            "answer_text": "In fact, there are different definitions of enlightenment that result from different forms of meditation and those definitions (like the effects of the different forms of meditation) can be exactly the opposite. For example, the definition of of the beginning stage of enlightenment in Transcendental Meditation is NOT that \u201cI\u201d goes away, but that I am becomes \u201cpure\u201d (after enlightenmetn, one doesn\u2019t call desires or thoughts in the brain \u201cmy thoughts\u201d or \u201cmy desires\u201d \u2014 they are simply mental activity that exists in the brain that happens to be observable directly) and that pure I am becomes permanent: present whether one is awake, dreaming or in deep sleep: A list of many of the studies that have been done on the topics of TM, samadhi/pure consciousness and enlightenment can be found here. . As part of the studies on enlightenment via TM, researchers found 17 subjects (average meditation, etc experience 16,000 hours) who were reporting at least having a pure sense-of-self continuously for at least a year, and asked them to \"describe yourself\" (see table 3 of psychological correlates study), and these were some of the responses: We ordinarily think my self as this age; this color of hair; these hobbies . . . my experience is that my Self is a lot larger than that. It's immeasurably vast. . . on a physical level. It is not just restricted to this physical environmentIt's the \u2018\u2018I am-ness.\u2019\u2019 It's my Being. There's just a channel underneath that's just underlying everything. It's my essence there and it just doesn't stop where I stop. . . by \u2018\u2018I,\u2019\u2019 I mean this 5 ft. 2 person that moves around here and thereI look out and see this beautiful divine Intelligence. . . you could say in the sky, in the tree, but really being expressed through these things. . . and these are my SelfI experience myself as being without edges or content. . . beyond the universe. . . all-pervading, and being absolutely thrilled, absolutely delighted with every motion that my body makes. With everything that my eyes see, my ears hear, my nose smells. There's a delight in the sense that I am able to penetrate that. My consciousness, my intelligence pervades everything I see, feel and thinkWhen I say \u2019\u2019I\u2019\u2019 that's the Self. There's a quality that is so pervasive about the Self that I'm quite sure that the \u2018\u2018I\u2019\u2019 is the same \u2018\u2018I\u2019\u2019 as everyone else's \u2018\u2018I.\u2019\u2019 Not in terms of what follows right after. I am tall, I am short, I am fat, I am this, I am that. But the \u2018\u2018I\u2019\u2019 part. The \u2018\u2018I am\u2019\u2019 part is the same \u2018\u2018I am\u2019\u2019 for you and meSo, for TM-style enlightenment, your question not only doesn\u2019t make sense, but is exactly the opposite of what long-term TM does. One man\u2019s enlightenment is another man\u2019s ultimate delusion. It is up to you to decide which meditation tradition and so which enlightenment outcome is better for you. ",

            "answer_text": "The \u201cI\u201d continues to exist post-enlightenment. However, the perspective shifts such that a so-called enlightened being no longer identifies with the \u201cI\u201d perspective of the mind-body and identifies instead with a larger interconnected awareness or Self. The \u201cI\u201d is mind-generated and, in a sense, a virtual perspective of reality based upon sensory inputs and composite mental interpretations of one\u2019s environment. It never actually existed except within the confines of an individual\u2019s abstractions of events perceived and conceptualized by the mind-body complex. While enlightenment is described somewhat differently within various doctrines, it is essentially a deeply more subtle perspective of a more universal and direct awareness. It exists outside the confines of (though includes) thought, language and a perspective of a self. In Buddhism, this is referred to as anatta (Pali) or anatman (Sanskrit) or \u201cno self\u201d. Thus, confusion arises because if there is no self how can there be an \u201cI\u201d? This gets explained very cleverly by pointing out that the \u201cI\u201d was only an illusion of duality and therefore never existed in the first place. However, that cleverness doesn\u2019t help if one is shopping for groceries, teaching children or running a company. Unless we choose to live out our existence isolated in a cave somewhere, we do live in duality - a consensual delusion. While we may realize that there is no objective physical reality beyond the interpretations of individual minds, the mind-body experience is the common human experience. Thus, we humans live in a synthetic reality whereby a discrete mind-body has learned to interact with other mind-bodies by agreement of defined concepts. One of those concepts is \u201cI\u201d and it is useful in navigating our co-created reality. In effect, the enlightened being recognizes and has access to both a provisional truth and an ultimate truth (two truths doctrine) and, with practice, can navigate freely within and between them. \u201cI\u201d is ultimately a useful instrument of language rather than an independent entity. /////  ",

            "answer_text": "Try writing & speaking about enlightenment, or any part of life, without using the term \u201cI,\u201d and see what happens! Good luck with that. As other answerers have noted, it depends on your definition of \u201cenlightenment,\u201d as well as who referring to when you say \u201cenlightened writers\u201d Many of the most widely-accepted as fully enlightened writers of the past century - Sri Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi, Sri Nisargadhatta, Papaji, Jean Klein, etc. - have copious books and \u201cwritings,\u201d but they did not actually write a word, and had no intention of putting out a book or claiming themselves as enlightened writers. Those books and writings are simply transcriptions of talks they gave, collected & published by one or more of their devoted followers. Nisargadhatta\u2018s \u201cI Am That,\u201d widely recognized as one of the greatest \u201cbooks\u201d about enlightenment, was simply a collection of the salient points he discussed in decades of giving humble Satsangs in his humble Bombay loft. And were you to read all 5 of the above, you would notice they almost never refer to themselves as \u201cI.\u201d Indeed they don\u2019t talk much about themselves at all, but rather, just point to the awakening process. Similarly, when counseling others, I almost exclusively speak of the unfolding of awakening and the nameless Consciousness that is everything. I rarely bring up my own \u201cpersonal story;\u201d it\u2019s about our story. Accordingly, I\u2019ve gone out of my way to avoid the \u201cI\u201d term when talking about \u201cenlightenment,\u201d even when using my own unfolding to lend clarity to part of the \u201cpath.\u201d I say, this took place in \u201cthis location\u201d or \u201cthrough this vessel\u201d or this \u201cseemingly-separate body-mind.\u201d But that can also sound hokey and \u201cnew-agey\u201d As long as we are playing out this temporary, illusory role of \u201cseparate\u201d humans, living out this allotted time Consciousness manifested to express & experience something through these individual vessels, we are, and must speak as, both Pure Consciousness and a separate \u201cI\u201d at the same time. Even after realizing there is only One and becoming that One, when choosing to say \u201cI am All of Conscioussness\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m just me,\u201d there\u2019s nothing wrong with humbly choosing the latter.

            "answer_text": "Because language was not created by the enlightened people. It was created by us. And they couldn\u2019t create it even if they wanted to, because enlightenment happens in deep utter silence. It cannot be put into words. Still, words must be used. So when enlightened people speak, they use our language. But we must remember that the words are not adequate to the experience. \u201cI\u201d is a pronoun. When an ordinary person uses the word \u201cI\u201d he is referring to a sense of self he feels actually exists within him. A self which is the doer of things, the thinker of thoughts, the chooser of this and that, the seer, the hearer, a subjective sense of self.  When an enlightened person uses the word \u201cI\u201d he is referring to name and form and the stream of consciousness which the name and form are imputed on. He does so out of convenience because it sounds awkward and pretensious to not speak natural. There is no need to talk funny. An enlightened person still has a body, still has a mind, thoughts, etc. It is natural to use the word \u201cI\u201d when referring to these. It doesn\u2019t mean that he feels there is an eternal ghost in the machine who controls all this. ",

I challenge anyone to go without using the word \u201cI.\u201d Even if you\u2019re talking about humanity in general, you\u2019re often talking about yourself in relation to other humans. I don\u2019t even want to try to communicate with anyone who never says \u201cI.\u201d No matter how immersed in the spiritual you are, you\u2019re always going to be talking about how certain things made you feel.
