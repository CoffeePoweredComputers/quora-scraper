            "answer_text": "What are some examples of personal beliefs? I personally believe that there are intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe. They\u2019re just so far away we\u2019ll never meet. I believe that all people are basically the same. They want a good life, some relaxation, good job, happy family that they can care for and get care from, a secure life. I believe that every body is unique. They each have their own desires and goals, feelings and hopes, and fears. And how they react to those fears are also unique. I believe that given half a chance the people of the world could make this a very nice place. I also believe that people who do violence have far more power, individually, to screw up that goal. I believe Trump is one of the people who screw up that goal. I believe in a loving God who cares about individuals - all of them as he created all of them, even the bad ones, and the ones I don\u2019t like. Who cares about them so much, that He allows them free will to really, really screw up. I believe that the USA is a good country. I believe it could be a much, much better country, and to get there doesn\u2019t involve reducing the taxes on the rich. I believe we\u2019re all in this together, and the best way to raise everyone is to lift the lowest. Life isn\u2019t a zero sum game. Some things, the more you give, the more there is, like love and prosperity. I believe that I will either be on the bridge looking out at the big ships sailing into New York harbor to celebrate the Tricentenial of the Declaration of Independence in 2076. Either that, or (if I\u2019m lucky) _being on_ one of those ships. I\u2019ll be 117 at the time. And if I can reach 117, I\u2019ll hang on a few more years to watch the 2099 eclipse of the sun in Minnesota. Thanks for asking! ",

            "answer_text": "I wrote this somewhere else\u2026 \u201cThe adverage human brain has over 80 billion neurons. That's more than all the stars in our known galaxy. I believe in conciousness, time, love, self evolution and life itself.We spend far too much time obsessing over mortality, that we forget about actually living\u2026and consistently miss all the little things that give us meaning. My parents were very religious, but never pushed it on me. They were very supportive of anything I took on, and never invalidated my objectivity. I despise most organized religions. But understand the history and respect others values towards what they believe in. I think governing bodys/religious leaders have used & continue to exploit religion as tool to influence their own agendas. How else do you get people to inflict death, with the possibility of being killed themselves? With inspired passon and a sense of being a part of something larger. Is there life beyond our own state of consciousness? It\u2019s the enternal question you will only find out when you eventually die.I believe in the universe itself. That everything is finite, and time itself is what makes things relevant. Life isn't just about survival for us. It's about living in the moment. In summary\u2026People spend far too much of their limited time, worrying about their idealisms and things that at the end of the day\u2026don't really matter. The day we really will evolve, is when we become creators ourselves. The only way we will discover other parts the universe, and escape our perfect prison\u2026is to create something infinite. A concious being, capable of love and compassion. Without empathy, it would have no meaning. The human brain & body are just vessels for our own conciousness. I choose to believe in the universe and myself. I choose to embrace and be grateful for what I have, without all the politics inbetween. I choose to live the moment\u2026not the big question, why? As the only sentient beings on this planet. We are it's protector and guardians for every other living species. So, when we will start actually doing this? Hopefully soon. For our children's children. For they are how we live on. Well\u2026in their lifes, anyway. Live now. Embrace life. Small things do matter. The ability to love is lifes greatest gift. Everything is finite, but the universe waistes nothing.\u201d ",
