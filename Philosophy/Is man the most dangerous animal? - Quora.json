            "answer_text": "The man can run at over 150 kilometers per hour, has the strength to lift 40 tons with a single hand, has retractable 1 inch fangs and 5 inch claws, and can open his jaws at 170 degrees and bite with a force of OVER 9,000! tons psi. They are also smart enough to compose nuclear reactors out of raw materials, like mud or wood. They are more durable than titanium steel alloy, and if you do manage to harm one, their blood is extremely corrosive. More so than hydrochloric acid. Of course, bone of that is true. . I am one person who despises how most people overestimate some human qualities, and underestimate others. Underestimate, physical prowess. Humans actually do have plenty of power. Most of it is inhibited by fear, though. . Overestimated, intelligence. People say humans are the most dangerous animal because of our intelligence as if we could build war tanks and AK-47 in the middle of the jungle. When actually, probably less than 1% of all the people on Earth could build an AK-47 at all from scrap metal. And it would take a long time. We built this relatively safe world, and gave ourselves power, but it took a very long time, and that power, apart of being actually very limited, more than people realize, is not part of us, and is not always accessible. . But, intelligence does count for something. First of all, many animals use tools, but no other animal uses weapons. Not even the smartest animals after us\u2026 well, actually, they do. But they only throw things. Which we also do. But we also use hand held weapons. For a human, it doesn\u2019t take much intelligence to grab a stick and hit someone or something with it. Literally even little kids know that. And adults should know to make spears at the very least. And we are much better learners than other animals. Aside of that, we do have some intelligence that works well for many animals, such as staying together, and strategizing. . So, I wouldn\u2019t say humans are the most dangerous animal. Just not all that insignificant. ",

            "answer_text": "Homo sapiens does not superficially fit the bill for the world\u2019s most dangerous animal, but appearances are very deceptive. He is a medium sized mammal that has lost most of its body hair, as well as his strength. There is no other animal that is as weak pound for pound. He lacks built-in weapons, like fangs, talons, claws, horns, and tusks. He is very slow, does not climb or swim very well, and cannot fly. The way he compensates for this makes all those other weapons puny by comparison. Homo sapiens has hands with opposable thumbs, and an advanced brain to use them for the creation of deadly tools One of the most primitive of these, the spear, made him the master of far bigger and stronger animals. The species used them to exterminate most of the mega fauna worldwide. It also invented machines that can fly faster and farther than any bird, bat, or insect. This most advanced hominid has more than doubled its natural lifespan through medical technology. This allows it to proliferate to the point of expanding into all habitats all over the globe. The process is destroying the homes of thousands of species of plants and animals, threatening them with a rate of extinction not seen since the dinosaurs and all other major species were wiped out 65 million years ago. Home Sapiens has the technology to make the planet uninhabitable for most current major forms of life. He has the intellect to understand this, and to do something to prevent it, but its advanced cerebral cortex has remained a slave to the more primitive amygdala. Consequently, his reason is always overruled by his emotions, driving him to make very bad decisions, pursuing short term mirages over more sustainable long-term ones. Collectively he behaves exactly like a the mindless invasive species he is. The creature is so dangerous, he is on the verge of exterminating even himself a very short geological amount of time after he first appeared on the African Savannah. ",
