            "answer_text": "Others\u2019 thinking about the self is important to understand the concept of self. But that knowledge stops a the conceptual level as some sterile knowledge that you may use for a time for various purposes before forgetting it. It is more important to abandon all hearsay concepts and look at that which wants to understand concepts- know yourself, not as an abstract concept but as that which is truly you. This contemplation of your own being/the self is a mind activity only to a point after which the mind needs to be transcended and the self will reveal itself as consciousness. Any and all philosophical views about the concept of the self are irrelevant in this contemplation of what you are. ",
