            "answer_text": "Chaitin's constant is uncomputable and normal. Normality follows from its uncompressibility or \u201calgorithmic randomness.\u201d The shortest program to print NN bits of Chaitin\u2019s constant (not the whole thing, that would be impossible) is itself N\u2212O(1)N\u2212O(1) bits. If the number were not normal, we could use Huffman encoding to do better than this bound by representing more common bit-sequences with shorter strings of bits. ",
