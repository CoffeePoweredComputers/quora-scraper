            "answer_text": "Both Kant and Rawls emphasize the ethical importance of not privileging oneself. This similarity comes through in the best-known features of their ethical philosophies. If people know one thing about Kant\u2019s ethics, it is his categorical imperative. Universality and the equal ethical significance of each and every person lie at the heart of the categorical imperative. Act according to a maxim that you could will would be recognized as a universal law. Treat others always as ends in themselves and not merely as means to your ends. You are not morally special. The core of morality is to recognize this. If people know one thing about Rawls\u2019s normative philosophy it is the veil of ignorance. Deciding upon just principles to govern society depends upon a thought experiment requiring people to forget things that are particular to their own situation. The whole point of the exercise is to make it impossible to privilege your own position. The core of his political philosophy is the reciprocity that comes from recognizing that all other citizens matter as much as you do. That said, there are major differences between the two. One is that Kant constructed an intricate and far-reaching philosophical framework addressing the most fundamental questions, while Rawls wanted a political theory that would not depend on one\u2019s views on such questions.
