            "answer_text": "In material aspects, it is not vital. In soul's aspect it is vital. You can probably make enough money on one day to feed yourself for one week even one month if you can spend your money really wisely. The most important things are for free or really cheap or their price cannot be measured in money. Your soul is that part what needs the work. And I don't mean a job by that but I mean creating value to others. You need to create value to others to be happy being yourself. Having a job makes it a lor harder and being self-employed or a company-owner entreprenur makes it easier. The more freedom you have the more opportunity and the more rensponsibility you have. So work is vital for your soul and everything comes from your soul. So work and not in an office and not in a 9\u20135 job but really create value to others. You will be happy for yourself and also God will help you in your ways. Have a good day! ",
