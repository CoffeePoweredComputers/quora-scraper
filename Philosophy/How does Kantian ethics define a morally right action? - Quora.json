            "answer_text": "Kant\u2019s ethics are formulated on the universality of an action, specifically in its compatibility with a stable society. \u201c\"Act only on that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.\u201d Is lying wrong? \u201c\u2026[i]f I wanted to lie to get something I wanted, I would have to be willing to make it the case that everyone always lied to get what they wanted - but if this were to happen no one would ever believe you, so the lie would not work and you would not get what you wanted. Thus, it is impermissible to lie, according to the categorical imperative. It is impermissible because the only way to lie is to make an exception for yourself.\u201d Credit to KANTIAN ETHICS The last sentence sums it up very well. Something is morally right if everybody can rationally perform that action, instead of placing themselves as an exception. There are a few problems with this definition. Kant believed homosexuality to be immoral, as if everybody only had homosexual intercourse then nobody would procreate, and there would be nobody left to have intercourse with. Additionally, in our society we often make an exception for the police - they can kick down your door if they have a paper that says they can, but I can\u2019t. ",
