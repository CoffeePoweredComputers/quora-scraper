            "answer_text": "I understand religious nominalism to mean people who identify with a religion (and maybe take part in religious community events such as churchgoing) without actually following the teachings of that religion (in the case of Christianity, I suppose that would be to not love everyone and not actively help the poor). At the core of the Buddhist philosophy of life is the necessity of reducing suffering/unsatisfactoriness by acting ethically and actively pursuing insight. So clearly by not acting ethically, and by not actively pursing insight by questioning, nominal Christians are in conflict with the Buddhist way. Indeed, religious nominalism is quite explicitly warned against in a Buddhist scripture called the Kalama Sutta, which teaches that we must not accept religious teachings just because of repeated hearing (eg at church), or purely because they are in a scripture (the Bible isn\u2019t right just because it\u2019s old), or simply because we have adopted a particular religious teacher (preacher/pastor/sect of Christianity). The Buddha instructed that we should listen to the wise, but question everything and judge it using our own reasoning. Nominal Christians, I think it\u2019s obvious, are characterised by not questioning anything: neither the teachings of their sect, nor the ethics of their own situation and behaviour. Personally I\u2019d go further and suggest that Christianity, with its emphasis on obedience to a patriarchal god, is inherently in opposition to the Buddha\u2019s teaching of taking responsibility for ourselves. However, there are also branches of Buddhism which emphasise obedience to one\u2019s teacher and to the literal sayings of the Buddhas so obviously this is just my perspective. ",
