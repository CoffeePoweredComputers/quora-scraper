            "answer_text": "Sometimes people use being \u201chonest\u201d as an excuse for saying hurtful things. People tend to confuse being rude and being honest. For example\u2026\u201dyou got so fat!\u201d Well, he DID get fat\u2026you were just \u201cbeing honest.\u201d Or, say a friend causes a major catastrophe at work. She asks, \u201cdid I cause the downfall of the company?\u201d You could be honest, she did ask for your opinion, after all, although she might not like the answer. However, if you walked up to her saying, \u201cwhat\u2019d you do? You singlehandedly caused the downfall of the company!\u201d You were still being honest, but she did not ask for your opinion! If you don\u2019t want people to be mad at you, then tell them what they want to hear. If you want to be a true friend, tell them the truth, but ONLY if they asked. ",

            "answer_text": "Well you have to keep in mind is your truth their truth, depending on the topic there are many differing truths to a subject. For example if a christian told a hindu he as going to hell and he\u2019s an idiot then that would be the christians truth but not the hindu\u2019s and the hindu would be mad and rightfully so. I know this is specific but judging from the way your questions is phrased it makes you seem like a pompous ass only willing to accept his view and not any other, and in my experience this is a quality of religion so sorry if this doesn\u2019t match what you were looking for but this is what I have.
