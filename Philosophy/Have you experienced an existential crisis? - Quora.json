            "answer_text": "Unfortunately I can\u2019t remember the date. It was a Sunday afternoon in 2014. To call this a \u201ccrisis\u201d might be a bit overdramatic. It was more like a moment of clarity at the end of a long search \u2014 a moment that could have gone very badly. I\u2019m 60 years old now. When I was 15, I started trying to understand the answer to \u201cwho am I?\u201d \u2014 the basic existential question, right? So I spent over 40 years working that question, trying out many different disciplines and perspectives and studying what I could find on the topic (which is a lot: the world is full of viewpoints about this!) What I wanted was an absolute truth that I could trust: some moment where I would see myself in some sort of mirror that could not be denied or questioned. So I spent my life looking for that kind of mirror, really. That\u2019s one way to frame the story, anyway. (I also lived of course \u2014 married several times, kids, a career\u2026 this search wasn\u2019t in an ivory tower.) Then this Sunday afternoon came along, and I realized that the only way that I would ever have an absolute truth about my own being would be if I created that truth myself. My absolute commitment to the grounding and upholding of that truth is what would make it absolute, and nothing else could do that for me. I saw that the notion that this truth could be pre-existing so that it could be \u201cdiscovered\u201d was wrong, and I finally understood why it was wrong and what one could do about that. In the short space of a few days, a whole ton of questions got resolved for me: questions about values and meaning, questions about motivation and generosity and courage and vision and possibility. My whole perspective about myself and life underwent a transformation in the wake of this Sunday afternoon. Why did I say that this was a \u201ccrisis\u201d? Because I think that the genesis of this realization was a kind of \u201ccoming to the end of the road\u201d in terms of trying to locate that absolute truth by searching. Having searched everywhere and not found it, it would have been very easy to give up and collapse in frustration and despair. I think if you do that, then you maybe don\u2019t notice the little gray door by the side of the road which has no flashing neon lights or reassuring label that makes claims of wisdom. If you just give up and collapse into despair and nihilism, then you don\u2019t see that this uninteresting door leads to the solution: a human has the power to create the truth of their own authenticity, and that is what solves the puzzle \u2014 nothing else. The search for true self is just what you do because you don\u2019t understand. When one gives up on the search because it\u2019s not working, that\u2019s a dangerous moment I think \u2014 it\u2019s very easy to miss the recognition that \u201cI can be my own ground of being.\u201d That\u2019s where nihilists come from, I think. A crisis like that, if you don\u2019t resolve it correctly, is a real problem. ",

Since every person is unique, each person needs to develop hiser unique life. That should be based on what is real, valid, no matter the time, place, circumstances. Once you are so founded, you can develop methods, explanations, perception suitable to your uniqueness, and compatible with the rest of the universe. Use the memories of what you thought-did, and what the results were. What do you want in life? If you want to succeed, as you define it, and create a great life, use this. Since every person is unique, each person needs to develop hiser unique life. That should be based on what is real, valid, no matter the time, place, circumstances. Once you are so founded, you can develop methods, explanations, perception suitable to your uniqueness, and compatible with the rest of the universe. This works for me. The more I have used it, the less frustrated I have become, and the more rewarding life has become. My ability to learn has also increased. Do all the standard information, and control techniques because they work for surface problems, and are often required for normal work-life functions.. Then, supercharge you achievements. Get rid of the anxieties, obstacles hidden in old memories, and twisting your perspective. Combine what everybody already knows in bits, and pieces into your most powerful tool. Affirm the essential relationships of life, and get underneath the limitations. Then dissolve them. Sounds great, right? How can you do that? Many people worked it on for a long time. Even though there were many avenues, and turns, the desire for a clear, commonly usable formulation persisted. One group got there. They used the knowledge extracted from vast experience, and deducted the limited, local, specific factors, and reduced it to six words. Nam Myoho Renge Kyo is the empirical cognitive science that has resulted from those efforts. It is utterly practical, realistic, and its use can help anyone who wants it, open the focus of the moment, or the entirety of the cosmos. The language is Japanese because that\u2019s where the discoverer of the formula lived. Nam is the focus on what is. It also expresses the intention of equality. It is a verb. Myo is the unlimited we are all a part of. Ho is the specific. They are not separable. Renge is the aspect of causes, and effects. Those effects are local, specific, or mental, and reverberate forever. Kyo is the change, and persistence, we observe all around, and in our daily events. Since these are all true, simultaneously, inseparably, they must be taken as a package Infusing those realities into our lives by chanting the sentence engages the mind, hearing, voice, intention. It is a regular activity like breathing, eating, having a heartbeat. The infusing happens when you say the words, by yourself, and sometimes with others. It engages neuroplasticity to connect your mind-heart in success patterns. One shot is not enough because we humans are addicted to habits. I have always broken through my obstacles when I did this. Happiness was a faint hope, even when I had success, and money. It also works for millions of others around the globe.

            "answer_text": "What is an example of an existential crisis? Anytime anyone questions their reality, what they see happening does not align with what they thought could happen in the world, that is the trigger of an Existential Crisis. An Existential Crisis causes an emotional shock to occur because the person realizes what they thought was \u201cfirm ground to base their world view\u201d is in fact unstable and disappearing at that moment right before their eyes as they examine the situation, realizing what they thought to be true is not true at all. This is the nature of an Existential Crisis. Examples include: Devout Christian family breaks up when Dad announces he\u2019s gay and moves in with his new lover. Wife and teenage kids all experience Existential Crisis, because from their world view Dad is abandoning the family, the church, and is willingly going to hell;Serious student with straight A\u2019s simply cannot get an A in the class their future college career depends, throwing their imagined future life into question;Socially popular teen begins to see the toxic treatment of their set towards others, calling out their peers\u2019 behavior, they are cast out of their popular set and now face other social sets poised to reject them for past bad behaviors;What to do about an Existential Crisis? Recognize them as an unbalanced emotional reaction to a self deception being revealed. It is a self deception because it is the individual\u2019s responsibility to tell themselves the truth, even when painful. Any pain associated with the emotional shock accompanying this Existential Crisis serves to cement the memory as a mental milestone to remember the pain and the lesson that this specific instance of self deception caused this specific problem. As duel recognition of being in an Existential Crisis and recognition of the lesson being learned commits to memory, temper oneself to not over react. At that point in time step outside yourself and take some analytical notes. This serves to release an amount of the emotional energy and to re-center your awareness away from the immediate moment to a more timeless perspective, a perspective where you\u2019ll have more control over your emotions, granting a clearer perspective of the situation and how to move forward.

I really am as stupid and insignificant as I have been told\u201d. I\u2019ve had quite a few life threatening situations occur, whilst going through alchohol and drug fuelled moments of existentialism. But I always survived in the most bizzare ways. I\u2019m not cut out, to be cut out by my own crisis-ies apparently. I decided very early on in my life, that \u201cplodding on\u201d, eternally plodding on, was the only way to get to wherever it is that I am supposed to be going. I became a survivor, just because I am bloody minded. This does not mean that I am not still, occasionally dragged down by a new existential crisis. I haven\u2019t had a good one for over a year now, which means progress, methinks. There are bound to be others in the pipeline, waiting for the unwary me, just when I think that I\u2019m going okay, bang! I\u2019ll be brought down so low that I can see up skirts. I\u2019ll feel dirty and useless, a waste of time, a wastrel. I\u2019ll lumber along in a haze of self loathing until I get so depressed that I will remember my mantra. It could always be worse, you asshole. And I\u2019ll get up, and start pushing that rock up the hill again. Sisyphus and me have a lot in common, a lot more than I care to relate here.

            "answer_text": "All identity is someone clinging to a fixed or reinforced idea of themselves like armor. From this, we derive a sense of existence and context by assuming a false idea to be truth, and maintain it by reinforcing the places where it fails us through various denials and projections. ALL identity is constructed this way. When one\u2019s armor breaks entirely, or substantial parts of it break, and more information, understanding and reality come through that don\u2019t meet with those idealisms and other plates of armor; then you\u2019ll likely have such a crisis. Indeed, such crises are endemic in Western society, simply because we refuse to teach anyone about themselves. We devalue it, and allow them to flee from crisis to crisis (or maintain the false armor we have given to them regarding materialism, consumerism, belief in media, the rightness of white people, etc.) that they often have a crisis without any way to really grow from it, or their crises are so trivial that despite their life change they really only re-invest back in the same system that created the problem they are experiencing now. It wasn\u2019t always this way, and there are few teachers or mentors left. Everyone who was one before is assumed to be a pedophile or other deviant, so\u2026 let\u2019s be scared of the solution, too\u2026 right? Oh, well, and anyone who asks us to be volunteering for difficulties is now an enemy as well, so even the crises that allow us to mature and shed our old skin have ALSO been disallowed at this point. You ARE allowed to do sports, so there is that. Video games and sports. Decent distractions, right? Just don\u2019t try to grow TOO much from your participation in them, as you might discover more to yourself than society wants to allow\u2026 so be careful. Western society is constructed from absolute ignorance of ourselves and so existential crises will ALWAYS happen here. Everything that would create these crises is both produced at every turn, but also denied. It is also denied that they are valid, needed or useful in any way. The construction of an identity centred on the specific identity that society wants from you (consumerist, paranoid, fearful, productive: aka enslaved) is what is allowed. ONLY that. If you\u2019re brown, white, whatever. Colors don\u2019t matter. Class doesn\u2019t matter. EVERYONE is a slave now. Trapped in the identity they call themselves. Don\u2019t fall for any of this. You can still be free. The tools are all in your mind, or in the minds of people you can learn from, which still exist, like Neo in the Matrix. We still exist. Come find us. ",

I was super into this \u2018Children\u2019s Encyclopedia\u2019 book which was basically a very, very abridged history of the human race. It detailed the rise of the Egyptians, the Romans, the Greeks, and more. Now, at some point while I was going through the book, I remember thinking, \u2018What had happened to all these people I\u2019m reading about? What happened to Columbus? What happened to Newton? What happened to everybody?\u2019. I put down the book and thought for a bit about this enigma. And I just began to. Bawl. My. Eyes. Out. My mother picked me up and tried to comfort me, but I was inconsolable. I could only manage to blubber out a \u2018and, and, and I\u2019M gonna disappear, and YOU\u2019RE gonna disappear, and PAPA\u2019S gonna disappear\u2019 to her before I was too far gone in my horror to even talk. At some point, I managed to stop crying, but a deep cynicism towards life was installed in me for a few days. I felt sullen and angry that I wasted any time on playing, or studying, or eating. Luckily, my memory was pretty shabby and I soon forgot all about my revelation. I promptly went back to annoying everybody around me with my squeals and enjoying foods far too fattening for a child.

If you can get past the \u201cfear\u201d and the illusion of choice, you will have no existential crisis. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune and carry on with your life (existence). However humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.  ",

            "answer_text": "I believe an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d is fundamentally a point in your life where you have to decide \u2026 Is there a God who created me for some purpose or not\u2026 simple. If there is a God\u2026 now the question is how does God communicate that purpose to me? If I come up with a no-God belief I must \u201cboldly create my own purpose\u201d. Kierkegaard was a Christian and defined his existentialism within the paradigm of the Christian faith. So, his crisis came about from the dead faith of \u201cnominalism\u201d . He saw that Danish Lutheranism was just going through the motions. It lacked the vibrancy and life of an \u201cexistential faith\u201d. He saw that he had to break free of his nominalism rooted in rationalism and take a \u201cleap of faith\u201d in the personally subjective. He really discovered the necessity of subjective faith or existential faith. One discovers in this crisis the need to break free from \u201cthe Formal Faith\u201d into \u201ca personal faith\u201d\u2026 \u201cmy personal relationship with God\u201d. Kierkegaard really is the forerunner of the modern day distinction between Christian \u201creligion\u201d and \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d regarding faith in God. In modern evangelicalism \u201creligion\u201d is a dirty word because it is seen to lack the \u201cexistential\u201d aspect of \u201cpersonal relationship\u201d. Shift: I shift now to the existential atheism of Nietzsche, Satre and Camus - to name the biggies. Simply, if you don\u2019t turn to a personal relationship (existential) with God, then you are on your own buddy! For some, this is a great relief and freedom from a common paradigmatic negative view of God. This is the view that God is 1) dictatorial, judgmental and punishing . Christianity in turn is man-made and an attempt of the religious to control the non-religious. You want to be free from something like that don\u2019t you? \u2026 if it in deed is true! If the result of existential atheism is nihilism\u2026 true nihilism you will be stuck in the insanity of meaninglessness - constantly searching and jumping from one insight to the next, one \u201ca-ha\u201d season to the next. It gets old. You get no where because there is no where ultimately to go. However a happy existentialist is not a true nihilist at all. In fact they are really not an existentialist at all! A relatively happy existentialist is one who has really locked into a religion of some sort \u2026 a religious philosophy of life. The happy existentialist must lock into some kind of social fellowship\u2026 be a part of a body of like-minded believers\u2026 in something and something established and formal. Even a society of \u201cexistentialists\u201d. Bottom line: The happy ending of an existential crisis is finding one\u2019s part in an established whole\u2026 a human whole with friendship and fellowship. Adding my final bias\u2026 Jesus Christ is the penultimate existence\u2026 the Gospel \u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing was made that has been made. In Him was life, and that life was the light of men. The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. \u201c John 1:1\u20135 \u201cGod intended that they would seek Him and perhaps reach out for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us. \u2018For in Him we live and move and have our being.\u2019\u201d Acts 17:27\u201328 ",

A laminated napkin is something that\u2019s basically lost all its purpose, it\u2019s become perfect and cannot be ruined but it\u2019s lost it\u2019s purpose. I hit a blunt so to speak. My mind ran in circles and desperate to share I told mum sister, she was 6 and didn\u2019t get it. I told mum, she laughed it off. I told some friends, they said wow. But it kept on running round in my mind. Napkin, purpose, laminated, purpose gone. But it\u2019s purpose was so trivial maybe the trade off was good, but whaaattt?? After all this crisissing I hit something else, what\u2019s my purpose, how would I lose my purpose, is perfection the loss of purpose?preservation or purpose, preservation or purpose, preservation or purpose, is preservation not the purpose? Is purpose preservation? Is this what it means to decay? To be redundant? I am still perhaps in that perpetual crisis for I haven\u2019t figured out the answer. ",

            "answer_text": "One in which someone does not know where they came from, why they are here, and where they are going when they die. God, in the Holy Scriptures, gives us definitive answers beginning in the book of Genesis and throughout the Bible concerning these questions. Holy Scripture [Excerpt] God has carefully and individually made YOU, \u201cfearfully and wonderfully.\u201d (Psalm 139:14) So if He thought of us and created each of us so intentionally, we need to understand His purpose for the lives He has given us. God has an incredibly valuable task for you. You, in the situations of your life that He created uniquely for you, should carry out His will on earth, as it is done in heaven. God has prepared specific works for each of us to walk in. (Ephesians 2:10; Philippians 2:12-14) Perhaps one of the most beautiful and life-affirming passages in the Bible are the words of David in Psalm 139. \u201cMy frame was not hidden from you, when I was made in secret, and skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And in Your book they all are written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them.\u201d Psalm 139:15-16. Jesus was with the Father as a master craftsman when He marked out the foundations of the earth. He rejoiced in all His inhabited world, but His delight was with the sons of men. (Proverbs 8:22-31) So when the time was right, Jesus took upon Himself the body of a man, born of Mary, as the Son of Man (God in the flesh). PHILLIPPIANS 2:5 \"In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: 6 Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; 7 rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. 8 And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death\u2014 even death on a cross! 9 Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,11 and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord,to the glory of God the Father.\" In that body, all the will of God would be done for Jesus to be our perfect substitute. God sends His Holy Spirit into our hearts through the Gospel message of sins forgiven completed by the vicarious work of Jesus Christ to show how good and acceptable and perfect His will is, so that in the ages to come, it is incontestable and the standard for God's judgement for all people when He returns to judge all mankind. The Holy Spirit comes to us to guide us in the steps of the Master, so that we do not have to be slaves to sin. (Romans 12:1-2; Acts 1:1-4; 2 Peter 1:2-4) God, the Father of spirits (Hebrews 12:9), who knew us before the foundation of the world, gave us a body. His purpose is that we should follow in Jesus\u2019 footsteps so that God\u2019s will be done on earth as it is in heaven. \u201cAlways carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus. Christ died on the cross of Calvary as payment for the penalty of sin that we had coming but He also led a perfect life in our behalf, never sinning, which task He fulfilled while He lived on earth as a human being. (2 Timothy 2:11; 2 Corinthians 4:10; Philippians 3:10; Romans 8:3) Sin is anything that goes against God\u2019s will and His laws. To commit sin is to transgress or disobey these laws. The lust to sin dwells in human nature. In other words, it is contaminated and motivated by the sinful tendencies that dwell in all people as a result of the fall into sin and disobedience in the garden of Eden. In these bodies, we also have a sinful human nature, which has a will of its own that is in conflict with the will of God. So our spirit has to fight. Almost all talk of battles and wars when concerning a Christian life refers to the inner battle that arises when a sinful thought tempts you. God\u2019s Spirit, living in the hearts of believers, and the flesh are at odds. See James 1:14. Also called \u201csin in the flesh.\u201d Things that go on around us have an effect on us, and we are tempted. Thoughts that are not from God, and that would draw us away from our connection with Him try to enter in. (James 1:14-15). As sinners, we often fail but believers are \"forgiven sinners\" because Jesus carried the punishment for all mankind's sins. There is no time to mess around, wasting our time in doing our own will. We are here to do God\u2019s will, and to do that we need to be extremely humble, acknowledge our weaknesses as human beings, and go to the throne of grace with repentant hearts seeking HIs forgiveness, which He richly provides. HEBREWS 4:18 \u201cLet us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\u201d Because Jesus was tempted, yet did not sin, it is possible for us to come to Him with boldness to receive forgiveness and grace, and the Spirit's power where we get the help we need to overcome sin, as God intended and promised. \u201cAnd we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.\u201d (Romans 8:28) We were foreknown and predestined to be conformed to the image of Jesus. (Romans 8:29-30) God\u2019s desire for us is that we gain divine nature, which is eternal life. [Excerpt] The body of Christ is made up of all of those who have been blessed by the Holy Spirit. They work in the ministry that He has appointed them, which differs from person to person, for the edification of themselves and others to bring all to unity. It is made up of all believers in Christ. Many people use the words \"Body of Christ\" or \"Christ's Church on Earth\" to describe a certain denomination or group or even the physical building that Christians gather in. The Bible makes it clear that the true church of Christ is made up of all those who trust in Jesus for the forgiveness of their sins and His resurrection that, one day, they too will experience. All of this is to God's glory both on earth and for all eternity. This is the very reason that He formed us so fearfully and wonderfully. ",

            "answer_text": "When we ignore the higher-level purpose of life, we see everything meaningless; that feeling increases anxiety and depression. Regardless of how successful we are with our personal objectives, we may not feel secured without addressing the high-level objective; the purpose of our existence. It is wrong to say \u2018let us enjoy the journey and forget about the destination\u2019 If you find yourself in a train, you should not enjoy the beautiful scenes before first ask: why am I here? Where is the destination? We should first ask \u2018what is the purpose of life?\u2019 What is the value of life if we do not know the purpose of that life? It is the greatest good for an individual to discuss virtue every day...for the un-examined life is not worth living \u2013 Socrates Our life on earth is a very short period compared to the universe time scale; It could be a temporary test period. God is testing us in our short life on earth; the wealthy father has the right to test his children before distributing the wealth. Testing missions are not supposed to be easy and comfortable. The test questions are not supposed to be known in advance. Our life on earth is a very short period compared to the universe time scale; It could be a temporary test period. There are hundreds of verses and teachings about that as mentioned in the following answer: Sabri Shahin's answer to How do we know our purpose of existence in this world? We have been asked to believe in God and Heaven but we have not seen God or heaven. Our fate will be determined based on that belief and on our good deeds. Why did God make it a difficult test for us? Although God knows what\u2019s in our hearts and what each of us might do, he tests us and wants us to witness our own test results in order to admit that we have been fairly rewarded according to our achievements as recorded in the test results Before the wealthy father distributes his wealth, he may want to record which son is obedient, the records are not for the father who knows, but as a testimony for people who might question the justice of their father Although the wise teacher knows the hard-working student and the lazy student, he prepares regular exams as testimonies so that the students would not say that the teacher had favored some students over the others. Exams also urge students to get prepared in order to succeed We have not created the gifts of sight, intelligence, conscience, and many other gifts. Those who can see the miracles in everything around them and in their own creation then deny the existence of God, those must be mistaken. There are many verses in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam to teach that God has created everything in heavens and earth. There are many other verses to teach that we are here for testing and there is an afterlife. Sabri Shahin's answer to What are God's greatest teachings? God has sent prophets to notify people that he has created and fine-tuned everything for them like the father who prepares good environment for his children to live. God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God has enabled people to choose their own destinations. God does not predetermine plans for us. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free. ",

The existential crisis is the dark void between the rupture of your previous paradigms and the generation of new insights into the value and meaning of your own life. Long held beliefs are psychologically painful to let go, which is what can cause the experience to be disconcerting. If you are in one, embrace it. It\u2019s an unpleasant period, but it can be one of the most transformative experiences in your life. We are not comfortable sitting in the dark, but if you persevere, and use this opportunity to rethink and process your emotions and thoughts you will find a better light. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm going through a very difficult one right now, I guess. Every morning I wake up, extremely tired after 7 hours of sleep, only to question my reasons to getting out of bed. At that moment, all my commitments seem valueless, non important. Day after day, I feel more bitter and lonely. Despite I am married, this loneliness grows disproportionately. And it is completely my fault, by the way. I find my job senseless and I began hating it. There is no purpose in it from the way I see it. A year ago, I moved to Spain and since that moment, I have made zero friends. No one to visit and chat during weekends. And while everything seems to be failing apart in my head, financial challenges spawn everywhere, jeopardizing our wellbeing. Now, this may be considered as an existencial crisis. I haven't been able of overcome it yet, so I cannot speak about a positive point of view. Nevertheless, I continue believing that everything is going to be better, that this isn't the rest of my life. I really hope so. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no one way to answer this because truth is relative. This means truth depends on the individual, if we define truth as \u201cthe way things really are.\u201d It seems not too many existentialists ask themselves whether the depression/anxiety comes first or second regarding existential crisis. Does temperament (nature), upbringing (\u201cgood enough\u201d parenting or nurture), avoiding trauma and other problems growing up, have anything to do with whether or not a person will have a \u201cneed\u201d to deal with an existential crisis? What are the factors? Why do some gravitate towards Freud (the animal instinct) or Jung (the symbolic person)? Why is meaninglessness a far bigger problem those struggling with a personality disorder? The existentialists are absolutely correct, as are the Buddhists. Life presents us all with inescapable forms of potentially acute suffering: growing old, getting sick, losing others, coping with isolation, meaninglessness, death and freedom. Being at peace with the human condition is highly recommended. Saying \u201cof course\u201d is a far better option than shelling out the money for more plastic surgery. But why does one person have \u201cattacks\u201d of death anxiety while another simply accepts death and doesn\u2019t have much fear of it at all? Does the latter have better defense mechanisms, therefore better able to repress/suppress death anxiety than the existential traveler? Nietzsche observed we become what we focus on (the abyss problem). Is the self-analysis and inner thinking involved in existentialism too much of a good thing? (e.g. eventually creates depression and meaninglessness etc.). Is there such as thing as Existentialist OCD? If so, which writers have it and which don\u2019t? How does PTSD fit into it all? People with this problem have acutely charged antennae which constantly scrutinize the environment for clues, signs and evidence of imminent danger, at the exclusion of the opposite. Sometimes people without PTSD have created a narrative script, an inner dialogue\u2014a perceptual map, which filters out all beauty and positivity in the world\u2019s page\u2019s landscape, instead only \u201cseeing\u201d the negative. Does having such a schema lead to depression/anxiety and the existential crisis? A child experiencing a horribly handled divorce can grow up with this \u201cvision\u201d in mind. How does narcissism play into nihilism and meaninglessness? A person with this problem sees others and self as black/white objects characterized by worthlessness and idealism. The endless seesaw this creates, and the emotional energy needed to prop up the perfect self-image, creates profound depressions and very often substance abuse. I would say, being a narcissist is hell, rather than generally \u201cother people\u201d are hell is much truer. One person\u2019s existential crisis is another\u2019s highly meaningful, philosophical discourse. And so we must first define Existential Crisis. And I\u2019m not sure I can do that. ",

CRISIS COMES TO THE NON BELIEVERS be like \u201c\"FKKER - You just told me that nothing matters (AND I BELIEVED) but when you told me that GOD is the LAST MAN STANDING, goddamn it i dont believe in this shit.

If you did how that experience made you feel? It made me feel horrified that one day I will occupy 2 meters of the ground and my body will be eaten by different small creatures. What I am telling you about is a fear of death that we as a humanity feel strongly. Despite all our efforts of trying to treat all diseases nobody found one treatment from death. This fear is called existential crisis and the longer you live the stronger it is no matter how hard you meditate. But the good news is that most of us are in denial and live their lives hoping that they will have a second one. This is our coping mechanism from something inevitable. ",

It seems humans have a brain fault that allows imagined fear to develop its not always conscious and symptoms are often not associated with anxiety so we just feel something is missing, its goodness/energy efficiency that gives the feeing of belonging and purpose without question. I do know the purpose of life now but knowing the purpose is no help, we must feel it and that only comes through a good meditative practice if we need it as most do. ",

            "answer_text": "Ok. I have written this myriad times in varioys ways in you tube comments under simulation theory videos yet here it goes\u2026 1) Notable cientists, such as Neil De Grasse Tyson and Elon Musk, have stated it is at least 50/50 that we live in a simulation. Just one point. 2) Look at our prevalence towards simple simulations. Verbal stories, written stories, radio stories, TV & movie stories, computer game and now VR stories. All simulations to one degree or another. First we used our imaginations and now you can participate in a simulation in a simple way. BtW Eventually one will not be able to distinguish between reality and a VR sim. Already research is being done to link the mind with computer hardware & software. Quality video and VR simulations are olik to distinguish already. Imagine entertainment 100\u2013300+ years in the future 3) Reincarnation. If you watch videos of legitimate interviews of young ,5+ ,children regarding their past lives you will be convinced, unless one is a diehard religious wacko, that reincarnation is real. People are rebooted/reincarnated. My dog & I were in bad car crash but, that is a whole other email and I doubt you would believe me even though there are hospital records and photos of my car to verify my claim. 4) Immortality. The bible talks of the immortal soul. People want to believe that we have one because no individual, including myself somewhat, wants to believe one is birthed\u2013lives(oft suffering a lot)\u2013dies and that is it. We have big egos. What if? If we are immortal think how boring it would be after several hundred years. Having done and seen everything. It could drive one mad. (I recommend the film He Never Died)The best solution for enduring immortality would be to enter a simulation in which you believe you are mortal so you experience the newness of life over & over again from many different vantage points. Perhaps to ultimately gain wisdom or some form of enlightenment. 5) It would explain the Mandela effect. Many people, including myself with some events from history, remember things differently. Some sensationalize the Mandella Effect to profit from it but, there are some valid discrepancies. I will give you one that I find quite unusual. There supposedly was an event called the Black Tom explosion on an island near NYC. Circa WWI (Look on you tube or Google it for specifics.) Neither I, nor my Stepdad, who grew up in New York, recall learning of this major historcial event. Many other learned folk with good memories do not recall it either. This could be the closest thing to evidence that we do indeed exist in a simulation. There are numerous Mandella Effects. I have other cogent theories but, I am considering writing a book on the topic so I will keep them to myself. It is not important to me that you believe me. You were in interested so\u2026 Simulation theory has as much proof of being real as the plethora of religions that people still use as a crutch or to excuse not critically thinking. Considering the average I.Q. of the world.populace it is not surprising that billions still believe in an invisible entity. Oh, there are some unexplainable observations in physics that may be proof but, I am not a scientist and can not speak on there validity. Enjoy your life/simulation and remember that this life, and past lives, influence your future lives. Karma perhaps. I am neither a Buddhist trying to validate his spiritual beliefs. Oh, split personalities and brain injuries that leave people with knowledge they never learned in their current life could also be signs of being rebooted over and over. And, don't get me started on dreams. Could be a scrambled version of all one's past simulations. Oh. And, stereotypes & stupid people could be A.I. non-people that don't exist except as societal filler within our simulation.
