            "answer_text": "Yes. Because paradox is really an artefact of language. The \u2018real world\u2019 doesn\u2019t use language, it is what it is, in whatever state it is, paradox is being in two states simultaneously, which cannot happen. Take the barber paradox. \u201cThe barber shaves everyone in the village, who shaves the barber?\u201d Well in reality that is pretty simple. 1/. The statement isn\u2019t true. 2/. The barber shaves himself. 3/. The barber isn\u2019t from the village at all, he just stops by on Thursdays to shave everyone in the village. What you see here is the failure of language to completely describe the real world situation. The simplest paradox doesn\u2019t even refer to the real world, its just a recursive construction in language: \u201cThis statement is false\u201d. Use of the term this makes it recursive. and a statement which denies its own validity is of course indeterminate in terms of truth value. As an engineer I use feedback a lot, and if you apply negative feedback to a boolean system such that its output tries to negate its input, one of two things will happen: it will stick halfway between true and false, or it will oscillate between true and false. This is real world truth indeterminancy! The real world system has more degrees of freedom than the simple Boolean world of truth and falsity, in language. So many of these grand philosophical problems fall to pieces at the first touch of the real world\u2026 ..take Theseus\u2019 ship, which is preserved and repaired to commemorate Theseus, so many times that its arguably not the same ship any more. Philosopher\u2019s will hold this up as An Important Problem Of Identity. But it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s all just word-meanings. Does any \u2018identity\u2019 persist in time? Only if you define it to do so. In reality I am not comprised of the same thoughts, feelings or atoms that I was a year ago. I am \u2018not the same person\u2019 and yet for conveniences sake I am legally defined to be and must answer for the traffic offence \u2018I\u2019 committed then\u2026What does \u2018Theseus\u2019 ship\u2019 mean. Can one \u2019own\u2019 a ship? Again this is a legal definition, not a \u2018real\u2019 quality of the ship. So when we talk about Theseus\u2019 ship, we are not mapping the real physical world, so much as a plethora of human perceptions and emotions, into language, and really when it comes to those we have infinite choice. Which has lead to even more nonsense from the more half baked philosophers who now claim that reality is whatever we choose it to be, ( a social construct) forgetting completely that although what we think of as reality is, yes, our construction, it is not just our construction. There is a real world out there independent of what we perceive it to be and describe to ourselves in our internal language. Otherwise the world would be full of paradox and we would all be magicians, willing the world into being, by (as with Tinkerbelle) believing very hard. And yet two boys, one of whom absolutely believes he is a girl, do not a baby make\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "We all operate under the point of view that paradoxes do not exist in reality; what appears to be a paradox is only an incomplete understanding of reality. Zeno pondered the mystery of movement given that one must move an infinite number of points before ever getting anywhere. Turns out one doesn\u2019t have to move an infinite number of points, thanks to indeterminacy and quantum effects, there aren\u2019t really an infinite number of points between here and there. And so it goes for all paradoxes. Of course, you realize everything stated in this post is false. Humor helps us get over paradoxes without figuring them out, which can be difficult. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Does paradox only exist in minds but not in reality? Why? Ponder on this: You adopt a newborn pig and took care of it, fed it, bathed it, etc. For people who are watching your behavior, they think you are a loving person taking care of your pet. But when the pig was already full grown and it was your birthday, you butchered the pig, cooked it and served it to your visitors and you even partook on eating it. ",

            "answer_text": "Paradoxes are merely a sign that someone has found some special circumstances in which some part of our language doesn\u2019t work very well. That\u2019s OK; language is just a tool, and there\u2019s no reason why all of it should work perfectly in every situation. But they\u2019re not particularly profound or meaningful, any more than jokes or rhymes or riddles happen to be. And they don\u2019t \u2018exist\u2019 in the sense in which objects exist. ",

Paradox is a concept and concepts are what \u2018fuels\u2019 the mind, which cannot operate outside of concepts- the mind itself being a concept that has \u2018spotty\u2019 apparitions in reality [not a constant presence], without having reality in itself. Reality begins where the mind ends, and not what the mind produces; what the mind produces is a repetition of concepts learned from others in various combinations, be that in a new/\u2018innovative\u2019 form, customarily labeled as \u2018originality\u2019.
