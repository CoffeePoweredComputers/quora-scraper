            "answer_text": "Question: Is knowledge true belief? Arguments from epistemic minimalists defend the claim that knowledge is true belief. Typically their counterexamples of true belief as knowledge involve gambling or betting. What are valid examples of true belief as knowledge which might support the claim that knowledge is true belief? Answer: That is an extreme point of view, but given it comes from an epistemology, it kinds of make sense. Human beings are limited by the very fundamental question that has been asked since Rene Descartes\u2019 Cogito Ergo Sum (I think, therefore I am): How can we know that what our senses (and tools which assist our senses) tell us are real? That we are not just a brain in a jar, or living in virtual reality, or in a world created by demons? To our brain, dreams and reality are IDENTICAL. We all live in our heads, literally. The world we see are merely our brain\u2019s interpretation of it. From that point of view, any objective empirical a-posteriori knowledge could not really exist. i.e. our senses cannot be trusted, hence our experience cannot be trusted. But I cannot understand how one can reject the senses and still claim that anything is \u201ctrue\u201d. The best you can get from that point of view is knowledge is belief. If you are a Popperian , you would clarify it as scientific knowledge is a knowledge that is falsifiable, but is not proven to be false yet, despite best efforts to do so; and has predictive value that is better than any other competing hypothesis. If you are taking epistomological limitations , you would add a small disclaimer at the end: assuming we live in a predictable universe that our senses can observe objectively. So unless you accept that our senses are capable of observing the reality objectively, then knowledge does not exist; and if knowledge does not exist, then the concept of \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d are merely subjective judgment, an opinion.

            "answer_text": "Knowledge is justified true belief. If the belief is not justified, then it\u2019s not knowledge, even if by coincidence it happens to be correct. If your only source of time is a stopped analog clock, can you ever know what time it is? The stopped clock is right twice a day. Let\u2019s say the clock is stopped at 6:27. One day, you happen to glance at the clock twice, once at 10:05a.m. and again (by chance) at 6:27p.m. Both times, you believe the clock, so both times, you believe it is 6:27. The first time, your belief is incorrect, while the second time, your belief is correct. But you have no way to know that. Neither of those beliefs is justified. Does it make sense to say that you didn\u2019t know what time it was the first time but you did the second time? As an aside, while it is possible to have knowledge (i.e., justified true belief), we can never really know if a belief is true. A belief isn\u2019t necessarily true just because it is justified. Our senses and our memories justify our beliefs, but we cannot know if our senses and memories are truthful. For example, you probably believe that you\u2019re reading this on a computer screen (including phone, table, etc.), and that belief is justified because it\u2019s what your senses tell you, but for all you know you could be in the Matrix, and what you sense could be an illusion. Another example, you probably believe you just read the preceeding sentence, and that belief is justified because it\u2019s what your memory tells you, but for all you know you could have been created one second ago with false memories.
