            "answer_text": "Effect of COVID-19 on the aviation industry can be observed in each region including North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World. For instance, in the US, since the national health emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak, most of the region is on complete lockdown, which is in turn restricting the domestic travel in the country. Countries such as Italy, France, Spain, and India are under complete lockdown and all kinds of flights are stopped until further notice. Key companies of the aviation industry that are getting affected globally include Qatar Airways, Emirates, China Eastern Airlines, Lufthansa, Boeing, Airbus, American Airlines Group Inc., and Delta Air Lines. Moreover, Emirates also halted most of its passenger operation as a result of the pandemic. Now, the airlines and airport managing companies are seeking bailout packages from the government. I am mentioning some if the facts and impcts which I found on the internet Year on year Change of flight frequency Worldwide is in the Week of august 11, 2020 Is -47.9%Forecasted number of air passengers Worldwide in 2020 Before the corona virus pandemic is 4.72bnSince the beginning of 2020, more and more countries across the globe shut down borders and limit domestic travel as a response to COVID 19 PANDEMIC. Thus, cancelling almost all flights to control the spread of the virus has affected the entire airline industry globally. THANK YOU \u2764\ud83d\ude00 STAY SAFE \ud83d\ude43 ",
