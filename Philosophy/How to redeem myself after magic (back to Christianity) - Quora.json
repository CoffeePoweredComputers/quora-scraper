            "answer_text": "IF you genuinely seek restoration with Father who create all spiritual principles including those that Satanists have to follow to work their magic then you can do the following: NEVER return to Christianity. It is a badly disguised druid cult and is just another form of Satanism.Ask Father who formed you in your mother\u2019s womb to place you in a spiritual bubble because Satan is going to try to kill you and probably already has a contract out on you to do so.Find someone who is properly anointed to do deliverance ministry. They have to take you into Father\u2019s throne room court to hear what has given Satan authority over your life. Only Father can do thatPreferably find a messianic Torah keeping group near you. At least you will hear the truth. Ask Father to reveal them to you.Ask Father to cut off all soul ties and generational curses for starters and to protect you within that spiritual bubbleAsk Father to cut off all backlash and any spiritual transference that could occur as a result of your need to be in alignment with HimAbove all, do not give up and ask other Torah keepers for covering prayers at all times. There is a tough time ahead for you and it will get very difficult but at least you have started and the benefits of doing so are enormous.I may be on other social media and could recommend someone to assist you in your locality. It will all depend on how genuine you are in wanting to return to obedience to Father. ",

            "answer_text": "Unfortunately, I\u2019m unaware of any 12-step, or advocacy/counseling group that assists with leaving the occult. There is certainly a need. Personally, I\u2019d talk to a priest. If nothing else, they may have ideas about separating yourself from all of that. I\u2019d get rid of the paraphernalia: the altars, the books, the tools. I\u2019d limit contact with people who are practicing, at least for awhile. You might want to consider a more active prayer-life, perhaps investigate centering-prayer and other such techniques. Re-read the Gospels. Eventually consider joining a church. You may find the more liturgical, the better. You may be in a better position than most to grasp the mystery at work in the Eucharist. Also, find an un-related hobby. Gardening, painting, working with animals - something that will be personally fulfilling. ",
