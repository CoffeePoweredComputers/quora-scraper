            "answer_text": "It was the year 2013. Class 12th results were out. I had passed with decent marks(more than decent in the eyes of my father). My father had always wanted me to pursue a career in engineering and even though I had asked him again and again during previous two years to allow me to pursue MBBS, his decision never changed. So when he asked me about my plans for future I just stayed silent. I knew what I wanted to do but since that would not be permitted I decided not to say anything. But then I had to tell something. So finally I decided to give in to his decision and pursue engineering. I had taken JEE mains by that time and even though the results were not out, I knew that I was not going to qualify. I told him about that and said that I would be dropping one year for JEE. He agreed. I didn\u2019t have much idea about JEE at that time. And my friends circle was also not a great one either. And I was a shy person at that time. I was hesitant at asking questions and clearing my doubts. So basically I was dropping for JEE without even having proper knowledge about the exam. My father mentioned about coaching which I plainly rejected. Till that time I had never taken coaching in my life and I was of the view that I would clear JEE(at least JEE mains with good marks) by studying on my own. I bought Arihant books for each subject and then started the preparation. I will not me writing much about preparation since I didn\u2019t give it my best and also I never had a feel for engineering. I still remember studying Biology books during that year(just for fun). Even with all this I qualified JEE mains and got admission to NIT srinagar. But later I realised(and now I feel it even more) that I should have gone for coaching. I didn\u2019t even join a test series. I had no idea of a test series at that time. My speed was poor during the exam and so was my accuracy. Had I gone for coaching then I would have joined a much better NIT(maybe an IIT). When I decided to prepare for GATE then I was in a huge dilemma whether to go for coaching or not. I believed that I could do it on my own but that disaster with JEE was still bothering me a lot. In the end I decided to not join coaching(not a great learner, I believe). But this time I did join test series and ended up getting a great rank. I don\u2019t know how much of an impact that decision made on my life but I believe what could have been something great ended at being something good. That\u2019s all folks\u2026 ",
