It is a matter of taking one step at a time and making them believe there is nothing wrong with being among other people. There minds are susceptible to \u201cinput\u201d of thought or an idea and they can accept what you tell them. As the others say, it is a long, slow process, but can be achieved as can a lot of mental health issues that are just what people think.

Initially, you may seem a rude person, the \u2018non-nice\u2019 person you were presumed to be till that deciding moment. But, with time invested in the social relationship, people\u2019s initial perceptions change. All of the change can be possible only with faith. Here are some TedX links for Social anxiety.
