            "answer_text": "The Tao is a Chinese concept that loosely means path or principle. It\u2019s an ethic found in Confucianism and other religions and world views. It also resonates among Western thinkers. For example, the 19th century essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2019s Essay on Compensation has Taoist thought although he never labeled it as such: \u201cPunishment is a fruit that unsuspected ripens within the flower of the pleasure which concealed it. Cause and effect, means and ends, seed and fruit, cannot be severed; for the effect already blooms in the cause, the end preexists in the means, the fruit in the seed. \u201c The basic idea is that principles aren\u2019t random, relativistic notions. Rather, they are rooted in a core of objective value, rightness, truth, and coherency. If you break the rules, the rules will break you. If you violate the laws of common sense, the laws of nature will kick in with a vengeance. It may seem hard to accept that an idea is more real than a laptop, but new technologies are always replacing old technologies. This flux and flow occurs against a backdrop of eternal principles. In that sense, those principles have a solidity that people and equipment lack. A principle is an imperative standard. \u201cFasten your seat belt\u201d, \u201chonor your parents\u201d, and \u201cbe neighborly\u201d are principles. They come from common sense and from our shared humanity. Principles are also a priori propositions, reasonable perhaps but not provable. For the logical positivists of the 1930s, if we couldn\u2019t verify a statement empirically, it was literally nonsense. But this criterion is, in itself, a principle. Some principles, such as \u201cscience is\u201d and \u201cfaith is\u201d on the surface seem to contradict each other while other principles, such as \u201cfree speech\u201d and \u201cpublic safety\u201d suggest that an absolutist application of either principle can undermine both principles. If we fall short of the principle, the principle remains but so does our failure of that principle. An application, by contrast, is a way to meet the principle. We could think of a principle as a destination. Let\u2019s say we want to go from New York City to Chicago. We could drive, fly, go by train, take expressways, or take the scenic route. Chicago is the principle. The way we get to Chicago is the application. If our journey ends in Cleveland, we\u2019ve failed our principle of going to Chicago. If the principle is to have a daily scrum and our standup is on Monday through Thursday only, then we have failed the principle. Java, .NET, SOAP, and REST are applications of principles of information technology, not principles. In American law, principles are encoded in the Unioted States Constitution. The application to those principles are legislated and litigated in countless cases and in front of jurors. Moral and non-moral standards are similar in that those standards are principles. The application to those principles are contextualized situationally. The principles doesn\u2019t change. The applications to the principles are always changing. ",

            "answer_text": "In the exercise of critical thinking, it is not assumed that the subjects should remain undefined and lacking in a precise definition. There are no \u201csimilarities\u201d in the comparison of: (A) \u201cmoral standards\u201d and, (B) \u201cnon-moral standards\u201d. The designations \u201cmoral\u201d and \u201cnon-moral\u201d are specifications for mutual exclusions which expose the logical error in the proposition, making it unassociated with conceptions of 2 Extremes and a Mean. Beyond that, care must be taken in the formulation of a proposition, not to include, an Excluded Middle Value. Venn Diagramming of the proposition will show this to be factually representative. In an objective methodology, The 2 concepts are antithetical. Attempts to identify \u201csimilarities\u201d between the 2 identities constitutes a violation of the Law of Noncontradiction. Furthermore, absent an objective definition of both terms, there can be no objective contrast of either identity. There is a neglect to identify a \u201cnon-moral standard\u201d. That specific designation is demonstrative of the error designated the Fallacy of Equivocation. No \u201cnon-moral standard\u201d has been defined or identified for comparison. Basic errors in reasoning must be avoided to obtain a true conclusion. ",
