            "answer_text": "It is not a competition, and Science and Philosophy are not really fighting for the same throne.  However, for the ordinary man/woman, I think that the success of Modern Science made it outshine Philosophy completely. Science is very popular; popular science books sell much more than the philosophy ones. The best and the brightest kids are strongly encouraged to become scientists (and sadly, engineers), but rarely to become philosophers. In fact, Philosophy is commonly thought to be a useless endavour.  So, on an intellectual level, Science has not replaced Philosophy. But it has become so much more popular. ",

            "answer_text": "Science has no moral value. The most technically gifted man, the smartest scientist, the craftiest doctor can be the most cold sociopath or the most righteous man alive. I'd define philosophy as the art of wisdom. Philosophy is about exploring practical, social, metaphysical, ... problems and attempt to find the \"best\" solution through rational argumentation. The path to the \"best\" solution resides in defining what is \"best\", \"good\" and such. \"Correct\" philosophy derives from many things such \"killing is bad\", notions like duty,... you could probably argue that it all derives from a \"group interpretation/transposition\" of the survival instinct. That sounds wierd but I can't really define better. In any case, philosophy revolves around a few axioms that define what is \"good\" and \"proper\" and such.  Generally speaking, \"philosophy\" attempts to answer \"why should I or should I not do this/use this/say this/think this\". Religion (which is about answer \"why does this exist or happen this way\") sometimes intrudes because it posits certains rules or consequences of divine events/choices. Science on the other hand tries to answer \"how does this happen/how does this work/how can I do/make/change this\". Science doesn't really overlap with philosophy, except when it creates new questions/problems for philosophy to answer. In other words, science is about how well you use your hands and mind to resolve problems and understand the world. Philosophy is about finding what is right. ",

            "answer_text": "Science is underpinned by assumptions: 1. Causation: That if something happens, something caused it. If, for example, I get bopped on the head by a ball thrown in the air by someone, then that is caused by someone throwing a ball in the air. It sounds obvious to us, but philosophy can sustain arguments against this.2. Reliability of observations: Science assumes (within a degree of measurement error) that observations are a reasonable interpretation of what is actually happening. Counter to this is Descartes' first meditation: How do we know that what we perceive is not fabricated? If it's entirely made up (like, for example, in The Matrix (1999), it's false, unreliable and does not predict because the determination is under another agency's control.3. Causation is consistent: The laws of physics never change but only if we assume that they don't change. Science can provide evidence against all of the above but only if the assumptions are assumed. Within those assumptions, science is (to date) the best tool we have for establishing knowledge (or to be precise, what isn't true). If we chose to move outside those assumptions, science falls down.

            "answer_text": "I think that there is a need to \"scientify\" philosophy and base it in mathematics instead of fuzzy logic based in words. Words are not nearly precise enough to describe problems/solutions in a good enough way. \"Dethrone\" is perhaps the wrong word to use in this context, I would rather say we need a philosophy based on scientific principles and math.Observation, learn from mistakes, build the reasoning on solid mathematical ground is the only way to be able to use philosophical knowledge in the coming age of supercomputers that are sentient beings. How do you teach/tell/preach to a supercomputer to get along with  mankind? Perhaps with philosophy, but then in a form that can be better understood by a supercomputer, ie maths. The new science of deep learning used in several scientific projects the last year shows that progress will be fast in the AI area after the breakthroughs have been made. Philosophy is lagging behind in this, and I fear that it even might be too late, or as Elon Musk puts it \"we are unleashing a demon\". What did he mean? Maybe that a supercomputer without a moral (human) value base can be very dangerous indeed. Maybe there is a scientific project somewhere working with these issues - I certainly hope so. What I am very sure of thoughm is that there is no project driven by philosophers that will ever be able to address this issue. ",
