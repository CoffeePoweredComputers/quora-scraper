A true example is my losing a job in the World Trade Center due to my babysitter abruptly quitting. this saved my life. Also thebreakup of an engagement saved me from marrying an infertile man ( Ididn't know his condition at the time ), which would have prevented me from having my beautiful and devoted daughter. When you look at patterns like that, the evidence of karma kicks in. ",
