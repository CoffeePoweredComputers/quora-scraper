            "answer_text": "There is no such thing as psychic power. There are different kinds of people who pretend to be psychic or really believe that they are: Type A. Pretends to be able to speak to the dead relatives of people who are grieving for their lost family and charge them money to pass on fake messages from their dead loved ones. These are really sick individuals who should be fined or incarcerated for fraud (wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain.) Type B. doesn\u2019t charge people for their services but just tells their friends that they are psychic to appear cool and special. Type C. Has a mental illness such as schizophrenia, hears voices etc. and really believes that they are in contact with spirits. It is all pretty ugly. ",

            "answer_text": "You will not like my answer. You have been warned. There are two types of psychics, the deluded and the scammers. What they have in common is the skill of cold reading and related skills. The deluded do this subconsciously, believing their abilities are psychic powers. Scammers, on the other hand, do this consciously. In both cases the \u201cpsychics\u201d take advantage of the desperate and vulnerable, almost always for money, favors, or something. There are a very few who use their skills to help others for free, but it\u2019s still just cold reading, not any kind of magical psychic power. I wish you well and good luck in finding a real solution to your life problems. ",

Children will know things which they could not normally do (for someone his/her age). They could have access to information or knowledge which they normally couldn\u2019t able to know. They could be lacking in fear of places which normal people couldn\u2019t dare to venture (because they know whether it is ill place or not) and very judgemental of people who could behave friendly (because they can sense their inner emotions). Eventually, they could grow up alone but NOT lonely (if they maintain their inner child). ",
