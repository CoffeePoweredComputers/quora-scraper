            "answer_text": "Historians suspect he was condemned to death because earlier, when he served in government as a juror as Athenian citizens were expected to do, he refused to condemn someone to death unjustly, and his political enemies were taking revenge. \u201cCritias had been the leader of the thirty tyrants, and had been killed in the fight against the exiled democrats. Alcibiades had a prominent Athenian statesman and general during the war between Athens and Sparta, but had betrayed Athens and joined Sparta. He had also been one of the architects behind another oligarchic overthrow of democracy in Athens in 411, which was short-lived however. Alcibiades was killed before the war ended. We have here then two prominent public men who had both contributed to the temporary undoing of the democratic state. Socrates had been the teacher of both, and had also had a very close personal relationship to Alcibiades. Socrates also chose to stay in Athens during the rule of the thirty Tyrants, even though he could have left the city, thus implicating him with the rule. But even though he stayed in Athens, he did somewhat distance himself from the thirty, since at the risk of his own life he refused to carry out orders from the 30 [tyrants] that would lead to the execution of a just man. \u201c Why Socrates sentenced to Death? So you have the official charge, and then the underlying motivation which probably was the real cause of the charge against Socrates: he associated with anti-democrats on the one hand, but also refused to carry out the nefarious commands of the same anti-democrats, thus making enemies in both camps.

A crime at that time punishable by Death ii) He had formed a secret Society in which he was giving instructions on how to overthrow Democracy. Three of his students Critias-Alkibiades-Faedon tried to. Critias actually became a Tyrant in Athens iii) He was introducing a new Religion into Athens -A crime at that time punishable by Death and he was against the established Religion. Not just a Non-Believer but an Enemy of the Gods. A crime at that time punishable by Death. Just for his Pedophilia and for his Conspiracy, he was going to get executed even in our times. ",
