Things were said that could only have come from her, and others heard them as well. So I am convinced that there is an afterlife, at least for one person, my daughter. Read the whole story, which I call \u201can impeccable death,\u201d here: Philosophy for Real Life (Philosophy for Real Life) And please read it. Don\u2019t just assume that it must be wishful thinking or delusion without at least considering my story. ",
