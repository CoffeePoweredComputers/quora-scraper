            "answer_text": "Society refers to the state of a group of individual life forms which have attained a status of living interdependently either through choice or by force or by both. All life forms have various levels of social complexity but nearly all life forms are social. Even life forms that do not consider themselves interdependent can be quite so. Take for example the Cheetah and the Antelope. They do not seem to socialize with each other, in fact they do their best to avoid each other. Yet they do comprise an interdependence on several levels and as such comprise a society. In fact all the animals of a particular region comprise a society with interdependence across the entire biosphere. There are no differences between animals in this regard. The only difference is the level of complexity of the interdependence. Generally the more complex the interdependence the more complex the society. ",

            "answer_text": "When I hear the word society I think of sheep. More accurately a community of people who blindly conform to the norms while believing that to do so serves the common good. Those who stand outside of the normalcy of a society are often considered social outcasts and are shunned for their indifference to herd conformity. Often enough these types are also called Satanists as well. ",
