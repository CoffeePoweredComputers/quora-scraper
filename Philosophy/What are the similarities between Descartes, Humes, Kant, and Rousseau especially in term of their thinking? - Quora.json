            "answer_text": "Broadly speaking the main similarity is that all of them thought philosophically. More specifically, Descartes and Kant were rationalists, Hume was an empiricist, while Rousseau was a politician. Furthermore, Descartes was very materialistic. For example he could not get the piece of wax out of his head. It bothered him that it would melt and that he would see it melt. And so he wished that wax would actually not melt and instead  just  be what it is .  \"There must be demons in the world\", he thought. And at first glance such a conclusion may seem a bit farfetched in our today, but consider how not so long ago even Bob Marley - when asked if he could be loved - also said \"Don't let them fool ya, or school ya...change ya, or rearrange ya\" -- but who is them?  Descartes thought it was wax-matter. Now we know that he was wrong of course, but still this puts us in no position to criticize him because without him there would be no Kant either. Kant read Descartes and basically said  \"First forget wax-matter, or any matter per se - these are mere 'building materials'. All that really matters is manner -- namely  the plan or the design\"-- in other words, the important thing is not what wax is, but the way in which it melts; namely, it is the how that counts.  Out of the four, Hume was the one with purpose, and with one simple goal on his mind: How do I impress my mater ?... And really there is no need to employ any rigid Kantian methods here, which are just probably unnecessary. And if there ever was any antagonism between Descartes' matter and Kant's manner, Hume will make us doubt that. Rousseau was interested in politics and freedom, skeptical about social contracts and about contrived human relations. He saw society rather than being like children all playing together and freely, instead having progressed into the state of oppression and pretence. But genuine freedom is necessary for genuine human relations to develop and for all the apparent nonsense to get settled down. Politically speaking and small as may be, the little bit of room that political freedom provides means quite a lot, and according to Rousseau is the only way for man to get back that which he naturally deserves.

            "answer_text": "Supposing you desire not an academical response, I answer at two questions, for similar means difference in two senses: 1 Classical: take three elements, how do you say that two of them are interrelated, and the third is a reciprocal; and for any fourth,fifth,..., element, this element must be reciprocal, and could be interrelated either to the formers(that are interrelated yet,for it has been welcomed) or to others. Example: two mices, one cat; how mices are similar, reciprocally giving something different from themselves like the cat,...?  Things are similar because: A)circumstances, so due to either quantity or quality; and due to quality either in substantial or accidental way. Example: 1lt boiling water is similar to 1lt boiling oil in respect to quality in accidental way, beacause both of them are boiling; and in respect of quantity, which is never substantial- as a measure.  B) their phenomenon: are similar things that are given in a certain way- thus all men are similar- or are changing because of similar causes- thus,for example, someone who is feeling fear is similar to someone, or something, else who is affected with fear too. 2 Non classical: a thing A is similar to another B, when it n e v e r happens that A is given and B could not be derived from. Being uninformal: being here A, B m u s t be there; or A e B are similar if there is at least one term, whose property(i.e.vagueness) do not prevent to make a set in which there are both A and B. So, which are the similarities? Suppose these questions asked to ancients philosophers together: 1Which thing is man? \"Mortal\"2Why is man worth living? \"Because he thinks\" Suppose the same questions asked to medieval philosophers: 1 \"Creature\"2 \"Because he is guided\" And finally to Descartes,Hume,Kant,Rousseau(in a way they all agree): 1 \"Thinker\" 2 \"Because he is free\". Totally agree with Stephen Simons : \"The question as written could be the subject of a book\" ",
