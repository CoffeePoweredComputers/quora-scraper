            "answer_text": "Dear Friend Rumi says, \u201cDrunks fear the police but the police are drunk too\u201d. We are prone to thinking that a \u2018thing\u2019 is cancelled or neutralized by its opposite and our superficial experience in the world supports this kind of thinking.When cold water is mixed with hot water what you get is water that is neither cold nor hot.When a force toward the left meets a force towards the right, what you get is equilibrium. So it is no wonder, that we think that the opposite of \u2018something\u2019 neutralizes it, finishes it, dissolves it.If the day is hot, we wait for the night. We say, \u201cThe day is so hot, the night might bring us some relief.\u201d And when the night comes, we are glad to say, \u201cThe night brought us relief from the heat of the day\u201d.For us, a \u2018thing\u2019 finds its end, its deliverance, its solution in its opposite. If the day troubles me, then my deliverance lies with the night. If white threatens me, then my succor lies with black. If going upwards, I find suffering then the correct way for me is to go downwards.That is the way of the Samsara (World). That is what our \u2018normal\u2019, everyday experience has taught us.But the wise man looks attentively at the world. He asks, \u201cIs really a \u2018thing\u2019 finished by its opposite?\u201d He probes deeply into life and what he sees is that the deeper is the pain, the more is the search and the memory of pleasure. And the more is the pleasure, the more is the urge to consume the pleasure out of a fear of pain.He sees that just as, the more a spring is stretched, the more it wants to return to its unstretched position, similarly, the more a thing is, the more its opposite is created.He sees that you cannot have \u2018something\u2019, without parallely creating its opposite. If you want to see pitch darkness, then you will need to have a background of white. Without a background of white, it will be impossible to have even black.He sees that the opposite of a \u2018thing\u2019 does not neutralize it, instead enhances it.And that is the difference between the worldly man and the wise man. The worldly man, rushes from one end of duality to the other end of duality, looking for relief. Of course, whichever end he goes to, he only finds more suffering. But to him there is no world, except the one found between the two poles of duality.So even if he suffers, he remains helpless. Where can he go? When night troubles him, he begs for the day. When the day tortures him, he fondly remembers the night. And, he argues that there is only the day and the night, that no third condition exists. So he says, \u201cEven if I suffer in the day and I suffer in the night, I have to be either in the day or in the night. There is no third possibility. The best that I can do for myself is that when the day becomes too much for me, then I can rush toward the night. And when the night starts killing me, then I can go towards the day.  \u201cSo I can position myself at some kind of interface between day and night. But wherever I am, I am in the game of opposites. And I am sustained by my belief that, \u2018Relief from one end is possible by rushing to the other end.\u2019 That is what makes me stay in this game and that is what does not allow me to rebel. I have short memory and I am so hopeful. I forget, I conveniently forget that I have rushed from one end to the other end, a million times, without ever finding permanent peace. I completely forget. And even if somebody comes to remind me that you are engaged in a lost game, that what you are trying out is impossible, that your efforts are going to fail, I reply with the grand statement full of hope; I say, \u2018One should never stop hoping, one should keep trying!\u2019\u201d \u201cYes, I have failed a thousand times before, but who knows? I may just succeed the next time. And that is what my elders always taught me: \u2018To be hopeful.\u2019 So even if I see that jumping from one pole to the other doesn\u2019t do anybody any good, yet, I maintain a foolish belief that I might be an exception!\u201d\u201cI maintain a foolish belief that, by walking down the same road (n+1)th time, I will reach a different place. I have walked down the same road n times and I never reached anywhere! Yet I am so hopeful, that this time, I will reach paradise!\u201dThe wise man realizes a simple, basic and obvious thing. He says, \u201cEnough of this \u2018left-right\u2019 business, enough of this \u2018pole to pole\u2019 business. I have been hopping around like a monkey, since ancient times! When heat has troubled me, I have gone to cold. When I was young, I use to pray for maturity. When I became old, I remember my young age. When the wife would trouble me I would rush to the mother. When mother would be too much upon me, then I would hide with the wife. When I would be with people, then I would crave for aloneness. And when I would be on my own, then I would search for company. In the summers, the winter would look so nice, so I would want to rush to the hill stations. In the winters, I would build a fire, devoted to the memory of summers. You see, this game is a stupid game! And one end of duality is not cancelling out the other end; one pole is not neutralizing the other pole.\u201dHe realizes that one pole is the foundation on which the other pole stands and vice versa. He realizes that pain is not the opposite of pleasure. Pain is the inevitable, inexorable and natural companion of pleasure.Without pain, there can be no pleasure.Now this man\u2019s life, after this realization, cannot be the same. He cannot chase happiness and pleasure anymore! He has realized that happiness is not at all distinct from sadness, and the one who chases happiness is simultaneously chasing sadness. In fact, happiness, sadness, and the chase for either of these are just one and the same thing. All three are the same!Having realized that the two ends of duality maintain and sustain each other, that they never cancel out each other, they look like opposites, but they are not really opposites; having realized thus, the wise man is established beyond duality. Now, the highest point in his psyche, in his mind, remains no more a dualistic point.In the mind of the worldly man, the highest accomplishment is a dualistic accomplishment. Whatever the worldly mind will want will have an opposite; it would be dualistic in nature. Which means that whatever the worldly mind would want, would still be within the mind; would be a product of the mind; would be within the limitations of the mind; would be within the dualistic domain. And if the highest that you can want is still dualistic, it means that if you are wanting the highest pleasure you are simultaneously arranging the highest pain for yourself. And that is the fate of every single worldly man.Running after pleasure and happiness, the fool does not even know that he has been arranging the highest pain for himself. And when pain comes, he acts as if something unexpected has happened, he pretends as if something beyond the acceptable has chanced.So all his life, the fool, would keep moving in the dualistic plane, and never realize why he has been suffering, why his life has been an unbroken succession of miserable mistakes. Time and again, life would show him, expose to him that his life lacks juice and love and attention and wisdom. Time and again, he would stumble and fall down, but like a drunkard he would get up and act as if nothing has happened! Time and again, life would show to him that he is missing out on something very important but like a biased judge he would totally ignore the evidence! He would want to continue with his drunken ways.The wise man, the wise mind, on the other hand, does not target anything within the dualistic domain, within the mental domain. His eyes are firmly set upon that which does not have an opposite. He asks this very question, \u201cThe \u2018thing\u2019 that I am wanting, did it have a beginning?\u201dAnd if the answer is, \u2018yes\u2019, he says, \u201cIf it began at a point, it will also end at another point, because that is the law of duality. I cannot want it. If I want it, I would only be ensuring trouble for myself\u201d. He asks a simple question, \u201cThat which I want so deeply and so badly, did it begin?\u201d and \u201cDid my want for it begin?\u201dIf the answer is, \u2018yes\u2019, he directly and fearlessly says, \u201cIf it began at a point in time, it is sure to end at another point in time. By wanting it, I cannot curse myself to suffering!\u201dThen he asks himself, \u201cDoes it have a limit, that which I want?\u201d And if the answer is, \u2018yes\u2019 he says, \u201cIf it has a limit, then outside that limit, its opposite exists; and a thing cannot exist without its opposite. Now, by wanting it, I\u2019ll have to parallely want its opposite. I am creating suffering for myself.\u201dSo he says, \u201cI cannot really want that which is limited, I cannot want that whose existence is dependent upon the existence of its opposite.\u201d And thus, the wise man comes to want that and only that which the mind cannot think of. Because the mind can only think of dualistic objects; the mind can only think of limitations. Having realized, the wise man says, \u201cWhatever the mind can think of, will only bring misery to me.\u201dThe wise man abstains from wanting anything which is an object of the mind. He says, \u201cIf I can conceptualize it, if it is a worldly object then it cannot be my primary concern. It cannot be the center of my life. I cannot allow it to dominate my mind.\u201dAnd a great revolution happens!The revolution is that the mind of the wise man becomes liberated from material.Mind is material, material is mind and both mind and material are dualistic. You can call material as material only if it has a limit and a boundary. You call material as material only if your senses perceive it, and your senses cannot perceive the limitless. The mind of the worldly man is full of material and material only. You can call the worldly man as a \u201cmaterial man\u201d, to him nothing but the material exists. His highest quest is for the material.Yes, he may use word like \u2018God\u2019, but even his \u2018God\u2019 is a material God. And this itself is the punishment of the worldly man, because when the highest you can want is material, then you will never get that which is not material! Your life will be totally devoid of that which the mind cannot think of, which the hands cannot hold, which the eyes cannot see and that which is beyond perception and experience.You will have no flavor of that. And, what is that? What is it that you cannot hold in hands? What is it that you cannot think of? That is what the worldly man will miss and he will not know what he is missing. It\u2019s just that he will keep suffering without ever realizing why he is suffering.You cannot hold love in your hands. And if the material is the highest that you can want, you will never get love, never! Yes, you will have the word \u2018love\u2019 but even your love would be a material love and hence there would be no love.You will keep thinking that you know love, but all that you know is material. So you, obviously, do not know love. The mind that is ambitious, and when you are ambitious, obviously, you are chasing something material. The mind that is ambitious and wants money, property and recognition, this mind simply knows no love. He would say, \u201cI love you,\u201d but saying, \u201cI love you\u201d is not love.But sweet words are not love, singing songs for somebody is not love. These are things; material, past and history that you absorb and copy from the influences that you have had. But so poor and deprived is the life of the worldly man that he mistakes these silly expressions for the real thing! He lives in shadows and thinks that these are real people.He lives with the word \u2018love\u2019 and thinks that he knows love. That is his punishment. He will die without ever having known love even for a second, even for a moment. That is his punishment. And it is not only love that is non-material. How will you weigh peace? How will you measure peace?  How will you store peace? Peace is not material and if material and duality is all you know then you will never be at peace!(Mockingly) What is the unit of peace? What is the density of peace? Where do you dig out peace from? In which laboratory do you process it? How will your analytical mind ever come to know of peace?Peace is non-dualistic, peace is non-material. But you refuse to have faith in anything that is non-material. You dismiss it, you are contemptuous towards it. And you are such an idiot! You do not even realize that by being contemptuous towards the immaterial, the beyond material, you are being contemptuous towards the highest that life can give you. You are such a fool, but when you are dismissing that which is beyond mind, you act as if you are being sensible; you act as if you are being smart and intelligent. Like a fool, you want the evidence of that which is all around you and within you!That which is right under your nose and right in front of your eyes, you want evidence for that! You want evidence of that, which is not only in front of your eyes but also behind your eyes!And because you get no evidence, proudly you declare, \u201cIt does not exist\u201d, and that is your punishment. By declaring that, \u201cIt does not exist,\u201d you actually prohibit yourself from knowing it.That is the only difference between the knower and the fool. The fool says, \u201cTruth does not exist,\u201d and he never, hence, knows the truth. The wise man says, \u201cNothing but the truth exists,\u201d and he sees nothing but the truth!That is the only difference. The fool has a deep belief in his ideas about the world, and about the world you anyway only have ideas. He has a deep belief in his ideas.All ideas are material. He gets no love, no peace, and no joy. He gets his calculations, he gets his numbers, and he gets his conclusions.And it is not as if, he is never reminded. His suffering, explicit and implicit, superficial and deep, is a daily reminder to him that there is something fundamentally wrong with the way he is living. But the deeper he goes into his \u2018ways of living\u2019, the more he finds that he has invested into his ways of living, and now he gets another \u2018smart\u2019 argument. He says, \u201cI have invested so much in my current ways of living that I cannot come out of them! You know, my deep investment is at stake! Let me first recoup that investment and then I will exit the whole portfolio.\u201d I have put in my entire life here; how can I just leave it like this?\u201dWe calculate  so much, yet we are pretty poor even at calculations. Our calculations are never holistic, we never calculate the total cost that we are paying; we never calculate. Somebody offers us money for a job and we are able to see how much we would be earning in this job, but we are never able to see what we would be paying for that job. We are never able to see the hidden costs; we are never able to see how we are paying with our life and our blood to get that amount of money.And if you were wise enough to factor in all the costs, if you could make a total, comprehensive and holistic calculation, then you would see that whatever you are doing in life is a very-very loss making proposition. But you simply have no idea of all the costs that you are incurring. The costs remain hidden. You do not know the value of love, so how can you put a number to what you have lost? Living a loveless life, what is the cost? Finding no joy! Can you put a number to your loss?Says Rumi, \u201cDrunks fear the police but the police are drunk too\u201d.Wherever you see a pair of opposites in this world, realize that both ends are just the same, like two faces of a coin. We often think that the drunkards and the thieves necessitate the police. What we fail to realize is that it is policing that continues and sustains crime and theft parallely.The common logic is that you require locks so that there may be no theft. But the wise man says, \u201cIt is not, as if, theft brings the lock into existence.\u201d The wise man says, \u201cThe thief and the lock are born together, not one after the other. Not one after the other. It is not as if thief came first and then the police came. It is not, as if, the thief or the theft happened first and then the lock is used. The fact is, the same mind that wants to steal is also the mind that wants to hoard and conserve and use locks. These two are the same mind but they look opposites. Hence we are fooled into thinking that they are actually opposites. They are not opposites. The mind that will have no intention of stealing would also be the mind which will have no intention of safe guarding his possessions. And if you are particular about safe guarding your possessions, kindly understand that you are not far away from stealing.This might sound a little preposterous to some of you, but go into it without prejudice and you will see how the law of duality works. I repeat, if you are very particular about locks, then you cannot be far away from being a thief.  If you are very particular about possessing, then you cannot be far away from acquiring. And when the acquisition happens as per means approved by society, you just call it acquisition and achievement, right? You say he is an achiever. And when the acquisition happens outside the ways approved by the society, then you call acquisition as a theft. That is the only difference between achievement and theft. Achievement is acquisition sanctioned by the society and theft is the acquisition not sanctioned by the society. But fundamentally they are just the same, just the same.And social norms keep changing; laws of the land keep changing. What is today \u2018a theft\u2019 would tomorrow be called \u2018an achievement\u2019, what is today is \u2018black\u2019 money would tomorrow become \u2018white.\u2019Possession and theft go together because you cannot possess without acquiring.If you like possessing, you will have to like acquiring. The thief and the lock are one; the lock and the thief are one.Whenever you see a thing, do not be captivated by it. At that very instant, remember it\u2019s opposite. Be situated at a point, where you can look equally at black and white: together and in parallel.Do not be swayed away, do not be taken in. And when you are bothered, resist the temptation of going to the opposite of your current state. It would be a great temptation, but resist.When you encounter suffering do not jump to the other pole. Instead, remember that suffering comes when you are in between the poles, or at either of the poles.Suffering is the result of forgetting the non-dual Truth. Suffering is the result of forgetting Advait (non-duality; oneness). That is the only reason why you suffer.Resist the temptation of jumping from one pole of dvait (duality) to other pole. Stay with your suffering boldly, fearlessly, intelligently. And if you can stay with it, look at it, then there would be no need to go to the opposite state. That fearless staying is itself advait (non-duality; oneness).Do not be in a hurry, you have always be in a hurry, you have always been hopping around, try something else, at least once.

            "answer_text": "What a lot of people seemingly have a difficult time accepting is that emotions, as well as sensations, exist on a continuum. Namely where one type of emotion must exist and be experiential the other polar opposite emotion MUST also exist and be experiential. Meaning you cannot have pleasure without pain, and that you cannot have pain without pleasure. People seem to be under the notion that an eternal pleasurable experience is possible without any reference to pain whatsoever. A state of eternal and sensual bliss. People believe this is possible without giving it too much thought. For surely we have all had painful experiences put also pleasurable experiences, why not have a state where one exists in exclusion to the other. After all, you can only really experience pleasure or pain, at any one moment in time and not both simultaneously. So why not choose the better experience of \u2018pleasure\u2019 for all eternity, seems plausible and possible doesn\u2019t it? But, on closer examination, that type of logic begins to break down. Pleasure as well as pain while not being quantifiable in terms of measurement is qualitative and thus has properties that can easily be described. Some things are extremely pleasurable (use your imagination), some things are moderately pleasurable, some things are relatively pleasurable, and some things are just ok. On the other hand, some things are extremely painful, some things are moderately painful and some things are only mildly painful. As one can easily see the sensations of pleasure and pain exist on a continuum with an almost infinite amount of gradations of \u201din-between\u201d states. The point is that something that is extremely pleasurable can ONLY exist in relation to something that is less pleasurable and thus inherently more painful in terms of spectrum. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure, I think it is confusing and savage when people links pleasure with pain. Pain per se leads to suffering and is the ausence of joy. People who is sick for an illness experience pain as there is something, like a virus, in their body that is mortifying. If you don't feel joy or mental calmness you are not and cannot experiencing real pleasure on what you do. Or you feel pain and suffer or you feel pleasure and enjoy the moment. Listen to yourself when you read this: ''pleasure in being abused or dominated : a taste for suffering.'' Taste and pleasure is similar. That was one of the definitions for masochism, and it is considered a trait for Sadistic personality disorder (link). Effort is something that is used to work in our daily schedules, but this doesn't mean that there is the presence of pain or abuse. This is clearly experienced while doing sports. When pain arrives the pleasure ceases, except that you lie yourself and go against your will. In that case you will see: that the energy is not well canalisedthe person can abstain from following rulesthe player is not fluidseems harsh and uses more the brute force than his/her skills, with no integrity.doesn't develop style and seems unnatural (mechanic, robotised).It doesn't mean that you should feel scared when suffering or pain arrives, but is a symptom that your body needs a pause for recovery, a different skill, a different strategy, preparation, another sport, other peers, or that you are approaching to the natural closure of the game to see if you won or not. :) thanks!

            "answer_text": "When one sees a splendid sun-rise, one does not feel pleasure nor pain in that moment, one is captivated by the moment. Only when thought comes in, and says: I must have that again, is there a notion of that experience being pleasurable. A value has been set on the experience, and forever after the mind seeks what it remembers as of great value, and thus of great pleasure, and forever will it escape that of negative value, thus of great pain.  Now, having put something high, we must have the low. Thus, we suffer greatly because we remember great bliss. It is a vicious cycle. To scratch an itch brings great pleasure, for it releases the tension and discomfort. But to never have an itch is still greater, for it means peace and harmony. One cannot have a notion of pleasure without a notion of pain. The same life can be experienced in two ways. Either as one of pleasure and pain, or one of peace. The differentiation is caused by the first clinging to memories, which happens as a thought asserts a value to an experience. While the second is without conflict.  If there is a 'my way' and 'your way', there will be great pleasure and later there ensures a severe depression. If there is only the way, then the question never arises. ",

            "answer_text": "After 25+ years of observing and researching this, I strongly believe that pain and pleasure are intimately interconnected. And that they always balance each other out in the long run in each of us. To clarify, by \u201cpain\u201d I mean any unpleasant sensation (physical, emotional, or otherwise) and by \u201cpleasure\u201d I mean any pleasant sensation (again (physical, emotional, or otherwise). Also, I do not mean to say that every pleasure is immediately followed by an equal amount of pain, or vice versa. I just mean that the mix of pains and pleasure we experience eventually balances out. I believe this is a fundamental underlying \u201cforce\u201d in the universe, akin to electromagnetism or gravity/relativity. I call it suduality. Suduality helps explain why people who experience prolonged pain (such as a marathon runner, or someone fasting for days) can then experience euphoria (e.g. the runner\u2019s high). On the flipside, it helps explain why those who take recreational drugs to get euphorically high inevitably go through a horrible comedown/withdrawal and/or suffer significant anhedonia (loss of everyday pleasures). I am writing a book on this topic called The Sudist Way, which provides evidence of this principle, how it affects our perception of human life, how to leverage it to make better life decisions, and how to use it to overcome chronic pain, depression and anxiety. You can download a free copy here, or on Apple Books or Google Play if you\u2019d like, at no cost since my goal is simply to help others in their own life journey. Have a good day! :-) ",

For instance, one can enjoy ice-cream, without suffering from it later on :) All that needs to happen is to simply be aware of arising attachment or aversion to any created mental concepts of the ice-cream. We can only crave or averse concepts, never reality. The mind will create concepts, this is completely out of our hands. Just notice the attachment or aversion to them as also something simply arising in awareness. Something not you. Something not freely chosen. Just see through the dream. It\u2019s like a virtual reality made of concepts. Imagining is purely conceptual, but we make concepts on top of observed reality as well. I always remember my mother not noticing my father had shaved off his mustache, because she was looking at her own created concept of him. For instance, this whole interaction on Quora here, other than the letters on the screen, is occurring completely inside our conceptual imagination. Just see through that, and any attachment or aversion of how people might respond will be seen through. ",

Human nature automatically moves toward pleasure and away from pain. If there was no lack or suffering we wouldn't have to move or do anything as we would be content. It's like there is no in between we are either suffering (seems like 95% of the time) or enjoying a fleeting pleasure. The temporary satisfaction repeats itself over and over and if we are lucky this cycle of dissatisfaction leads us to not only ask but actively seek the meaning and purpose of life. ",

So the destination to your pleasure is not necessarily as same as mine. Yes we all try to get to the same things in life: good job, money, car, big house ... .

It doesn't necessarily get you an \"ultimate pleasure\" Are you able to experience pleasure without pain? Well, yes, just as much as you can experience pain without pleasure ",
