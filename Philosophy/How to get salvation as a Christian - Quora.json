            "answer_text": "Galatians 2 (KJV) 19 For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. 20 I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. 21 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. Salvation is a free gift offered to all men, by the generous grace of God, through His Son, Jesus Christ. Why do we need saving ? We are all sinners, we all have a carnal nature. The wages of sin if death. But God is longsuffering that even one of us is lost to Him. So He extends to us the free gift of Salvation. This gift is free, meaning that we don\u2019t earn it. In fact nothing we do, our good works, is sufficient to pay for salvation. Jesus paid for this free gift. Salvation is not based on our own works. Salvation is based on the works of Jesus Christ. Salvation is made available to all. There is no favored group of individuals. God doesn\u2019t care about your annual salary, how big your house is, how fancy your car is, nor what brand of clothes you wear. God values one thing, and that is your love and worship of Him. John 3 (KJV) 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. There is only one thing we need in order to be saved. We need to trust and believe in Jesus Christ as Son of God, and Savior. He did the heavy lifting for us. He did the work that we could not do ourselves. We owe our salvation to Father God\u2019s love, generosity and mercy. Father God sent Jesus Christ to earth in order to save the world. Jesus came to live among us, so that He could implement and fulfill Father God\u2019s plan for man\u2019s salvation. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the question, \u201cHow can I get salvation as a Christian?\u201d In the Book of Acts 2, the Apostle Peter said this to the listeners on the Day of Pentecost: \u201cTherefore let all Israel be assured of this: God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.\u201d 37 When the people heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, \u201cBrothers, what shall we do?\u201d 38 Peter replied, \u201cRepent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off\u2014for all whom the Lord our God will call.\u201d Thus salvation is not earned by good works as praying, charity, attending worship services. Peter says salvation comes to a person through repentance and belief in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of one\u2019s sins. Repentance is the acknowledgment that one has lived a life that is contrary to God\u2019s will. It is confessing that one has lived a self-centered life that puts self before God and others. This self-centered life has defiled one\u2019s own conscience and has hurt others immeasurably by one attitude and or actions. This repentance not only acknowledges one\u2019s selfish lifestyle, but turning away from it and turning toward God. This turning to God and belief in him and his salvation can be described in steps. The following steps are as follows: Step 1: There is the belief in the existence of God and that one has offended God by one\u2019s past actions. Step 2: There is the belief that one deserves separation from God due to one\u2019s past actions. Step 3: There is the belief that one God has provided Jesus Christ as the atoning sacrifice for one\u2019s sins. Jesus took my sins upon himself to pay the penalty of my wrongdoings against God. Step 4: There is the asking of God to forgive one of his/her sins and to give him/her a new life. Step 5: There is the asking of God to help him/her in his faith in Jesus Christ through understanding of the Bible by reading, meditating, and studying the Bible personally and in a group setting. Step 6: There is the surrendering of one\u2019s life to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord. This public profession is through water baptism of an already inward belief in Jesus Christ. The Apostle Paul summarizes the salvation message with these words in I Cor. 15, \u201cFor what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 that he was buried,that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that he appeared to Cephas, and then to the Twelve.\u201d He further said this in Eph. 2:8\u20139, \u201cLike the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. 4 But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, 5 made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions\u2014it is by grace you have been saved. 6 And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, 7 in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace,expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. 8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith\u2014and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God\u2014 9 not by works, so that no one can boast. 10 For we are God\u2019s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\u201d SUMMARY: Salvation is ultimately a gift from God. It is turning from self and turning to God and enjoying God forever. ",
