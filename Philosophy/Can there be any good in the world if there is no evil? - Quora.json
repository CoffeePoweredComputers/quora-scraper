            "answer_text": "Approaching this question objectively: First some preliminary observations to consider: The question, as stated, presupposes these relative concepts, which humans variously refer to as \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d.The concepts of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d are abstract, by definition, and how each is perceived is definitely not agreed upon by all humans. Cultures (like our own, which are deeply imbued with religious sentiment, from West to East) have long-held and deeply saturated beliefs about the concepts of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil.\u201d These tend to be more concrete in the minds of adherents than they actually are.The concepts of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d are typically considered polar opposites\u2014in terms of \u201ceither good or evil\u201d\u2014but this is not actually the truth of the matter. Rather, it might be more true to propose that the concepts of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil,\u201d (assuming their existence) reside on opposite ends of a spectrum; thus the concept of relativity is introduced.Whether something is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d depends on how we perceive it. For example, some wholeheartedly believe that to consciously and premeditatively take the life of another human being in the context of capital punishment is essentially a good and just thing to do, whereas others see the same act as evil, equal to murder. The same is true of abortion; or consider even cannibalism, where another farflung culture\u2019s beliefs are concerned, or otherwise where the impossible choice of one\u2019s own life or death might be at hand. Other examples include war, or suicide (with or without assistance by a physician), or the killing of animals for sport (particularly those that are rare or endangered), or \u2018mercy killing,\u2019 ethnic cleansing, euthanasia\u2014the list could go on and on, actually.Whereas we might like to believe that the definitions of \u201cgood\u201d and/vs \u201cevil\u201d ought to be clear and simple, in reality they are not at all. So therein lies our most significant place to start, where answering this question is concerned.\u201cGood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d (or \u201cbad\u201d) are words we learn as children. But what do we actually mean by them? Words are only signifiers, like avatars or icons, which point to and \u2018stand for\u2019 something else that we like to think we agree about, serving our ability to communicate. Thus I suggest that this is where one should start when proposing to answer the question presented here: \u201cCan good exist without evil?\u201dPS: Obviously there is another distinct context in which this question is being asked, that referring to the relative existence of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil,\u201d in the same context as that of others such as big and small, light and dark, tall and short, high and low, fast and slow, etc. Thus the question being asked is: Can our concept of \u201cgood\u201d exist at all if we do not, at the same, hold a concept of \u201cevil,\u201d which we perceive to be relatively the opposite of \u201cgood\u201d? (likewise, could our concept of \u2018big\u2019 exist without our having a relative concept of \u2018small\u2019? etc).I like this question. It is actually a very good one to ponder, given that so much of our daily life and strife as humans is directly related to our beliefs about \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad,\u201d or \u201cevil.\u201d So, what might be your thoughts about what I\u2019ve responded with here, so far? How might one actually go about answering the question? JH.Boise ",

I like how Shakespeare said it - There is nothing good or bad but thinking makes it so. I've been trying to live my life always seeing goodness in everything and all situations. It's very hard, but it seems to be the ultimate personality. The biggest difficulty is by getting close to that personality it makes you pretty wierd. It helps to understand that no one has the right to declare that they have found an ultimate truth. Even the most dedicated scientist understands that their found proof is not perfect and it will likely be modified in the future. Our beliefs are what we think is good. Those beliefs build the reality in which we live, but it's our reality not a universal reality or ultimate goodness. Our job as part of humanity is to share our good opinions, take in others\u2019 good opinions, and adjust our beliefs with the hope of getting closer to the ultimate truth. Bad opinions should be kept to ourselves and worked to be destroyed. Every bad opinion can be converted to a good one. Instead of saying, \u201cI hate that guy\u201d, say you like a certain other guy because of certain traits. Instead of the structural engineer saying that this bridge has cracks, he can say that the overall structure is good for a particular weight. Positive people give good opinions and are honored by others for it. Don't be intimidated by those who promote not expressing all opinions. They are being manipulative and afraid of hearing negative opinions or bad beliefs. Expressing our good beliefs as opinions may just be why we all are here - ultimately! ",

Sophistry, smoke, mirrors and logical fallacies, mates! Allow me to dismantle it for you. Imagine yourself petting a dog. The dog is happy and wags its tail. You\u2019re also happy. That is a simple moment of good.  Does this moment need evil, like murder and ass cancer, to be possible?Does this moment become evil the minute it somehow becomes impossible to beat the dog instead?Is this moment evil in comparison with taking your kids to Disneyland?No. None of the above is true. The only argument you could make is that petting the dog can only exist if an opposite state - not petting the dog - is possible, and that state is \u201cevil\u201d. Indeed, that is the crux of all \u201cgood requires evil\u201d arguments I\u2019ve heard: that evil is the absence of good. To which I once again reply: hogwash! There\u2019s a vast spectrum of neutral and uncomfortable states that cannot be called evil - yet can be improved. Unfulfilled needs only become \u201cevil\u201d in extreme circmstances. Starvation in practice does not happen in developed countries. The people reading this will never experience starvation. We will all experience mild hunger. But mild hunger is not evil. Hunger does not become evil if it is no longer possible to starve. Heck, people often do cleanses or diets and intentionally put themselves through the discomfort of hunger. TLDR There is a vast spectrum of situations where good (or more good) is possible without any evil being present - whether the evil is factual or potential. ",

            "answer_text": "We generally consider Evil to be the opposite of Good. But for our purposes here, let\u2019s simply consider it an alternative. That is, they\u2019re still mutually exclusive, but there may be other possible things to be. Now let\u2019s consider something else that a thing could be: salty. Salty means \u201chaving salt or the flavor of salt.\u201d So, salty is something that a food could be. Food could also be bitter, or sweet, or sour. But let\u2019s say that humans never developed the senses of bitter or sweet or sour. Let\u2019s say that all we could detect was salt. Does that mean that \u201csalty\u201d no longer exists? Since it\u2019s all we understand, we wouldn\u2019t call it salty, since there is nothing else it could be. We may not even recognize that there\u2019s a possibility for food to be anything other than salty. But none of that changes the fact that the food has (the flavor of) salt. The food is salty, regardless of our perception. Of course, Good and Evil are less quantifiable concepts, but the point is the same. Without Evil, we may not recognize Good, and we likely would not have a name for it, since that\u2019s all there is. But that wouldn\u2019t change the fact that Good would still exist. ",

Things may be labeled good. Obviously you don\u2019t need the label \u201cevil.\u201d It sort of seems a bit cockeyed to have a label \u201cgood\u201d and not a label \u201cevil,\u201d but humans do cockeyed things every day. Sometimes we elect a loony psychopathic thug to national office, so go figure. But- but- but don\u2019t you have some sort of objective state of being, called \u201cgood,\u201d and isn\u2019t it the exact antithesis of an objective state of being, called\u201cevil?\u201d Uh, no. Here\u2019s why. \u201cGood\u201d is a label we use for things we choose to call good. However, I just spouted nonsense. \u201cWE\u201d don\u2019t label something good or evil. You may do it, and I may do it, and Joe Rosenschmuck across the street may do it, and guess what? Our three definitions of good and of evil will be three different things. It might be that they are very, very similar, but they are different. Each of us has different experiences, different expectations, maybe even some off-the-wall biases that skew our perceptions. Anyway, no, there is no objective state of being called evil or good. We simply apply the labels, and for each of us, those labels mean just what we decide they mean, crazy thought that may sound. So since \u201cgood\u201d is merely a label, then sure, you can have \u201cgood\u201d and not have evil \u2014 technically. Since part of the definition of both terms usually relates directly to the other, however, it might be hard to pull that off. Am I getting at what you are trying to find out at all? ",

When I first read/heard it, I felt that sentence didn't quite make sense: how can good people become evil once evil is removed? But then, if one were to look at good and evil as on a scale from left to right with evil being on the left, and good being on the right end, and you remove evil from the scale, what would we have left? We would have the remaining good on a shorter scale from left to right, with the good on the left being the \"lesser good\". Might this lesser good become the \"new evil\"? Of course, this is assuming that good and evil exist on the same scale (judged upon the same criterion), and that there is no zero point *separating the positive from the negative. My example aside, I think good can exist without evil. If we could remove all the darkness and evil from all our minds and hearts, the world would be a much, much better place to live. An ideal world based on love and mutual respect for one another. But some might argue that good and bad can be relative, e.g. A good bottle of wine can only be called \"good\" based on how much better it is compared to bad-tasting wine. But then this should only be applicable to some situations, and not for good and evil in the moral sense. In this case, an act of kindness or compassion can be considered good on its own, without comparing it something malicious. So long story short, I do think good can exist without evil, but the question is: can evil be removed from this world? ",

To a Christian the notion of morality logically comes into play and, of course, the matter of an elevated sence of self awareness in relation to everyone else and everything else, concequences, futurity and the list could continue no doubt. The simple answer to me would be a definite no. One might conclude that everything could be cosidered equally good or that everything would be good in varying degrees which would mean that everything would be relative and nothing would be evil. To a Christian that would make no sense. That is why Christians believe that love of God and neighbor is so important. That is why the true Christian strongly believes in hating the evil people may do but love and forgive the sinner with appropriate concequenses. A tall but necessary order, an order that is probably impossible to do in real time without love in your heart. Amen. ",

            "answer_text": "A sound is a good thing, but a musical note is better. A musical note is good, but a chord is better, A chord is good, but a tune is better. A tune is good, but a musical theme is better. A musical theme is good, but a symphony is better. And so on. Goodness is a constructive concept. There is no a priori limit to the degree in which phenomena can be good. And the degree of goodness can be determined without any reference to evil. The good can exist without evil. The reverse is not true. Evil is a corruption of the good, and cannot exist independently of it. The notion that evil is the opposite of the good is dangerous, for it leads people to try to achieve the good by means of the elimination of evil. This doesn\u2019t work, because it does not help to achieve higher levels of goodness. A tune, removed of evil, will still be a tune and not a theme. Not only do attempts to achieve good by eliminating evil not work, they generally result in less good. For the energy we apply in order to eliminate evil cannot be used to achieve the good. Even worse, the elimination of one evil often leads to - or even requires - other evils. Jesus of Nazareth taught his followers not to resist evil, but to devote their energy to achieving the good. The United States, as a professedly Christian country, should apply his teaching, and stop the un-Christian and evil practice of imprisoning large parts of its population. Maybe it will then truly become the good society that it aims to be. ",

But in the afterlife (heaven), our sin nature will be removed by God. So there will be good without evil. God will remove this sin nature for all who ask Him to. Those who ask Him to are those people who have accepted Jesus Christ into their lives. We were created by God to be perfect. But we chose to sin. We are now born with a sin nature. People are not sinners because they sin. We sin because we\u2019re sinners. At the 2nd Coming of Christ, our sin nature will be removed from us, so all that is left is our good, godly nature. It\u2019s not quite as simple as this but this is a good way of explaining it. ",

            "answer_text": "Good and evil are predicated on the intent of the actor.  An event itself is neither good nor evil, it simply is.  The intent behind the action (if indeed there is any) would be considered good or evil.  A school full of children has a gas line rupture and explode, burning everyone inside to death.  There was no evil done, although that makes it no less tragic.  If a person purposely set fire to the school with the intent to burn everyone inside, that act would be evil, whether or not anyone actually burned.  Then, if a teacher ran back into the burning building with the intent to save people, that act would be good, because the intent was good.  If a person ran back into the building to make sure the doors and windows were all locked so that no one could escape, even if he did not find any doors or windows to lock before once again fleeing the building, the act would be evil, even though the action and the result were the same as when the teacher ran back to save students and found no one, thereby escaping the building empty-handed. Good and evil are not relative to one another.  There can be good in the world without the presence of evil to which it can be compared, and vice versa.  The intent, if any, would be absolute, and that is where one would find good or evil or both. ",

One would have too assume that we still have the freedom to choose between the good and evil and we choose good.  If we are all programmed robots and have no choice in the matter then good and evil would be irrelevant.  Given the choice though, if people always chose good over evil then there is good and no evil.  For example we dont need to murder someone to know its evil, if we all choose not to murder someone then there is no evil of murder, if instead we choose to help someone who needs help that is good.  Example if we choose to help someone up when they fall down that is good.  Again this all assumes free will, if I know I can kick the person is down but I always choose to help them up, it is good. I assume here that murder most simply put would be defined as killing someone for fun. ",

If we were to eliminate everything that was \"evil\" from the world, people would then begin to discriminate between things that were \"really\" good, and things that were \"not so\" good.  And... those things that weren't really all that good, but definitely not evil before, would become the new evil. That's the thing about opposites.  You have to have both, if you want to be able to distinguish between them.  Otherwise, if there is only one, there would be no concept of the other.  Good would be meaningless if everything was \"good\".  If everything was \"good\"... then everything would just be.  It wouldn't be good. So yes.

            "answer_text": "That is an interesting question. The quick response would likely be to say \"no\" based on the assumption that good and evil are merely two counterbalancing forces; or perhaps two sides of the same thing. I believe that that assumption would likely be wrong. Stealing something from a hotel room is wrong or evil. But millions of people stay in hotels every day; andl leave without stealing anything, it is certainly a good thing, but it seems a stretch to hold as a virtue opposite of stealing, simply because it is what is expected of a human. A person can be charitable and quick to lend a helping hand - a clear virtue. On the hand many people are not that generous, without being labeled evil. I believe that good and evil stand on their own, and in any given period a community may have an abundance of one and sparcity of another. On occasion they may balance each other out, but that is an incidental finding and not because good and evil must do so. A given society's highest achievement is an eradication of evil and a voluntary adoption of good; and that is also the teaching of most religions. ",

In the vast majority of the things surrounding us we only see reflected light coming off of them. If our eyes could see the light from the energy being given off from everything around us could we legitimately describe anything as darkness in and of itself? Which brings us back to the question can good exist without evil? Can good only be described in terms of comparison or can it also be defined as an entity on its own apart from comparison? Another example; God describes Himself as good in the bible. Is that description a matter of comparison or ? ",

But I'm not sure how much we've learned from this observation.  \"Good\" and \"evil\" are ill-defined categories, with vast amounts of overlap, subject to both point of view and hard-to-measure notions like \"intention\" and \"long-term ramifications\".   I suppose it shows that evil and good aren't equal and opposite.  The world is not a zero-sum game.  We can do things to make it better, and we can do things to make it worse.  It's not necessary for something to be able to be made worse in order to make it better.  That seems pretty obvious to me, and makes me wonder why one would even want to ask the question. ",

They came into being simultaneously, because one doesn't exist without the other. It's always been like this. We may never rid the world of wickedness, but it gives us appreciation for the good. Sometimes the comparison is the motivation we need to do better. A bad example can be as useful for learning as a good one, mostly in the form of a cautionary tale. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. Light exists, and the absence of light or less light is referred to as darkness or \u201cdark\u201d. But darkness is not a counter-force, there is no carrier particle or wave or negative energy at work. Heat exists, and the absence of it is referred to as cold. But there is no such force as negative heat. When it is cold out, or even if there was an absolute zero of heat, that isn\u2019t a different and opposing force at work. That is just less or no heat. People can be very good, more good, less good, not very good at all, or totally immoral. But there is no counter-force, no negative good. Evil is a myth.

            "answer_text": "Religously speaking yes. It depends on your definition. In the Bible, good is described as the Creator/Supreme Being, and evil is described as opposition/antagonism to that Supreme Being. So yes, completely possible to have good without evil. Atheistically speaking, I don\u2019t think it is possible because Good and evil have no reference point and are essentially up to the beholder. Good and evil is just a scale of acceptability that can shift to the left or to the right at any second with the right environment. A more accurate statement for an atheist perspective is: CAN there be good or evil at all? ",

Bad is the opposite phase. Now, If you dont grow towards others you wont feel \u201cfriction\u201d and \u201cdifficulty\u201d meaning there is no real bad maybe, but is there good when there is no growth ? also depends the perspective and the ((spiritual) size of )world you want to live or correct or defend. in the spiritual world (the mirror) you have egypt and babylon. A land of ignorance and a land of conquering. They both symbolise other ways of bad. In the same way you have the beasts of the sea and the land. One of growth and one of ignorance. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, without a doubt! The argument that good needs evil in order for it to be defined, and enjoyed, is an argument I have heard in certain religious circles, and I think it\u2019s pure hogwash! First of all, the concept that the opposite of good is evil is false information and a logical error. Good and evil are false polar opposites. A good definition for good is sharing. The opposite of sharing is receiving for the self alone. So the opposite of good is extreme selfishness, not evil. True evil, such as terrorism, is destruction. The world does not need cruelty, misery and destruction so that opportunities for sharing can be created. Opportunities for sharing always exist. It is possible to live in a prosperous, peaceful society that has solved all of its problems, and where evil does not exist, and still do acts of sharing. Sharing is as much needed and appreciated in a country like Denmark or Canada, as it is in Syria. You do not need war and other forms of evil to practice and enjoy sharing.

I have been all over the world and seen some dark things, and seen some things that will grant me hope forever.  I truly believe that 99% of the time this is a matter of semantics. The definitions have ranged widely from culture to religion throughout human history. In the end you can pull out the \"universal evils\" as those that are a detriment to any society, and are therefore programmed in out of necessity. Even those regarded as the ultimate examples of good; Ghandi, Dr. King, Mother Theresa, etc. These were people who preached non-violence under any condition, a concept that is very foreign and difficult to understand here in America. So I find that most here who do praise them either do so for standing up for something so strange and foreign, or do so because it is the current cultural norm. And little regard is given to the actual goodness of the lives they led. I personally disregard these words in my daily life.  I have a personal belief system that is my own, and ultimately I am accountable only unto myself, like any person. S I do my best to make sure I can sleep at night, and when I cant. Its time to re-evaluate. ",

Good can be universally recognized as a conscious intent to promote the well-being of others, and evil as a conscious intent to maliciously harm others. Although they may be opposites, does one truly need to exist for the other to exist? Good can exist without evil, and vice versa, evil can exist without good. Orchestrating a genocidal famine does not need altruism to exist in order to be implemented, nor does the intent of freely giving to the less fortunate need intentional malice to exist to place them into such destitution. And where does that put indifference or neutrality? Simply by not killing people, does that mean you're good? Simply by minding your own business and not going door to door making sure your neighbor is safe and secure, does that mean you're evil? ",

Good and evil will always exist as existential concepts, and it\u2019s true that the existential concept of good means that an existential concept of evil also must exist. But evil does not have to be active in the world in order for there to be good. If goodness is everywhere, then it just means that evil will have been placed into remission. For instance, if the world is safe and secure, then you can still show affection to others, fall in love, etc. etc. and do everything else good and positive. ",
