            "answer_text": "Are there any recent classical theories of consciousness that supports the mind is a product of brain 'monism' and falsifies 'Orch OR' theory of quantum mind and dualism? Theories don\u2019t support or falsify things like that - theories make predictions, which can then falsify something. So - if a theory makes a prediction different than what \u201cmind is a product of brain monism\u201d predicts, then testing that will support one prediction and falsify the other prediction (unless of course some *other* result is found, falsifying both of them). At that point, people supporting the theory whose prediction just got falsified get to either fix their theory so it predicts the now-established result, or toss it in the dumpster and follow it with a Molotov cocktail. For the record, at the current time, nobody reputable thinks \u201cquantum mind\u201d is anything other than \u201cquantum woo\u201d - we\u2019re quite sure that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon having to do with the number of neurons and their interconnections, not quantum mechanics.

            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t really necessary to falsify Orch OR theory since there is no supporting evidence. It exists as a rather fanciful conjecture and little else. And dualism as a theory is even worse than Orch OR. All of the evidence supports the idea that consciousness is created by the operation of a brain. ",
