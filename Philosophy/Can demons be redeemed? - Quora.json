            "answer_text": "No. Because God did not create them. And no, they are not fallen angels. As angels have their own celestial body and do not need to inhabit a body. (Many times The Bible shows God's holy angels as human men. Look at the story about the 2 angels God-sent to retrieve LOT and his family out of the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. If they did not look like human men, why did the men of the cities surround LOTs house demanding that LOT give them the 2 men, so that they could have sexual relations with them? AND scripture says even lucifer can appear an an angel of light, telling us he has another fallen ugly state as well. 2 Corinthians 11:14. And don't forget Hebrews 13:2 tells us Do Not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, because some have entertained angels unaware. Again proving that even God's holy angels will take on a human form. So why would Genesis chapter 6 angels not be able to do so?) Demons is a term to describe the disembodied spirits of the nephilim. The fallen angel offspring. (Genesis ch 6 Shows us that the sons of God, AKA angels, looked down upon the daughters of men, AKA human's. They went to them, so they willingly left heaven, they took wives and had babies, the giants in those days. When the human body dies they become a disembodied \u201cunclean spirit\u201d that can now possess human beings.) I believe these angels did it AGAIN after the flood. And are the 1s condemned in Jude 1:6. Since they *moved out without notice. Different group from lucifer and the one third *evicted from heaven and were cast down to earth. Now you see God didn't create them. And they're abominations. They're half human half fallen angel. So they have an immortal spirit but it's unclean and there's nowhere for it to go. They don't have wings. So they wander around looking for a body (without the Holy Spirit) to inhabit. Read Genesis ch 6 and even the book of Enoch! Enoch \u2026 Was the father of Methuselah and the great grandfather of Noah. He walked with God. And he was one of only 2 people ever to be translated into heaven, never tasting death. This is why I believe he and Elijah, will be the 2 witnesses that come back, spoken about in the book of Revelation. Now does it make more sense why Holy Spirit conceived Jesus Christ the messiah in a Virgin? And Mary comes from king David's bloodline as she is a descendant. Plus Jesus was born in the \u201ccity of David\u201d. And who is David? Well he is a famous giant killer\u2026the offspring the seed of Satan. Even Genesis 3:15 describes the serpent will have offspring! Before Jesus there was not 1 human relieved of demons. Humanity has dominion over the 1st heaven which is the sky that we can see. Demons roam the Earth. Fallen angels are in the 2nd heaven which we know as outer space. Celestial bodies. God and the holy angels are in the 3rd heaven which is above space and time over to the North. So the fallen angels the principalities the powers (read Ephesians 6:12,) are conveniently placed between humanity and God to block blessings and prayers. We also see this in the book of Daniel. P.S One answer here, prompted you to look into becoming what their religion is. I am not going to advertise my faith or doctrine to you. Here is what you need to ask for yourself. Does the prescence of the God of Israel Gods Holy Spirit show up in the church? Are people being healed in Jesus name? Are miracles seen and done in Jesus name? Are demons being cast out in Jesus name? If you can't answer yes to all these questions, they are not teaching full truth or truly following the gospel of Jesus. This is what you want to test. God bless you! ",

            "answer_text": "No. They cannot be redeemed. We are talking about perfect angels, who have known the just and loving Creator, Father, God, who made them, and gave them everything. They have served him happily for aeons of time before the tempter, Satan, seduced them to do base things and go down to earth taking fleshly bodies and have sex, most of the times violent rapes they were, with earthly women, which was not theirs to take. Women were exclusively created for men, and not for angels! You have to realise that these angels had a perfect mind and a perfect balance they had mentally, emotionally and spiritually. They had perfect spirit bodies and everything was perfect and beautiful about them, they got everything that they could have ever needed in abundance. They were personally acquainted and loved by their Creator, their Father, and they were given all that could make them happy. Yet, when one of them turned evil and tuned into the Devil, he slandered God and told these angels that something was withheld from them, and their Father was actually mean and the thing he withheld was: sex with earthly women. He told them they can also be gods to feeble humans and do whatever they want. This appealed to many of them and they forsook God and sided with Satan. Stupid or greedy whatever they were they accepted and did what Satan suggested to them and they lost perfection were condemned to death immediately,only their sentence is going to be carried out a lot later, in about a millenium of more time. They willingly became Satan\u2019s slaves, and he gave them human dominions and the rule invisibly from behind, they are the Princes of this world, a few of them the bible mentions, such as the Prince of Persia, a demon ruler of Persia, but there are the others for every country, they rule the world and people here on earth. They cannot take fleshly bodies, but sadly they can still inhabit men and women, they can invisibly move into them, and make them do horrific things. They also influence those, who are on the lookout to meet the spirit world, who searh the occult, who disobey God, and want to have a relationship with these fallen angels. These are then puppets in their hands and they start and make wars, they are used in politics and they are still seducing people to harm each other in every possible way. They, demons, taught humans homosexuality and bestiality they taught them to abuse their spouses and other people they taught people t be haughty and disagreeable and even evil. Fallen people have a tendency to be all that, but only those can be used well, who give in to their evil inclinations. They become perfect tools in the hands of the Devil and his demons to damage other living things, animals, plants and other humans.These are those, who torture people, animals, and burn up forests for fun, and are careless and harmful for all living things. Do you think for all their evil influence and their evil actions: they can be redeemed? No, they are not humans. Humans are imperfect in a different sense, and so they have hope and they can be redeemed, if they change their thinking their mentality their attitudes and their words and actions. What the real questions is: do you want to be redeemed? Because it is your life that is in the balance. Do not mind angels it is nto really your business, but your life is. Do you want to be saved? Do you want ot live a peaceful life on Paradise earth rid of demosn? Do you want to live on a planet that is being healed and cleasned and whose ruler is Jesus Christ by the grace of God Almighty? If you do, do nto hesitate to ask for a bible study from Jehovah\u2019s witnesses or online on jw. org. Invest into your future life and your happiness, care not for demons! ",

            "answer_text": "Hi, this is actually a really good question. Within Church Theology within both the Eastern and Western traditions the answer is no. Demons are Angels that for one reason or another rebelled against God and since they can\u2019t take out their anger on God they take it out on what they can hurt to hurt God emotionally, us. In the Orthodox tradition there is a Saint whom I cannot remember the name of who prayed for demons nightly that they may give up their evil and return to God, as far as I remember the story going an Angel appeared to him in a vision along with seven dog skulls floating laughing at him and mocking him, the Angel praised him for his love even offering it to demons but he said the demons are not worthy of his love. Unlike humans who are beings of flesh and have only been around for a few million years, Angels are beings that have been around for a period of time we cannot comprehend and are beings made of pure consciousness and thus are held to higher standards than us. In the West too a Priest performing an exorcism supposedly asked the demons oppressing a woman if they regretted rebelling against God, and they said yes and then he asked if they would do it again, and they also said yes.

Remember the part where the word of God says (Jesus) \u201cthat the ruler of this world has already been judged.\u201d All the fallen angels are under and on the side of satan. Judgement was passed unto them along with satan. Demons can't be redeemed. They are the evil spirits that Jesus casts out of those who are suffering because of them. A spirit cannot be redeemed. God is a God of the living not the dead\u2026..those who belong to the light not the darkness. And also I want you to look at this those who die without receiving and acceptung Christ cannot be redeemed to God for their time to do that has passed. They are now no longer alive in the flesh and are now spirits. A spirit cannot be redeemed. ",
