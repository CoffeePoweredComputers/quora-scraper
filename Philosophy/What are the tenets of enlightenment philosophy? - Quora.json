            "answer_text": "Definition of terms: Enlightenment Philosophy is an accepted technical term to refer to Western Philosophy from about 1600 to about 1800. It begins with the rapid rise of Natural Science against the censorship of the Catholic Church. It developed further in competition with the Protestant Churches. It boasts many famous writers, including Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hobbes, Rousseau, Voltaire, Locke, Jefferson, Franklin, and many others. Its main feature remained its strident challenge to Church authority, and it still has this flavor today. The main idea is that everything can be explained by Natural Science and Analytic Reason. Its main weakness, in my reading, was its inability to provide a consensus theory of Ethics, Morality and Politics. Instead we were left with two opposite tendencies: (1) the theory of Rousseau that the State of Nature is Good but human society corrupted it; and (2) the theory of Hobbes that the State of Nature is Evil, and that human society is our only salvation.
