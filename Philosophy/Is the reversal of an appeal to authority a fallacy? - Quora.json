            "answer_text": "By \u201creversal\u201d, you could mean (a) an appeal to non-authoritative source, or you could mean (b) an appeal to the non-authority of the sources. There is a subtle difference here which makes a difference. In (a), you could appeal to non-authoritative sources like logic or science. These are non-authoritative in the sense that they are not experts in a subject like a logician or scientist might be. They use publicly accessible methods, when used by anyone, can be used to arrive at the same conclusions. This is not a fallacy in and of itself. It\u2019s really what Descartes\u2019 was trying to develop with his epistemology and philosophy of science. In spirit, it is an attempt to find public justificatory methods for knowledge not based on some private authority. As with any informal fallacy, (a) depends on context of use. In the wrong context, it could be fallacious. So suppose that I propose that if there is no publicly accessible justificatory method to approve or disapprove some claim, then that claim is not true. Well, there is no publicly accessible justificatory method to approve or disapprove that proposal. On a foundational level, (a) does not provide its own epistemic justification. Now (b) is almost always a fallacy I think, and the source of \u2018conspiracy theories\u2019. Because it\u2019s current and socially relevant, I think of the alt right in the US today who believe in all sorts of crazy ideas seemingly entirely on the basis of their extreme distrust of authority. You can\u2019t trust someone like Hilary Clinton, who has made a career of developing expertise in politics, precisely because of her expertise (add \u2018the deep state\u2019 conspiracy theory to it to make it sound more plausible, which itself is developed as a worst case authoritarian scenario). Look at the distrust of climate change deniers in the authority of scientists on scientific topics. They are likely the same people who don\u2019t want biological evolution taught to their children in schools, or had parents who didn\u2019t want to teach them biological evolution. They have no knowledge themselves of how co-evolved ecosystems work and don\u2019t work. In an argument, if you make any scientifically based claim, they are automatically skeptical. It\u2019s a knee-jerk reaction. That\u2019s most certainly a fallacy. Unlike an argument from authority, it\u2019s an argument from anti-authority. Again, it depends on context. Suppose you live in a (real) authoritarian state where the actual state media is known to report false events. Suppose also that you know that 90% of their reporting is false. In that case, it would be reasonable to infer the opposite of whatever they say. Obviously this would not be a very effective method for the state media, which is probably a good reason to argue that this kind of state media would not really happen. But if it were the case, in this context, (b) would not be a fallacy. Again, as with all informal fallacy (any one which is not necessarily logically invalid), context of use is most relevant to determining its relevance. Without discussing it with others, and getting their feedback on its relevance in the context of use, and using general common sense, there\u2019s no easy way to determine when an informal argument is a fallacy and when it is not. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t focus too much on fallacies in arguments. I focus on developing the context and the utility of my claims within that context, then make sure my inferences from them are deductively or inductively valid. ",

            "answer_text": "With respect to the other writers, I don\u2019t view this as a fallacy. Logic is a system of rules for the evaluation of arguments. An argument, in turn, is a series of connected statement intended to lead the listener or to reason from that which we know to that which we do not. A classic argument is a syllogism such as: \u201cAll banks accept deposits of negotiable instruments. The First National Bank of North Podunk is a bank. Therefore, the First National Bank of North Podunk accepts deposits of negotiable instruments.\u201d A \u201cfallacy\u201d is the result when one of the rules of logic is violated in the construction of the argument, thereby rendering it invalid. Note that invalid is not necessarily \u201cfalse,\u201d but merely insufficient to prove the point. When the parent dismisses the statement of the child, he or she is not making an argument because he is not constructing a chain of reasoning. Rather, the parent is doing something quite different, making an \u201cevaluation of a witness credibility.\u201d Remember, an argument structures a series of statements to proceed from that which is known to that which is unknown. The statements themselves must be known to be true or must be assumed to be true in order to make the argument function. On the other hand, we have a child simply stating a purported fact\u2014that there\u2019s a killer under his bed. We don\u2019t know whether this statement is true or not, and the child is adducing no argument in support, merely offering his testimony. Accordingly, the parent does what sensible people in the real world do with testimony\u2014they make a determination of whether to believe the child\u2019s statement based on age, intelligence, the child\u2019s record for truth and veracity, etc. This is not a \u201cfallacy,\u201d but a perfectly valid kind of reasoning\u2014it is simply not \u201clogic.\u201d It is the analysis of evidence, which is an entirely different discipline.
