Since the physical created heavens could not contain him no more than a painter who created a painting of outer space, could live in his own creation . see1st kings 8:27 He created the spirit world God being the only one who was alive with nothing before him to create him thus the reason he is titled The creator and not the created. psalms 90:2 And he being throughly complete in himself lacking nothing was never ever lonely, is omniscient and omnipotent but not omnipresent , could accomplish such a feat as creating a spirit world heaven called the 3rd heaven, the heaven of heavens Deuteronomy 10:14 which would be independent of and beyond the two yet physical heavens he was going to create sometime after his creating the spirit heavens for his and his future yet to be future creations called superhuman spirit angelic sons of God Job 38:7 Revelation 5:11 for their dwelling place as well. see 1st kings 8:43 They were created by the one described as the very personification of love 1st John 4:8 the Great Jehovah who gave the gift of life to those who he knew would appreciate it.
