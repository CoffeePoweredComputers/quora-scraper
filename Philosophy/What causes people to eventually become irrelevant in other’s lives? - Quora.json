            "answer_text": "That is funny you asked, I have been thinking about that very thing. I have only come up with three possibilities that only my own experiences have taught and /or are teaching me as we speak. People can grow apart as each of them has other roads they need to travel with their families and closest of friends. As a result the distance grows and becomes insurmountable to overcome. There are no anger or odd issues, just ain't different paths.Issues between parties could not be resolved and each chose other roads to follow. Sometimes as you get older, you run across bformer friends and seem resolve difference. It seems afterwards it was all lip service to evade truly resolving differences.Sometimes God puts us in people's lives for reasons unknow. Someone is to learn a lesson, one or both. I struggle with wondering what I am to learn, or how can I help the other. I have to console myself to the philosophy of my God will tell me when he is ready. In his time, not mine. I wish I had more to give you to go own. I guess the gist is, there are many reasons and I believe number 3 is closer to reality than anything. Good luck.",
