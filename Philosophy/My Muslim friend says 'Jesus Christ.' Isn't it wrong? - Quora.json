            "answer_text": "Christ is Almasih in Arabic, we indeed, all of us, believe that Jesus is the Messiah. He has a distinct role in the coming times that is well described by the final prophet, as he is one of the major signs of the impendence of the day of judgement. My brother saw that he came down and me and him and a third brother of ours were going to follow him. this is a verse from the Quran: And remember when the angels said, \"O Mary, God sends you the good news of a Command of His: his name shall be Messiah, Jesus son of Mary. He will be highly honored in this world and in the Next World and he will be among those favored by God. He will speak to the people alike when in the cradle and when grown up, and he will be among the righteous.\" Hearing this, Mary said, \"How, O Lord, shall I have a son, when no man has ever touched me?\" \"Thus shall it be,\" 44 was the answer. God creates whatever He wills. When He decrees a thing, He only says, \"Be\" and it is. (Continuing their message, the angels added,) \"And God will teach him the Book and wisdom, and give him the knowledge of the Torah and the Gospel, and appoint him as His Messenger to the children of Israel.\" Quran 3:45-49 ",

But [none the less] it is unclean (defiled and unholy) to anyone who thinks it is unclean. But if your brother is being pained or his feelings hurt or if he is being injured by what you eat, [then] you are no longer walking in love. [You have ceased to be living and conducting yourself by the standard of love toward him.] Do not let what you eat hurt or cause the ruin of one for whom Christ died! Do not therefore let what seems good to you be considered an evil thing [by someone else]. [In other words, do not give occasion for others to criticize that which is justifiable for you.] [After all] the kingdom of God is not a matter of [getting the] food and drink [one likes], but instead it is righteousness (that state which makes a person acceptable to God) and [heart] peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. So let us then definitely aim for and eagerly pursue what makes for harmony and for mutual upbuilding (edification and development) of one another. You must not, for the sake of food, undo and break down and destroy the work of God! Everything is indeed [ceremonially] clean and pure, but it is wrong for anyone to hurt the conscience of others or to make them fall by what he eats. The right thing is to eat no meat or drink no wine [at all], or [do anything else] if it makes your brother stumble or hurts his conscience or offends or weakens him.\u201d Romans\u202c 14:14-17, 19-21\u202c AMPC\u202c\u202c ",
