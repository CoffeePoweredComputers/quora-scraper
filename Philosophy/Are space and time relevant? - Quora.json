            "answer_text": "Very, very relevant, but they are only relevant if we define them properly, otherwise we run into the problems associated with Quantum and Einstein\u2019 Relativity. To define them properly, we must first ask the philosophical question about if they exist. If they don\u2019t exist, then what are they? My conclusions are that they do not exist, but there is an inherent reality to them, therefore, I will not say they exist, but that they are real. I will take the stance that they do not exist, which appears to be the road less traveled. Most physicists and philosophers alike will tell you definitively that SPACE and TIME exist since they can be altered by matter. Einstein, though he made the statement that TIME is relative, still acknowledges an existence to SPACE and TIME by the creation of the equally mathematical space-time. If space-time can be altered, then it must exist, you can not change what does not exist. His theory falls apart if SPACE and TIME do not exist as I propose. Determining the existence or non-existence of SPACE and TIME is a philosophical problem, whose lack of definitive conclusions on that level are then leaked into physical description of reality. What most people don\u2019t understand is that Einstein\u2019s Relativity is 75% a philosophical problem, and 25% a physical problem. The problem arises by the process of reification, a term I did not know of until recently, however, it explained the problem I was trying to solve. I wished to understand better the existence of SPACE and TIME and discovered that people were converting concepts to existants, which is the fundamental act of reification (example: Mother Nature). For myself, I had come to the philosophical conclusion that SPACE and TIME do not exist. They are merely CONCEPTUAL and are identifiable as such by the fact that they require a RELATIONSHIP in which to define them - that relationship is based on the basic level by the mental creation of a relationship between two objects/atoms/matter or two events. Matter in all forms exists, however, how we categorize and RELATE them is still merely conceptual. The philosophical position I take in saying that there is ONLY matter (in all forms) that exist can be called materialism. In the philosophy of materialism, things such as motion, events, consciousness, SPACE/distance, and TIME do not exist but a conceptual a means to explain the interactions of matter that creates our reality. A materialist would say that events are \u201creal\u201d, they lead to real effects, but do not exist, but the matter that \u201ccreates\u201d the event exists. What it requires is to separate the matter from the events, to deal with their characteristics in our \u201creality\u201d. It is not a contradiction to take this stance and it is quite important, I acknowledge that there is a need to distinguish between what exists, matter, and the concepts we derive from their relationships. I still acknowledge that things are actually in motion relative to each other, that when a force is applied they accelerate, and that there is something to consciousness, and the very real importance to understanding what me mean by SPACE and TIME since they are essential tools for relating our reality. They are all based on the existence of matter and that it interacts. The interaction of matter, and its inherent co-existence creating relationships are what are concepts are derived from. In fact, these interactions are the source of all of our sensory input, from which we make judgements about our reality and our consciousness. The term SPACE is derived from the reality that things in the Universe are not all in one place: not a singularity. SPACE is not composed of matter, it is the absence of matter. We do not detect it, we judge it from a lack of detection. And when we discuss SPACE we usually mean distance, which requires two endpoints to define, again a relationship. To have a word like SPACE is purely conceptual, since there is actually no tangible thing to observe to define it, it is defined as the absence of something we do know - matter. It is a negative judgement if you will, similar to a shadow, silence, a hole, etc. TIME likewise is conceptual and a judgement. From a series of observations, at least two, we make the judgement \u201cTIME has passed\u201d. If nothing moved, we could not judge TIME, if nothing changed, motion being an example of relative change, we could not create a relationship to base a judgement. If nothing moved, we would also have no means of observation, since light, a type of matter in motion would never reach us to excite our senses and that makes up the bulk of how our observation are done scientifically. For both SPACE and TIME we have created standards, which stand in as essentially \u201cabsolute concepts\u201d since they define a strict relationship, a standard relationship: this strictly defined relationship will result in virtually identical results for the same experiment. It is by comparison of a different relationship than the standard relationship, that the Relativity of TIME is judged, once again not experienced. Relativity is the result of a comparison of two results from two different perspectives, usually the comparison is done to the standard. This is why it is important to understand the concepts SPACE and TIME and the most important being that they are relative because they are dependent on a relationship. A single piece of matter does not need another piece of matter for it to exist, it is not a relationship. It is the building block for relationships. The reason the MEASUREMENT of SPACE and TIME are relative, leading to Relativity, is because any time you change the relationship to the same event, a different observation or measurement is obtained, which creates a different type of detection and therefore reality. Matter is therefore absolute, while reality is relative to a consciousness. The key point to make is that the effects created by the interaction and motion of matter creates a definitive event, however, how that event is observed can be altered by the perspective of the observer. It is only the MEASUREMENT that is altered relative to another, not the event that is being observed. If an observation requires the establishment of a relationship, then Relativity is a relationship between relationships, again relative.. Hopefully, though not a perfect presentation, this is clear enough to give you the idea that though SPACE and TIME do not exist, they are very important for characterizing our reality and the matter that exists. and with a proper definition show why Relativity can exist among our observations. (As a note, I would like to bring attention to Bill Haede, who is one of the only others on Quora who is also tackling this problem when we reificate, and compliment him on that. This is the initial drive for myself too. Who got it right? Only time will tell.) ",

In a way, they are only talking points; they aren\u2019t in the math equations (the dimensional values are but the concepts are not) so these talking points aren\u2019t relevant for making predictions, but they do serve a real purpose when teaching the subjects that the equations are relevant to.
