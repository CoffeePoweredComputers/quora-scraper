            "answer_text": "As I understand it you are referring to Service, as in the hospitality industry. There can be no greater principle in life than serving others with grace and favour. However, this is not an easy task I believe as others expectations can be very high, some people can be rather demanding, impolite and rude, and to balance good ethics and exemplary behaviour when offering service to others, when others are being less than fair and empathetic to your position, can be a very big ask.
