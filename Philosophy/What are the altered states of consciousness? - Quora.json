            "answer_text": "Well, I'd think there is a significantly altered state for most drugs legal and illigal. Sensory input like music, video, and others would count too. Biology and environment would also cause altered states so there'd be at least one different state for all 7+ billion of us.

You probably felt drunk at least once, or woozy from the dentist\u2019s gassing you; that is another. Others include from meditation or hallucinations. You can also feel \u201cflow\u201d when you are fully engrossed in some activity. There are many types. ",
