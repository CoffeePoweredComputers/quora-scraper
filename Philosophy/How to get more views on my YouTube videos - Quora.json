            "answer_text": "In order to properly answer your question, I feel compelled to divide into two parts: organic techniques and paid techniques.  Building YouTube subscriber (viewer) list organically: 1. Pinging - The very first thing you should do after uploading a video is go to www.pingler.com. In the space provided under \u201cwebsite name or title\u201d, type in the title of your video. Fill in the videos URL. Select a category. Enter the CAPTCHA and click on the \u201cping my site\u201d button.Amongst other things, pinging informs the search engines that there is new content available for indexing. 2. Commenting - Commenting on other people\u2019s videos can have a major impact on the amount of views your videos and profile receive. But the first thing you should do after uploading a video is be the first to comment on it! (yes, comment on your own video) This will encourage others to follow along.I have not seen many bloggers or marketers do this but it can dramatically increase the amount of comments and ratings your video receives. Just saying something simple such as \u201cPlease tell me what you think\u2026 leave a comment\u201d or \u201cGive me some feedback\u2026 leave a comment and rate the video\u201d can have a positive effect on your efforts. When commenting on other people\u2019s videos, I usually will try to find the one\u2019s with a large number of views or go the opposite direction and comment on the newest videos to make sure I\u2019m the first. 3. Social Networks - Once you have uploaded your video to one of the popular video sharing sites, you should share it with as many people as possible. You should start with your own social network and share it on Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and other social networking sites. As you share it with your friends ask them to share it with their friends by either positing it as part of the status update on Facebook or asking people to re-tweet on Twitter. You should seek out special interest groups that would be interested in seeing your video. For example, if you created a video about skateboarding, post your video on Facebook among Skateboarding groups and fans of various Skateboarding brands.4. Forum and Blog Marketing - One thing that I\u2019ve had success with was promoting it on relevant forums. For example, if it is a video about dog training, it could be promoted on dog forums (there are plenty!). Basically you want to find your audience, and head there. You can put it in your signature, or even make a post about it. Just be careful that you don\u2019t push too hard, as that could turn people off. You should also reach out to Blogs and first leave your video as a comment, but contact the author as well to ask them to feature your video as future blog post. You should seek out Yahoo Groups and should post your video for their members to see. Post your video on as many places as possible.  5. Rating - As you share your video among your social network and on forums, ask people to rate it high. A high rated video will show up higher on search results, and if you target the right keywords will result in higher \u201ctargeted\u201d views. 6. Social Bookmarking - Submitting your videos to popular social bookmarking websites such as Digg, StumbleUpon, and Del.icio.us can produce a heavy stream of increased traffic to your videos. Submitting to these sites will also help your video get indexed faster and provide extra link juice to increase your search engine rankings. One of the keys to effective social bookmarking is submitting other people\u2019s content and not just your own. People who use these sites will see your profile and consider your account purely self-promotional or even worse they may see it as spam if all you are doing is submitting your own content.There is a lot of value in passing around quality information and even if the content isn\u2019t your own, you can still be viewed as an authority if you are providing readers with valuable links to quality information. TIP \u2013 Always inform the original video/content owner that you have submitted their work to a social bookmarking website. You may get the favor returned. You can semi-automate the social bookmarking process by using a free site: http://www.socialmarker.com/, you can submit your videos URL to 48 social bookmarking websites. Or you can automate the process using social bookmarking software. The two I recommend are: Social Bookmarking Demon (http://bookmarkingdemon.com/), SocialBot (http://www.socialbot.org/). 7. Web 2.0 Blog Distribution - You can use Posterous (http://posterous.com/) \u2013 to distribute your videos across multiple blogs and social networking websites.The first thing you will want to do is set up accounts and a simple blog on these services: Blogger (http://www.blogger.com/), Xanga (http://www.xanga.com/), Tumblr (http://www.tumblr.com/), LiveJournal (http://www.livejournal.com/). (You will also have a blog automatically created for you on posterous). Send an e-mailtopost@posterous.com The first e-mail you send posterous should be a\u201ctest\u201d e-mail. Place the word \u201ctest\u201d in the subject line and just some random text in the email body. Posterous will automatically create a blog for you. You can change your blogs URL and create a username and account. In the top right hand corner of the screen, click on the \u201cmanage\u201d link. Then, on the manage screen select \u201cAutopost\u201d of the left hand side. Click the \u201cadd service\u201d button to add all of your various blogs. Now you can e-mail posterous (post@posterous.com) and your videos will automatically be post on these various sites.Enter the title of your video in the subject line. You can copy and paste the description either before or after the video. Place the link to your video. Select anchor text. The anchor text you use should be a keyword you are trying to rank for. 8. Article Marketing - Writing articles and submitting them to popular article directories can be a greatsource of additional views to your videos. Writing an article in under 10 minutes: http://mjthompson.net/257/how-to....  Doing this also provides backlinks back to your video meaning higher search results. A list of 1010 article directories: http://www.directorycritic.com/a... Building your YouTube subscriber (viewer) list in a paid way:   There are a number of firms that deliver views to your videos on YouTube. Some of them include: ShareThrough, AlphaBird, Feed Company, Unruly Media and Virool (http://www.virool.com).The problem with most of these companies is they charge $100,000 to begin working with them before you even see any results (this is the case of ShareThrough, AlphaBird, Feed Company and Unruly Media) and they will typically charge a premium of $.20-$.25 per view. With Virool (http://www.virool.com), on the other hand, you can start a campaign for only $10 and typical per view rate usually doesn't exceed $.10.If you perform a search on Google for \"YouTube Marketing\", you will find a lot of companies offering cheap packages (100,000 views for $100) that guarantee to deliver YouTube views. I would NOT suggest using any of them. Most of them have a bot or use proxy networks to deliver very poor quality traffic to your videos. I have tested about 20 companies and did not find even one that was bringing genuine human traffic. I even had videos removed and flagged as a result of me contracting one of these \"YouTube Marketers\" that ended up pocketing the money and delivering bot traffic that YouTube recognized as fraudelent.  The way Virool works (and companies listed above), they typically show videos to specified audiences on blogs, social games and iPhone apps. If your video is professionally produced and is targeting the right demographic, then you have a great chance for it to go viral. Try out Virool (http://www.virool.com) and let me know if you have any questions:alex@virool.com. ",
