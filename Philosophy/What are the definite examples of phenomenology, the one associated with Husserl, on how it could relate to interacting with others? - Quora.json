            "answer_text": "In my reading, the phenomenology of Husserl involves a first-person meditation on first-person mental processes. There is no social interaction involved in Husserl\u2019s phenomenological procedure. Husserl developed no social theory from his phenomenology. This was not his purpose. Yet perhaps we can surmise a social implication from his actual purpose. In my reading, Husserl\u2019s purpose was to save the Subjective Reality from being overwhelmed by a massive Objectivity of Government, Taxes, War, Science, Industry, Public Education, Medicine and so on. There is a sincere scientific inquiry today, regarding whether or not the Self even exists. This is what Husserl feared. Husserl hoped that philosophers would write volume after volume of first-person accounts of first-person mental processes. This would eventually establish a literature of the Subjective. Instead, Husserl did not finish his work, but was interrupted by the rise of the Nazi Party. Husserl was an ethnic Jew, so he lost his job. Martin Heidegger (who was a long time member of the Nazi Party) took his job. There is a Nazi myth that persists in Encyclopedias today \u2014 that Heidegger built his philosophy upon Husserl\u2019s phenomenology. But such falsehoods never quote Husserl himself on the topic. Husserl denied that Heidegger built upon his phenomenology. Husserl\u2019s work stopped when Husserl was booted off of his University position because he was an ethnic Jew during the rise of the Nazi Party. Period. There are two social implications here (and thus implications for interacting with others). One is obviously political \u2014 involving anti-Semitism. The other is Husserl\u2019s moral purpose \u2014 to salvage an awareness of the Cartesian Cogito. It seems that Husserl\u2019s purpose loses ground more and more as time goes on. ",

            "answer_text": "for me, H. is always about the appearance of the thing giving the most data for an understanding of what\u2019s human. but, for me it depends on the person observing. i have really good photographer\u2019s eyesight \u2014 20/10 corrected, and i simply see a lot. if i were a doctor and a diagnostician i\u2019d see even more and with a special gravity. if i were a father seeing his daughter, etc\u2026 or any special case. but, this is why Heidegger admired Husserl so much \u2014 that Husserl wasn\u2019t all \u2018mental\u2019 about things. not looking for the soul essence of things can really help you see things in context \u2014 not get lost in the possible secret meaning of things and what they might have for you as knowledge. with phenomenology you simply see and respond and file it away. sartre goes on to say that seeing means identifying the human and demands a collective and concerned response to anything human. ( i think that\u2019s how it goes. ) maybe reading sartre\u2019s novels would be an interesting read\u2026? ",
