            "answer_text": "(A2A) I don't practice meditation very often, however I expect that the meditation-aspect of a psychedelic journey would be beneficial. For example, when I smoke cannabis, which I consider to be of a psychedelic nature. I notice that it becomes easier to clear my thoughts. Also, cannabis and other psychedelics have a way to somewhat force you into a \u201cmeditative state.\u201d They accomplish this by ego-dissolution, which is often an unavoidable effect accomplished by higher-end dosages of specific substances. This is particularly true of the tryptamine class of compunds (psilocybin, dmt, lsd, etc.). ",

            "answer_text": "Taking psilocybin, the active component in magic mushrooms, results in very similar brain activity in brain scans as someone in a deep meditative state. People that are able to reach that state with meditation, have been training for many, many years, so they have context when they reach that state. Psychedelic drugs are often called \"spiritual theft\". They put someone in a state where most have no context whatsoever. Combined (using micro doses), they are able to show you what is to be reached after a lot of training, so it is very helpful in finding the correct path. The difference between psychedelic drugs and other types of drugs, is that you can take with you what you have learned. It is able to do some neuroplasticity. These are interesting talks that also discuss psilocybin and meditation;   ",

            "answer_text": "They helped me perceive two things: (A) That drugs are a waste of time, especially for meditative purposes, because the only thing they do is to enhance your mental contents, while meditation is to go beyond that. Real meditation is natural, effortless, and anything that you need to ingest in order to cause an effect is effortful. It just adds a problem, not solves it; (B) When your mind is shaken from its ordinary state by an external source like this, it's a great test for you to maintain your calm and not fall on delusions, be they good or bad trips.

            "answer_text": "I think there are different types of meditation. One is simply observing phenomena in a detached, equanimous way. This is good for dis-identification with the mind. Follow this path if you desire freedom from duality. Then there are other types of meditation in which you are not simply a detached observer, but an active \u2018player\u2019 or \u2018protagonist\u2019. Here you are required to integrate unknown parts of your Self, and re-shape your personality. Psychedelics are good tools for this type of meditation, not so much for the former. Follow the latter path if you desire Self-realization, which will be of course always bound to duality. ",
