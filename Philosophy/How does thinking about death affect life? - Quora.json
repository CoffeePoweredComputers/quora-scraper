            "answer_text": "The other day I went to this party at my friend's place. We had been planning for it for ages. It went on for two straight days. All our old friends were invited, people we hadn't met in years, people we had nearly forgotten existed, old crushes, exes. It was amazing. I was very excited about this reunion for months. During the entire time, I kept thinking about how it's going to get over in a few hours, and we'd all just go back to our own lives again. How this amazing feeling is temporary, how wonderful it would be if we could just be there forever, and how that was not meant to be. I kept thinking about all of that and this gave a sad bittersweet tinge to my experience the entire time. I would see people laughing and joking and catching up, dancing, singing, and really enjoying themselves, and I couldn't help but feel how fleeting it all was. That this time the next day, we would all have nothing but memories of this time that we are spending with one another. But, the thing is, when the time actually came to say goodbye, I realised I didn't make any memories. I didn't have memories of those two days to look back upon, because I couldn't enjoy them at all! I kept worrying so much about all of it ending, that I couldn't live in the moment when it was actually happening. It doesn't matter if good things come to an end, because everything ends some day. What matters is, how much we actually made use of it while it was happening, how much we made it count. Because at the end of the day, if we look back and realise we didn't live because we were too scared of the end, that would be the worst feeling in the world. We are meant to live this life. Death is inevitable, it will come for all. Thinking about it won't delay its arrival, on the contrary it will only tarnish the memories that we are supposed to be making right now. ",

When I have to die one day, why should I take any stress in life? When I have to die one day, why not make most out of life? Why not have unlimited fun? When I have to die one day, why not break the rules and laws, why fear? When I have to die one day, why should I accumulate wealth? Why should I hoard materialistic possessions?  Thinking about your mortality can definitely change the way you live, but in accordance with your set of beliefs and level of thinking. A person with negative mindset will find reasons for self-destruction, while a person with positive mindset will find reasons to be happy and to spread the same. Improve the way you think, alter your thought process and eliminate negativity, also do introspection and use will automatically use all concepts and facts for your benefit. ",

Thinking about death also can make one more careful and plan about securing dear ones future. Death also means no tomorrow so you can actually tune yourself to think \u2018if I die tomorrow is this what I rather be doing\u2019 that can help you sort a lot of your priorities and preferences. Not thinking of darkness dosen mean light will shine always, it's in being prepared to face darkness that a bulb was invented. Don't just breath.. Live till you actually die! ",

Why should one worry about a certain activity when nothing can stop it from happening? Rather than contemplating about the specifities and details of death, one can think about how they can make the future, the best by making their present a living dream of theirs. Of course because thinking about death will neither stop it from occurring nor will it change the way it's gonna occur. Best thing to do, live happily. Make sure you will be able to live happy in the future. And most importantly make sure others are happy because of you. That matters. That is content and that defines satisfaction. Cheers :) ",
