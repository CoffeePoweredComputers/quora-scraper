            "answer_text": "There are similarities between communism, socialism and fascism . Both are anti-democratic, have elements of central control, oppression of the beliefs of any kind of opposition, do not believe in all kinds of freedom. Communism says that it is classless but ask people who actually live under it\u2019s control. There are elites who enjoy whatever they want as opposed to the \u201cworking\u201d class. Communism is about economics. Yes it is. Take the Cuban people for instance. The average Cuban, before Che came and started torturing them and keeping notebooks about how their brains oozed out of their ears, etc, made something like 20k per year. Now it\u2019s between 30 and 60 dollars per month. They have very little choice in society. Having a second job is against the law. Groceries stores have very little in them. Che and Fidel really taught the elites who were existent in Cuba a lesson. And they left and bought their smart hard working butts and brains to the US. Ever wonder why Communist societies build walls. They say it\u2019s to keep people from entering but think about that. If their system is superior why would they deny access to it. And, ever see pictures of people getting shot trying to enter. Nope it\u2019s people dining to LEAVE. See the biggest community to both is arrogance. Arrogance that a few people are smart enough to lead and everyone else is bound to follow. Both are tyranny. Thomas Jefferson said that when the government fears the people it\u2019s called Democracy but when the people fear the government it\u2019s called democracy. When a leader says \u201cWe believe in science, it\u2019s code for political evolution and the fact that that person and their cohorts believe they are bound by science to rule over others. Yes Che was a Tyrant. . . . Here\u2019s an edit and clarification of my thoughts: I\u2019ve never met Bautista but according to the materials (and maybe propaganda) he was corrupt. On the other hand I\u2019ve met actual Cubans who told me what it\u2019s lie NOW. Cubans make between 30 and 60 dollars PER MONTH. How many have you met and don't tell me you\u2019ve been there and talked to Cubans because of course they're going to say they love it. They fear for their lives \u2026 avoiding any kind of misstep. No freedom, no elections, very little choice, baby sat by strong handed people. Furthermore I\u2019ve been to East Berlin and West Berlin before the wall came down and seen the looks on the faces of people in each respective city. Vast difference. Vast difference in the demeanor of the guards at Check Point Charley. Thomas Jefferson said when the government fears the people it\u2019s called democracy but when they fear the government it\u2019s called tyranny. Bautista was corrupt and Che and Fidel were TYRANTS.

            "answer_text": "You know, words actually have meaning. Che Guevara was no kind of fascist, conforming (to what exactly?) or otherwise. The fact that people can even ask such questions reveals a great deal about the incredible levels of confusion many people seem to have about the basic definitions of political vocabulary. This is worrying because it leads to cruder and cruder forms of politics where everything not \u201cpolitically correct\u201d is simply dismissed as variations of \u201ccrimethink\u201d. Communism, fascism, liberalism, socialism-- What\u2019s the difference? Well, the differences, in fact, are very significant and the inability to grasp that is quite dangerous. ",
