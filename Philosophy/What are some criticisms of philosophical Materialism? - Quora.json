            "answer_text": "You haven\u2019t clearly mentioned which branch of materialism you are talking about, so I would assume it to be Mechanical Materialism. Let\u2019s have a look at defining elements of mechanical materialism: The whole is a summation of partsEverything in the universe can be explained as mutual interaction of hard impenetrable particles.Basic cause of motion is external force.Now, as science advanced, we came to know that above statements have got flaws. We observe in the nature that whole is not the sum of parts, at different level of scale , different property emerges. Just by knowing cell, you cannot understand Human body , for that you would have to study the different level of organization(tissue, systems etc. ). We cannot understand everything just by studying small particles.(This was the actually reason different discipline like chemical science emerged ). Every changes cannot be explained by external force, one has to look inside the matter. These were the criticism associated with defining element of Mechanical materialism. Now to counter those question/criticism, entirely new branch of materialism emerged called Scientific materialism ,which says that: Matter exists Independent of our conscious and in case If it exists at all, it should be able to influence our enlarge sensory system.(Including telescope !)Whole is not summation of partsEverything is in motion and motion is a mode of existence of matter.we should study the process as matter would not exists one day( as opposed to Mechanical Materialism which emphasize on study of matter (hard impenetrable\u2026.???)There must be cause of any effect and the nature of the cause must be materialist.",
