            "answer_text": "The easy and simple answer will be a solid Yes; however, if you execute a deep analysis, then, the answer is more a Depends.  Lets say you are a healthy person and none of your capacites are diminished, thus, erasing fear from your life you could probably think that there\u00b4s no limit to what you can accomplish in life. Like the quote goes \"if you put your mind to it you can accomplish anything\". Notwithstanding, there are certain things, other than personality and intelligence, that can affect your actions. Certainly, genetical factors contribute enormously (positive or negative) to your possibilities of having some kind of success in your chosen field. Now, of course success is not mandatory for you to be whatever you want, but if you don\u00b4t stand at least a minor chance to participate, then, your plans are more dreams than goals. For instance, if you are 5\u00b44 and your goal is to be a NBA player, chances are that your are going to have a hard time; i\u00b4m not saying it is impossible, but lets face it: you can do better things with your time and your resources.  Another thing to take into account is your social and interpersonal relations. Maybe, until know you\u00b4ve only work in a certain place, you are married and have two kids; suddenly, a revelation comes that your calling in life is to be a sherpa. What do you do? Probably if you travel to Nepal and live a couple of years in the sherpa comunity, within sometime you can be a sherpa and guide climbers throught the Himalayas, but what about your former life and family? You impose on them the obligation to follow your path, and if not they are traitors? You leave them? The answer to this questions clearly shed light on the many variables and choices you will have to make and include in your decisions. Thus, in an ideal world you could be whatever you want, but sometimes you just have to put your feet on the ground and face reality; then, a simple answer is not available and a simple Depends is more plausible.

I think there are personal ceilings based on work-ethic, ability/desire to learn, personality, ability to change, and about a trillion other factors, but I don't think there are any hard and fast rules as to where those ceilings are.  And I take this be both a good and a bad thing. One one hand you its bad because you are limited. On the bright side, since you don't know where that limit is, you have to push as hard as you POSSIBLY can, in every avenue possible, to find out. And when you find your personal limitation... you'll be there. That's not so bad, right? ",

            "answer_text": "As Jonathan, Jason and Johnnie have all clearly and thoughtfully stated in various ways, it's unlikely that you can be \"whatever\" you want due to biological and situational limitations. But there is also the limitation of intelligent pragmatism. There are zillions of things that you could be, if you wanted to spend decades of time learning the necessary skills, or climbing that particular apprenticeship ladder, or swimming in that pool of sharks singlemindedly. But unless you were a fool, and wished to sacrfice every other damn thing in your life to that single goal, you would never make the decision to do that.  Could and would are very different things, and much of life is about learning this and making continual trade-off decisions between wishes, hopes, plans and feasibilities - and distinguishing between them.

A poor woman in rural Guatemala just won't have the tools to overcome her environment. Her possible outcomes are limited, as are the outcomes she can even imagine. To be hyperbolic, Astronaut is just not in her future, and tragically, likely not even in her imagination. The important thing to remember is that those limitations are there because of human decisions. Not by the woman herself, but the social, political, cultural, and economic environment she finds herself in. An environment rooted not in a pre-determined law of the universe, but the result of individual people making choices to make that a reality.  Thanks for the A2A. ",
