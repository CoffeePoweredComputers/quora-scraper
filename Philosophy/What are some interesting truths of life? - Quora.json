            "answer_text": "The most interesting truth of life is that life is an art and most unfortunate about life is nobody is ready to learn this art. Another thing about life is that it is highly unpredictable. Nobody knows what is going to happen next. And that is the beauty of life. Life is beautiful only because we don't get any clue about what will happen next. Religion provides a recipe to this enigma and provides ready-made answers to all possible questions. As humanity is scared of this uncertainty, so most of the people are religious by nature. religion has done far more harm to humanity than any atomic bomb because it has destroyed the beauty of life.

Try to let go of the way you think things should be and simply enjoy life as it is.Everything is imperfect, even youWorrying is a waste of a timeThe best lessons will come from hardshipsWe confuse being productive and with being busyMost of us don\u2019t need more, we need lessIt\u2019s easier to hold on to the way things are, rather than accepting changeThe best things in life are free think about oxygenThank you ",
