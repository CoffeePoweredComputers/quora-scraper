            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not about you! You need to discover the effective strategies for the students you get! The goals which they need to achieve. That means you have to decide, before you start, 1) what you want your students to acquire 2) which strategies work best for them for achieving the specific goals Your philosophy must be to honour your subject and sustain their morale individually and as a group. Its not entertainment, its a serious human duty. You have to know your subject and know your students. Enter the classroom the first time with a smile which says you are delighted to be there and look at them individually all during the hour, working your way with apparent ease to each student, enjoying the process. Create a morale for the group making sure every student is given the promise of a good position in the group. Quickly pick out students showing annoyance, revolt, without their knowing what is going on and surprise them with shots of humour, shots of shared social standing, covert promises of shared common sense, a fair deal and above signalling a shared \u2018secret\u2019 understanding between you. Realize that every student is swimming alone or with a subgroup, approaching each kind, each kind, involves a different set of skills. Trust your intuition but catch and correct mistakes about the social details of the groups, and the loners. I could go on but the key is your confident smile and personal integrity, not serious on the surface but always visible. The philosophy behind all this? Realize that the group in your room is a complex society and you have to be their leader like any other leader, and that you have to hold your leadership and morale whatever the dangerous surprises. A pause, with a few little nods and serious eyes, a refusal to be insulted or intimidated is key when someone is set to cause a fracture in the planned drama of the lesson. Walking away while watching them seriously is a safe trick but be ready to cut through their negative emotion and find their trust, and then promise that the trust is secure for them as individuals. In this matter, you have to be unflinching and they have to see that. Teach the wave: roughly three minutes on, three off. But like a car driver, constantly adjusting your direction, speed, eye movement, your position in the seat. The philosophy? The classroom is a social drama that many humans have the ability to create, it is mainly a natural skill. It is what humans, a highly social animal, can learn to do without too much (apparent) effort. It may seem ironic that the school often interrupts this drama. But that is understandable, the principal has each classroom as a virtual person. He or she faces in the school the same challenge as yours as a teacher but with the parents and The Department and its regulations folded in. The best teachers become principals and the best teachers are not hard to spot. ",
