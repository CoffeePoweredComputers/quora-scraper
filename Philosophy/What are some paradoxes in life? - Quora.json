            "answer_text": "1. The more you hate a trait in someone else, the more likely you are avoiding it in yourself. Carl Jung believed that characteristics in others that bother us are reflections of the parts of ourselves that we deny. Freud referred to it as \u201cprojection.\u201d Most people call it \u201cbeing an asshole.\u201d For example, the woman who is insecure about her weight will call everyone else fat. The man who\u2019s insecure about his money will criticize others for theirs. 2. People who can\u2019t trust, can\u2019t be trusted. People who are chronically insecure in their relationships are more likely to sabotage them. Call it the Good Will Hunting syndrome, but one way people protect themselves from getting hurt is by hurting others first. 3. The more you try to impress people, the less impressed they\u2019ll be. Nobody likes a try-hard. 4. The more you fail, the more likely you are to succeed. Insert inspirational famous person quote here. You\u2019ve probably heard many of them. Edison tried over 10,000 prototypes before getting the lightbulb right. Michael Jordan got cut from his high school team. Success comes from improvement and improvement comes from failure. There\u2019s no shortcut around it. 5. The more something scares you, the more you should probably do it. With the exception of genuinely life-threatening or physically harmful activities, our fight-or-flight response kicks in when we\u2019re confronted with past traumas or actualizing the self we dream of being. For instance: speaking to an attractive person, cold-calling someone to get a new job, public speaking, starting a business, saying something controversial, being painfully honest with somebody, etc., etc. These are all things that make you scared, and they make you scared because they are things that should be done. 6. The more afraid you are of death, the less you\u2019ll be able to enjoy life. Or as one of my favorite quotes puts it, \u201cLife shrinks and expands in proportion to one\u2019s courage.\u201d 7. The more you learn, the more you realize how little you know. Every time you gain a greater understanding, it creates even more questions than it answers.  My man Socrates dropping some knowledge bombs about the uncertainty of knowledge. He knew what was up haha. 8. The less you care about others, the less you care about yourself. I know this may go against every perception you\u2019ve ever had of a self-serving asshole, but people treat people the way they treat themselves. It may not be apparent on the outside, but people who are cruel to the people around them are cruel to themselves. 9. The more connected we get, the more isolated we feel. Despite being in more constant communication than ever, research finds an increase in loneliness and depression in the developed world over the past few decades. 10. The more you\u2019re afraid to fail, the more likely you are to fail. See: self-fulfilling prophecy. 11. The harder you push for something, the harder it will feel to achieve. When we expect something to be difficult, we often unconsciously make it more difficult. For instance, for years, I assumed starting a conversation with a stranger was something that was highly abnormal and therefore \u201cdifficult.\u201d As a result, I spent a lot of time strategizing and studying ways to relate to people I didn\u2019t know. Little did I realize all I had to do was say \u201cHi\u201d and then ask a simple question; that would get me 90% of the way there. But because it felt hard, I proceeded to make it hard for myself. 12. The more available something is, the less you will want it. Humans have a strong scarcity bias. We unconsciously assume things that are scarce are valuable and things that are abundant are not. This is not the case. 13. The best way to meet someone else is to not need to be with someone else. The fact remains that the best way to find a sexual relationship \u2014 committed or otherwise \u2014 is by not needing a sexual relationship to be happy and investing more in yourself. 14. The more honest you are about your faults, the more people will think you\u2019re perfect. The amazing thing about vulnerability is the more comfortable you are about not being that great, the more people will think you are. 15. The more you try to keep someone close, the further away you\u2019ll push them.This is the argument against jealousy in relationships: once actions or feelings become obligations, they lose all meaning. If your girlfriend feels obligated to spend her weekends with you, then the time you spend together has become meaningless. 16. The more you try to argue with someone, the less likely you are to convince them of your perspective. The reason for this is that most arguments are emotional in nature. They come from someone\u2019s values or self-perceptions being violated. Logic is only used to validate those pre-existing beliefs and values. It\u2019s rarely about the objective or logical truth as much as it is repairing people\u2019s worldviews. For any real debate to truly exist, both parties must be making an honest concession to put their egos aside and only deal with the data. This is rare, as anyone who\u2019s spent any time on an internet forum could tell you. 17. The more choices you have, the less satisfied you are with each one. The old \u201cparadox of choice.\u201d Research shows that when we\u2019re presented with more options, we become less satisfied with any particular one we go with. The theory is that when we have so many options, we have greater opportunity costs to selecting each particular one; therefore, we\u2019re less happy with our decision.  Pick one. C\u2019mon, PICK ONE!!! 18. The more convinced someone is that they\u2019re right, the less they probably know.There\u2019s a direct correlation between how open a person is to differing perspectives and how much that person actually knows about any given subject. Or as the philosopher Bertrand Russell once said: \u201cThe trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent are full of doubt.\u201d 19. The only certainty is that nothing is ever certain. 20. The only constant is change. One of those little banal statements that feels really profound but doesn\u2019t actually mean anything. But it\u2019s still true! ",
