            "answer_text": "Yes, absolutely. It hardens the heart of the liar, to begin with, and the hardening, if left unchecked, can become pathological, to the point where no one trusts the person. I believe this is what happened to Donald Trump. Second, it hurts the lied to because lying is a form of theft: The liar steals something very precious, faith, and when we lose faith in people, we can become overly suspicious and distrusting. No matter how difficult it might be, don\u2019t lie. It would be best, of course, to have not done the thing you need to lie about, but a single lie can cause a cancer in a relationship that can destroy a person\u2019s faith and trust. I heard once of the son of a pastor who grew to hate the Faith, became rebellious, angry, bitter. After many years, his father finally got him to talk about the issue that cause him to lose his faith. The boy, now a man, explained that when he was about 10 years old, he and his father planned a long fishing trip. The boy was so excited, because getting any time with his dad was pretty hard. No one really faults parents for being busy. But the morning they were to go, the boy set his alarm and was in the process of packing for the trip. Suddenly, the phone rang. His heart skipped a beat. A phone call this early could only mean trouble. After a while, his dad came in and said something had come up at the church, I believe someone of prominence was dying, and they would have to cancel the trip. Too the pastor, it was important, he was needed. it was his job. What the boy heard was, \u201cMy job is so much more important to me than you, I am willing to throw this whole weekend away so I can tend to it.\u201d The damage was done. A relationship destroyed, a little life would now regard everything any authority figure said with distrust, and suspicion. All because of one, \u201cunderstandable\u201d LIE. My father was a pastor most of his life, and I can say pretty honestly, at least about the times he was not traveling, the priorities of a pastor was this: God, FAMILY, congregation. Even with lay workers, the priority should be God, family, business. But that\u2019s another topic! ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cDoes a lie hurt more than the truth?\u201d Sometimes. It depends on the nature and the reason for the lie. My father had Alzheimer's. My mother felt that telling him the truth would be too hurtful. I disagreed. He continued to deteriorate; forgetting things, minor scrapes on the car, which he would take to the body shop for repair, then believe that he was still driving well because his car was pristine and he never had any trouble on the road. Once, I could not take it anymore and told him. It destroyed him. He felt that I was lying, he could not fathom any reason for it; by this time he had forgotten that he had three daughters, and wooed my mother as if he was seeking her hand in marriage. He knew I was a friendly face, but he did not know that I was a part of him. He screamed, cried, ran to the room and cried himself to sleep. Of course, by the next day he had completely forgotten the incident. He was fine. He was not losing him mind. My mother assured him of that. So I continued with the lie. I smiled and never denied my mother's statements that he was well. When I felt his driving was too dangerous, my mother and I conspired to take away his car. He asked me where he had parked the car and I lied; I told him that he had taken it to the shop because of a problem with the brakes. He accepted that lie as the truth and asked me to take him to the store. After a few days, he had gotten used to not having a car, and stopped asking. Then, a few days later, he asked again, and my mother again lied: \u201cYour car was stolen, Uhl\u201d she said, \u201cDon't you remember? We went to the police station and you reported it.\u201d He accepted the lie, which was repeated several times and confirmed by my sister and her husband. The alternative was telling him the truth; that he was sick, senile, and that his own family had stolen his car from him. This truth would kill him. This truth was too painful to contemplate. It would hurt him the way it was hurting my mother, my sister, and me. The lie did not hurt him. The lie was soothing. The lie tore me up inside, but I knew that it was for the best; the shadow of the man my father had once been deserved to live his final days happy. He deserved to have his last coherent thought be of him as he had been; strong, smart, witty. Within two years, my father was gone. His body lived, ate, defecated (a lot!) and smiled. He was in a happy place inside the fragments of his memories. He lasted nearly ten years like this, breathing his last only nine months, to the day, of the passing of my mother. They both now rest with God. They are both happy, remembering all the wonderful years they shared, with perfect clarity. Yes. Lies can hurt. But it cannot be denied that lies can also, sometimes, in some cases, heal\u2026 not only the person being lied to, but the liar as well\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s less powerful, but it spreads faster. Research on why memes spread suggests that fake memes are just as viral or more viral than truth. How Fake News Goes Viral\u2014Here\u2019s the Math The reason is that most memes are spread without checking, because of information overload. Obviously, more salacious memes have a greater chance of being spread, and it is proportionately easier to manufacture a lot of memes if you don\u2019t care whether they are true or not. Memes spread by attractiveness, not by truth value. But fake memes, fake news, lies and hoaxes are intrinsically weak, because they can be so easily dismantled. Outside of entirely false frameworks, aka conspiracy theories, lies don\u2019t fit with other truths which we can experience and verify. They can be propagated as long as it is in no-one\u2019s interest to debunk them, but, once someone attempts to, it\u2019s relatively easy. Things which cannot be directly proved or disproved (perhaps because of a defensive stance on one side or another by a significant proportion of those interested) should nonetheless be taken seriously if they have survived many attacks over a long period of time, and not been demonstrated false. Clearly, with conspiracy theories such as the Moon Landing Hoax, Autism caused by Vaccines, and so on, even after complete debunking there are still people who are willing to believe them. Interestingly, it is people who are most likely to doubt who are most likely to be taken in by such things.[1] Doubt, notwithstanding the arguments of Ren\u00e9 Descartes, turns out not to be a good path to truth.  The question has now changed to \u2018which is more important\u2019. A lie has no importance. It\u2019s impact may, but it is not intrinsically important. The truth is always important.

            "answer_text": "The main reason why one would lie, is because it prevents that person from getting hurt (psychologically / emotionally). So at first, your question seems very contradictory with the use of lies. However, when taking a closer look, one can say that lies definitely hurt more \u2013 in general (we also have white lies and lies for someone\u2019s own good) \u2013 than saying the truth. This is because the effects that the lie sets in motion once it has been spoken can have tremendous effects on the person or his or her loved ones (e.g. lying in a relationship about having an affair with someone else, or not announcing that you have a very bad disease because you\u2019re afraid of how family and friends will react \u2013 just two examples). Although stating the truth also is definitely not the easiest thing to do, in the long run, the damage is kept limited, which is often not the case for lies, which can get lifes on their own. I think that people invent lies primarily because they want to prevent psychological damage in the short run \u2013 it\u2019s like Freud\u2019s Id (tell lies, profit now and push negative consequences into the future) versus the superego / self (face your misdeeds which will be, in the end, the best strategy).

            "answer_text": "A lie is a betrayal. It's an unnecessary act that belies comfort, but in truth conveys disrespect. When you tell the truth no matter how terrible, you are giving the person the opportunity to make a decision based on reality, you are affording them the respect to process it. When you lie, you rob them of the ability to make decisions or judgments that affect themselves. You lose trust that you can never get back. Example A: John got drunk and cheated on Amber, he felt terrible and deeply feared her reaction, instead of hiding it he told her the truth, and begged forgiveness. She was hurt and angry and left, but she was able to think about it and decided she didn't care since he was honest-she believed he was sorry. Later, they run into the fling and John holds Ambers hand tight embarrassed, Amber see's he feels nothing for the fling and they move on. Example B: John got drunk and cheated on Amber, he felt terrible and deeply feared her reaction, he decided to never speak of it. When Amber asked what he did that night, he made up a story and she believed it. Two weeks later, Amber and John run into the fling. Amber notices Johns discomfort and the flings overfamiliar gestures, and is humiliated. She confronts him and learns the truth. She is unable to forgive him or trust him since he lied, and was so embarrassed to be caught in a situation she was unaware of. ",

            "answer_text": "Lying is much more difficult to maintain because it begins with a presumed falsehood. As time moves forward and the truth continues to unfold, the lie begins to unravel because it does not fit into reality. To keep the lie merged with reality unchecked, one must constantly maintain it and shape it to match the truth. Eventually the truth will always come out because it will begin to envelope the lie until the lie can no longer exist as anything other than a lie. It\u2019s like a house of cards. You can only keep adding so many cards to it before it eventually falls apart. So even if a lie starts out with more power than the truth, the lie eventually dwindles away and becomes powerless over the truth. ",

In a case where you want to protect someone I think it\u2019s quite reasonable to lie about it than telling the truth. Of course it shouldn\u2019t be something where the person you lie to, could find out easily that you lied. I like to think about the scene in Batman The Dark Knight, where Bruce Wayne(Batman) takes the responsibility for Harvey Dent\u2019s(Two-Face) death so Gotham(crimeful town) wouldn\u2019t know the truth about the tragedy of Harvey Dent. Dent used to be a district attorney. Then a fatal criminal act involving bribe and lying turned him into a villain. If Gotham knew what happend, they would have lost their faith in the good. ",
