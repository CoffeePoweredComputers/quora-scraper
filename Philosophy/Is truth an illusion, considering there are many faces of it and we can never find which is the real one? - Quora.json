            "answer_text": "No ! Truth can't be an illusion . Under no circumstances ! Under no condition ! It's a completely different thing that sometimes the truth is circumscribed by haze ,frost , clouds , darkness . But that doesn't mean that truth doesn't exist . Actually , we don't want to reveal the truth because of our own compulsions . We don't want to reveal it because of our various weaknesses like our true character , our propensity to hide so many things, our inability to face the world, our shame to come clean, our vested interest in presenting a rosy picture diffent from the grim reality . But as the sun can't be hidden from the clouds for an indefinite period , the truth can't be suppressed for an indefinite period . The truth would come out today or tomorrow . Various agencies collude and operate to hide the truth . They try to create a black hole to dump the truth there and expect never to be dug up . But some of those who are behind the whole story may not be a part of the gang, and had to be part of it because of situational compulsion or out of ignorance ,or monetary greed . And situations arise when one day they spill the bean and the whole episode comes to the front . And what happens is known to everyone . The culprits are given the punishment they deserve . It's not that every crime ,every truth is decoded . So many factors play their role in hiding the truth . But that doesn't mean people don't know what is what . They can't digest the falsehood . Though officially the truth is something , the real truth is disclosed by the general public in the social media mocking at everyone who are part of the gang conspiring to hide the truth . And no amount of denial is strong enough to challenge the winds of truth blowing through the minds of the people . ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone is Unique in terms of Intellectual potential (IP) and Mind potential (MP). Intellectual potential (IP) is the ability to comprehend the available information in terms of structure, function, reaction, situation, facts, details, process, status, maturity, intentions, attitudes, impacts and state that are stored as Knowledge and Experience. Mind potential (MP) is the desire in the form of accumulated thoughts that are generated within the self of the individual in order to manipulate and exploit the comprehended information in their advantage based on their likes and dislikes. Finally, an individual can perceive the truth based on the \u2018resultant effect' of their both Intellectual potential (IP) and Mind potential (MP). Every individual in the world has their own Unique IP and MP. In other words, an Absolute Truth is perceived as a Subjective Truth by an individual due to their MP and IP. Due to the above-mentioned reality, it becomes highly difficult to understand the Absolute Truth. We can get to understand the Absolute Truth only when we increase the IP and balance the MP to the fullest extent. If the aforesaid mission becomes difficult, then we need to get to understand the Absolute Truth from those people who have already acquired the IP and MP to the fullest extent possible. ",
