            "answer_text": "Kind of. We can make choices consciously. But thinking is a very calorie intensive process, and so our natural tendency is to think as little as possible. In truth, we kind of spend our lives on autopilot, repeating behaviors we have learned, producing the behavior when the correct environmental stimuli is present. Even when we do think, it\u2019s usually not really about what we are doing in that moment, it\u2019s about the future, the past, the theoretical. We think we are free. And we are often told we are free. But let\u2019s look at a real life example: Everyone is free to decide if their organs are donated or not. Certain countries have an opt-in system, where you have to sign up, and other countries have an opt-out system, where you donate by default unless you ask for it not to happen.  The answer varies depending on how the question is asked.  When someone goes into a shop to buy a product, they are free to buy whatever they want. Or are they? The salesman exists to try and have them make a certain choice. There are price anchoring strategies  If the kids are free to ask for candy any time they want, why does it matter so much to try and place it in front of their face at the checkout? Everyone thinks advertising doesn\u2019t impact them, only everyone else, and yet advertising is a trillion dollar industry. With advanced predictive AI working to create targeted ads.  There is a parenting strategy that consists of giving choices to control children. Don\u2019t say: \u201cPut your shoes on!\u201d, say: \u201cDo you want to put your left or your right shoe on first?\u201d It\u2019s called a false dichotomy when used in dialog, it\u2019s a logical fallacy that people fall for. We see it being used in politics all the time as well as in advertising and marketing. And in the media.  Think about your breathing. You are free to breath however you want, but you rarely actually do it. Based on the air, your emotional state, physical state and so on, you will breathe differently without even necessarily noticing it. The rest of your behavior is like that too. You can control the way you walk if you want, but most of the time, you don't really think about it.  We design a lot of life around that. It\u2019s not enough to explain to someone how to ride a bicycle, or a car, and then have them try to consciously control their body to turn the wheel, and press on the pedal and so on. People train a little bit, so that they can know how to do it as a reflex, a built in pattern, without needing to think. Martial arts are like that too. You train and train and train, because you know you are not going to have the luxury of thinking about your every move, you want to already know how to do the techniques and have done them so much that if you see an opening, you can react almost instantly, with as little actual time for thinking as possible. Other sports too. A basketball player shooting is not consciously thinking about their finger and elbow movements during the throw, they could tape it and analyze it later. But they train a lot, to be able to do it with muscle memory and trained reflexes.  So much of your life is like the organ donation opt-in vs opt-out issue. You technically can make a choice, but in practice, the way the environment is set up heavily influences your decision. The act of making a choice itself has a cost, and so there is a bias towards the default choice presented to you. People are meddling with your environment. Trillions of dollars are spent on teams of scientists, engineers, marketers, advertisers, etc, All to influence the choices you will make. They say that since you still have a choice, you are free, and so it doesn\u2019t matter if they set up the system to be opt-in or opt-out. Are you really free, or is it a lie? A half-truth used as a distraction maybe. ",

First you have to think about what society demands for you. There's expectations and rules. There's norms and sacred mores to consider. That's a lot of idealistic pressures right there. And how about that Government? The individuals who make policies and laws. The ones who lead us and divide up the power and the money. Then there's every individuals own unique biology and personal circumstances to factor in. Are you morally sound and physically healthy? Are you mentally stable? Or predisposed to diseases or a mood disorder? Are you able to access the necassites? Food, water and medicines? Are you fortunate enough to drive a vehicle to your chosen occupation? Or are struggling to make the ends meet and keep your sanity in check? In my opinion I'm one the freest person I know of. I embrace who am and I'm not bond to a household or a automobile. I'm not even working so there's no management to piss off now. While most people scoff at my decision to not be a slave to the money or to any man. I am able to pick up everything I hold dear in just three bags and walk away. I respect myself, I understand that I'm accountable for my actions. I will respect you as well and I rarely judge anyone by their mistakes. I'm fallible too. Probably more than most. I suppose yes-I'm free. And I have to wonder how many people out there right now feel the same way about their lives. Hopefully-many do! ",

            "answer_text": "We are constrained by the laws of physics, of course. We cannot levitate or walk through walls or anything of the sort. We are free generally to do what we like while understanding that there are consequences for all actions. I can walk off the edge of a tall building, for instance. The understanding is that I will subsequently be subject to the force of gravity and the impact will very likely kill me. I\u2019m quite free to threaten the life of the president, understanding that I will very likely be hauled in and questioned sharply by the Secret Service and very likely jailed. I can constantly ignore the traffic laws with the understanding that I will likely receive citations from the police or be involved in accidents. Nothing will physically prevent me from doing any of these things, nor any number of good things either. I can freely give away percentages of my income to charity, spend hours doing volunteer work, or help little old ladies across the street. My motives may be entirely altruistic or entirely selfish. There is no constraint either way. Most of the arguments I hear about the very contentious idea of \u201cfree will\u201d are religiously informed and as such, nonsense. \u201cIf God knows our ultimate fate how can there be free will?\u201d How indeed. Simple answer\u2026 There is no God. Our ultimate fate is determined either by our own actions or by actions that we have no control over. Free will does not come into play if a comet falls on my head tomorrow. The other view is more of a philosophical one that goes something like this: \u201cThe universe is subject to the laws of nature and thus will play out in a manner determined by those laws. Every event or action affects future actions. If one could extrapolate from original events, one could plot the exact fate of everything.\u201d Cute idea, but the sheer \u201cindeterminancy\u201d of the Universe makes any such calculation essentially impossible. The final notion I\u2019ll mention comes from the realm of neuroscience. It\u2019s been discovered that the subconscious mind does a great deal of \u201cprocessing\u201d, and that many (if not all) decisions we make are made subconsciously and that these decisions \u201cfilter up\u201d to the conscious mind that then fools itself into thinking that it made the decision. This would seem to indicate that we are but \u201cmeat puppets\u201d that are being driven by our own subconscious minds. However: I\u2019d argue that this is rather preliminary research and further that the subconscious is of necessity OUR subconscious, formed by our life experiences and heritage and culture and thus is a \u201csingular\u201d subconscious\u2026 Ours alone.

            "answer_text": "Short answer is -  No, We are not free. Now depending on what you mean by \"free\", there could be a different interpretation to it. There is one Absolute freedom, and then there is this relative freedom. and We do have some relative freedom. But no Absoulte freedom. In no way, shape or form we are absolutely free. We are governed (for a lack of better word) by so many rules and laws - both from social and physical world. Our physical world has some very specific set of rules which can not be broken. The laws of physics govern this Universe of ours - where nothing can go faster than the speed of light. So there is limit to everything. You can not jump higher than a certain height. You can not escape gravity without external help. You can not go to outer space on your own without any help. This limits prohibits any absolute freedom. You do have free will - but that is also more of a illusion. Think of sex - how easily you get attracted to it. Can you escape - for real for every single time it tries to get you in its grip. So if sex can enslave you, you are not free. Do you do anything that's out of the world - if not then you are only following the things from the world around you - that's not freedom. Our social world of course has many rules and laws -so you cant be going out and about and doing anything as you wish - so your freedom is limited by those set of rules. So this freedom we enjoy is relative freedom. We are not completely free in that sense but that has never been a problem to us mankind.  We enjoy life - within the boundaries of our social and physical world - there is so much to do and achieve that we can completely feel free without being bothered by what governs us as whole. ",

            "answer_text": "I think I know what you mean but still I wonder, who says that we are free? Or ever were free? And free of what? It really depends on your definitions, your circumstance, and how you scope the extent of \"freedom\". The answer in any case will be individual, relative and subjective. In my opinion, anyway.  Everything we see and do, even the culture we are born into, is filtered through our minds and interpreted individually. In that way, arguably, even seeming absolutes are in some way subjective. You may attempt to seek and test for absolute objective ethical neutrality, indeed I encourage you do exactly that, but it does tend to slip out of your grasp just when you think you have it. I always think of the punishment of  Tantalus here. An ancient Greek story of good and evil, proving perhaps that this search for absolute values is not just a modern one.      The short answer is that we use our personal value system to differentiate right from wrong. It is always subjective, at least to my mind, being based not on objective values or even absolutes but subjective, relative values chosen by you, consciously or not, from an array of options. Yes, our decisions are informed by our culture, true. And our culture is an inherited thing, developed subjectively over time by previous generations.  There's also an argument here over how much freedom and how many options we are allowed in any one society (it will vary), but unless we are totally controlled by others and have no say at all in our own lives, generally we do chose at least something. Even if not necessarily consciously!  There's another argument along the lines of innate values, being \"values\" that have been embedded in us by some process, be it by evolution or a spiritual methodology of your choosing. Again, we have problems of definition and of determining what is \"innate\".  I'll throw a few more ideas around to expand further on that answer.   Subjective = influenced by personal feelings, tastes or opinions. Objective = not influenced by personal feelings, tastes or opinions. Absolute = a value or principle held to be universally valid in and of itself. By extention, objective in nature. Relative = a value or principle without absolute validity that varies with perception and consideration. By extention, subjective in nature.   Are we really free? No. I can't say that currently we are free to do or be anything we can imagine, although that may change with future technology (such as virtualisation). More speculatively, others may see a spiritual dimension and/or opportunity here as well. Presently I can say that relative freedoms do apply, depending upon your definition of \"free\" and your individual context. As far as I can see, it has ever been so.  Does culture, advertisements, experiences etc shape us into who we are? Not entirely. These are certainly influences on 'who we are'. Depending upon your individual environmental context and personality you may or may not have choices. You may be able to modify or ignore your culture even by increments, or choose to avoid some experiences over others. There will be events outside of your choosing, yes. You may be able to avoid or mitigate advertising, too. Avoiding a broad \"et cetera\" is harder. You can't escape some features of your genome, for example. Ultimately, however, you process incoming neurological signals subjectively and personally.  Are these values subjective?  Yes, they are, in my opinion.  Assuming that you specifically mean good/evil and right/wrong then arguments arise as to how we can determine absolute, universal values without some reference to context, rendering the result relative and subjective. I suspect that ultimately all values are arguably subjective, at least by degree. The arguably more objective values are the physical and physiological ones, but even the ostensibly objective is individual, relative and personal, too. It's hard to escape the subjectivity clause I'm afraid, although obviously many have tried.      Then how do we differentiate right from wrong? Is differentiation dependent upon objectivity? No, not in my view. I believe that we can differentiate subjectively, indeed people do it every day. One way to do this is by having a personal value system, by which I mean an ethical and moral basis for making such decisions, and testing it regularly, widely and relatively against other examples. Decisions based not on well tested, consistent subjective values are valid, in my view. We all have a personal value system, influenced to varying degrees by the cultural, social, spiritual and contextual lives we lead. Our authenticity here remains intact if we maintain consistency with our regularly tested subjective values.   Then how do we differentiate good from evil? Do we need to? Is \"evil\" even a thing in and of itself? Or should we be recognising and differentiating behaviours based on our personal value system instead? And acting thereafter in accord with that value system.  This may or may not feel comfortable. Perhaps you would prefer absolute values for good/evil and right/wrong, I don't know. You could argue a case for that, of course, but our subjective minds will remain in charge of any one interpretation.     How restricted you feel by culture and commercialism depends a lot upon you and your relationship with your immediate environment. You may or may not feel free where you are, because of family or societal influences that close off degrees of freedom. But you may feel more free in another context, if you are lucky enough to be empowered to get there.   But in no sense can you achieve absolute objective freedom whilst living and breathing, especially freedom from personal decision making. (OK, maybe in a dream or altered reality? But still, there's an underlying dependency somewhere.) Reality's all relative and subjective as far as I can see.  Which doesn't mean that seeking and testing for absolute objective ethical neutrality is a waste of time, indeed it remains a noble pursuit, at least in my mind.

            "answer_text": "Freedom is the world is conditioned by several factors. That\u2019s why we have freedoms, but not just freedom which represents being free from everything undesirable. In the world, we can be free from something while not free from something else. When free from something, this freedom is true so we\u2019re truly free from that something. However, when not being free from other related things, we cannot say we\u2019re truly free. For example, one is not in jail, but one\u2019s brother is in jail. Although one is physically free from jail, one\u2019s mind can be in jail with one\u2019s brother - as one is bearing the burden of one\u2019s brother being in jail. That is an example of how freedom is conditioned. Worldly freedoms are somehow connected. But they are not connected with total freedom or being free from all undesirable. For example, as one is not being in jail, one is free from confinement and punishment but one has to worry about other worldly things so one also wish to be free from these worldly undesirables that surround their victim. We have many problems with our minds and bodies. We have to look after them but we often don\u2019t know how to look after our minds so they are usually not free, but confined by thoughts and they bear heavy loads. Relief is generally obvious when it happens. The heavier the load pressing the mind, the clearer the relief can be when it happens. That can be compared with walking on hot sands bear feet. When a feet is lifted up, it feels comfortable, but the other feet is very hot, so the feet with relief has to step on the hot sand again. Only when one gets to a true shade, one can really stand on cool sands. In deserts, animals like lizards run very fast, yet it has to run for shelter inside deep sand. As human beings, we can hardly get to the real shade like that. We just have to walk on the hot sands - day and night. We should say the total freedom is the true shade with cool sands - but we should not think it\u2019s death. ",

Ultimately it depends on many things, short term and long term. You\u2019ll never be free from imperfection. Honestly, there\u2019s a lot you can be free from, all the way from student loans to happiness. Being free is a very subjective thing, because there are a million different ways to look at it.

Some are so bounded to go with their emotions simply because they have given a relation a name.

Yes, she can take actions to prevent the abuse but she is forever chained to them because of her blood lines.The universal law of survival of the fittest makes us to strive to be the best of the lot.

            "answer_text": "As it is phrased, this question is proving difficult for people to answer. That\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t provide us with any context. That is, it doesn\u2019t specify in what regard one might be free\u2014and there are many aspects in which freedom may or may not apply to a human being. This is a common problem with questions and answers on Quora: one word gets overworked as if it has only one definition and use. Then it seems it\u2019s always my job to rotate things a quarter turn to reveal its other facets and put things in perspective. On Dictionary.com there are 36 entries for \u201cfree\u201d under the \u201cadjective\u201d heading alone! Of course, not all may be considered attributes of people, but several may. And they can apply either physically, mentally, figuratively, or metaphysically, depending on what aspect of their being you have in mind. So, let\u2019s single out some definitions and cite examples of how they might apply to human freedom.  enjoying personal rights or liberty, as a person who is not in slavery \u2014 This is pretty straightforward and I doubt any Reader would have a problem grasping the concept. I can legitimately say I live in a society where I\u2019m \u201ctruly free\u201d in this regard. Are all humans free in this way? No. But then the question doesn\u2019t ask whether all humans are \u201ctruly free\u201d in this or any other regard, does it? That\u2019s a common fault in Quora questions: being too broad and vague in scope.  able to do something at will; at liberty \u2014 Again, there is no doubt I\u2019m able to do something at will\u2014of my own volition. Answering this question is one example of my having done something at my own will. Who can show that anyone or anything besides my own self has forced me to write this answer. There are any number of things I could have done during this time, yet I chose to write this answer. I submit that every other person on Quora has that written an answer has done so by this same freedom. Not everyone has the same freedom or the same means to write a Quora answer.  not occupied or in use \u2014 Since I\u2019m free in the first since I mentioned and am therefore not a slave, I\u2019m not in anyone\u2019s use in that way. But I may or may not be free to be of voluntary use, to assist or serve someone else in some way. I many or may not be \u201cfree,\u201d then, in the way often used in the British sitcom Are You Being Served?, where Mr. Peacock might ask another employee, \u201cMr. Humphries, are you free?\u201d In the U.S. someone might ask, \u201cAre you busy?\u201d And, of course, not everyone in the world will be \u201cfree\u201d (or busy) at the same time. But at any given moment, many very well are \u201cfree\u201d or \u201cbusy.\u201d  exempt or released from something specified that controls, restrains, burdens, etc. (usually followed by from or of) \u2014 This type of being \u201cfree\u201d has the context almost built into it, in that it\u2019s often followed by from or of\u2014directly tying it to some constraint. The examples given after the definition are free from worry and free of taxes. Again, which of us can\u2019t possibly be either of those at some point in our lives? And, though none of us is likely to be free from worry the entirety of our lives, does that prevent us from being \u201ctruly free\u201d from worry at any time or for a given duration?  unimpeded, as motion or movement; easy, firm, or swift \u2014 Is the Reader tied or duck taped to a chair at this moment? Or, are you in a jail cell? In either case, you might be rightly deemed as not being \u201ctruly free\u201d in that regard. But, what if you\u2019re outside in a large open field? Are you \u201ctruly free\u201d? Are you \u201cfree\u201d at all? You can run in any direction. You can turn cartwheels. Or you can sit or lie on the grass. Who decides whether you are or are not \u201ctruly free\u201d? What prevents you from designating yourself \u201cfree\u201d by this definition? Let\u2019s say you\u2019re in that field as part of a prison detail. Are you still \u201cfree\u201d? Is it not apparent that your being \u201cfree\u201d (or not) depends entirely on which aspect of your being is in effect, and on who is considering that aspect? Who gets to arbitrate this, and for whom?  So, What Is the Question Again? Hopefully, the Reader begins to see that anyone presuming to answer for everyone the question of whether you are \u201cfree\u201d is appropriating to himself some kind of omnipotent prerogative he or she obviously doesn\u2019t possess. What, then, are we really asking here? It it even an answerable question? There\u2019s no set context or perspective by which a useful answer can be tended. Every answer can only be the Writer\u2019s personal opinion or philosophy. Which accomplishes what, exactly? You think being \u201cfree\u201d is this, and I think it\u2019s that. Or, you think there\u2019s a difference between being \u201ctruly free\u201d and I think \u201ctruly\u201d mitigates absolutely nothing (which I indeed do). But, once all our verdicts are in\u2014then what? What have we accomplished? Have we resolved anything? Wait\u2014maybe there is something. We\u2019ve all gotten in some writing practice. We\u2019ve all had an opportunity to show off our writing (and, perhaps, thinking) skills. Some of us may even have taken this opportunity to make some kind of point about doing such exercises\u2014even suggesting there is none, except they\u2019ve actually participated in the exercise and therefore sound like some kind of hypocrite or smartass for even participating. Who knows? Who would do such a thing, anyway? Maybe its simply human nature and narcissism, and generating views and more visibility for ourselves. For some, tons of upvotes. Then again, maybe some do it just because they\u2019re \u201ctruly free\u201d to do so.  \"Meaningless! Meaningless!\" says the Teacher. \"Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless.\" \u2014 Eccl 1:2  Related: Johnnie Lockett's answer to Is human consciousness only an artifact of electrochemical processes in the human brain?

Everything you said was wrong, although I'll start at the bottom as it were. You may not be able to become a recording artist, but you can still do music for the love of it. You can record it and put it on Youtube or busk or any number of other things. Your ability or inability to get a contract is a meeting of your freedom to try and their freedom to accept or deny you. Freedom isn't compelling other people to do what you want. This is your freedom, yes, if you devote all your energy to music and can't make a living out of it then you may starve but once again, the freedom is choosing to make the attempt. Likewise, you and I have complete freedom to commit crimes. We can make the attempt - others will use their freedoms to try and stop you. The government will try and punish you based on the laws that it wants you to live under. I fully acknowledge that plenty of people will say that I'm getting it wrong and that there being consequences means that I don't have freedom but even if you were in a paradise where your sustenance needs require only that you reach out and take it you are still restricted by the physical laws. People still have the right to not want to listen to your music, unless you're the only one with freedom. ",

            "answer_text": "Reminds one of Rousseau's saying, 'Man is born free, but everywhere he is in chains'. For Rousseau the condition of not being free (being 'all against all', i.e. the condition of humanity in the 'state of nature' as described by Thomas Hobbes, but with very different implications) necessitated a 'social contract'. Well, in the Western world we are all likely persuaded that, as stated by Churchill, democracy is the lesser evil, better than every other political arrangement. Are the wealthy, the millionaires, or simply well-to-do - given an absence of war and/or general turmoil, really free? The answer is simple and everyone knows it: they enjoy a relative freedom (denominated 'negative freedom'), provided also there is marital harmony, absence of disease, etc.; this fortunate lot may still have all sorts of worries, grudges, and unfulfilled desires. In reality, there can only be PSYCHOLOGICAL freedom, even in the presence of physical pain and/or discomfort. For that to be the case, you have to observe, and accomplish, the Oracle's dictum (Oracle of Delfos): Gnothi seaut\u00f3n, 'know thyself'. I will not tell you here how to do it or go about it. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh, I love this question. I follow the principal that we are free to make any choice we wish. The reason we generally choose one option over another is simply because we prefer the consequences of that choice than the consequences of the other. Or it\u2019s an easier choice to make. Let\u2019s use an example. I can choose between a red apple and a green apple. If I choose the green apple, nothing will happen to me. If I choose the red apple I will die. Dramatic but you get the idea. Now obviously I choose the green apple because I don\u2019t want to do. The question remains, did I freely make that choice considering the outcomes. Yes, I did. The idea of freedom is that if I wanted to I could still choose that red apple. So long as I still have the ability to choose that red apple, no matter the obstacles, limitations and consequences, I\u2019ve still got freedom of choice. The issue with freedom is when an external body begins making the choice harder to make. To add to my example, imagine the government imposed a ban on every red apple. So now it\u2019s harder to get my hands on that red apple. Finally I find one but it\u2019s locked deep in a building, guarded heavily by dogs and barbed wire. I still have the freedom to choose to eat that apple but that freedom is being encroached upon by an external force. So long as we always have that ability to make the choice, so long as we have choice, we have freedom. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you realize how many choices you make every day? I have never tried to count them as there are just too many. From the simple to the complex, we make thousands of choices every day. We are indeed free to make these choices. Is this the freedom referred to in the question, probably not. Not all humans are free depending on their geographical location or the culture in which they live their lives. In certain country\u2019s, if you don\u2019t follow the laws of the government you could be put to death. In certain cultures if you don\u2019t abide by that cultures rules and traditions, you could be banished and considered dead and in some cases actually put to death. That isn\u2019t being free. In a place like any country that claims to be a free country, Like the USA, there are laws to be followed, and if you choose you can break those laws and risk being caught and suffer the consequences. Some of these consequences aren\u2019t as severe as they probably should be but certainly not as severe as they might be in a country or place that isn\u2019t considered to be free. True freedom therefore comes in the God given freedom to do what is right. Freedom to bless and heal instead of harm and hurt, freedom to love instead of hate, freedom to do things to help others and maybe save lives instead of take advantage of others or even take their lives, freedom to Worship the One and Only God who gave you this freedom. That is true freedom. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a natural tendency of every human being to want to be free. Freedom is not luxury, it is a necessity. Not just human beings, but even animals want freedom. Babies want freedom. If you tie a scarf on the neck of a baby, it just wants to remove it. You put a chain on a baby\u2019s neck and the baby will want to pull it out. It is the adults who put jewelry around their neck, but children want freedom, they don\u2019t want any restriction. That is why they throw their hands up and down\u2026 free!Wanting freedom is innate to human beings as well as animals. Every life wants freedom, and liberation or moksha is nothing but freedom. Freedom is a natural desire in every human being but when the mind gets so muddled up in unnecessary day to day things, it forgets that it wants freedom. It is as good as someone who wants to sleep but has forgotten how to sleep. What does it mean to be free? Freedom is not running away from situations and circumstance. Sometimes a situation is stifling or unpleasant, and we run away from it and think this is what freedom is, but that is not so. Freedom means: Being unphased by circumstances, situations and the people around youBeing free from your own emotional garbageBeing free from the jungle of your thoughts that bother youBeing free from all the entanglement that you harbor in your headBeing free from fear and anxietyAnything that stifles you and makes you feel small, being free from that is what freedom is. How to move towards freedom? Let go of cravings and aversionsWhether you accept it or not, watch it or not, life is an act of letting go. It started the moment you were born. You let go of the womb and came into this world. As soon as you came here, you started breathing in and breathing out and you are taking food in and letting it out. It is a constant exchange. You cannot hold on to anything here.As a child you were holding onto many toys, and as you grew up, you let go of all those toys. Are you still holding on to your little toys and bells? No! As you grow older, you obviously let go of many things. Similarly, let go of cravings and aversion. When you feel free from all the cravings and aversions, that is freedom.MeditateMeditation is food for the soul, it nurtures the core of your existence. It keeps you physically fit, healthy and mentally focused. Intellectually, it brings you sharpness, keenness of attention, awareness and observation. Emotionally, you feel lighter, softer and purer and you feel able to let go of the past garbage. It creates positive vibrations around you, influencing your behavior with others, and others behavior towards you. There is nothing better than meditation to bring calmness to the mind!Reduce your wantsIf you want freedom, your wants should be minimum. Minimum wants will give you more freedom. If the wants are too many, they go on and on and on.Now, when the wants arise in you, what do you do? You can't keep on wanting things. This is where wisdom comes to help. See life with a bigger context.Develop a sense of contentmentWhen the mind is not stuck in desires of either respect, money, position, and the mind goes beyond these things, then you can say you are free.Before you let go of the body, if a point comes when you are so fulfilled, and you are ready to let go of everything \u2013 that is the infinite freedom that you experience.You need not even physically let go of things. It may not be possible practically to let go of everything but at least in the mind if you let go of everything, you will find there is enormous freedom, and lots of happiness and connectivity towards everything will come.Have FaithOne very important thing we need is the faith that only the right thing will happen! There is a great power in the universe that has maintained this universe from billions of years. Have faith in that power.",

Freedom is knowing you have a saviour and you have an eternal life to come.

(And in our mental creation of our will and plan, we are free to come up with any idea computable with reasonable time and energy in our brain.) However, there will always be constraints on our ability to successfully carry out our willed plan. Constraints such as:- Basic laws of physics (Gravity - not just a good idea. It's the law!)- Social bounds (strictures) and levels of tolerance of \"aberrant\" behaviour- Extant hierarchical social power structures. Yes, these can usurped at great cost, but it is guaranteed (by thermodynamically optimizing social logic) that another hierarchical power structure will take the place of the one you usurped. Ok you could be on top of the new social hierarchy. But if you are the leader and think you are free, you are sadly deluded. You will conform to the norms and limits;  the characteristic behaviour expected of good leaders, or you will be done like dinner soon enough. So in short, we are free to dream, and if our dream is within social and physical bounds, we may be free to realize our dream, but if not, then our flight is confined to our fancy. ",

In a society that has fallen as far as ours economically,90% of the work force is at the wage slave level of pay. Freedom may be difficult to grasp or to even consider when you are working 50 to 80 hours a week just to tread water. Yet freedom is what you use to decide consiously to over exert yourself every day-just to tread water. A truly free people are inwardly strong. They are bonded together and forward looking-together. America has not been that for many years. Every public figure that has had the courage to stand and exhort inclusivity and tolerance has been assassinated. Hhmmmm. Little wonder ALL of our leaders are silent,while our so called culture is coming unravelled and about to fall apart. Today in America most folks only have time to think about survival. ",

His point (assuming the narrator is a he, I\u2019m not sure) is that everything we do is determined by our past actions and thoughts. For example, although you may have clicked on this answer possibly out of supposed randomness, you did not. You opened Quora not out of random, but because this is the primary thing you open when you are bored. Why? Maybe you wanted to come across answers from Quorans you like because you have liked them before and you want more? Every decision was based on previous thoughts, actions, and beliefs. So, you were forced to open Quora. Your mind would not have said: Hey, so I know you\u2019re about to open this thing, but let\u2019s not do that today. How about you do 20 push-ups in the middle of the room and sing your favorite song! Na. And even if you make that realization, you still have made that realization based on previous thoughts, beliefs, etc. So, maybe free will is a myth. ",

We are always looking for ways to improve what we already have. Some will argue that's a good thing.

Since it takes about 21 years to fully come down to Earth, I would think it takes about another 21 years to rediscover who we are, and what our own true goals are.

So, if you have a fatalistic mindset, no one has true freedom.  However, we can be free within a human society. There are ways in which you can live not bound to material things, social connections, or a lot of responsibility. It all depends on what kind of freedom you're talking about.  ",

Then there is what you care to do about it that can increase freedom. I suggest that finding out that one can not be totally free is not improved by becoming depressed and posing with angst. If you want to become more free, decide what that means to you, design a plan towards that meaning, and act on your plan. I would also suggest not expecting one fell swoop act to gain total freedom and to be prepared to take incremental steps towards greater freedom. ",

Yet, thanks to Eve, so to speak, we are now like God, knowing Good and Evil. We no longer wander naked through the forest. To be more Hermetic about it (as Hegel liked), we have many attributes of God, including Reason, Creativity, Lawfulness, and FREEDOM. So, because of our spiritual half, we are half free. Yet, because of our animal half, we are half unfree \u2014dependent upon outside conditions for our very survival, and slaves to our own instincts. ",
