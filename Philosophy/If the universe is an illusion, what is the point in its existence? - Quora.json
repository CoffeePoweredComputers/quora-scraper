It is called \u201cMaya\u201d in our scriptures. You can compare this Maya to \u201cSimulation\u201d in our current world. This whole world might be a simulation or Maya created by higher beings for their enjoyment just like we play video games to enjoy ourselves. Is there a point in playing video games? except for fun, No there isn\u2019t. But we are the ones who are being played. They are enjoying our suffering. But that\u2019s okay. Because we are not real, just like this world, We are also binaries 0 and 1. How can 0 and 1 have a purpose? How can there be a point in Mario dying? He never dies. He takes birth again again whenever we want to enjoy. So just like that, This universe has no point except for the enjoyment of the creator. Now what\u2019s in it for us? Well we have nothing. We can pass our time here as smoothly as we can. So just do that. The higher beings might also ask this question \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d But just like us, they also have no answer except for \u201cJust play the fucking game\u201d.  ",

            "answer_text": "Ganesh, A fantastic question, because you declare life as we know it as an illusion, yet you still ask for the meaning of it all. Something cannot be right, but at the same time you are asking this question for a good reason. Let\u2019s first take the illusory part of our existence. I can agree with you that to some extent illusion is part of our lives. Illusions exist perhaps to help guide us through phases. If we all knew about the troubles ahead, would we still want to move forward? And yet while moving through some painful periods, we can come out on the other end stronger and more mature. What I disagree with you about your illusion statement is that you declare all to be illusory (or at least that is how you phrased it), and that cannot be correct. It cannot be all illusion. If there is no actual contents, then we would not exist. So, we have to investigate the layer of illusion that is somehow part of life. \u2014- Let\u2019s move to the other part first, before making both come together. The point in our existence is yet again well put. You\u2019re asking about the meaning of the universe, of life, and perhaps how the individual needs to deal with this. I am not the first to make this statement, but the meaning of life is what you make it. This is not some facetious answer; it contains a rather complex aspect to it. We find ourselves in a directed setting (most certainly so as children), and as adults we need to give ourselves (and perhaps others) direction. Some of us have to start out from scratch finding direction and that can be quite difficult. To give oneself direction requires an understanding of what makes you tick, requires an understanding of what makes you interested in your world. This can be a negative approach (and you then want to make the world \u201ca better place\u201d), or it can follow a love (a love for art, a love for people, etc). \u2014- Let\u2019s bring both together. Living in a directed world or universe, having to find one\u2019s own way to further a personal direction, tells us that there is indeed no singular reality, but a combination of realities occurring at the same time. Because the universe is a directed place (outward movement for all matter in the universe), we have to acknowledge that there was either something wrong or something so beautiful that this direction (in all directions) occurred. This means there was a prior state from which it all derived. As they say in Buddhism, our universe is a result, it is not the original. But of course it will contain some aspects of the original. We are part and parcel of this result. The blissful moment some would love to see at the end of any story will not occur, it is an illusion. The universe is on an eternal journey and there will not be a moment it all ends. However, moments of bliss can and will indeed occur throughout our lifetimes. This requires us to have made decisions about our own direction in life, and to know when to enjoy the fruits that come around every so often. Life is real, and the illusion is just one part of life. Pricking through the veneer allows us to examine what we like or dislike, allows us to grow into a different phase, and this can allow us to connect with the center of our own being. ",

Questioning the point behind the existence of universe is same as questioning the point behind your life. We do not look upon our life as pointless or meaningless. Everyone has his own motivation to carry on in life to pursue the goals set by him. As such there is no point in questioning the purpose or meaning behind the existence of the universe. Man can question the point or purpose behind what he does or makes consciously. He has no locus standi to question the existence of something over which he has no control and which has come about without his conscious determination. ",
