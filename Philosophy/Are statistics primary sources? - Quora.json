            "answer_text": "I\u2019m guessing that you are asking whether it is necessary to cite statistical sources as references when writing a research paper. If so, the answer is \u201cno\u201d. Typically the statistical analysis used in evaluating the data gathered in an experiment is referred to by name in the Results section without citing a reference if the tables or probability distributions used are commonly available. If, however, the statistics used are of an unusual circumstance or condition that the reference tables used are not commonly available, then a citation in the reference section is certainly warranted as a primary source. If the conditions warranted a special consideration in the analysis of the results, that should be discussed in the results section as well. ",
