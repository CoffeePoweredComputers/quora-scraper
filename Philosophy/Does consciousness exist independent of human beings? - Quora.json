            "answer_text": "This is still a matter of intense scientific (and philosophical debate), but it clearly depends on what you mean by consciousness. Various ape species (of which we seem to be close relatives) seem fairly provably to share the ability to know they are alive, recognize a \u2018self\u2019 and that the self is mortal. But also clearly they see the world quite differently from us in many ways, probably including their vision of \u2018self.\u2019 So are they possessors of \u2018consciousness\u2019 or not? Depends on what you feel has to be included in the definition of that word. They clearly have some form of it, but not exactly ours. Of course this opens the door to ask whether machines will attain consciousness and what the definition will look like when they are much more like us than at present\u2026 in some respects\u2026 or in all respects. Again, likely a different, perhaps enhanced form of consciousness and we won\u2019t be able to retain our belief that we\u2019re at the top of the heap. But, even so, will that reduce our feelings of well-being. We will feel humiliated, short-changed, will we try to live up to the new, higher level? All interesting, but unresolvable questions\u2026 for now. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it exists without a physical counterpart, there are thousands of cases where the person has returned from behind the curtain commonly known as the afterlife, Russell by Gwen Byrne, gave researchers an ex-directory number for his parents some 17 years after he so-called died. Arthur Findlay his Father spoke with him long after he passed, Arthur was astounded as he had told no one his name, and from that moment on he became a believer in the afterlife he spoke with many people after that, ( on the edge of the Etheric) Findlay. Marie and Pierre Curie interacted with Materialised forms. Sir William Crookes interacted with Materialised forms. Scientists and researchers have interacted with the afterlife some in physical form. Google Victor Zammit updated info. Marcello Bacci for voices. The Scole report scientists from various fields, \u201c\u201cWe witnessed the impossible happen I have witnessed Materialised forms in group settings under strict conditions, I have many recordings. I have one of a Father apologising to his Son for ending his life, \u201c I couldn\u2019t stand the pain any longer\u201d not unless you do plenty of research you will not find any of this out, it took me 30 before I seen my first Materialised form.

            "answer_text": "A thing or quality comes into existence only after it is discovered by a discoverer. A discovery becomes collective perception when it is accepted by all or most in a class. For instance humans accept that mango is an edible fruit and that's our collective perception or discovery. The question of existence of a thing is not valid for a thing which is not discovered. Both the discoverer and the dicovered object together define the existence of that particular object in terms of a totality of characteristics it is discovered to have. Note the use of phrase 'totality of characteristics'. Humans discover mango to be an edible fruit but tigers do not. Thus consciousness will cease to exist in the totality of characteristics that humans cognise it to have once humans become extinct. I urge you again to underline the phrase 'totality of characteristics'. The question whether consciousness will still exist in a manner humans have not cognised it is an invalid question. ",

            "answer_text": "Consciousness cannot be separated from perceptions namely seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling and thinking. Time, space and cosmos and the perceptions of time, space and cosmos arise simultaneously and sink together as well. So Consciousness and perceptions emerge simultaneously from a mysterious source which is the source of this cosmos itself. What is the nature of this source? Science calls this source pure energy. When this energy vibrates, the subject or the perceiver and the cosmos or the perceived appear together in what we understand as wakefulness and both the subject and the object disappear in the unmanifest POTENTIAL in deep sleep, swoon, coma and death.

            "answer_text": "Consciousness is the body\u2019s navigational system; it consists of the act of paying attention to signals for relevance to survival. All animals are conscious of their surroundings. Some animals appear to be conscious of themselves to some extent. Humans too but we have this added layer of thoughts about everything so our little bit of self awareness can be thought about in ways that perhaps no other animal does, and that may be why some think only humans are conscious of themselves. But you asked about consciousness, not self consciousness / self awareness. ",
