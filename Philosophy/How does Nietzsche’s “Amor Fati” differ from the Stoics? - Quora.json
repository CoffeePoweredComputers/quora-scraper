            "answer_text": "Nietzsche\u00b4s \"Amor Fati\" shares the ethos of the stoic philosophy, for they both reveal the acceptance of suffering. They both believe that there is an ever-occurring eternity of opposites, which is there will always be a bad and a good. Here Seneca quotes it beautifully in his \"Letters from a Stoic\": \"Winter brings the cold and we must shiver; summer brings back the heat and we have to swelter. Bad weather tries the health and we have to be ill. Somewhere or other we are going to have encounters with wild beasts, and with [people], too, \u2013 more dangerous than all these beasts. Floods will rob us of one thing, fire of another. These are conditions of our existence which we cannot change. What we can do is adopt a noble spirit, such a spirit as befits a good [person], so that we may bear up bravely under all that fortune sends us and bring our wills into tune with nature\u2019s; reversals, after all, are the means by which nature regulates this visible realm of hers clear skies follow cloudy; after the calm comes the storm; the winds take turns to blow; day succeeds night; while part of the heavens is in the ascendant, another is sinking. It is by means of opposites that eternity endures.\u201d And here a famous quote from Nietzsche in Ecce Homo: \"My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it\u2014all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary\u2014but love it.\" I believe there are some nuances in these two philosophical formulas, what I see is that Nietzsche remarks of not only to accept fate, but also to love it. This is that you should not resent any unprecedented negative change that comes your way, you should love it because it is moulding you into the person you need to become. Suffering will make you less naive, and a wiser person. The stoics also say we should accept life\u00b4s chaos because it is inevitable and uncontrollable, but what is in your control is the way you respond to things. They address to the significance of virtuousness and wisdom. Because when you invest in yourself to become a more virtuous and wiser person than you were yesterday, this in turn will make you more invincible to life\u00b4s chaos. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a stronger imperative\u2014that is, it demands more. Otherwise, it is similar, and many Stoics use the concept (perhaps without realizing its origins). Stoic acceptance is just that\u2014acceptance. A Stoic is under no obligation to be joyous at everything that happens, but only to be unperturbed by it. After all, while nothing that happens to us is bad, none of it can be good, either. Meanwhile, Nietzsche\u2019s amor fati requires, I think, a more active embrace. I believe he put it somewhere that learning that one\u2019s life will be repeated eternally should be a cause for celebration, for joy. That\u2019s not un-Stoic, but it\u2019s also not required of a Stoic. ",
