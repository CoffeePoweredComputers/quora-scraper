            "answer_text": "\"Simile\" is another word for \"synonym.\" Does that, give you enough to  s m i l e  about? Because I am a World Class writer...the last time I recall checking a dictionary or thesaurus was a decade ago. But then, within the last two months, I Googled the \"odd\" word to clarify any residual discrepancies floating 'round in my mind. Very often, one hears the expression: \"What's synonymous with that...?\" Meaning: \"likliest to go with.\" You can use \"equivalent,\" but because this word is even bandied about in chemistry & physics, only \"word-equivalent,\" suffices for ...synomyn. Similar is the adjectival of \"simile,\" the word I suggest. Also there's \"commonality\" and a host of countless words that ALL fall short for one reason only. These are also used in OTHER contexts...too. And believe me, English Lit., is so persnickety about \"proprietary exclusion\" that you need \"grammatic wording\" only..to match with its own. So short of \"inventing\" dozens for you...e.g. \"synchronym\"(for one)...\"simile\" is  t h e  most appropriate...by far.          \u2606  \u2606  \u2606  \u2606 w ",
