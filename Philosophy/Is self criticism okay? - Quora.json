            "answer_text": "Self-criticism can be poison. My daughter showed me her grades this morning. They do not use A\u2019s and B\u2019s at her school, they use a range of numbers - four to one - with four as the highest and one as the lowest. Her report card was stellar. I did a little happy dance, congratulated her and offered her a special treat of her choice. She grabbed the report card out of my hand and pointed out the three in P.E., algebraic reasoning, and Music. I saw her get all stiff \u2013 which is the warning sign before she scrunches up her face and bawls. I tried to do some fast talking to divert the tears, but she flooded. We stopped everything and I hugged her for a while. When she could talk \u2013 she told me she was trying to be perfect, but she always stops short. She can never make that leap to being the person she sees in her head. She tries not to say anything, but it\u2019s painful to do everything well and still fall short. The self-loathing and pain I heard come out of the mouth of my beautiful, sensitive child makes me want to cry myself. Holy shit, I\u2019ve given her my internal landscape. I\u2019ve been enjoying the perfect child act for a while. I\u2019ve seen it as a testament to my success as a parent and a human being\u2026but I knew. I\u2019ve seen her wilt at the slightest correction. I\u2019ve seen her try to make everything perfect, wake up early, review her homework, put on a cheerful face, ask for nothing. I\u2019ve seen her go quiet and shrug off disappointment. I\u2019m not particularly critical of my daughter but I am highly critical of myself. This pressure is coming from me but it\u2019s not directed at her. I talk too much, and she sees. It\u2019s not a good thing. That voice I hear in my head is toxic and I know it. My life hasn\u2019t been easy and I blame it all on that voice-that-is-me. I don\u2019t listen to it any more than I have to. I make fun of it. I try to blow it off. Self-criticism sucks. It\u2019s counter-productive. Life is for growing, experiencing, doing things that are worthwhile. You get better and find success when you show-up, finish your projects, and put them out there. I am brave and adventurous. Even so, I implode every once in a while. I forgot to take out the garbage bins this week. Fear, Disgust, Failure! I have piles of notes, a place to write and 3x5 cards that I need to go through but I hate all my ideas. I wont show my art. There\u2019s a difference between being self-aware and living with a bully in your head that edits all your moves. Sometimes I won\u2019t talk for fear of saying the wrong thing. My kid is more conscientious than I was as a kid. She told me we were going to be late\u2026and we were. I had to stop everything for a while to give her hugs and time to pull herself together. Meanwhile, I am going over everything I did to pass on that particular voice to my child. What do I do? Zen camp? ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s not always bad, first of all. But I\u2019ll just stick to answering the question. Why it can be bad: One person\u2019s internal thoughts and ideas and beliefs are ultimately a closed loop system. It can be easy to not share this inner critical voice with other people, and yet be ontinually believing it, without anyone around the person knowing they have this highly critical beliefs. Talking to other people about our internal workings and our views helps us stay grounded in a shared reality, complete with other perpective on how we are and appear and the value of our effects on others. I say this as a person who has, for various reason, spent large chunks of time in my life with no social network, no friends, and spending most of my time in isolation, despite living in a large city. During the worst of these times, I became riddled with anxiety, depression, and other painful thoughts and emotions. I was seeing the world through this very limited lense of my \u201cclosed loop system\u201d within my own thought patterns. I think our interconnectedness through our relationships to others like an ecosystem, or even like a human body. Ideally, for optimum health, most of us need a variety of nutrients from diverse food sources to live well. I personally thrive in diversity - assuming I have some sort of healthy connection with it all. Basically, self criticism can be bad because we have a very limited perspective by virtue of being only one person. One\u2019s patterns of self-criticism might even stem from an early role model in their life who was not particularly kind, intelligent, or loving, but perhaps harsh, cruel, or had their own painful issues which we as children were unaware of. This criticalvoice from another source can get stuck in our heads, telling us this is what we need to do to survive, but really\u2026 that\u2019s not true. If we listen to that self-criticism it may eventually tear us apart and tell us nothing we do is good enough, and so on. ",
