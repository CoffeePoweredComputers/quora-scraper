            "answer_text": "Is hypocrisy immoral? Note: I\u2019m not going to do a whole song and dance here as to how morality is derived. For that, see like every freaking other of my answers on the topic. I\u2019m just taking it as given that there is a thing called \u201cmorality,\u201d by which deliberate wrong is called \u201cimmoral.\u201d I\u2019ll come in again.  Is hypocrisy immoral? Depends. Hypocrisy can be completely unconscious, where one hasn\u2019t closely examined oneself for fit and misfit and conflict. A lot of people don\u2019t. This doesn\u2019t make the person not a hypocrite, but it would be rather droll and off-brand (for morality) to charge someone with wrong over an unknowing and unintended act. Which is why I focus on what hypocrisy is, rather than make assumptions about unknowables (another\u2019s motives, another\u2019s knowns). Hypocrisy is any case where one\u2019s public presentation (of belief, of behavior, of what-kind-of-person they are) is at one and the same time violated, contradicted by one of their own private acts. Now this is either deliberate, in which case it is dishonesty plus whatever the moral charge of the private act may be. Or it\u2019s unknowing, in which case one can\u2019t charge immorality (except on the separate basis of the private act, if it is immoral). But one can charge hypocrisy. And in this case, the hypocrite is at fault for their unconsidered and ignorant tangled-up act. Fair enough. That\u2019s a strong enough charge, isn\u2019t it? Hypocrisy is a failure in integrity. A failure in self-consistency. These by themselves are not necessarily immoral, but they are weak. This person is by degrees divided against themselves. Where hypocrisy is deliberate, it has additionally the intrinsic offense of deception. One is deliberately convincing other of what is false. One is living a lie. As to the actual acts which violate the public presentation, these are immoral or not depending on the acts. Probably for any very wrong act, the doer is aware how it conflicts with their public front - and if they sneak and conceal, this is a dead giveaway. If they know they have to hide it, they know what a hypocrite they are. ",

            "answer_text": "Roger is nervous because he is at his cardiologist\u2019s office. The nurse sends him into the doctor\u2019s office room for a conference. There is a large executive desk made out of heavy mahogany as his desk. There are files piled up around the office. You take a seat. The doctor comes in through another door. He is a man about 50 with round rimmed eyeglasses and salt and pepper colored hair. He is wearing a dress shirt and tie underneath a white lab coat. \u201cHi, Roger, I received the results of your tests. I think we covered everything,\u201d the doctor says, taking a seat. \u201cOh good,\u201d Roger says, his heart pounding. The doctor then open his desk and pulls out a bottle of whiskey. He pours himself a shot and immediately slams it down. Roger\u2019s eyes open a bit. He\u2019s not used to seeing his doctor drink hard liquor at an appointment. \u201cRoger, you are going to need to start living a more healthy lifestyle. I mean food and drink.\u201d Roger nods his head. Then the doctor pulls out a long menthol cigarette and puts it in his mouth. He lights it with a skull lighter. He takes a deep drag after it lights. Then he exhales, filling the room with blue smoke. \u201cRoger, you are going to need to limit your alcohol. Keep it moderate. And most of all, don\u2019t smoke. It is terrible for your cardiovascular system,\u201d the doctor says as he takes a few more drags on his cigarette and then pounds down a few more shots. Then the doctor excused himself and left the room. Was the doctor wrong? Is smoking bad for your cardiovascular system? Of course not. Hypocrisy doesn\u2019t look good, but it isn\u2019t technically wrong in and of itself. The doctor made no claims about his own behavior. ",
