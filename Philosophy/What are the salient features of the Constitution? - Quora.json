            "answer_text": "Nothing is more important than the individual.Second most important thing is the independence of each sovereign State \u201cnation\u201dThe Federal government is granted certain authorities from the states and the citizens called \u201cenumerated powers.\u201d They total 30 to 40.The powers vested in the federal government will have input from the states (Senate) and the people (House of Representatives).Separation of powers is the constitutional system of checks and balances (on power) between the needs of the people, the needs of the states and the requirement of a federal government. The framers of our constitution knew that democracy does not work \u2014 you end up with tyranny and the winds of political preference shift easily and often. They knew that the states were, in essence, their own individual countries that wanted and needed to remain autonomous. They knew, in order the new country to survive, certain aspects of society needed to be headed by one central authority. They knew that all states and people just fought a war to remove themselves from under the thumb of a king and did not want that to happen yet again in the new land. So, in order to foster the best possible structure that took all these competing factors into consideration, they framers / founders, created a federal government with roughly 35 enumerated powers; anything not listed would be reserved to the people and states respectively to determine what was best for them in their own little unique \u201ccountry\u201d (aka - state). Legislative Branch: this branch was separated into two separate chambers.House of Representatives - these people were to be elect directly by the people based on population. These representatives are elected to represent their local constituents when creating or voting on laws and budgets.Senate - in order to have representation of the \u201cstate\u2019s\u201d interests, these representatives were originally elected by the legislative members of each state, who were elected by the people of their state. With the passage of the 17th Amendment, the Senate is now elected by direct popular vote, just as the house. The 17th amendment forever changed the separation of powers so beautifully struck in our constitution because the members of the Senate are no longer responsible to the legislative members of their state.This branch, based on the writing of the Federalist Papers \u2014 is the strongest and most powerful branch of our federal republic.Executive Branch:The executive has the power to veto legislation and budgets that are presented to him from the legislative branch.The president is responsible for EXECUTING the laws passed by the legislative branch.Last, the president is commander in chief military operations.This branch, based on the writing of the Federalist Papers - has much less power than the legislative branch, but does veto power \u2014 however, a veto can be overridden.Judicial Branch:This branch is the weakest among all the branches, as is very clearly articulated in the Federalist Papers.This branch is purely controlled by the House of Representatives. Aside from one chief justice, required by the constitution, the House of Representatives could add more or remove any judicial agencies (by jurisdiction) and can add or remove supreme court seats at will.This was the branch, in the Declaration of Independence, that accounted for the most abuses of power. The founders knew that the courts\u2019 power had to be diminished as much as possible because it was the most likely to become corrupt.From one of my many answers on the Constitution, including: Bryce Ebeling's answer to The Constitution lists a clear separation of powers. Describe this separation of powers. What was this separation intended to accomplish? ",
