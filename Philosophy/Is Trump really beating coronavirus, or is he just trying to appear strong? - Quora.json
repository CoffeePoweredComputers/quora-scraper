            "answer_text": "First thing. Me think trump bad. His tack on China, Iran and North Korea wrong but he was right there needed to be a change in how they were approached. Oh I am not from the US but somehow everything that happens there affects my pocket in the end. Trump has been an image man his whole life. This could be more of the same. Appear strong and never show weakness or back down. That is a large part of his public persona. The treatment he received could make him feel better initially. This being shouted out by a million different people online. So he is sick, feels fine now and then gets worse. Possible, most likely trying to hide it when it happens. There is another possibility. He was just not that sick. He was infected, got sick and had mild symptoms. Due to his history of trying to project a strong image making people not beleive him now. Add to that the US President, no matter who, is unlikely to admit how serious it is. They will say something like it is due to an abundance of caution. Different presidents would have dealt with it differently but if it had been serious there would have been attempts to downplay it. This is a case of commentary is suspicions and guesses. We will have to wait and see in another week. Hopefully people will see that it can \u2018get to' anyone. Sadly most comments by those who are either pro trump or downplay Covid say that is proof that it was overhyped. ",

            "answer_text": "The fact that the pandemic did not pass by Trump became known to the whole society, however, the president's medical history was very short. Just three days. The day before, he was discharged from the military hospital and returned to the White House. Moreover, barely reaching the residence, he hastened to take off his protective mask. In general, all this looks so positive that a lot of conspiracy theories about the president's health have appeared. Say, the virus could only become part of a big political game. \"The fact that Donald Trump is being discharged from the hospital does not mean that he has recovered. He can get sick on average, with these forms, up to 10 days people excrete coronavirus. Maybe even more. He just does not need hospitalization,\" At the disposal of journalists was a list of drugs that are being used to treat Trump. A whole cocktail! First, it is a powerful antiviral agent, which is prescribed, for example, for Ebola. Secondly, an experimental set of ready-made antibodies. Why test this on the president? And thirdly, a steroid, which is usually not prescribed for mild illness. Conspiracy theorists are sure: if the president really felt good, he would not be stuffed with such a set. And they conclude that the president's illness will overthrow him. True, this is possible with a mild course. ",
