I have a friend and he will always stand in an extreme opposite side of mine, Whenever we argue about something or whenever we come up with some sort of justifications. He consideres his life as a burden and he'll never try to mingle with people or will try to accept the reality. He always blames the society and until now i don't even know how the topic of society interfered in our personal arguments! But,still he never even tries to understand things from different aspects. There are some people who are so dominant on what they speak and they want all the people to follow their footprints,But unfortunately they are so dumb enough to realise that their life itself is already in a horrible stage. Those people who think that their life is full of sadness and consider it as useless, should always remember that \u201cLife won't adjust with us,we are the ones who make the life Beautiful\" Ofcourse, we also will have a lot of sorrows too,but we need to be flexible enough to take it in a positive way!

            "answer_text": "Wisdom and Happiness are the states of mind. Let me help you with this. You feel wise enough to answer any questions. You feel wise enough to be of help to someone. You are wise enough to do some task. Wisdom is a quality of your state. A person cannot be wiser than everybody in every situation. It is an ideal situation, highly unlikely to happen. I might be wiser than you when it comes to problems in relationships and you might be wiser than me when it comes to career guidance (funny because my career is facing quite a few struggles right now). Same is the case with happiness. You might be happier than me when it comes to playing video games, I might be happier than you while reading a novel. Wisdom. Happiness. Sadness. Comparable states of mind. Subjective per se. So, I might be sad right now that I am not getting any breakfast to eat and I'm sitting here waiting for my mom call my name in absolute rage so that I end up running fast enough to get a plate and serve myself. But I am wise enough to answer this question of yours and happy enough to be of help. Peace. ",
