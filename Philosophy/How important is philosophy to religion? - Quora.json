            "answer_text": "Here are two quotations: \u201cNothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.\u201d \u2014 Ralph Waldo Emerson \u201cMan is the measure of all things.\u201d \u2014 Protagorus of Abdera Religion might reject either of these perspectives. And yet, a spiritual life bears witness to either as profoundly true. Once we relinquish the illusions of thought and conceptuality, there awakens a mind profoundly aware and perhaps eventually conscious of a singular, esoteric truth: Through such emptiness, a Grand Silence permeates One and All. As \u201cthe magic is in the ordinary\u201d, are the capital letters for additional emphasis or out of respect for the ineffable quality of our existence? Some would argue that such grammatical allegiance is residual religiosity, as if an inescapable gavity has so altered the mind. Couldn\u2019t wisdom surpass all notions? Philosophy is nothing more or less than a love of wisdom. Wisdom is the capacity to see things as they are. While logic is more favorable to linguistic comprehension; epistomology considers one\u2019s consideration; aesthetics resonates with awe, in and of itself; but, ontological curiosity may illuminate the mind to rely on the very source of our being. So, does faith supercede belief? Philosophy may lead one astray or challenge one to awaken in the here and now. When the utility of metaphorical language recedes, there is always \u2014 All This and the suffusing Silence combined! ",

            "answer_text": "Historically, Catholic belief is essentially married to philosophy. Protestants tend to have a stormy relationship, some left the house and threw away the key, while others are trying reconciliation. Islam used to be in loving and mutual relationship, but then decided to go all macho. Judaism kind if does their own thing, they are talking though,\u2026 Eastern religions had a couple of dates but decided that they were too incompatible. Philosophy kind of keeps stalking them, posting blurry, hardly-recognizable pics online. Catholics do not like that, unsurprisingly. Philosophy tends to think of itself as a free spirit, but it is really just in an unhappy relationship with theology. They are often contemplating to sue for divorce, but then, who will fund them? who will listen to them? And how to untangle all the assets, they have been together for thousands of years? And, worst of all, theology is not allowed to have a divorce anyway, so there is no point, really. I often suspect they would love to marry science instead, but science no longer loves them. Science was courting them for centuries, making little secret visits and publicly announcing their undying love and admiration. However, recently, they have pretty much given up on philosophy, it is like they don't even speak the same language anymore. Philosophy has started an affair with history instead, they share many common interests, so let's see how that turns out, given that history has started dating science a bit more seriously. It is really like a soup opera, once you start thinking about it. ",

            "answer_text": "In terms of Christianity, it\u2019s taken very seriously. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Early Church Fathers, Pascal, Soren Kierkeggard, Calvin, Luther, and Jonathan Edwards all have philosophical benevides. You find this in Lewis, Alister McGrath, Tim Keller, NT Wright, and a number of other moderns as well. The fundamental philosophical challenges of Jesus and Paul bespeak this: What is the treasure of your heart? What are your loves? What are your desires?Who do they say I am?Who is your neighbor? Who is your brother?What is human value and purpose?These are meaty and fundamental issues. These are the issues that the New Testament and specifically the Gospels dealsdirectly with. And they are issues that the Psalms at least touch upon. ",
