            "answer_text": "Yes, philosophy should exist. Should comes from German, from schuld which means a debt, should implies an indebtedness. Philosophy quite literally means love of wisdom, philos is brotherly love, but has been consistently interpreted in the sense of eros, physical love, since at least Socrates. But, the ancient Greeks did not yet have the concept of amor, the courtly love that begins with a beatific vision of the beloved which the lover strives to keep close to his heart and live with courage to the ideal his beloved calls forth from him. And, if I had to rename philosophy today, or perhaps to rechristen philosophy anew, I would call it amorosophy (or something close, I\u2019m willing to listen to the linguists on this one). Anyway, is a love for wisdom indebted to exist, absolutely. What is such a love indebted to, to the beatific vision of wisdom that once glanced upon will change a devoted heart forever. I mean, because surely you cannot be asking if I should quit doing something that I love because of someone else\u2019s opinion? Right, because that\u2019s just ridiculous. ",

            "answer_text": "I won't tell you if it should exist but I will give you some examples on what would happen if it didn't exist. First and foremost, mathematics, physics and other sciences wouldn't exist thus humanity could never be in the same level it is now!We would live in a world of anarchy.Philosophers are the ones that create rules hence if they didn't exist societies wouldn't exist either!We would probably live under terrible conditions of war, dictatorship and there would be no ethical limitations to your actions!Connected to the above but I feel it should be in a category of its own. No ethics and freedom of speech would exist\u2026Imagine that!This question and answer wouldn't existThanks for your time ",
