We all are actors on a stage, playing a part in the play directed and created by ourselves as we experience our \u2018Life\u2019s Dramas;\u2019 each actor has his/her role to play, as their entrances and exits happen when they should. There is an unseen orchestration going on behind the scenes, which the audience is totally aware of, in order for our \u2018Life\u2019s Dramas\u2019 to unfold with impeccable timing. ",
