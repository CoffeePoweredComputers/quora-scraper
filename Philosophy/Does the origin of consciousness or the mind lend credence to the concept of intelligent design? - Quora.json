            "answer_text": "Not really. Why? - If all thing were created by some such intelligence - then there would be a perfect state = that which never changes - once perfect always perfect - nothing to compare its self to; thus cannot know even its self to exist nor need a motive to change to exist. The term \u201cconsciousness\u201d and \u201ccognitive awareness\u201d are very different terms is their essence of use; and, our human Theory of why and how such levels came to be and are applied to things: Both literally and metaphorically is the realm of true philosophy. Although, often loosely interchangeable are these terms generally addressing the idea of having mindful sense of presence, but not necessarily the mystic ability is fully understood how we learn and bring past experience analysis forward to a given moment and project acceptation and expectations of future possible consequence of some or a probable range of variable consequence that might result happens as for being human or any other life form might reflect of ability. This is uniquely a chance happenstance of human kind evolution to the extent of creating means and ways to survive and thrive\u2026 or paradox to intentionally destroy and corrupt that which we are dependent upon for sustainability as a species of life form = a state of profound imperfection = the ability to and motive to change is the evidence of presence and comparative consequence of other life or inanimate things we can experience (But in molecular motion, too): = Results that showed up and just propagated an ability to process that experience giving rise to a uniquely developed brain matrix of composition character of chemistry and physical form relative to other brain bearing life-forms, or otherwise \u201cliving\u201d things such as a flower or tree are technically a \u201cliving thing.\u201d \u201cIntelligence\u201d is a relative term, an invented idea of comparative measure of cause and effect as we human would dictate it to justify or judge the content of emotional and our then operational behavioral consequences in context to all other person, place and things. (We like to love of self-experience - not that it loves us back is not the reality - a different topic). The reason for the idea of some (divine or singular force) of creationism by some \u201cIntelligence Design (er)\u201d is to excuse our imperfection = that is non-sequitur in and of its self then to rationalize some support such designer creator exists - Because, Perfect cannot create anything of imperfection - Nor even know imperfection to exist discounts its perfection to create. Mythology is our narrative to question our imperfect ideas of experience as a living thing that has a \u201cbrain\u201d comprehend sensory experiences of simulations of how we human conceive some consciousness of \u201creality\u201d {Which is relative term, too}. OUR sense of existence is THEATER OF THE MIND and mind is an elusive scripted narrative of allusive content of contextual composition of being \u201cwe\u201d merely finds our self ever the philosophers (Greek origin) merely Actors\u2026 strutting upon the stage we think to think our reality is merely always asking what do we know to think we know or can know not of certainty, we know to know (Philo = Love/love of & Sophy = Knowing/knowledge) and not opinion but a process of means and ways to validate the veracity of our experiences\u2026 is our entertainment to justify our existence has some purpose - We human are otherwise inconsequential to the planet to sustain life: We are the most expendable life form or useful residue of solid form contribution. IF WE were intelligently a product of some creative entity - That thing is hardly artistic nor all that smart, nor would it or could it think to come up with an excuse to blame human for their constructive or destructive nature and have them suffer for the divines failure to be perfect - Very narcissistic to an extreme\u2026 don\u2019t you think? Why have it be of any need for the Universe of all things go though some process of change and assimilation - How imperfect is that as a plan can one come up with\u2026 What\u2019s the point\u2026 just cut to the entry on stage and exit - skip all the in between? \u2026 We are freelance and to some extent all things within our sensory comprehension are often comical characters clearly imperfect but proudly funny\u2026 Which is why we least important life form species just happen to evolve the intensity to laugh at our pretentious supposition we are of such ego to assume we are the most intelligence creature of all - Who decided that the tell to tale WE LIKE to tell? Well, that depends on the degree of perfection we might demonstrate or some other life form known or not of yet, or the totality of all possibility is NOT anywhere to be found to claim it so or know UNTIL and UNLESS that which is of an \u201cabsolute\u201d = \u201cThat which is always, anywhere and everywhere, the same\u201d is nailed down tight. It\u2019s not going to happen\u2026 as it is always in motion, never in a perfect static state\u2026 if it was, you would not know it to reveal its self\u2026 even to its own self is inherently not a likely possibility a perfect creation or creator of anything can know it\u2019s self to exist. - That\u2019s evolution\u2026 just think of it as play of things and cast of characters \u2026 AND how OH, how we love the contest between protagonist and antagonist, winner-loser, and only occasionally the win-win happy ending ever after tales we tell the children or the adults still of like maturity to have them believe in and act on - is fun even if our preference is for disruption of harmony sells more tickets to movies, plays on stage and books - and we wonder why we feel stressed - aware of it - then laugh at the irony of it\u2026 but seldom seem to want the experience of acceptation and expectation to align to a constant state of harmony - We\u2019d be bored to death - literally until we are dead and not mindfully conscious or cognitive players anymore. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the show\u2026 and even when the curtain closes on one drama\u2026 or you\u2019re dead of mind to know to even think its over - your pile of residue subject to some possible energy entropy; You will just be recycled back into the work in progress script of the play of things as something more than not of chance. That\u2019s as close to immortality as you\u2019ll get - once human, not what made you that thing in form, may retake form as a toaster oven or a carrot to eat - There goes the pure vegetarian thing - what was once meat and become a carrot on the come back.

            "answer_text": "No, because Intelligent Design is a scam and an intellectual con trick. Its main argument is poor and could be use to argue for magic being real. Read A Refutation of Intelligent Design. It is also invalidated by evidence. Read Microbiome shows the fragility of Intelligent Design. Advocate's poor understanding of biology lead them to make ludicrous claims which come apart as we have a greater appreciation of how all living systems are interconnected. My final contribution is my factual piss-take of their favourite irreducibly complex organ, the eye. Read and enjoy! Consider the vertebrate eye. It is complex and beautiful allowing the organism to see light. It also has a problem in its fundamental design. Smack in the centre of its field of view, there is a blindspot with no rods and cones. This results in extra processing required in the brain. This is due to the optic nerve being joined to the eyeball there. Now look at the cephalopod's eye. It is very similar to the vertebrate eye but its optic nerve is connected at the side of the eye. Hence no blindspot in its field of view. Both eye designs work but here is the nub. If there is a Designer, the Designer is pernicious in giving a squid a better eye than Man. Alternatively, the Designer really is not that Intelligent! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It is impossible for purely naturalistic theories to account for \u201cthe origin of consciousness or the mind\u201d. The simplest way to see this is to turn naturalism back on itself since it claims to explain why we\u2019re thinking the thoughts we have now. But that means they are not really thoughts but just electric signals, etc. Yet we are aware that we do think real thoughts so naturalistic theories fail to account for reality. On the other hand, the hypothesis of intelligent design at least enables the possibility of a genuine explanation of \u201cthe origin of consciousness or the mind\u201d. That\u2019s as far as they goes for now, but that much is a stretch for many people today. ",

The Universe becomes conscious of itself through human beings. That\u2019s supremely wonderful, beautiful and awesome!
