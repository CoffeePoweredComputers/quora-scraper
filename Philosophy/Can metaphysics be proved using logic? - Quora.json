            "answer_text": "No,never,never and never. Logic can\u2019t prove metaphysics. Even logic misinterpreted some observable facts so how could it be able to prove metaphysics which lies beyond perception. The pre westren Logicians and Philosphers believed in world past eternity but now it has been discredited by Big Bang cosmology.They were sure about it because they adopted this position after rational and logical thinking. It also inspired Muslim thinkers like Ibn Sina and Ibn Rushd who followed Aristottle in this regard. They claimed that universe,being an effect can coexist along with its cause,GOD because the priority of cause to the effect is mere in essence and rank not in time. But Al Ghazali clearly separated metaphysics from logic. He said that it is impossible to prove metaphysics using logical premises. Those who want to prove it will fail. They will reach to the conclusion that religion is based on mere supersititions as it has no rational,empirical and logical support. But actually it is the unvalidity of logic rather religion.He strongly criticised such philosphers in his famous book\u201cThe incoherence of Philosphers\u201d which made him a controversial figure. He said you are free to do science and those religious scholars who reject science,harm religion rather science. You may believe in spherical or flat earth on the base of evidences. You may assume any scientific cause for solar and lunar eclipse etc beyond religious interpretation.Scientific proofs are exact and repeatable.He further said that faithful shouldn't be worried at all about advancement in science and those who view science as a thread to religion and for this purpose repute science as a religious duty, weaken religion.The athiest find satisfaction in viewing religion and science contrary to each other. So Ghazali didn't repute any scientific proven fact outside the metaphysical domain.I mean that Ghazali was in full favour of science but wasn\u2019t happy with those who used logic to prove metaphysics because it discredited religion like Logical positivists who said that metaphysics is meaningless. In other words it means that religion is meaningless. Muslim theologians criticised world past eternity belief of Philosphers on the base of their evidences which were less attractive in the realm of rationality and some what religious but time proved that theologians were correct and Philospher were wrong. Theologians were thought to be pseudo intellectuals by so called Philosphers but science at some points supported Theologians intrepretation and rejected philosphical interpretation.Hence we should keep metaphysics separate from logic.

            "answer_text": "Logic itself IS METAPHYSICAL ! Ask yourself, \u201cWhen was the last time I literally tripped over a law of logic\u201d? Logic is the immaterial essence of mind. Go back and study the pre-Socratic philosophers especially Heraclitus and those who came after him. Note how they used the term Logos. Then read the Gospel of John chapter one and note how Christianity used the term Logos. They are one and the same. The Pre-Socratic philosopher's held that there was a divine Logos (Mind) behind the universe itself. Logos means Mind, Reason, Logic, Wisdom and Word. In John chapter one the term Word is Logos. Read the first 17 verses of John and it becomes self explanatory. Plato's metaphysics of Idealism was based on his conception of Logos. Plato and Aristotle were both Rationalists but Aristotle based his metaphysics on Realism. Both systems are profound. But I don't think Plato is given enough credit. Find a competent commentator on Plato and you will be amazed at how brilliant his system really is. Most seem to follow Aristotle for good reason but both systems are profound. Aristotle's system includes all of physics which most prefer over an ideal world. Whether you realize it or not, there is a Metaphysics of Logic. Google it and see what comes up. Any time we debate the nature of reality we are doing metaphysics. All thinking is metaphysical by nature. The mind itself is a metaphysical construct. The metaphysics of logic is the domain of professional philosopher's who argue and debate the nature of logic itself. There is no universal consensus on logic as many wrongly suppose. Sure, we have \u201csome\u201d agreed upon rules but nothing is actually cut and dried one size fits all in logic. Logical fallacies aren't always logical fallacies for example. As said, the big boys don't agree on logic and they never will. Logic and epistemology were subfields in the classical metaphysics of Aristotle. Aristotle was the one who actually discovered logic. For 2,000 years when anyone discussed logic they were discussing the logic of Aristotle. I would conclude by saying that Metaphysics has the uncanny ability and knack for burying its undertakers. Metaphysics isn't just the invisible elephant in every room of the house of Being, but it is the foreground and background and underground and the very structure of the house of Being itself. All perception is a metaphysical abstraction of mind. ",

            "answer_text": "The word \u201cproof\u201d has become saturated with misunderstanding. To avoid that term, I will rephrase your question in the hope that it preserves the essential meaning, and where it doesn\u2019t, hope that I have made the appropriate correction. Can metaphysical principles and claims can be demonstrated? Here I would answer: it depends. For example, first principles cannot be proved, that is to say, their truth cannot be demonstrated precisely because they are first principles. The principle of non-contradiction (PNC) is one such example. Its truth cannot be demonstrated and need not be demonstrated because it is self-evident. You cannot coherently deny PNC because the very act of denying it presupposes the PNC. To require demonstration of the PNC is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of demonstration. Now ask yourself: do things change? That things change is evident to us and is not something that requires demonstration nor could such a thing be demonstrated. However, on the basis of that fact, we can begin a demonstration of something like the theory of act and potency. A demonstration takes us from self-evident, evident and possibly other demonstrable truths to still other demonstrable truths, tacitly or through explicit appeals. Generally speaking, none of this means that there is no debate among metaphysicians \u2014 of course there is, just like there is any other field \u2014 but it does not follow that the truth of metaphysical claims cannot in principle be demonstrated.

            "answer_text": "The consistency of a metaphysical theory can be determined with logic. It's truth cannot. The validity of a metaphysical argument can be determined with logic. It's soundness cannot. In general, metaphysics cannot tell us what there is, but it can tell us what there can be and what cannot be. So, if you have two scientific theories with irreconcilable presuppositions or axioms, then metaphysics can tell you \u201csorry mate, can't have it both ways: pick one or none\u201d. The above applies for realist metaphysics. Anti-realist metaphysics is a completely different beast and there's no point of even talking to people who accept it :D ",
