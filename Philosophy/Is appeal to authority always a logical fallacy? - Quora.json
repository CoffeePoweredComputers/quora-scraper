            "answer_text": "I guess it depends on three factors: How extraordinary is the claim being made by the authority figure?How reliable has the authority figure been in the past (and are they really an authority in the field from which they\u2019re making the claim)?Is it possible or practical for you to verify their claim yourself?The universe is an inconceivably complicated place, no one person can be expected to have even a miniscule fraction of the knowledge necessary to fully evaluate every one of the thousands of claims (or \u2018truths\u2019) that they encounter on a daily basis. Therefore we must rely on authorities just to get through our daily lives. For example, if the announcer at the train station tells you that your 7:00 am train will arrive ten minutes late you should probably believe them for three reasons: The claim they\u2019re making is extremely ordinary \u2013 trains are often late.The station announcer has a track record of providing mostly accurate information on late trains (and that\u2019s their job).There is no practical way for you to verify this information yourself (I mean in the sense that you can\u2019t physically go to the train and verify its current position yourself).At the opposite end of the spectrum, if a former movie star tells you that you can cure your cancer by taking a bath in tomato juice, you might want to be just a little bit more sceptical.

            "answer_text": "Yes, appeal to authority always is a logical fallacy. That doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t do it. Rather, it means that we should phrase our statement accordingly. For example, supposing we are talking about for example deductive logic, to say \u201cI take his word for it because I don\u2019t have the time to check\u201d would probably be not only factually true that this is what you are doing, but also the rational thing to do, and so, not possibly a fallacy. However, saying \u201cI take his word for it because he has a PhD in Quantum physics\u201d would be fallacious since from the fact that one has a PhD in Quantum physics, it doesn\u2019t follow that you understand deductive logic at all. We also need to remember that a fallacious reasoning doesn\u2019t imply a false conclusion, and so although appeal to authority implies logical fallacy, it doesn\u2019t implies false conclusion, not least because the authority appealed to might be right. The point, though, is that being right doesn\u2019t make the reasoning valid. And appeal to authority is always the wrong kind of argument. ",
