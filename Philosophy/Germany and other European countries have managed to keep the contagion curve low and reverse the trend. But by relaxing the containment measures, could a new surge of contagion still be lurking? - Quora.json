The only way you can remove the risk is vaccinating everyone but nobody can tell you when we could develop one and when we can have it available for everybody. So after any lock down has been removed, any sane countries would then require everyone to continue the social distancing and/or wearing of the mask for another couple of incubation cycle before determining whether is it still necessary to continue such restriction. Only when there are several incubation cycles of NO infection, would you expect the country to remove the requirement of social distancing or wearing of mask. Very likely they will still monitor the situation in neighboring country as well before making such decision. ",

            "answer_text": "Covind 19: 1. Just now we have no idea whish method is best. We will only know after 2 years. 2. Closing down totally may temporarily break the speed of spread of this virus. But as long as most people has not got immunity the virus will come back when lockdown is stoped and replaced with a more open policy. Only by getting the infection and survive, or by getting a vaccine people may get immunity. Still there are lots we do not know about the behavior of this Covind 19 virus yet. 3. The price of lockdown is also destruction of the economy, many people get bad health hence more likely to get other infections later, more suicides etc. A Swedish expert Johan Giesecke states that in the film Jurassic Park dinosaurs did find a way out of the park because \"Life finds a way\", and in the same way Covind19 will find ways regardless what we do untilled enough many people are immune. 4. Without a lockdown Sweden is still NOT totally open. People follow government recommendations in Sweden, normally anyway. And we have many instructions. 5. Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, is reported to have about 30% of the population infected, most people without any severe problems. And by the summer it is estimated that Stockholm (but not the rest of Sweden) will have herd immunity. In other words so many people will be immune that the spread of the virus stops as when an infected person spread virus it will go to people already immune. ",

The U.S mortality rate is less than half of that for the average of UK, Germany, Spain, Italy, and France whose combined population is about the same as ours.
