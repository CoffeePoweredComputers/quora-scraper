            "answer_text": "His best is The Thin Red Line, which is an incredible masterpiece, and one of the best war films in cinema history.  (EDIT: I'll add that very close behind this film is Tree of Life, another brilliant film that is just a hair away from a tie for first place.) For \"worst,\" a term which honestly doesn't apply at all to Malick's films at all in my opinion, the only way I can provide an answer is to define \"worst\" as \"the one that's at the bottom of the list if his films are listed in order from greatest to least-great.\" Thus his \"least-great\" great film would probably be Lanton Mills, due to being shorter and thus examining less themes and having less time to establish as much artistic expression as his other films, plus the fact that it's his first film and he was still learning the ropes so to speak, compared to later films.

            "answer_text": "I have to say Badlands is his best film overall, as I most consistently enjoy watching it. I'd say that Days of Heaven is the most beautiful, followed by Tree of Life. I'll agree with Mark Hughes that \"worst\" is hard term to apply to someone like Malick. I found The Thin Red Line to be confusing, but I'm also willing to think that that was his intention.  I also saw To The Wonder recently, and wasn't blown away by it. The story and characters weren't all that compelling. It was shot gorgeously, but repeated a lot of the techniques of cinematography and muted-speech-without-dialogue from Tree of Life.  Has Lanton Mills been released? I've read that it is only viewable at the American Film Institute. ",
