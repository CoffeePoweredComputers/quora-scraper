            "answer_text": "Well, the first answer from Robert Hayes makes a lot of sense to me. See an Ophthalmologist and ask him or her if you have a potentially blinding disorder. Of course in most cases, if they are honest with you, the Ophthalmologist will tell you they don't know. If you are already blind, it's a little easier to tell you if you are likely to stay blind or regain some vision, but if you are not blind it's quite hard to predict if or when you will go blind. If you don't want to go to have your eyes checked by a professional, but would like to try to figure this out for yourself, you could decide what disease you think you have (preferably a blinding one in order to answer your own question), and then look up how frequently people go blind with that condition. There are lists of diseases in world blindness studies that could give you a starting point. If you decide to pick a disease that would otherwise be treatable, but you still don't want to see an Ophthalmologist, you can speed up the estimated time to blindness considerably by avoiding treatment. A good sign that you MAY actually be going blind, would be a rapid decrease in vision in one or both eyes. Again, by not seeking care, I would say that you would increase your odds of actually succeeding in going blind. There you have it. If you think you may be going blind, or are losing vision, go see an Ophthalmologist or optometrist. Or don't. And \u201csee\u201d* what happens. Maybe you will eventually go blind. Probably not. But don't expect a good answer on Quora to a vague medical question like that. Instead, you will get answers like this one. *(just a little ophthalmology joke there) ",

My injuries occurred in late 1977 and I really didn't notice much change till couple months ago. The bag in my left eye ruptured by but the leak was very small nut through the years the tear got larger so I'm losing more fluid. I have a total blind spot about center left and now have to use very dark sunglass plus and I patch when in sunlight. Like many things you gradually get use to this things but they are super annoying. I'm really hoping that the surgery at least slows it down or causes a complete stop. And if not I'll learn to live with it, what other choice do i have. I'm extremely grateful for the job my doctors at the VA have done for me and others. ",
