If the universe is a simulation, then it must be simulating your consciousness\u2014 else how could you be having the thoughts you do? (You are \u2018thinking,\u2019 aren\u2019t you?) And now, you are also asking if reality is \u2018real!\u2019 Strangely enough, this kind of problem was explored in creating set theory in mathematics! \u201cSet theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used to define nearly all mathematical objects. \u201cThe modern study of set theory was initiated by Georg Cantor and Richard Dedekind in the 1870s. After the discovery of paradoxes in naive set theory, such as Russell's paradox, numerous axiom systems were proposed in the early twentieth century, of which the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms, with or without the axiom of choice, are the best-known. \u2026 \u201cElementary set theory can be studied informally and intuitively, and so can be taught in primary schools using Venn diagrams. The intuitive approach tacitly assumes that a set may be formed from the class of all objects satisfying any particular defining condition. This assumption gives rise to paradoxes, the simplest and best known of which are Russell's paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox. Axiomatic set theory was originally devised to rid set theory of such paradoxes \u201d See in Set theory - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "He who stares at stars trips on roots. Cree Proverb I recall reading about an exchange between Carl Sagan and an elderly lady following a conference he spoke at. The lady wanted to challenge him about his view that the Earth was indeed orbiting in space around the Sun. She argued that the Earth was resting on top of a giant turtle. Sagan asked her what that turtle was resting on. She responded another turtle. So then Sagan asked her well what is that turtle resting on? And she responded it's turtles all the way down! The claim we are living in a simulation reminds me of the fallacious logic present in the woman's response to Sagan: its focuses less on attempting to explain the world as it is while focusing more on how the world is believed to be. The human imagination is a wonderful tool; however, if it is not grounded or reined in or balanced against what we actual know about the world it seems to give people permission to think magically as opposed to materially. The result is the egg-within-the-egg logic of a reality inside another reality which is inside another reality ad absurdum. Reality in all likelihood is simply what we are living in and directly experiencing. There is no ostensible need to explain the world in terms of simulations; moreover, the claim we are living in a simulation is not even falsifiable, I.e. the simulation's creators would certainly control every possible variable and every law in Nature we have identified in our reality would be inviolable. The world would look exactly as it currently does. We would lack the means of seeing outside to the primary reality. ",
