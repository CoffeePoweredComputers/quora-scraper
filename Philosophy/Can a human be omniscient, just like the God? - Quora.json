            "answer_text": "No. Our current understanding of the universe tells us that omniscience is not just a practical impossibility but a theoretical one as well. Two examples: On a cosmic scale, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. One consequence of that is that any object in the universe can be thought of as having a \"light cone\": imagine a burst of photons spreading out from you in every conceivable direction - and a corresponding stream of photons reaching you from every conceivable direction. Now imagine something that is outside that light cone. What does that mean? It means something that is further away from us in space than light is able to travel in the time between the two events. Physicists call this a space-like separation. Why is that important? Because nothing, including information, can travel faster than light, we can't know what's happening at any point that has a space-like separation from us until its lightcone overlaps with ours. Until that happens we are effectively blind to what's going on there.  That's a pretty big barrier to omniscience. Then there's Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which tells us that the product of the standard deviations of a quantum particle's position and momentum must be greater than the reduced Planck constant. That is, we can never know the position and momentum of anything precisely: if we know its position perfectly, we cannot know anything about its momentum, or vice versa. (Or, more likely, we know both to some degree but have a bit of uncertainty about them). The uncertainty principle is often described in popular science books as a measurement error - by measuring one aspect you disturb some other aspect and so introduce the uncertainty - but it's more fundamental than that. It's a quality that's inherent in all wave-like systems. So, you can't know about everything in the universe at the same time, and you can't know everything about even a single particle at once. Humans can't be omniscient and it's very hard to see how anything else could be, either. ",

We have in the order of 10\u00b9\u00b9 neurons and 10\u00b9\u2075 synapses. With visible universe with 10\u2078\u2070 particles in a total of 10\u00b2\u00b2 solar systems it is obvious that the universe has many more states then our brain.  There are 7 billion minds on this planet alone, and they are all roughly equal in power and memory capacity to mine. How can my one mind contain all they know? Our brain is just to smallAnd when you take into account that an elephant has 3 times as many neurons then you realize that most of our brain is dedicated to sensing and controling the body. ",

Basically the idea is that an omniscient super-human being could predict the future if it knows everything about the current state of the universe. If you check the arguments against Laplace's demon in the article you see that there are problems both with \"knowing everything about the current state of the universe\", \"predicting the future\" and \"knowing everything about yourself\". The thing is that some of those are limits of the universe not of an individuals cognition, other limits get harder the closer you get to omniscience.Even if we assume that knowing everything about our universe counts as omniscience there is so much raw information that it is not possible to represent that with the limited amount of brain cells in a human brain.",

It carries the connotation of necessity, that the one who is omniscient must know all things. Consider the CPU on your computer and all of the processes it monitors. When it comes to your computer, the CPU may be said to know everything. But, are you aware of all these events? Do you need to be aware? Worse still, the idea of omniscience really clashes with the quality of omnipotence. An all powerful being cannot be bound by necessity. So, for example, God has no more obligation to be aware of our future than you or I have to read the last page of the whodunnit. ",
