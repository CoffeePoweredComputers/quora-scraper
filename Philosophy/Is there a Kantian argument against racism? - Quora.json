You wouldn\u2019t will that people be racists or stereotype you. Act so that you don\u2019t use humanity as a means, but treat it only as an ends. Racism treats others as a means to your ego and in doing so uses them. The core of his philosophy is human dignity. Racism is dehumanizing and doesn\u2019t respect the dignity of others. These same principles seem to apply to all forms of rational discussion (i.e. name calling and like I alluded to earlier stereotypes of all types). ",
