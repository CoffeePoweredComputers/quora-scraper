            "answer_text": "There is a famous quote given by Descartes which says : \u201cCogito Ergo Sum\u201d (I think, therefore I am) According to him, a person can just be aware of his/her own consciousness and thus can be sure about his/her own existence, but there is no way for him/her to be sure about the existence of any other person as there is absolutely no way to feel or verify the consciousness of another person. Descartes puts it in a beautiful way saying that when I stand in a window looking down the streets, I really doubt if the people passing by are human beings or just some automaton. Also, this hypothesis doesn\u2019t seem that weird given the advances in science and technology in this modern age. With the advancements in AI and ML, we are getting closer and closer to build robots with exactly human like features. Let\u2019s assume we have built a robot which is exactly like a human, that is to say looks like a human, talks like a human and has the average human intelligence. Do you think you can differentiate in a human being and such a robot given no prior knowledge? There is absolutely no way to verify if the person standing in front of you is actually thinking or there are just a bunch of algorithms running that makes us feel like the person is thinking. Thus Descartes summarizes by saying that I think and therefore I am. This hypothesis can further be extended to the thought of there exists just a unique and single consciousness throughout. But, I guess this is out of the scope of the question asked. I hope I answered your question! P.S - This is my first Quora answer. I would really appreciate some reviews and feedback's. ",
