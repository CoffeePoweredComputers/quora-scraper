            "answer_text": "Like any physicist, Einstein certainly knew and used a substantial amount of advanced mathematics. But, no, it is not accurate to call him a mathematician. Einstein was a physicist. His degrees were all in physics. His academic publications were all in physics. His academic appointments were all in physics. He did not contribute to the field of mathematics per se. Newton, on the other hand, would be an example of a physicist who was also a mathematician. He made significant contributions to the advancement of both physics and mathematics. Two or three hundred years ago there were quite a few people who made important contributions to both mathematics and physics. These include, for example, Euler, Lagrange, Hamilton, Fourier, Gauss, and Laplace. In more recent times it is far less common, but there are some, such as Weyl, von Neumann, Dyson, and Penrose. ",

He created  a framework which used some great mathematics, specifically what I think can be generally called differential geometry. But no, not really. He didn't seem to take an interest in mathematical topics for t  heir own sake, as did Dirac and Dyson.  Nope.  ",
