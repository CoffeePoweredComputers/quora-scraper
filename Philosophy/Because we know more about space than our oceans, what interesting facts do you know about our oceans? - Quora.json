            "answer_text": "I have a few quibbles about the premise being more based on an ocean science funding sales pitch than fact. More is spent on maritime activities than spaceflight. I don\u2019t begrudge those researchers shaking the tree to see what drops. That said billions are fed from the ocean every day. The top 33' or 10m of the ocean contains an equivalent mass and heat content of the entire atmosphere. Not all ocean science is bathemetry, mapping, or hydro-graphic survey. Satellites and remote sensing are important ocean observation and monitoring tools. The narrative of either ocean observation or spaceflight is a false one. They are complementary pursuits. Many astronaut applicants take up scuba diving to improve their application. ",

In 2016, science described around 18,000 new plant and animal species. Some resemble figures from popular culture, others a nightmare come to life. Some were found lurking underground or beneath the sea, while many had been hiding in plain sight all along. In 2016, scientists discovered 18,000 new species. Now meet the Top 10 ",

We know even microscopic lifeforms living there and ocean is thoroughly mapped.Space on the other side is near infinitely larger than puny oceans. We know nearly nothing about space, we know only very rough outlines of what is knowable about space. ",
