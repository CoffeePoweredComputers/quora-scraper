            "answer_text": "Socrates was famous for revealing the flaws and vanities of his opponents\u2019 thought processes through asking seemingly \u2018innocent\u2019 questions. If there is one chief characteristic of the Socratic method, it must be this one. Making inquiries of holders of very strong opinions is a typical approach, where you provide the target with a lot of \u2018rope\u2019 to hang themselves. Essentially, the Socratic Method of debate consists of being cooperative with your opponent, you accept the premise/s which they offer at first, and you determine the merit of these positions as they are revealed. What tends to happen is that your opponent reveals flaws in their critical thinking, they demonstrate the assumptions and presumptions which have given rise to how they think about the topic in question. Socrates famously questioned his opponents and offered suggestions as to why their conclusions might be false, given their acceptance of conditions Socrates got them to agree on during the course of his questions, and the to-and-fro of the dialog. You might say this method is \u2018didactic\u2019 in the sense that it gains the cooperation of your opponent in agreeing on certain principles, and accepted facts, thereby clearly showing your opponent why their original premise/s might have been deeply flawed. The only real problem with this is that it can get you killed. People dislike being proved wrong, or made to seem foolish, and this is why Socrates found himself having to take Hemlock, and kill himself because he had made such enemies of the city state, of Athens. What usually happens is people begin finding excuses and reasons as to why you are a \u2018bad person\u2019, and thus by stealth and dishonest means you are conveniently incarcerated, or removed from office, or \u2018ruined\u2019 in some other way. Accusations of wrongdoing which might have nothing to do with the original matter will appear, which in the case of Socrates was the charge that he was \u2018corrupting the youth\u2019 of Athens with his dangerous ideas, and questioning methods. I don\u2019t recommend the Socratic method, for these reasons. ",

            "answer_text": "Read the Platonic dialogs. Here is a quick list of critical thinking questions for the classroom setting: What is this saying?Is any part of it confusing?Why is it significant?What is the evidence, data, or justification?What are the assumptions?Are there any tricky definitions?What is the context?What is the inference?What is the opportunity cost of this view?How could you improve this?What was the most memorable?What worked? What didn\u2019t?(How do two arguments compare in terms of evidence or inference) Not all 12 questions are necessary. This set of questions combines critical thinking and writing skills. Here is an article on this topic that I was impressed with: Socratic Questioning: 30 Thought-Provoking Questions to Ask Your Students | InformED Interestingly enough the article speaks about questions that take it back to the nature of education in addition. I think that would usually only be effective a one or perhaps a couple times during the semester. But in the same way that you can talk about rules in the classroom\u2014talking about the purpose of why you are there can be helpful. Also, there is the learning in the reflection on the issues involved. If its an education class\u2014there may be much more value in revisiting these questions over time. Finally, the Blooms taxonomy questions might be helpful. It has a hierarchy, which involves a distinction between lower order thinking and higher order thinking. https://www.bloomstaxonomy.org/Blooms%20Taxonomy%20questions.pdf If you do a Google search on Blooms taxonomy questions there is a pretty colorful diagram which is just one page. (For some reason I can\u2019t insert pics from the web in my posts of late.) I hope all that helps!! What do you want them to learn? Ask questions about that. ",
