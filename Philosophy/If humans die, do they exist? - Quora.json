            "answer_text": "First, please  forgive me, but I do not understand the reference to picking up a shovel or random acts. I fear I may be guilty of picking up a shovel here... If so I apologize It has taken several days to have the time to respond to this question; this is related to death itself. Last night I lay my hand on the very cold and firm face of a 94 year old loved one whose heart slowed to a stop at around four pm. It has been an intense time, these last ten days since hospice came in to ease the passing. Twenty one years older than I, he was someone for whom I felt admiration. I held and stroked his hands and head during some of those terrible times when his consciousness came forth in its confusion and fear. Throughout the nine month transition from semi-autonomous old guy -- to resident of a Veterans Administration nursing home -- to death, his struggles potentially foretold mine yet to come. Thus I was immersed in both empathy and self reflection, and wish to share some of this here. I do not believe in an afterlife. I understand the science of death, and assume that when my heart stops for good what I think of as \"I\" will no longer \"be.\" But, it has been my experience that by seeing something as metaphor, I can gain some clarity. One recent learning was triggered by a blog post in reference to Thoreau's writings being carried on to Gandhi & Dr. King. That led me to a favorite author, Loren Eiseley, and his book The Man Who Saw Through Time. What I'm looking at here is the realization that the writings of Francis Bacon (the subject of the book) as described by Bacon as his hope for his writings, were as \"ships on the sea of time.\" So I come to a (as always, tentatively held) conclusion that while we are alive and upon the sea of time, our words have the potential to be carried on into the future. So now we run smack into the concept of time, and the plot thickens. I have no interest in debating the absolute scientific reality of time. To me it seems a construct that we employ to understand the order in which things happen. Our human concept of time is microscopic from a cosmic perspective. At that juncture, I again turn to metaphor and a marvelous author Susan Howatch. She wrote a novel, Wheel of Fortune, in which a character with deep roots in her Celtic heritage, speaks these words: \u201cThere is no timetable for grief,\u201d said Bronwin Morgan. \u201cGrief isn\u2019t a train which you catch at the station. Grief has its own time, and grief\u2019s time is beyond time, and time itself... isn\u2019t very important. It\u2019s the English who think time is a straight line which can be divided up and labeled and parceled out in an orderly fashion, but time isn\u2019t like that, time is a circle, time goes round and round like a wheel, and that\u2019s why one hears echoes of the past continually -- it\u2019s because the past is present; you don\u2019t have to look back down the straight line, you just look across the circle, and there are the echoes of the past and the vision of the future, and they\u2019re all present, all now, all forever.\u201d Dale Zhao said:  But they do exist to those who know them and love them, and perhaps exist forever in their worlds.  --  I think this is what Susan Howatch speaks of in her book. She goes on to suggest that we will look at a still living person touched by the deceased and see within them characteristics, traits, etc. that are living on. This can often be a function of a love shared between them. This is for me true of my maternal grandfather; he is alive within me and there was truly a love connection. He leads me to the words of Michael Dixon who said:  I feel that I am eternal in a way that I don't understand. Understanding death is not important in this world. I feel love in this world, and I believe love is eternal and beyond death. Hughston Fetner said: ...but I do think there are ways humans exist after death. We exist after death in our writing.There are literally parts of us in our children. When Our bodies die they decompose and become nutrients in a way it is like reincarnation. I think those are the ways we exist after death. And from love to words. My Grandpa was a man of words. He was a linotype operator turning typed words into molten lead cast into solid words on their way to being printed. He wrote poetry and I have read his powerful anti-war poem The War God in public and those words carry on as ships upon the sea of time. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer is in two parts, like the question. The first is fact-based. The second is wishful-thinking. When a human being dies, as with any other animal, it finishes entirely. Humans are animals. Life exists only if there is brain function. Medical science can do wonders in keeping a body going long after that human is dead, but brain death is absolute and final. One of the most successful pieces of religious propaganda ever is the notion that there is a soul separate from the body and that it continues on in an 'afterlife'. This is very comforting for those who have lost someone close to them so in that respect it is a nice amelioration. However it bears no relation to the stark real world. If there was such a thing as a spiritual existence, it would have to physically reside somewhere other than in a body which has finished existing. As we understand now, the only existence that is possible is in the form of matter or energy. Spiritual entities are neither and cannot exist. Belief in the spiritual is a very enticing confusion of thoughts. ",
