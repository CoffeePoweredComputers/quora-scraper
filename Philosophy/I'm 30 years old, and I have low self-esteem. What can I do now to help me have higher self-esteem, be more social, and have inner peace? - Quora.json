            "answer_text": "SELF- ESTEEM  SELF- ESTEEM Self-esteem and self-value are two related terms that are usually used interchangeably. A sense of self-worth means that you value yourself, and having a sense of self-value means that you are worthy. According to Dr. Christina Hibbert \u201cSelf-esteem is what we think and feel and believe about ourselves. Self-worth is recognizing \u2018I am greater than all of those things.\u2019 It is a deep knowing that I am of value, that I am lovable, necessary to this life, and of incomprehensible worth.\u201d (2013) Low self- esteem is multifactorial like cognitive and emotional development and experiences during childhood . It may also be acquired during adulthood from hardship of real life, habits of negative thoughts and inability to cope with negative emotions. The people having a good self- worth are likely to have a good personality and development in all areas of life. They enjoy mental peace, interpersonal relationships, tranquility and harmony. On the contrary, the people suffering from low self-esteem have poor self- image, negative thoughts, feelings and emotions. They have their immune system fragile and consequently suffer from physical, mental and emotional problems. Self love is connected to one's emotions, the love and care of oneself, acceptance of oneself irrespective of who you are and what you are, your flaws, sins, mistakes, all the good or bad stuff you've ingrained in your personality, character and psyche. The following lines found on the net are worth mentioning to enhance one's insights for the development of self- esteem. What is something that no one could ever take away from me?Who am I and who am I not?What kind of person do others expect me to be?What does self-worth mean to me?What false ideas have I been taught about myself?",

            "answer_text": "I've gone through a personal awakening similar to yours but at a younger age - still, I believe that we undergo changes whenever we are ready to make those changes.So, the time for you has come to make a plan for the rest of your life. It's a bit scary and is a bit exciting, isn't it?Please do not hold your age as a deciding factor or an important factor in this progress - some people never awaken and end their lives not knowing what purposeful living is all about. Since you are ready for the journey, and unfortunately your geographic location is missing, I will direct you to one book. You can either purchase it or take a library copy or otherwise locate it online - I am not affiliated with this publication or the author in any way.It's called \"10 secrets to success and inner peace\" by Dr Wayne Dyer. Yes, it's a cheesy title for a wonderful book but if you can just get over that title, you will discover a world of difference.Dr Dyer is a trained psychologist and this book is a summary of what he has learned in 25+ years of practicing his craft.A lot of the book's notions are plain common sense but combined together in a neutral manner, they will jump start your own path to self-development and awaken the real you.The key word here is resonate - there are things which are near and dear to you, and then there are others which you just can't accept. This does not mean that there is something wrong with you - it just means that your set of priorities is different, and as you continue evolving, you may or may not change what resonates with you. ",
