            "answer_text": "No. BLM has a whole different approach, the most important part being that the existing system can be integrated into, and that black people are not being allowed into that system. Malcolm would have said that the system itself is not worth being a part of, and that being a part of it is acceding to exploitation of oneself and others. Earlier in his life he said that exploitation was directed towards persons of color, later in his life he said that it was directed towards persons of a certain mindset. There are two parts to this: One, is that if persons are required to be part of a social/legal/economic system, their rights should be no less than any other persons within that system. And people are required - one cannot just \u201cgo back where one came from\u201d. In this way, his message was the same as Black Lives Matter. Two, that as above, the system is either built purposely to prevent the first point from happening, or if it were not, was not worth associating with as it is corrupt and immoral anyway and unreformable. Therefore, people of conscience should move towards not cooperating or being a part of the system in any way. NEITHER of these parts advocates unilateral violence. It does however (in the first case and somewhat in the second) advocate equal response to violence as reasonable self-defense. Black Lives Matter does not see the system as inherently corrupt, and does not advocate violence in any form. Malcolm X would see them as somewhat naive. Malcolm is a hero of mine. I would highly recommend reading \u201cMalcolm Speaks\u201d as half the race arguments still had on Quora 50 years later are exactly the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. I would say that BLM is similar to Martin Luther King\u2019s ideology. First of all, Malcolm was more radical and a black nationalist. He was ready to die for his people. I don't think that any leader of BLM is ready to sacrifice his life for a better life for African Americans. Even though I support the Black Lives Matter movement, I don't see it being capable to make a change and have an influence the way Malcolm X did. ",
