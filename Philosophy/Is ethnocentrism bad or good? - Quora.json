            "answer_text": "Ethnocentrism is the belief that your own cultural standards are universal and should be respected by all the other cultures. It is not a conscious attitude:it is rather an assumption based on your everyday experiences. You live in a culture which shapes your mind in a deep way, so you may think of something as natural while it is not for other cultures. Think of your family. You have learned that the sisters of your parents are your aunts and that the brothers of your parents are your uncles. But for some culture there is no such thing as an aunt or an uncle. You have cousins. But for some cultures there are no cousins and for some cultures there are different kind of cousins, with a different consideration in the family. And the same is true for colours. The trees may be green for you, but for someone you does not have the color green (not the word \u201cgreen\" for that colour, I mean the colour itself) the tre can be described in a different way. Some cultures have no more than five colours and they are just fine with that. But be careful, ethnocentrism has become an abused term,\u201dethnocentrist\u201d is sometimes used as a pejorative for those who are opposed to extreme cultural relativism.Remember that all the cultures give diffrent solutions to the same human problems, so we have to consider the clear differences while also considering the similarities between cultures.

(August 2018) Ethnocentrism is the act of judging another culture based on preconceptions that are found in values and standards of one's own culture. [1] [2] Ethnocentric behavior involves judging other groups relative to the preconceptions of one's own ethnic group or culture, especially regarding language, behavior, customs, and religion. These aspects or categories are distinctions that define each ethnicity's unique cultural identity. [3] William G. Sumner defined ethnocentrism as \"the technical name for the view of things in which one's own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it.\" He further characterized ethnocentrism as often leading to pride, vanity, belief in one's own group's superiority, and contempt for outsiders. [4] These problems may occur from the dividing of societies into in-groups and out-groups. [5] Ethnocentrism is explained in the social sciences and genetics. In anthropology, cultural relativism is used as an antithesis and antonym to ethnocentrism. [6] Contents 1Origins of the concept2Characteristics3Anthropology3.1Consumer ethnocentrism4Causes5See also6References7External linksThe term \"ethnocentrism\" was coined by Ludwig Gumplowicz [7] [8] and subsequently employed by William G. Sumner. Gumplowicz defined ethnocentrism as the reasons by virtue of which each group of people believed it had always occupied the highest point not only among contemporaneous peoples and nations but also in relation to all peoples of the historical past [9] (Der Rassenkampf, 1883). Although central to anthropology, sociology, psychology, and other disciplines the concept of ethnocentrism has been defined and characterized so variously that some scholars have spoken of the \"disutility of the ethnocentrism concept\" and have wondered whether from the large body of research on ethnocentrism any conclusions could be drawn. [10] William Graham Sumner proposed two different definitions. In the 1906 Folkways, [11] Sumner stated that \"ethnocentrism is the technical name for this view of things in which one's own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it\" (13). In the 1911 War and Other Essays, [12] he wrote that \"the sentiment of cohesion, internal comradeship, and devotion to the in-group, which carries with it a sense of superiority to any out-group and readiness to defend the interests of the in-group against the out-group, is technically known as ethnocentrism\" (11). Forty years later, anthropologist Richard Adams undertook to clear up a confusion. He noted that one scholar, G.P. Murdock, defined ethnocentrism as \"the tendency to exalt the in-group and to depreciate other groups,\" which made out-group antagonism the inevitable concomitant of in-group solidarity, but that another, M. J. Herkovits, defined ethnocentrism as \"the point of view that one's way of life is to be preferred to all others.\" He pointed out that these were two different attitudes, and that it was important to distinguish them. The first is in-group consciousness, a sense of communal interests found even in sub-human animals, but the second arises from the processes of socialization and enculturation, and has no counterpart among sub-human groups. [13] In 1996, Robert K. Merton commented that \"although the practice of seeing one's own group as the center of things is empirically correlated with a belief in superiority, centrality and superiority need to be kept analytically distinct in order to deal with patterns of alienation from one's membership group and contempt for it.\" [14] People raised in a particular culture that absorb the values and behaviors of that culture will develop a worldview that considers their own culture to be the norm. [15] [16] If people then experience other cultures that have different values and behaviors, they will find that the thought patterns appropriate to their native culture are not appropriate for the new cultures. However, since people are accustomed to their native culture, it can be difficult for them to see the behaviors of people from a different culture from the viewpoint of that culture rather than from their own. [15] [17] Ethnocentrism can be explicit or implicit. Explicit ethnocentrism involves the ability to express the feelings about outsiders (people from other groups), and implicit ethnocentrism refers to the inhibition of the feelings for outsiders.
