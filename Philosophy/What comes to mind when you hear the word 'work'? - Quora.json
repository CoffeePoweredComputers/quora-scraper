But before that, I thought of 2 words: \u201cI wish.\u201d Even though I worked for 50 years, I still look forward to working in horticulture one way or another. Retirement is not in my vocabulary. For now, helping take care of my mother is a priority, although I will continue to develop my garden blog, wellspringkim.com. Decades ago, I spoke with a business consultant, who said, \u201cThe worst day working for yourself is better than the best day working for someone else.\u201d That sums it up or me. I enjoyed self-employment for 40 years. Even though there were very difficult times (recessions), I wouldn\u2019t have traded it for anything. You have to love what you do, because too much time is spent doing it! ",
