            "answer_text": "I'm taking aim at post-modern theory. I've provided 12 criticisms of post-modern theory in terms of its reflection of truth and the consequences of following it as a methodology: Postmodern undercuts the entire enterprise of education and truth.To the extend that postmodernism indicts truth and value, postmodernism undercuts itself and whatever purposes and values it attempts to secure (i.e. less oppression, less violence, etc..)Postmodernism is a poor analytic tool. Whatever one gains with post-modernism, you take away from modernity. For instance, turning all governments including democracies into equal parts tyranny doesn't exactly help fight for freedom or less oppression. In addition, the norm to respect human dignity is different than the norm to take off your coat if you are going in doors--there are fundamentally different. While I think geneaology might be able to handle this difference--the other tools fight against this.Postmodernism undercuts rights protections (ie it would roll back the clock on the 60s reforms). Progressive reforms & anything involving government protection of individual and groups would likewise die.Postmodern focus on language trades-off with real world focus on actual oppression (not just the violence of language, but real violence). You can spend too much time on issues of language or the essentialism of labels and forget to make the world a better place.Postmodernism is too idealistic. We as humans need structure (ie laws and guiding mission statements). The idea that magically getting rid of those structures would be beneficial to everyone isn't true.Postmodernism is grounded on hyperbole and overgeneralization--which is what it critiques modernism for. It can ultimately become the fundamentalism it tries to critique.Post-modernism results in hyper-individualism, without much in common. The problems with this are described in Bowling Alone.Most of postmoderns advantages can be captured by modern values and modern analytic tools. You can examine power, ideology, and history without turning truth claims into mush.Postmodernism results in ultimate relativism. I've pointed to the problems of ethical relativism and relativism more broadly a number of times. Here is one of those articles: A critique of relativistic theories of ethicsPost-modernism also almost wholly ignores the historical and empirical success of modernism. Modernism got stuff done. Modernism caused progress. Sure, it has problems--but we don't level anything just because it has certain flaws. Fixing it rather than doing away with it is the answer.Assumptions & Caveats: To be fair, post-modernism is a rather broad field. You would have to attack those folks around Heidegger, Nietzsche, Baudrillard, those postmoderns who talk about the nature of language, as well as a field-by-field analysis of the use of specific post-modern theories. Given those constraints, I\u2019m trying to unpack, problematize, and criticize the core philosophies of post-modernism.In addition to the link above about relativism--I've also written here about the advantages and disadvantages of post-modernism.  There is also this from Steven Hicks: \u201cMetaphysics and epistemology are at the heart of this account of postmodernism. Despite the postmodernists\u2019 billing of themselves as anti-metaphysics and anti-epistemology, their writings focus upon those themes almost exclusively. Heidegger attacks logic and reason to make room for emotion, Foucault reduces knowledge to an expression of social power, Derrida deconstructs language and turns it into a vehicle of aesthetic play, and Rorty chronicles the failures of the realist and objectivist tradition in almost-exclusively metaphysical and epistemological terms. From the postmodern anti-realist metaphysics and anti-reason epistemology, the postmodern social consequences follow almost directly. Once we set aside reality and reason, what are we left with to go on? We can, as the conservatives would prefer, simply turn to our group\u2019s traditions and follow them. Or we can, as the postmodernists will prefer, turn to our feelings and follow them. If we then ask what our core feelings are, we connect with the answers from the past century\u2019s dominant theories of human nature. From Kierkegaard and Heidegger, we learn that our emotional core is a deep sense of dread and guilt. From Marx, we feel a deep sense of alienation, victimization, and rage. From Nietzsche, we discover a deep need for power. From Freud, we uncover the urgings of dark and aggressive sexuality. Rage, power, guilt, lust, and dread constitute the center of the postmodern emotional universe.\u201d (\u201cExplaining Postmodernism\u201d) ",

            "answer_text": "Seems I am fated to provide counter-balance to these, as far as I know, quite fallacious, distorting and dishonest caricatures one finds in these answers. More particularly, I will deal with one answer point by point. My defense here in no way supposes there are not good criticism of \u201cpostmodern\u201d thought ( we will get to the unusefulness of the term ), on the contrary, many of the supposed \u201cpostmodern\u201d thinkers disagreed on some basic points, Habermas, in line of critical theory, criticized severely Derrida, Gadamer as well. Best criticism of postmodern though is already there, because people throw so wide a net as a \u201ccatch-all\u201d trick, but there is no unified \u201cpostmodern thought\u201d. Foucault ( another often vilified name ) deals with matters entirely different. 1 - Postmodern undercuts the entire enterprise of education and truth. Well, it is not hard to dispute that point. One hardly needs a quick search and find the heydays of continental ( the supposed birthplace of postmodern thought ) universities in the 60s, 70s, to the 80s, when these supposed \u201cpostmodernist\u201d were holding open lectures where thousands of people attended. People from here, then Yugoslavia, drove to Germany just to listen Adorno lecture to full auditorium. The spirit of education was different back then. How it undercuts truth, I will gladly defend it in the comment after I see some valid criticism, not just a statement. And beside some fringe positions, the statement is false. But then, what does undercut means? Call it into question? Deny it? Well, very few people deny there is truth, even postmodernists. 2 - To the extend that postmodernism indicts truth and value, postmodernism undercuts itself and whatever purposes and values it attempts to secure (i.e. less oppression, less violence, etc..) It is hard to disentangle so vague statement that covers good fifty year of philosophy into one box. Plenty of \u201cpostmodernist\u201d built upon their work, I mean positively built, that there is a way forward. In general, there very little to say here without some more elaboration. But I will give a short interview to read, and I urge you to read it. 3 - Postmodernism is a poor analytic tool. Whatever one gains with post-modernism, you take away from modernity. For instance, turning all governments including democracies into equal parts tyranny doesn't exactly help fight for freedom or less oppression. In addition, the norm to respect human dignity is different than the norm to take off your coat if you are going in doors--there are fundamentally different. While I think geneaology might be able to handle this difference--the other tools fight against this. Poor analytic tool? Indeed, it was never intended as one. How all governments are turned into equal party tyranny is again, baffling. A good portion of defenders of European democratic systems sprung from these waters ( looking again at Habermas - still living ). Again, this paragraph shows utter detachment and ignorance of German critical tradition. 4 - Postmodernism undercuts rights protections (ie it would roll back the clock on the 60s reforms). Progressive reforms & anything involving government protection of individual and groups would likewise die. But it was exactly the movements that took the basics from these leftist foundations. Although plenty of them ( Derrida, Adorno, Faucault ) distanced themselves from actually movements, there is no question the movements and protests were greatly inspired by them. Others, like Marcuse, were actually very proactive. 5 - Postmodern focus on language trades-off with real world focus on actual oppression (not just the violence of language, but real violence). You can spend too much time on issues of language or the essentialism of labels and forget to make the world a better place. This is philosophy, theory. If one wants social and political writings, one can always read that. And they have some of those too. 6 - Postmodernism is too idealistic. We as humans need structure (ie laws and guiding mission statements). The idea that magically getting rid of those structures would be beneficial to everyone isn't true. While there might be some truth in saying their aim is utopistic ( utopianism was important subfield. Read Ernst Bloch - yet another one that was profoundly proactive in 1968 social movements ), the chances of attaining it are usually pessimistic.There is no magic involved, and that is again fringe position that no one argues for. Calling existing superstructures into question is not the same as total riddance of any structures - but rather their reformation. 7 - Postmodernism is grounded on hyperbole and overgeneralization--which is what it critiques modernism for. It can ultimately become the fundamentalism it tries to critique. I have no idea how one can genuinely write that while performing the same sin thousandfold. Large part of critical theory is how modernism brought us to two greatest wars the world has seen. I do not know how that can be a hyperbole. Much of writings of Adorno deals with questions of Auschwitz, and how we came to that point. Is that a hyperbole? If one wants close readings of Western philosophical tradition, Derrida and Adorno are right at the top in providing that. 8 - Post-modernism results in hyper-individualism, without much in common. The problems with this are described in Bowling Alone. Again the catch all term at work. And no, Putnam never engages with the names that have been put forward till now. If you equate the present condition ( and of the past few decades ) with the philosophy of the aforementioned ( and others ), that is a serious overestimation of their hold. One is putting the horse in front of a carriage. From what I know, he deals with social trends, not philosophical issues. But to entertain the book, it particularly mourns the decline of \u201ctraditional\u201d social structures, while it looks past the new ones emerging. We can tangle with this in the comments, if one wishes. 9 - Most of postmoderns advantages can be captured by modern values and modern analytic tools. You can examine power, ideology, and history without turning truth claims into mush. But again, where did it lead us, historically, with this modernism. And no, it does not turn everything into a mush. 10 - Postmodernism results in ultimate relativism. I've pointed to the problems of ethical relativism and relativism more broadly a number of times. Here is one of those articles: A critique of relativistic theories of ethics I read the linked answer. While very few ethicists are actually relativists ( and the names one usually connects with postmodernism, yes, those mentioned, actually are not relativists ), the linked answer is horrendous. Not one of them is arguing or defends a position described there. From the above link: That the meaning isn't stagnant, doesn't mean the meaning isn't incredibly important. This position denies value in the universe. Yes, true. But there is no such position whatsoever defended, established, proposed, in writings. No one denies it. I do not know where one gets these ideas. General agreements are sufficient for ethics.... I guess if you lived in different times, like Romans, or the times of slavery, or god forbid, some totalitarian regime, you would still parrot that phrase? But now, a shocker, even Foucault, so often accused of relativism ( or such nonsense ), was highly critical of Greek and Roman ethics, saying that there are things one ought to have value of. 11 - Post-modernism also almost wholly ignores the historical and empirical success of modernism. Modernism got stuff done. Modernism caused progress. Sure, it has problems--but we don't level anything just because it has certain flaws. Fixing it rather than doing away with it is the answer. Now here is a viable disagreement of how one evaluates modernism, historically. ( Stuff still gets done, science is still advancing, even today. ) But modernism did level itself in the two wars. One needed a response to how and why\u2014 12 - Assumptions & Caveats: To be fair, post-modernism is a rather broad field. You would have to attack those folks around Heidegger, Nietzsche, Baudrillard, those postmoderns who talk about the nature of language, as well as a field-by-field analysis of the use of specific post-modern theories. Given those constraints, I\u2019m trying to unpack, problematize, and criticize the core philosophies of post-modernism. Finished on a better note. The rest of the points though till hold no water. But then we sink again miles below: There is also this from Steven Hicks: \u201cMetaphysics and epistemology are at the heart of this account of postmodernism. Despite the postmodernists\u2019 billing of themselves as anti-metaphysics and anti-epistemology, their writings focus upon those themes almost exclusively. Heidegger attacks logic and reason to make room for emotion, Foucault reduces knowledge to an expression of social power, Derrida deconstructs language and turns it into a vehicle of aesthetic play, and Rorty chronicles the failures of the realist and objectivist tradition in almost-exclusively metaphysical and epistemological terms. From the postmodern anti-realist metaphysics and anti-reason epistemology, the postmodern social consequences follow almost directly. Once we set aside reality and reason, what are we left with to go on? We can, as the conservatives would prefer, simply turn to our group\u2019s traditions and follow them. Or we can, as the postmodernists will prefer, turn to our feelings and follow them. If we then ask what our core feelings are, we connect with the answers from the past century\u2019s dominant theories of human nature. From Kierkegaard and Heidegger, we learn that our emotional core is a deep sense of dread and guilt. From Marx, we feel a deep sense of alienation, victimization, and rage. From Nietzsche, we discover a deep need for power. From Freud, we uncover the urgings of dark and aggressive sexuality. Rage, power, guilt, lust, and dread constitute the center of the postmodern emotional universe.\u201d Not a single sentence here is appropriate or has any resemblance with the actual writings of the persons it mentions. This book is atrocious, even so called analytic, conservative, etc. philosophers will attest to that. It hurts anyone who had any contact with philosophy, or has any respect of it. More reasons here. Do yourself a service and read an actual book on history of philosophy, from the names respected in the said field. And no, Russell is not the book to go to. I will gladly give recommendation on specific fields. If anything, philosophy on quora is en general atrocious, orders of magnitude more so than other fields. Those few credible names are not all that active or gone altogether, the rest is just claptrap, and the questions are beyond description. It is so bad. ",
