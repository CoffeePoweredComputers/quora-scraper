            "answer_text": "Well, in some cases. Take, Charles Xavier. The power of telepathy is more than just communication. Can also control people, make them space out, brainwash them, and as well cause different kinds of sensations, including pain. But also pleasure. The power of telepathy as it is shown in the movies is not, but in real life, there are some people who can do incredible things. Read into your involuntary movements, expresdions and twitches, also your looks, all of your person. Like Robert Downy Jr in Sherlock Holmes. There is also people who using expressions and psychological tricks can persuade you to do things. For example, using a pen to show parts of paper, also talking a specific way, making certain expressions, using some phrases instead of others. All this my mom told me from when she was a sales person. But that was many years ago. Of course, that is like very very low level. People can do things and say things to make you do things you wouldn't think you would do. As for tranamitting thought, humans have a way to do that subconsciously. Sometimes just look at someone, or call their name, and they say \u201cright\u201d and do what you're asking them to do in your mind without realizing it. Or sometimes someone is acting a certain way and you want to understand and they look at you, or you see their face, and you understand. Welp, there you have it. ",

            "answer_text": "A quick search on Google shows that telepathy ranges from simple mind reading to consciousness transferal to mental projection that will object into existence. So it really depends on the author\u2019s interpretation of the power. Take for example Ace from Justice League: Unlimited  in this scenario. Ace evolved to a point where she was able to warp reality for a brief period of time before passing. You just can\u2019t predict how far these writer is willing to go sometimes. ",
