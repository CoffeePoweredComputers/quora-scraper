            "answer_text": "The statement itself is not a self-contained Irony, as in appearance and in reality, Iago isn't a trustworthy person. Yet, it contributes to illustrate an Ironical idiocyncracy of Roderigo,and to form dramatic irony. Iago utters the phrase as a reply to quench Roderigo's doubt. He says \u201cI am not what I am\u201d just to assure that he only serves Othello for his advantage. At the time the line is spoken, Roderigo is not aware of Iago's deceptive nature, as the former truly gives in to his credulity,and believes that Iago is a dependable friend. When Iago generally remarks that he isn't trustworthy, to the onstage character, Roderigo, and to the audience:the latter waits for Roderigo to question the speaker's duplicity, yet he does not - betraying their expectations. Therefore, the behaviour of Roderigo in relation to the statement is Ironical. Apart from that, when Iago says \u201cI am not what I am\u201d , which is an absolute truth, the audience directly gets to know of his deceptive nature, except the gullible on/off stage characters, contributing to create a dramatic irony ",
