            "answer_text": "No, there are two key problems with that. First, you can\u2019t just up and decide to be a Stoic one morning, nor, I think, could a well-practiced Stoic just drop it. Stoicism, like any other doctrine, doesn\u2019t simply require you to assent to its core ideas. You have to seriously live it, practice it every day, follow it with constant discipline. You can\u2019t live in ease and luxury today and yet be fully ready to handle a crisis calmly tomorrow. It doesn\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s not a switch you flip. There is a reason there are so many exercises for Stoics to practice. It\u2019s a brutally difficult doctrine to follow, and doing so effectively is all but impossible without knowing a few tricks to help yourself stick to it (like negative visualization, or the various short phrases Epictetus says we should keep handy\u2014\u201cThe <lost thing> is the price of freedom\u201d, for example). The more difficult to the doctrine, the more ceaseless practice is required, and Stoicism is way up there in difficulty, requiring us as it does to very actively strive to overcome our normal behaviors (e.g. passing judgement on externals). If you choose to pursue hedonism in good times, you leave yourself vulnerable to bad times. There\u2019s no way around it. That\u2019s why Stoics in good times are advised to practice askesis, training, in the form of moderate challenges to keep us accustomed to discomfort (e.g. cold showers, fasting, slightly under-dressing for the weather).  Second, hedonism doesn\u2019t necessarily make one any happier in good times than Stoicism does (and I would argue to the contrary). There\u2019s always some turmoil or struggle to be dealt with, even in the best of times, meaning Stoicism is always useful. Not just that, but since when does the pursuit of pleasure make one happier than the pursuit of virtue? That certainly hasn\u2019t been my experience; I can be discontented even while experiencing a great deal of pleasure, but as long as I\u2019m satisfied with my progress towards virtue my contentment is nearly unshakeable (and the more so the more I progress). It\u2019s worth pointing out\u2014as several Stoic philosophers have\u2014that pleasure simply drives us to more pleasure (eating out today means we want to eat out tomorrow; a raise now drives us to pursue another one) without actually having much of an effect on our satisfaction, whereas with virtue, all progression contributes to our satisfaction and there is a specific, if near unattainable, end point (perfection of virtue).

            "answer_text": "Daniel Phillipus gave a very good answer in terms of the concrete philosophies of both schools (if indeed hedonism can be considered a true \u201cschool\u201d of philosophy), so I'll try a different route. Assuming you mean this more generally, and are just talking about hedonistic and stoic tendencies, rather than discipleship, I do think you're on to something. It's obviously important not to get caught up in a frenzy of pleasure-seeking that drives one to absolute (or even partial) ruin. The idea ought to be maximizing the possibility to feel pleasurable enough over a long period of time.  Stoicism tries to make that enough very small, as I understand it, so that there does not arise a feeling of disappointment or distress when trouble comes. It's a bit like how some fighters thrust their hands into hot sand to build their durability. So, obviously, having this emotional durability is good, and practicing a bit of minimalism (which is like watered down stoicism) is a nice idea.  We do seem to possess certain innate drives and needs that, left unfulfilled long enough, start to influence our decisions almost like being caught in a current. If we swim hard enough, we can go another way, but it's taxing and cannot be kept up forever. We would do well, in our more hedonistic moments, not to dip our toe into such rivers as those that amplify and manipulate these innate drives and risk falling under their immense power. Feeling in control of oneself is key to wellbeing. What makes one happy? What the mind chooses to focus on, and nothing other than that. ",
