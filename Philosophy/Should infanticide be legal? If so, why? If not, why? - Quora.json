            "answer_text": "Infanticide should not be legal, but it also shouldn\u2019t hold a murder charge. In terms of the different traits a fetus and an infant hold, it\u2019s not really that different. Sure, we know that newborns actually can comprehend to some degree(probably due to endogenous sedation no longer limiting them), and yes they no longer need to use someone else\u2019s physical body for sustenance(as apposed to external actions), but we kill animals which are both self sufficient and can comprehend. https://www.nature.com/articles/pr200950 (<-for the endogenous sedation thing) The actual reason infanticide should be illegal is because as a precedent it is detrimental to society. The easiest example is killing someone else\u2019s kid, which obviously deteriorates the well being of the parent. This should hold a murder charge due to the severity of the detriment. However, the discussion would obviously be about killing your own infant. Not only does anyone who has a direct relationship who doesn\u2019t want it killed become subject to a deteriorated well being, but any other kids in the vacinity that witness an infanticide would be mentally scarred(which is pretty detrimental to their upbringing). Alongside this, the precedent of any thing being legal means it is more likely to be socially accepted, and thus people will think infanticide is less severe. This means in situations such as a kid crying in a restaurant, a person is more likely to want to kill it(and thus kill it), which is bad for society obviously. These three things(as well as the emotion well being of those who think killing an infant in itself is immoral) makes a good case why it should be illegal for someone to kill their own infant, especially when they can just ward it off to the state. It shouldn\u2019t, however, hold a murder charge. It should hold a low homicide charge, if not a little higher as the net detriment to society as a result of the precedent doesn\u2019t warrant a murder charge. ",
