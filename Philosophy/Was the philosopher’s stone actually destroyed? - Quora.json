            "answer_text": "Yes, it was. After Harry battled to make sure that Voldemort doesn\u2019t get the stone, Nicolas Flamel and Albus Dumbledore decided that they had no other choice than to destroy the stone. They wanted to make sure that it didn\u2019t get into the wrong hands and so they decided to cut it out of existence. Flamel said he had enough elixir to finish any unfinished business after which he could die. They didn\u2019t mention how they destroyed it though. ",

Dumbledore said enough Elixir of Life was created for Nicholas Flamel and his wife to get their affairs in order than it was destroyed. Their death was described as going to bed after a very long day. ",
