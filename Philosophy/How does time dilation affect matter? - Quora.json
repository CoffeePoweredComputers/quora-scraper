            "answer_text": "One thing to understand about time dilation is that locally, absolutely nothing happens. There is no experiment you can do locally (inside a small closed box sealed off from the outside world) to determine how fast your clock is running. To you, your clock is always running at normal speed. So we can only talk about the relative time dilation between two systems or observers. For the gravitational time dilation of General Relativity, things are pretty simple. If you are on the top of a a mountain, and I am at the base, your clock will be running slightly faster than mine. All observers agree on the ratio of the clock speeds; you, or I, or any third party all get the same answer. You may see someone else\u2019s clock running faster (if they are higher up in the potential) or slower (if they are lower down in the potential). Although it is traditional to teach Special Relativity first, time dilation in it is in some ways more confusing. If you and I are gliding by each other (unaccelerated) at close to the speed of light, I will see your clock as running slower than mine, but you will also see my clock as running slower than yours. We disagree about whose clock is slower; the answer depends on from whose frame of reference you are observing. You can only ever see someone else\u2019s clock be the same speed as yours (if they are not moving relative to you) or slower than yours (if they are moving at all); it is impossible to see someone else\u2019s clock running faster. If you see a muon\u2019s clock as running slower than yours, then it will decay slower (to you) by exactly the same ratio. In other words, it will always decay at the normal rate by its own clock, so if you know the time dilation then you can easily calculate the expected lifetime just by multiplying. This effect is used in muon storage rings such as the one in the Muon g-2 experiment, so we know it works. ",

            "answer_text": "Time dilatation is about the relative rate that a clock runs in different frames. An individual particle does not know anything about time dilation. It does not behave differently according to what reference frame you are in. It only knows about its own center-of-mass reference frame. Time dilatation is about what you measure according to your clock. If you want to calculate how the particle is supposed to behave, you need to do the calculation in the frame of the particle. Then you can transform to your frame, so that you will know what you are supposed to see. However, if you want to study the behavior of light, you have to be more careful. In special relativity, you cannot do a calculation in a reference frame which is moving at the speed of light relative to your reference frame. For general relativity, if you want to do calculations involving black holes, things are more complicated. For someone on the outside of the black hole, it looks like clocks at the event horizon just stop running. However, a particle which is at the event horizon does not know that you think its clock has stopped. And you cannot see what is going on inside the event horizon. ",

            "answer_text": "Time dilation directly modifies the rate at which time flows in any given region of space. This slows everything in the frame under comparison equally, including light, and yes, even in a vacuum, despite modern physicists catch phrases. This is actually a topic that we as a species are having a extremely difficult time comprehending properly due to our inherently subjective perceptions of physical phenomena. Einstein surely did not help us in this regard, putting his entire concept of relativity into a subjective viewpoint that is reinforced in modern academia. This causes 9/10 modern physicists to flat out disregard any concepts that do not fit into their subjective views of relativity despite our perceptions constantly lying to us in this regard. People easily forget that our perceptions of the universe are in fact a naturally occurring lorentz transformation that is heavily bias to our local frames dimensions. All i can say is that this is going to lead to a nightmare of extreme miscalculations across space with a changing dilation factor. We have already begun to notice this across the ultra small scales we have physical access to. Afterall, if the rate of causality itself is relative, there goes our entire physical conceptualization of relativity. Straight into the trash can. ",

            "answer_text": "Time dilation affects time, not just clocks. Since a light clock (the one Einstein used to derive the formula) is a proper clock, all other clocks have to tick at the same speed - imaging two perfectly synchronized clocks changing speed because you start moving them. It's really time that dilates. This causes everything to slow down: Wave frequencies, Caesium oscillation (the physical definition of a second), your mobile's CPU clock, your hearth beat rate, anything. Obviously this includes myons as well as every other decaying particle. Myons are in no way special and are not the only thing affected by time dilation next to clocks. You can just see the effects very well. ",

            "answer_text": "Radioactive matter is not the constant we were told it was! Its decay depends on pressure. Likewise it may be that quickly moving items don\u2019t experience the constant pressure of a still item. Quick items because they experience different \u201cpressure\u201d may hang around longer? As for clocks slowing down \u2014 it depends on what you mean by a clock. If you are thinking a windup clock, the answer is no. If you are thinking the normal decay of radioactive material, the answer is yes but. The trouble with Special Relativity is that it is supposed to be symmetric. I go at 10 MPH relative to you, so you go at -10 MPH relative to me. All this lovely symmetry falls by the wayside with fast radioactive particles moving relative to Earth. The theory of Special Relativity is wrong. Still, Einstein is a great genius. ",
