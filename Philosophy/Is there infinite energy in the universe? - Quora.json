            "answer_text": "AN, great question, leads off on another logic trail of intellectual thought penned as a logical answer to \u201c Is there infinite energy in the universe?\u201d.  Lets try too move/change as little as possible to solve the question/equations. First a little housekeeping: the Law of Conservation- Wikipedia \u201cIn physics, the law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant\u2014it is said to be conserved over time.[1] Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it transforms from one form to another.\u201d By definition \u2018uni-verse\u2019 is one isolated system. And so, is the universe infinite? leaving be infinite energy?; perhaps it seems infinite to the confused with a perspective that it is, \u2026until:  Just like their fuel tank, that logic and its energy runs out, and then what happens? When the perspective=tank is full can\u2019t see the end of finite exists, infinity seems possible. But when the perspective is changed, seeing/knowing the limits of the tank or the energy and universe, every \u2018thing\u2019 that is physical and has physical effects is finite. Perhaps one proof that: E= Mc^2 is a \u2018finite\u2019 equation\u2026.. So in summary, there is NOT infinite energy in our finite universe. But now that your \u2018perspective\u2019 is right, lets proceed on this logical trail and see what it proves about \u2018dark energy\u2019\u2026which is also an (hypothetical) energy that science says exists, forcing the galaxies from each other in defiance of gravity. Background: gravity (the master of all forces) attract/contracts physical objects together, naturally. Galaxies, massive amounts of objects/mass with often a massive black hole with a gravitationally massive singularity, have tremendous weight and gravity. A galaxy\u2019s natural process is self evident contraction: as an isolated system, as a cluster system, as a supercluster system, all are contraction systems within the universe. To substantiate expansion against the \u2018natural contraction system\u2019 of gravity between galaxies, \u2018expansion belief\u2019 science hypothesizes=theorize \u2018dark energy\u2019 is forcing the \u2018expansion at an increasing rate\u2019. Not only do expansionists theorize dark energy is: keeping galaxies from contracting (= galaxies are expanding away from each other) but also 2-making galaxies accelerate away from each other at an increasing rate\u2026. Logically, if you do the math, something is obviously amiss: Lets follow on the trial with this: We know galaxies have tremendous weight=gravity, within themselves but also between each other\u2026that is a given.  So galaxies have a natural system of gravity between them.  Keep in mind what the \u2018Force\u2019 is, what force is and how force is made: made by gravity because the \u2018mass\u2019 exists.  Next, lets simplify things and say only two galaxies exist\u2026 m1 and m2; naturally a gravitational force exists between them. Yet expansion belief science hypothesizes dark energy is keeping the Force/gravity at bay:  1st- to stop contraction plus  2nd- make the galaxies expanding away from each other at an increasing rate\u2026. Ok, lets apply some logic to the \u201chypothesis of dark energy\u201d.  If a galaxy exist, just to move it requires force or energy as in E= m*g*h,  though this formula is reliant on consistent gravity, it can be modified/used for applicability: the Energy required is the mass times the gravity times the height \u2026 reformulated: mass is one galaxy, gravity is of the gravity between the two galaxies (m1 and m2 above) and the height since there is only two is the distance between the two galaxies plus the \u201cexpanding at an increasing rate\u201d.  If gravity is a source of energy, then, keeping the galaxies m1 and m1 from each other requires an opposing force (hypothetically dark energy). So, if there is energy (dark energy) required to offset gravity, it has to be constantly being made to just stop in a stationary position the galaxies in defiance of their known gravity\u2026  So if you calculate the force, add up the mass due to the galaxies\u2019 masses and gravity:  To figure out their newtons=gravity force of the natural system:  To realize/conclude that two galaxies begin prevented from their natural system\u2019s gravity\u2019s contraction  requires infinite energy  over time or to validate\u2018expanding at an increasing rate\u2019 (forever)\u2026. And the above example is for two galaxies\u2026.imagine the requirements for billions of galaxies in \u201cexpanding at an increasing rate\u201d universe hypothetical. Understanding that  is not an \u2018infinite\u2019 equation; and gives conclusion that our universe or any/all energy is not infinite. As the logic finds the universe/science \u2018expansion at an increasing rate\u2019 is: 1- an un-natural system in which Entropy would indicate is null and void and, 2nd- would require infinite \u2018dark energy\u2019 to substantiate a- stopping gravity/contraction to be static and b- cause \u2018expansion at an increasing rate\u2019 (forever)\u2026.is mathematically and physically impossible\u2026 Therefore: dark energy and expansion at an increasing rate is _____. You fill in the blank as your destination of this logic trail indicates. douG For a logical explanation of redshift and the expansion perceptions see: VACIS The ToE:  If it helps, its a gift. ",

            "answer_text": "The Sun has been radiating energy for the past 4.5 billion years or so, sustaining all life on earth, and is expected to continue to do so for another 4.5 billion years! Afterall, a mass of just one kilogram contains energy equal to 9 x 10^16 joules! Based on that, and looking around ourselves and watching all the stars, galaxies and the rest of the observable universe, we would think that the total energy of the universe must be an inconceivably large quantity. But the contrary is true. Yes, scientists think that the total energy of the universe is probably zero. It sounds weird, but light, matter and antimatter belong to a group that physicists call \"positive energy\", however, there is an equal amount of \"negative energy\" stored in the gravitational attraction that exists between all the positive-energy particles, precisely balancing each other. Consequently, there is no energy in the universe at all. Stephen Hawking explains the concept of negative energy in his book The Theory of Everything* \"Two pieces of matter that are close to each other have less energy than the same two pieces a long way apart, because you have to expend energy to separate them against the gravitational force that is pulling them together,\" he wrote. * https://arxiv.org/ftp/gr-qc/papers/9910/9910036.pdf Since it takes positive energy to separate the two pieces of matter, gravity must be using negative energy to pull them together. Thus, the gravitational field has negative energy. In the case of a universe that is approximately uniform in space, one can show that this negative gravitational energy exactly cancels out the positive energy represented by matter. So the total energy of the universe is zero. In another essay \"A Universe From Nothing\"* - American astrophysicists Alexei Filippenko and Jay Pasachoff explain gravity's negative energy by way of an example: \"If you drop a ball from rest (defined to be a state of zero energy), it gains energy of motion (kinetic energy) as it falls. But this gain is exactly balanced by a negative gravitational energy as it comes closer to Earth\u2019s center, so the sum of the two energies remains zero.\" * https://www.astrosociety.org/publications/a-universe-from-nothing/ In other words, the ball's positive energy increases, but at the same time, negative energy is added to the Earth's gravitational field. What was a \u201czero-energy ball at rest\u201d in space turns into a \u201czero-energy ball that is falling through space\u201d. Stretching it further, the universe as a whole can be compared to this ball. Initially, that is, before the big bang, the \u2018universe-ball\u2019 was at rest. Now, after the big bang, it is falling: light and matter exist, and they are moving. And yet, because of the negative energy built into the gravity field created by these particles, the total energy of the universe remains zero. ",
