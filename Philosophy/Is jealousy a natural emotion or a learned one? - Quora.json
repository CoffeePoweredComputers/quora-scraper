            "answer_text": "I believe jealousy starts at childhood as sibling rivalry.  It is evolutionarily learned, that is, over time as a species.  It is natural or instinctual emotion for an individual.  It is natural for a baby to fear being abandoned or to receive less than optimal care and attention because one's parent(s) are giving more to a sibling.  This is a basic survival skill the baby was born with; it did not have to be learned.   Recent studies of chimps (and perhaps dolphins) show they have a lot of brain power devoted to keeping track of all the other members of society and all the favors done for and received.  A complex accounting is maintained by each individual of favors given and received.  Grooming, sex, sharing of food, etc, are common such favors and each one tries to keep their \"tab\" paid down.  Each insists that none of the others builds up a large tab, that is, takes advantage.  No one wants to be taken advantage of.  More leeway is given for one's children, and then other relatives, with distant relatives having less leeway than close relatives, because you share their genes.  Any extra help you give without receiving anything in return is ok because it helps pass on your genes.  In that way, the accounting is balanced.   However, in the chimp society, a very special economic relationship exists with one's mate, the one you share children with.  In this case, called \"love\" you are hormonally disposed to ignore the usual accounting and simply give freely whatever your mate desires.  Both parties do this, giving freely out of love not worried at all about fairness or rules.  The only really important thing is you must be devoted to your partner unconditionally, in sickness or health, etc, and you CAN NOT CHEAT.  You must be faithful.  In this way, the couple will suceed in raising healthy children while other couples, that hold back their resources to the relationship will not do as well, their offspring suffering.  Breaking the rules here, cheating on this special partner is the worse sin that can be done to you because you agreed to give freely and fully without keeping track of the favors based on them promising the same. Guarding one's mate, preventing them from straying is the purpose that jealousy continues into adulthood.  If your female becomes impregnated by another male, you will devote your resources supporting his offspring (his genes) and your genes will die with you.  If your male mate spends too much attention on another female and her offspring, you and your offspring may not receive enough resources, possibly not enough to survive.  If the male is an alpha male and a leader, then that is ok that he has other females, because he can order the other males of his group to gather resources for all the group including all his females. Despite jealousy being a completely natural emotion, one can learn from others, or the culture, etc, to be more or less prone to negative consequences of emotions like jealousy or anger or envy, etc.  As our species evolved to live in increasingly larger groups, we have set up cultural norms to ease the stress and conflicts of domestic disputes.  We have rules of conduct.  We have procedures to follow to resolve such disputes, both as affected persons and concerned third parties.  We invented the marriage contract.  We invented courting procedures.  We invented duels and non-violent contests and laws and counselling as ways to resolve disputes.  Primarily we set up a complex set of conditions under which a person is considered belonging to another (or each other) and when and when not acceptable for another to mess around with them. In many early cultures, a woman was given or sold to a man and she belonged to him.  He in turn was required to take care of her and her offspring.  If he failed to do so, he would be punished and/or the woman would be taken from him.  If he was wealthy or powerful and could afford to take care of more women, he was allowed to do so.  In such a culture, if a woman goes outside without an appropriate male escort and not completely covered from head to toe, her husband could become insanely jealous.  That is the accepted norm.  If a woman had sex with another man, she could be put to death.  Society and even \"god\" would expect this. Culturally enlightened (and wealthier) civilizations tend to grant more respect for the woman's wishes.  Intellectual resources are considered more important than brawn, so in this situation women have a lot more value to society when they are educated and can contribute the same as men.  She is allowed more say in whom she bonds with and she can terminate that bond if she is unhappy.  It is more a mutual relationship, especially when the woman is able to support herself economically and therefore isn't forced to seek the support of a man to live.  In such a culture, a woman might go topless at a beach where others do the same without her husband feeling the slightest bit jealous.  The pill, abortion, paternity tests, loss of stigma of divorce and being a single parent or child of unmarried parents make a lot of the old rules somewhat irrelevant.  Still, in many countries like the US, if a man impregnates a woman he is still legally responsible to support the child economically even as he has no say in whether the child is carried to term or not or even have any say in how the child is raised. As these trends have progressed, more and more men and women seem to be feeling that marriage is kind of a drag.  It is too hard and too restrictive.  We don't want ANY restrictions imposed on us.  We want to be free to do whatever we want.  We want \"to still have our cake after we have eaten it too\".  We still desire to receive the unconditional love that this special arrangement provides and this is often the only real reason anyone needs to get married anymore, however, it doesn't seem to last \"forever\" anymore like promised.  Once the \"love\" is gone, there is no longer reason to stay married.  Or perhaps for economic and parental reasons, the marriage is preserved, but romantic desires are not being satisfied like they were at first so now it should be OK for ME to have sex with others.  I have a \"right\" to get MY needs met.  Most people still feel this is unacceptable, primarily because of jealousy, so people often feel guilty, even as they continue to cheat.  Societies \"rules\" of conduct are not clear anymore. At some point in the future, when everyone is completely secure and receiving all the love and attention and sex and food and financial support they desire from society and do not require it to come from just one spouse or pair of parents, perhaps then we will begin to lose, evolutionarily, our feelings of jealousy.   Just such a situation exists in the book I'm working on, set a few hundred years in the future.  There is even room for love and it is sought after and cherished, but it no longer carries with it conditions.  It is simply something to be enjoyed while it lasts.  No one ever goes hungry; no one goes without; so no one ever fears losing anything. ",

            "answer_text": "Jealousy is a learned behavior. Since we live in a world where everything is about comparison, jealousy is likely to happen. For example, you go to the gym. The guy next to you (or hot babe\u2014shwing!) has an amazing body, 6-pack abs, and glowing from all of the endorphins. Your first inclination is to want to have that body. Who wouldn\u2019t want that body? We\u2019re programmed to be jealous, envious (same thing), or go to a distraught place. When you look passed the shell, however, there\u2019s still a person with a spirit. Have you asked yourself how often they work out? Do they eat all of the food from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives? Are they vegetarian/vegan? Instead of asking yourself about the sacrifices they made to look that way, the path of least resistance is to just be jealous. I live in Silver Spring; Bethesda is roughly 20\u201325 minutes from here. The houses are expensive and many people act as if they are entitled to everything. I\u2019m sure there are some great people in Bethesda. However, there is a superior vibe that exists over there. Honestly, I couldn\u2019t care less about their property taxes or their 82-bedroom house. Who cares if Linda Carter lives around there in Potomac? She was hot back in the day\u2026 Sorry, couldn\u2019t resist. My point is that I can choose to be jealous. I choose to enjoy my own space which costs much less. I can pay 3.99 for the apple pie at Giant or drive to Bethesda and pay 6 bucks for the same pie. The former is much more appealing. To wrap up, we are constantly observing how great everything else is, and our natural inclination is to be envious. It is a choice. Best, Evan J. ",
