            "answer_text": "A few of the major schools of thought: Virtue ethics (example: Aristotle) - the basis of ethical behavior stems from the character of the moral agent/actor; hence the goal of achieving a more ethical/good/just society is done by inculcating character and virtue in its members.Stoicism/Quietism - the highest good is contentment, serenity and peace of mind (apatheia); this was often seen as individual detachment to events and actions surrounding the individual, hence parallels in some forms of Buddhism and Taoism.Hedonism - the highest good is pleasure, or in a more negative sense, the avoidance/minimization of pain/suffering; hedonism is in fact manifest in many different schools, including Epicureanism and \u2026Utilitarianism - known particularly by the phrase: \u201cthe greatest good for the greatest number\u201d; in fact, utilitarian thought has evolved into numerous variants, from Bentham\u2019s basic hedonic version, to Mill\u2019s more nuanced discussions, to \u201cpreference utilitarian\u201d and other schools.Another way to get a handle on the myriad schools of moral philosophy, from the classical to the postmodern, is to understand the following descriptive terms: Consequentialist or teleological - the consequence or outcome of a given course of action determines its ethical value; while critics contend this leads to the Machiavellian idea that \u201cthe ends justifies the means\u201d, more modern consequentialists would argue that this oversimplifies their approach, as the best approach would consider all consequences of one or more given means (e.g., allowing someone to kill a child who is predisposed to sociopathy and violence would set an appalling precedent, especially if there are other ways to deal with the child\u2019s predispositions).Deontological - adherence to a given set of rules or precepts determines its ethical value; critics argue that this begs the question of how we know when a rule is indeed of ethical value, whether every rule is to be applied in every context/circumstance, and what happens when the options for action conflict with two or more moral rules.Egoist - a given course of action is ethical if it benefits the actor, regardless of whether it benefits anyone else; some proponents of egoism claim that, ideally, an egoist would in fact take others into account, as the well-being of each individual is tied to that of others (\u201cenlightened self-interest\u201d)Altruist - a given course of action is ethical if it benefits others, regardless of whether it benefits the person doing the action; critics argue that this might lead to extremes of self-sacrifice, rather than a balance.Mutualism - a middle ground between egoism and altruism, arguing that benefit to both actor and interested others should be the preferred course.Relativism - the assertion that, since there is no objective standard, the ethical value of actions are completely dependent upon specific contexts and circumstances; contrast this with \u2026Absolutism - the assertion that an action is either right or wrong, regardless of context.",
