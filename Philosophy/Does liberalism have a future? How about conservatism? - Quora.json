            "answer_text": "In this country, USA, liberalism and conservatism barley exsist..we have two very similar authoritarian parties\u2026classic liberals largely formed this country, they were economically liberal ( free and open markets) and socially liberal ( government power was from the consent of the governed) human rights exsisted from our creator and could not be interfered with by government or mob rule and most important every individual is the smallest minority and has the same rights as any one or group. Today both authoritarian parties work hard to impose there will on the citizens..as result, citizens are either happy or in fear based on who is in power..there is nothing to fear from the constitution we were founded on but there is much to fear from an unchecked authoritarian party.

            "answer_text": "Conservatism will persist because many people are mildly stupid, the radical conservatives who live in a bubble and would not know what liberalism was even if it bit them on their arses will be like the poor, ever with us since they are even more stupid, prejudiced, fearful and greedy. Liberals who have existed for 250 or more years will continue to run things because on the whole they are far more clever and moral than conservatives. Most of you yanks do not know what liberalism is. ",

            "answer_text": "The future of liberalism is looking bleak, as my generation is almost exclusively conservative and independent. And seeing as our oldest members are 21, the democrats have 9 years before individuals lock into their beliefs. The problem is, our generation is battle hardened already with our beliefs, so it will not be easy. ",

In the long run, liberal thoughts, ideas, and realities win the day - and the year. Conservatives know this and it makes them furious. ",
