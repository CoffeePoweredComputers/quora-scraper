            "answer_text": "Statements can be either false or true, but not both at the same time and in the same context. If a statement is offered as both false and true, it violates the Aristotelian Law of Noncontradiction. A statement can be written in a contradictory way in the context of what is possible. In other words, we can \u201cscrew up\u201d. It just fails to avoid logical incoherency if constructed with contradiction. So there is a difference between being \u201cable to do something\u201d and that something being true or factual. Anything can be \u201cwritten or spoken\u201d as a contradiction, but cannot actually be regarded as both true and false. Writing it or saying it, does not Make\u2014-It\u2014-True. It remains a Contradiction. If fact, the greatest part of all Critical Thinking, is simply a matter of examining something said or written, to see if that particular statement is contradicted by another statement somewhere else in the communication or argument.

            "answer_text": "\u2014nyuk nyuk nyuk. Don't take my word for it, it's true! A statement can be false, yes. The words \u201ca man\u201d can be spoken differently by the same person at different times, and differently at different times by another. True and false can coincide in time. But not in the same sense at the same time. Statements have context, and the way key terms are employed is the context of statements. So the meaning of the statements he is a man and I am a man may vary from one day to the next. Sometimes they will be true, sometimes false. And given the number of times \u201che is a man\u201d or \u201cshe is a mensch\u201d may be uttered or thought, it will be both true and false in different circumstances simultaneously. A statement can be both true and false, in different circumstances at different times, or at the same time. Can a statement be both true and false in the same sense at the same time? Nyet. H or Can it be that statements like \u201che is a man\u201d or \u201cshe is a mensch\u201d are always true? ",
