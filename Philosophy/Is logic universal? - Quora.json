            "answer_text": "To get at the answer and achieve the correct answer one must first clearly understand the question as it is framed and have a clear understanding of its terms, specifically \u201clogic\u201d. Logic is the attempt to apply mathmatical certainty to our language. And advanced symbolic logic is the same attempt in the higher planes of mathematics, like algebra. Just as there are planes of mathmatics beyond most minds and comprehension by minds their must be planes in the universe beyond human knowledge and beyond the realm of thus far discovered certainty or universal certainty. And so my best answer is \u201cnot yet\u201d at least in my experience thus far. However I have friends who are far more advanced than I and I believe in the existence of One who\u2019s Logic is universal. And if we ever learn to speak His language our logic will be universal because He spoke the universe into existence. ",

            "answer_text": "If you\u2019re asking whether logic is used universally by human beings, then obviously not, since these days most people operate on scripts rather than on reasoning. If, however, you wonder whether the rules of logic are reliable, then, yes. Of course, there are several types of logic, but within each system, the rules can be reliably used to establish conclusions, so long as the premises are also reliable. ",
