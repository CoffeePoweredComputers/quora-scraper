            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s define a reverse causation as follows: We assume that A cause B, when actually B causes A. So, what we assume is a fallacy. E.g. We are in a car and stuck in a big traffic. 50 meters away we see a traffic policeman moving his hands in various directions in a way that he looks confused and we think, \u201cThis guy is responsible for the big traffic; he does not know his job well, he cannot control the traffic and he makes it worse!\u201d Well, it is most probably the opposite that is true: If the policeman were not there, the traffic would be even worse! That is, instead of A (policeman) causing B (traffic), it\u2019s B (traffic) causing the existence of A (policeman). This the case when we often say, \u201cAppearances are deceptive\u201d. ",
