            "answer_text": "The question of the ontological status of thoughts (i.e. do they exist?) is both fascinating and ancient. It is an important question in the pre-modern Indian texts that I study. The answers you will get will depend on the assumptions that the person answering the question makes. The majority of modern people (and ancient Buddhists) are reductionists. They only consider substances real. Thoughts are not substantial, therefore, they will argue, thoughts are not real. The opposite of reductionism is antireductionism or emergentism. The subject of study is structures and/or systems. Structures persist over time, they have causal potential, so they are real. And structures have emergent properties that are not simply an aggregation of properties of substances. Thoughts appear to be an emergent property of an embodied, well-functioning brain. Thoughts can cause changes in our brain and in our body. Thus thoughts are real by this definition. Something is definitely happening when you have a thought, even though only you know about your own thoughts. In my view, thoughts are real, but not substantial. Thoughts are real in the sense that we all have them. Something is going on. But because thoughts are clearly not substantial, reductionism is not help to us. We must choose a different approach to understanding them. Thoughts exist subjectively as an emergent property of objective brain activity. All kinds of things exist subjectively. Most modern money doesn\u2019t physically exist but is just a concept. The fact that most money only exists subjectively is not a problem. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "If thoughts exist in our internal reality, aren't they real?  This is not a pipe. This is a *picture* of a pipe. I certainly can imagine an elephant standing in the parking lot outside my apartment. And the thought is a very real and valid thought. Scientists can even detect the neural activity in my brain and verify there\u2019s a thought (some cutting-edge research can even tell if it\u2019s a thought of an elephant or not). However, most people over the age of seven or so learn that magical thinking (yes, that\u2019s the name for it) isn\u2019t real, and that the imaginary elephant does exists in their mind (but only there) while there\u2019s no actual elephant outside.

            "answer_text": "If thoughts exist in our internal reality, aren't they real? How is this question different from asking If mermaids exist in our internal reality, aren't they real? or If Santa Claus exists in our internal reality, isn't he real? The problem is that you\u2019ve said something exists & asking if it\u2019s real. That\u2019s backwards. You need to ask if thoughts are real or not & keep away from saying in advance that it does from the get go. You\u2019ve made a similar error speaking of our internal reality. There is no \u2018internal\u2019 or \u2018external\u2019 reality. All there is is reality & it can\u2019t be sub divided as \u2018this\u2019 reality & \u2018that\u2019 reality because there\u2019s only one. To speak of \u2018realities\u2019 as a plural is meaningless. Now I\u2019ve made that clear I\u2019ll reinterpret your question so it makes some kind of sense: Are our thoughts representative of reality? The answer is \u2018That depends on what your thoughts conclude are real.\u2019 Without knowing what those thoughts are how can anybody know?  ",

            "answer_text": "What is real or real-ity are perception of the perceived moment which in itself is impermanent. A sustained experience do not mean more realness. It just mean that the perceived moment extends to different coming moments, but the existed moments always fade to pass. Like 8AM today is not the same 8AM tomorrow. ",
