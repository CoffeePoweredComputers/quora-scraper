            "answer_text": "It isn\u2019t much help yet, but AGI will be able to write substantial chunks of books for their authors while the authors make adjustments to the parts that they think can be improved. AGI will also eliminate all plot faults, ensuring that nothing can break the spell. It will also tell the author whether an idea is new or if it\u2019s been used before. More interesting though is the possibility that it can write a different version of a novel for each individual reader, removing the parts that that reader won\u2019t appreciate and replacing them with content better suited to them. Lots of good ideas that have been wasted in stories that aren\u2019t as good as they should be can then be reused to make better ones. ",
