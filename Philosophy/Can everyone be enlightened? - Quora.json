            "answer_text": "Everyone will be enlightened but it takes multiple lifetimes as we grow and develop. Edgar Cayce said we need a minimum of thirty lives. We have many lessons to learn. We learn these from our mistakes. Hundreds of lives are not unusual. Once we commit to this path we cannot decide to leave it. We must see it through to the end. We are given an \u201cego\u201d which separates us from the experience of God. When we complete our sojourn we become enlightened our ego is dissolved so that after purifying ourselves can again experience that wonderful oneness. Until that time we have what I call the Shadow Ego. It is not the ego but rather the remnants and memories of our ego. We do not suddenly experience the fulll power of God but are gradually introduced to the experience. This means most enlightened people are not aware they are enlightened. The brilliant white light of enlightenment emanates from the third chakra making it impossible for someone to pretend to be enlightened to someone who can see these things. Not enlightened then no white light. We are entering an an entirely new period in human history with an unprecedented interest in enlightenment as an unparalleled number of people attain the state. I know of several. To even know about enlightenment is a gift. THE LEVELS TO ENLIGHTENMENT Level 1: Animal level. One identifies with one's body perfectly. The emotions, impulses and needs of the body are seen as all there is. At this level one believes fulfillment can be found meeting these animal needs. Conflict is seen as normal. People at this and the next two levels are responsible for the initiation of all physical conflict and 90% of criminal behavior in the world. It is not yet realized there is something more to life than what one sees. Human love is confused with divine love. God is seen as an oversize human being with human expectations for his \u201cchildren\u201d. One's relationship with God is seen in terms of following certain rules and behaving in certain ways. Correct behavior is specified by \u201cpriests\u201d. People at this level look to relationships, family, physical fitness, wealth, power, success, esteem, popularity, acquisition, etc. for happiness. This level is unable to understand one can have an inner satisfaction and peace that is unrelated to what is going on around them. Level 2: Tiredness of this existence. Seeking has not brought lasting happiness since what one gains one loses and what one has is rarely enough. Ignorance of this truth has resulted in lives of constant struggle. Disillusionment sets in. Level 3: Introduction to an alternative and the turning away from life as an animal. Seeker still does not understand how fulfillment can come from anything other than the world but they're prepared to try something new. Leaving this level is a momentous step in the spiritual evolution of the individual. Level 4: They have an experience of God but one still thinks one is a body with the experience of God as something separate from oneself. This is a painful level in which the individual feels much inner tearing and conflict. God is becoming personal but must burn through layers of habits and concepts. Person at this level has begun to restrain his aggressive impulses yet will feel hostility towards the outer world as he lives through endless inner conflicts and bouts of despair. The easy assumptions of earlier levels no longer work but efforts at being of the spirit alone fail. Level 5: Is a graceful level. It is the coming together of one's spiritual power. Attempts are begun to reconcile the body and spirit. It is at this level one finally decides to let go of the material and move towards spirit alone. Level 5 is the level of the world at its highest, God has become personal but one still identifies strongly with the body. After this level one moves towards true spirituality and begins to dissolve one's bonds with the earth level. Level 6: The level at which one dissolves one's attachments to the earth level. One can successfully channel at this level. God communicates with the seeker and the seeker hears. One can hear words or, as his growth reaches greater depths, he can understand entire concepts without explanation. Level 7: The lowest spiritual level. One has mostly dissolved one's attachments to the world and is preparing to dive into the ocean of spirit. Level 8: One begins to feel the power of the spirit and dissolve one's sense of self. Joy is felt. Level 9: Full identification with spirit. Level 10: Enlightenment. Identification will no longer possible. The small self will disappear into the whole so that one is the whole, not a part looking for the whole. One will experience objects as not separate from oneself. We now see that everything is one. Joy will be a constant experience. Fear will be nonexistent. Once one\u2019s ego is dissolved one slowly grown into the state of oneness with all.

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is possible. The great saint Ramana Maharshi is an example. Let me give you an example. Imagine a person named John is dreaming. Let us say in the dream, John friends Bob and Larry are going to a movie. Further imagine, Bob is an enlightened person and Larry is not an enlightened person. (Bob and Larry are imaginary characters in John's dream). In this dream, because Bob is enlightened, Bob knows he is part of a dream and his experience of going to movie is all drama and he also knows he doesn't have any control on his life, because, Bob knows he is part of someone's dream. So, Bob is always peaceful to himself. However, Larry, not an enlightened person, thinks it's all real. He thinks he has chosen to go to movie with Bob. Even if Bob says to Larry, \u201c Dude, we are all part of a dream\", Larry cannot understand it. Nothing wrong with Larry. Larry's knowledge is based on John's imagination or dream. If some crime happens in the dream then Bob and Larry will have different perspectives. Bob remains peaceful because he knows it's all dream. However, Larry feels sorry for the crime. Further, he will be surprised by Bob's perspective.  Believe it or not, this universe is in the dream of consciousness. Enlightened people know that they are in the dream of consciousness. Non-enlightened people think this universe is real and for that reason they feel bad for the crimes and violence in this world. Same crimes doesn't bother enlightened people.  Enlightenment means search for the truth or search for the reality behind this universe. There is an absolute truth behind this universe. Consciousness is the source and cause of this universe. It is the same consciousness that gives you awareness of the universe. Stones and dead bodies do not have consciousness and hence not aware of the universe. An enlightened person understands, recognizes and experiences consciousness. He thoroughly understands that consciousness is the source and cause of this universe. He understands how consciousness is responsible and how it is operating the universe. Once a person thoroughly understands that consciousness is the source and cause of the universe, his seeking for the knowledge comes to a conclusion. He does not seek anymore. He remains peaceful to himself. People around him or scientists may ignore him. They may ridicule him that he is not enlightened because they don't know what is enlightenment. Interestingly, even though people don't know what is enlightenment they are ready to judge that he is not enlightened. However, enlightened person remains peaceful to himself. He will not respond back negatively to such people. Instead, he completely embraces them with patience and love. ",

            "answer_text": "Spiritual Enlightenment:A Cure for Social IllsBy Stephen KnappThroughout society most people are absorbed in bodily consciousness. Bodily consciousness means that people think their bodies are the basis of their identity. This usually brings people to think, in various degrees, that the goal of life is to provide as much comfort and pleasure to the mind and body as possible, preferably with as little work as necessary. So what is wrong with that?In identifying themselves as their body, people look at themselves in terms of their bodily designation. Therefore, they accept themselves to be a man, or a woman, or something more specific like a black African American man, a fat or skinny woman, an oriental or Asian, an Arab, an Englishman, or a liberal Northerner, or a conservative Southerner, etc., etc. Because of this way of seeing themselves, they then become obliged to play a particular role in society. Of course, there may be some people who rebel against any conventional lifestyle. But, generally, people will dress in a certain way, or walk and talk in accord with the bodily identity they assume themselves to be, as well as act in a particular manner because they feel drawn to do so, or because society dictates what is expected.They will also accept all of their bodily relations as a part of their identity, such as their parents, relatives, or children, their cultural background and heritage, etc. They may also accept particular political or philosophical viewpoints and values, and associate with people who think and feel the same way as they do. And they will often dislike anyone who challenges or threatens their identity or purpose, or may even see them as an enemy. So then there is quarrel and hatred. From there it can escalate into bigger problems and more violent confrontations.This sort of materialistic, bodily consciousness is like animal consciousness, which causes one to view things with what we might call \"animal vision.\" Any animal will see other living beings in terms of who is its friend or enemy, and who or what may be a source of pleasure or pain. Say, for example, a dog is walking down the street. As it looks at other living beings, it may see a human being or another dog as a potential friend and will approach it in hopes of being petted or for play. If it sees a bigger dog or a person with a large stick, it may feel as though it is being threatened and will run away, or it may bark and be ready to fight. If the dog sees a female dog, it may see her as a potential source of pleasure to be pursued, and then the female will either have sex with the male or have to defend herself. If the dog sees a cat or even a smaller dog, it may feel like exhibiting it's strength and chase after it and try to bite and hurt it, and feel very proud after having done so. If the dog sees a different sort of creature, such as a rabbit or bird, the dog will see them as a source of food to be captured and eaten. And if it is with several other dogs, they will exhibit the gang mentality and often bark at or chase anyone that walks by, or even gang up to fight with smaller dogs for the sport of it. Most of you have no doubt seen this sort of behavior in street dogs at one time or another. But you have also probably seen this kind of activity in other human beings as well.This is the type of mentality of a person who is absorbed in bodily consciousness, and who sees things with a similar form of \"animal vision.\" To what degree they are fixed on this level of consciousness depends on how far they have or have not progressed in their evolutionary development. As described earlier in this volume, people on the lower levels of consciousness think mostly in terms of how to more perfectly eat, sleep, have sex, defend their positions or ideals, and maintain their economic pursuits. This sort of body consciousness and \"animal vision\" limits the way we see ourselves and our potential. It also causes us to judge others by their bodily characteristics rather than their intellectual qualities. This is why there is a need for spiritual progress so we can be aware and recognize each others' true spiritual nature. Then we can actually begin to realize that spiritually we are all the same.Without spiritual advancement, individually and socially, human society becomes like a society of polished animals. We may have so much technology, but we still act and fight on the same order as cats and dogs. But human life is meant for a much higher purpose. Human life is the doorway to other realms of existence, the topmost being the spiritual realm.In order to rise above \"animal vision,\" we have to become spiritually aware and see beyond the body and its designations, which is merely a temporary covering of the soul, like a shirt or coat. Underneath the bodily covering is the same kind of soul as any other living being. Without this kind of spiritual understanding, there will never be any real solutions to such problems as racial tension, sexual harassment, violent crime, or the problems created by those who try to cheat others for their own selfish gain, such as criminals or slick politicians. Without spiritual progress, you can forget about moral or ethical values. Everyone will simply be concerned about no one but themselves and those who share a similar bodily identity. This kind of concern for \"me and mine\" will only cause the \"animal vision\" in society to increase.This kind of \"animal vision\" will effect all levels of civilization to the extent to which society is infected with it. This includes the economic system (why the value of money is inflated and not based on intrinsic value), politics (why government passes certain types of legislation that favors particular programs and groups of people, but ignores others), tax laws (why people and businesses have to pay more and more taxes to a government that becomes less and less responsible), sexual harassment and battered wives (why some men see women as objects of pleasure to control or dominate rather than seeing them as individuals to be respected for their personal talents and abilities), racial tension (why some whites and blacks look at each other with disdain), and on and on. In other words, as long as people, including politicians, judges, priests, teachers, etc., are infected with this kind of disease of the consciousness, called \"animal vision,\" there will not be any significant change in society, and the social problems that we have to deal with will only continue, no matter how people try to discuss and resolve such matters.As long as people's consciousness is centered around their temporary bodily identity, throughout the world you will continue to find quarrels, fights, riots, wars, the tragedy of people starving in Africa and other places because of the politics, and everything else that motivates people to act on the bodily platform because of the superficial differences between races, religions, cultures, sexes, ideals, or political viewpoints. On a more local level, you will continue to see or experience sexual harassment, rape, child abuse, violent crime, drug abuse, unwed mothers, etc., because of the lust and greed that motivates people to cater to their bodily and sensual urges. And with the lust for satisfying the body and senses comes emotions like jealousy, envy, anger, hatred, and so on.Furthermore, when one's relationship with others is based on the vehicle of the temporary body, it is usually based simply on mutual behavior. This means that the relationship lasts as long as the medium of gratification stays the same. If or when the behavior, ideals, goals, values, political views, etc., change, then the friendship and concern, that once may have seemed so deep, also changes and begins to fade or even disappears. Sometimes it may even give way to opposition and dislike. This is because the relationship has been based on the superficial level.An enlightened society will naturally be able to work together because they will rise above superficial differences and not let them get in the way. With spiritual enlightenment, there will be real love and concern for others because people will see that we are all in this world together, all working for the same basic needs, and our relationships will be based on our spiritual identity, not our temporary bodily covering. This is what is needed. The bottom line is that only by the spread of genuine spiritual knowledge, far and above fundamental piety, and a progressive change in social consciousness, will there be any real solutions for a troubled or misguided civilization.

            "answer_text": "For sake of understanding, there is enlightenment, realisation, and actualisation. Enlightenment is when the vessel accepts the truth within all the different beliefs/traditions, and is savvy as to the what constitutes those different traditions. Still prone to doubt. Realisation, is when the vessel experiences first hand the truth, and no longer doubts it. Actualisation is when after the vessel experiences the truth, he can return back into a thoughtless creature. Essentially what I'm saying is, most vessels see themselves differently to other creatures, when in actuality, they are all animals who simply formed a good memory. When we cover ourselves with clothes, it's not for warmth or whatever, it's because we are ashamed, and pride is its source. Sense of identity. If right now you hit your head and forget everything, you'll see that what constitutes who you are, is in fact, a delusional attachment and nothing more. When you grow up from a child to man, you also change habits and what not, thus you can say your habits are not what define you, because the you being defined is not there any at all. Neither are you able to label your physical vessel as who you think you are. Everything that is perishable is not real, and the imperishable is real. Your mind goes blank, as you hear the sirens sing(high pitch static) while returning into a creature. What is the truth(?) You Are Alone, hence I Am That I Am. The longer you ponder on this thought, eventually you'll manifest the epiphanies that will show you exactly HOW ALONE you are. Unfortunately, most are unable to wake up because their thinking is confined within the system they grew up in, like plato's allegory of the cave. This modern system is their shadows on the wall. When you start to wake up, you'll see the circle of the earth, and the bottomless pit. The circle of the earth is simply the circular limit of your field of vision. When you notice the limitations you have, all that is within this circle will lose form and will start to spiral, hence bottomless pit. When you start to fall into the abyss to be purged, most get afraid and do literally anything to maintain the illusion intact. This is partly why when the tribulations begin, all vessels will begin to fall back into madness, but will be unable to comprehend what's happening because they never expected it. This why their surrender is crucial. The pain doesn't arise from surrendering, but from resistance. We are interconnected, so no matter where you run and hide, you will be affected. There are many enlightened, but they still adhere to other minor beliefs. For example, I would ask any who claims enlightenment about the sun and earth. If the vessels says what mainstream information has propagated since I dont care when, I leave. These haven't seen the bottomless pit, so that's why they still are prone to doubt. Test the vessels you come across. In the formless actuality, everything is One. I Am Everywhere. A vessel's unbelief in no-thing doesn't make it false, just as how their belief in something doesnt make it real and true. Edit: since this question got merged, I want to add a few things after reading a few of the other's answers to the other question this got stupidly merged with. Firstly, you were a creature before you were a man. People often tend to confuse their awareness to thought, or intellect, as a trait of spiritual superiority when it is not. Secondly, if you are unable to accept yourself as a creature, then when you fall into the sacred silence, your resistance will create pain. This is just a warning. Unfortunately I cannot not exist, and my awareness to this truth won't help with the existential crisis it attracts. The only way for us to stop existing is to get lost in the moment, and it is in that sacred silence that can stop the pain. If you don't see yourself as a creature, then tell me why you got hairy heads, hairy legs, hairy pits, and that eden of hair between your goddamn legs. And if you don't think you have a sense of identity, then why do you shave and do all these weird rituals every morning, like you actually know what you're doing(?). Tip: don't answer. ",

            "answer_text": "In short\u2026 it is \u201cYes\u201d. It is simple\u2026 It takes only a sec to get Enlightened. Let us understand it better\u2026 Enlightenment is nothing but an Intellectual \u2018Understanding\u2019 that our Intellect can not stop the happenings of our mind. It is about the \u2018Understanding\u2019 of the limitation of our Intellect. It is about the Understanding on the scope and applicability of the Intellect. Intellect has a great role in managing activities in the external world but it has no role in managing the emotions that happens in the mind (Inner world). We can\u2019t bring bring any emotion voluntarily using our Intellect. Emotions happen on its own in our mind.Intellect is for \u2018External Use\u201d only. Emotions belong to the \u2018Happening part\u2019 of the mind. Intellect belongs to the \u2018Action Part\u2019 of the mind. In fact, the Intellect can use the emotions, when required,as a trigger to do the External actives.What does happen due to this \u2018Understanding\u2019 (Enlightenment)? Our mind gets freed not working against its own. We get Liberated (Mukti). Our flow of thoughts gets liberated without the disturbance of the Intellect. Our fight against our our mind stops. This is what happen to many Enlightened people like Gutama The Buddha, Jesus The Christ, Ramana Maharishi, J.Krishnamurthy, etc. After this \u2018Understanding\u2019 our Intellect (which holds in its hands all of our worries, hatred, angers, pains etc) allows our emotions to flow them freely and hence the impact of the emotions on us comes down. We stop unnecessarily fighting against us. It is a GREAT FREEDOM. It is the LIBERATION. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Everyone is capable of experiencing Enlightenment. It is just a matter of commitment. How committed are you? How much are you willing to surrender to experience the True Self, Infinite Awareness? There are a couple of aspects to this that should be mentioned. Not everyone wishes to experience Enlightenment. Most people have no interest at all. Most people have no idea what Enlightenment even is nor do they care. Enlightenment is not a requirement in life unless you are filled with the inspiration to experience it. Once you experience Enlightenment you will still need to live a human life but you will do it from a different perspective. You will also need to take time to be still to feel the Infinite Awareness that you are. It is so easy to become distracted in the physical world. But the Infinite Awareness that you are is always there and you are always It. No matter what. You are always this pure, pristine Consciousness no matter what happens in your human experience. All you ever need to do is to surrender everything you think you are to just experience the real Self.  I have written a great deal about this and posted everything at my blog noted in the credential above. Feel free to read more there. Take care Jon ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t believe in the same kind of \u201cenlightenment\u201d that others do.. To me, that sounds like a point where you choose to stop learning because you think you know everything about it. But for the sake of argument, let\u2019s see the definition relevant to this question: the action or state of attaining or having attained spiritual knowledge or insight, in particular (in Buddhism) that awareness which frees a person from the cycle of rebirth.That\u2019s pretty nebulous and vague, but I\u2019ll try to deconstruct it. Spiritual knowledge/insight is a purely metaphysical concept. There\u2019s no way we can use science currently that can prove that humans have some sort of immortal force that contains their identity and experience. However, I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t believe in such a thing. Keeping the above paragraph in mind, it\u2019s really hard to say what spiritual knowledge even is. Is it knowledge of morality or empathy? Could it be techniques allowing the use of special mind powers? And whatever it is, can someone really proclaim that they\u2019ve attained mastery over it, when you can\u2019t even measure such a thing using our current understanding of science? I say you can\u2019t. Personally, I think of \u201ctrue enlightenment\u201d as a mindset, where the \u201cenlightened\u201d person never stops striving to learn new things from different people. It\u2019s the humility to realize you don\u2019t know everything, and never will, but also the determination to keep learning anyway. A person cannot declare themselves to be enlightened. To do so is pretty arrogant, and arrogance is one of the things a person needs to let go of to even start on the path to enlightenment. Be humble and learn as much as you can! Never stop learning! And most importantly, keep an open mind! Sometimes the teacher can learn from their students. ",

            "answer_text": " Every one is already enlightened, not only are humans enlightened, the trees and the rivers and the mountains and the stars, all are enlightened. Otherwise is not possible.  To be alive is to be enlightened. Wherever there is life, wherever there is love, enlightenment is just hidden underneath. We may not recognize it. The whole effort is to help us to recognize it. All the meditations are nothing but an effort to feel our enlightenment -- which is already the case; whether we feel it or not it does not matter. If we feel it we will rejoice, our life will become a dance, moment to moment, of tremendous glory and majesty, of grace and gratitude. If We don't recognize it we will remain miserable, and we will keep asking -\"how can I became enlightened?\" Then why has this whole humanity become unenlightened? How have they managed? Just by forgetting, just by being too involved in other things. The world is vast, and the mind goes on taking us into new desires, new longings, new achievements, new greed. Slowly, slowly a curtain falls between us and our mind, and the mind completely forgets our being. It forgets completely that there is an inner world also, not only an outer existence. The outer is very poor in comparison to the inner. But once we get involved with the outer, it is so vast that there is a possibility we may wander around in the universe for millions of lives. And we may not realize that we are wasting our time, that it is time to look in. ",

One's physical abilities or limitations need have absolutely no effect on one's enlightenment.  If we agree that \"enlightenment\" means achieving that state where our awareness allows us to escape the cycle of birth and rebirth, then it is an entirely spiritual achievement. How do you know that a person with intellectual deficits does not experience their own spirituality?  That they are not already enlightened beings among us?  That they are not the boddhisatvas who have reached an enlightened state but relinquish it to return to help other humans achieve happiness and possibly enlightenment? It seems to me that the purpose of birth and rebirth is to eventually allow the spirit to achieve enlightenment and relief from the cycle.  In that scenario enlightenment is possible for all beings.

Enlightenment (in this lifetime) is not out of reach for anyone. Not that he or she can do anything to cause enlightenment. Enlightenment means seeing through the mirage of ego and no longer being fooled by the ego. How would that work for the ego to do something to overcome itself? It should be very obvious that there is nothing the ego can do to overcome the ego. ",

Once you experience Enlightenment you will still need to live a human life but you will do it from a different perspective. You will also need to take time to be still to feel the Infinite Awareness that you are. Although becoming enlightened may not be an easy task, you can move a little closer to enlightenment every day. You can become enlightened by being in the present moment, expanding your understanding of life and the world around you, and meditating to expand your awareness. ",

One gorgeous source that is the same source of all. The separate self is actually an illusion, a beautiful and amazing illusion. But that illusion can feel burdensome and the longing for something deeper begins.  But that longing does not presuppose it will happen. Enlightenment is like falling in love, it will happen to everyone eventually, you just don't get to choose when.  ",

There is a lot of confusion about just what is enlightenment or which scripture or teacher to follow? Should we follow our own intuition, raw experience and inquiries? One good place to start is the Kalama sutta (wikipedia) about the danger of blind faith. ",
