Otherwise all we\u2019ll do is experience what Oprah calls \u201cAha moments\u201d and keep on reading. IF we want to incorporate new information, especially new understanding, we need to review it. So i highlight passages and take notes inside the covers and reread them. In my case i also transcribe many passages that i save under various categories (currently i have over 150 categories). The one book i most often recommend at present to persons in pursuit of Truth is \u201cWaking Up \u2026\u201d by Sam Harris. rand ",
