            "answer_text": "PROGNOSTICS & DIAGNOSTICS RELIGION\u2014 Religion is going well, although not as well as expected, for people with a lot of commitments. Theology is stagnating, or seeming more and more as if it is either a chatacter fault to be religious, or something misunderstood and esoteric. Theological people will feel a 'why am I not like the other theologians\u2019 mentality. As a result, religion is increasingly for Brahmins, and as such its character, while elevated, is something of a fabrication. Religious people, sometime in the next 2000 years, will look hungrily outside of religion for something to substantiate their internal feelings\u2014perhaps a miracle, a fool, or a devil. PHILOSOPHY\u2014 Philosophy is slowly embracing technology, but as often happens the big revolutions are left up to the younger generation, so there is a conflict, a delayed response, when 40 year olds want to get more credit than 25 yrar olds. Even so, the schematic of education has never before been so objective and refined. Those who think freely can find knowledge of science as well as philosophy, language, and other subjects. There have been great advances in philosophy which are somewhat spoiled by technocratic arrogance and political concerns. It is my hope that the legacy of philosophy in education will not be permanently tarnished, and will actually reach a new golden age. SCIENCE\u2014 Science is making increasing progress on its own agenda. However, the scientists are not as similar to other people as they think. There us a degree of philosophical and historical myopism\u2014the kind that always precedes a great revolution in human thought. Unfortunately this time\u2014as usually happens before the very greatest revolutions\u2014the conservative experts think they finally understand how to approach everything\u2014this time with skepticism, the ultimate weapon\u2014 which means it will be a hard slog to get where we need to go.

            "answer_text": "Science has a common ground with philosophy. Religion has a common ground with philosophy. But science has nothing to do with religion! You could, for example, say that the Occam\u2019s Principle that the simplest answer is often the correct one, has both a philosophical and scientific aspect. You could say that the prevention of murder has a philosophical and a religious aspect. But don\u2019t try to argue religion with science or, vice-versa. ",
