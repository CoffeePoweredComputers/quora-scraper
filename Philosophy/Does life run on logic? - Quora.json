            "answer_text": "Quite certainly. Except that we don't understand the logic and often end up calling it as uncertainity. We must understand that Life itself is a logic. And how can something that is bounded by a logic would be illogical? We born, we feel, we laugh, we cry, we eat, we drink, we live, we die - Pretty much common for everyone and we know that these things will certainly happen in our life except the \u201cwhen\u201d factor and that decides our fate. There is no uncertainity in life. If something happens as we anticipate, then we call it as logical, if not, we call it as illogical. As simple as that. But that's not correct, right? Just because we don't understand something doesn't really have to be illogical. It's our ignorance that talks at those times. Just imagine, if we don't anticipate things, would anything seem logical at all? No, right? Everything will seem to be random. And what if everything happens as we anticipates? Everything will seem to be perfect. So apparently we will have to raise the actual question of \u201cHow good are we in the prediction factor?\u201d Life is that. ",

But as teens it\u2019s quit difficult to live a life on logics rather , we follow others blindlessly on the merit that they are living their life in a very lavish and cosy way; so why don\u2019t we , right !!! what i think is , the most daffy thing is people do things not just for their sake but do it just to get a fit in a community . like a boy who wants a particular t-shirt because his frnds have purchased it \u2026 for me living a life on logic is more convincing then living in a fantasy world ..

Every emotion has a logic behind it . If ever one gets to face an emotion without logic ,then just understand that your brain is not tuned or ready to take up the logic ,that is it , not that one can't see the logic ! It may be a straight consequence of expectation which again is rooted down with logics . ",

Human mind functions in a way that we tend to discover patterns in everything, sometimes even in places where there are no chances of finding. Patterns can be viewed differently by different persons and hence logics differ from person to person. For example, people can tend to develop a habit of waking up and doing a thing daily as their first thing of the day. They see a pattern that if they do the same thing, they have good days most of the day. And over time it becomes a logic for them. So in a way, life runs on the things we want it to run on ! ",

If your parents are asking you not to eat too many sweets logically you should realize that sweets are not good\u2026but emotionally you think your parents don't want you to enjoy the sweets so you start crying\u2026. And as a logical parent they should leave you to get over your tantrum but because your dad/mom is emotionally moved to see you cry they give in to your tantrum and give you sweet. Everything from advertising to politics to religion to friendships work on emotions. ",
