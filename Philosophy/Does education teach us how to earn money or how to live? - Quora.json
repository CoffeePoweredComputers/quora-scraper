            "answer_text": "Like college?  College taught me a lot of cool information that I can refer to when necessary. Mostly history stuff that I would have never tried to learn on my own, but it's really useful when evaluating the current state of things and just for pondering about where we are heading based on where we have been. It also taught me proper grammar, and how to think about building large bodies of words together so that they make sense for other people... Maybe even entertain them. I learned a bit about human behavior theories and stuff like maslows hierarchy of needs, or pavlovs dogs experiments. Good foundational knowledge to know about to help me make informed choices in my daily life.  It definitely did not teach me how to earn money. You learn that by simply trying to earn money. I don't think anything you learn from going to classes can teach you how to make money. Making money itself is its own thing.... You can use stuff you just happened to learned from college-- (like maybe you specialized your college studies in coding, and now you code for some company and make money) but you most definitely do not *need* college to earn money. In fact I think it's rather silly to attend college just to have money. **Especially** if your field does not require a degree for entry. Why get into debt to become a bartender if you know what I mean. It also didn't teach me how to live. Living does that. One does not need college to truly live life.  Overall I think professional education is a great thing though. It's a bit sad that inorder to pursue your interests in a structured setting like that you have to take out giant loans and be in debt forever, but other than that it's really a great resource to build yourself.  It's not going to make money for you or teach you how to live a good life though. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A. Ideally, education does both, but with the rapid changes in technology and how we work, perhaps not as much anymore. Education at least gives you foundational skills that you must have in order to get things done.  You need to learn to read, write, communicate, add and subtract, and learn how to learn. Education also helps to round you out as a person by exposing you to history, science, and other subject areas.  In addition, your teachers are basically your first \"bosses\" and you learn how to deal with superiors and co-workers (classmates).  In addition, education forces you to live by a regimented schedule and specific tasks.  All these are important, especially to young, impressionable children. ",
