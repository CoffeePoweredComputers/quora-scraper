            "answer_text": "Your responsibility is to keep being their parents.  Protect, feed, cloth, support, encourage, assist, teach them, mentor, have rules and expectations and boundaries you enforce,  train them for adulthood.   And as minor children in your home they should be expected to follow house rules.  Obviously you dont treat them like young children but they are not adults yet and in fact their brains wint be fully mature until their early 20's.   They should not yet be given full adult freedoms.  They should be expected to treat you with obedience and respect and honor your rules.  Of course if you didnt teach them to honor and respect you, or teach them about responsibility and respect and integrity and other important things as they grew up you cant really expect them to be that way now all of a sudden.     You cant legally kick them out until they are 18.   If they are disrespectful and disobedient and lazy, well...welcome to your consequences.     ",

I really don't know what they are supposed to give back, but I assume it's something about not killing your parents and treating them respect. ",
