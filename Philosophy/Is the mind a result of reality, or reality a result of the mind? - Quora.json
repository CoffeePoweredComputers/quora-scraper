            "answer_text": "You can not get out with the only terms 'mind' and 'reality'. Both are related but inaccessible to each other. There is only the relationship, the communication of information. For a future book, I had to deal with the poverty of this vocabulary. I added the terms 'Mind Pole' and 'Reality Pole'. You will see how it facilitates the answer to your question (at least I hope so). 'Reality' refers to the essence of reality, inaccessible to our minds, but they gather to define it. 'The mind' means the collective of our minds and not your individual mind. A brain generates a specific iteration of this collective, which borrows enormously from others. The brain makes the mental representations. They are grouped into two major parties: 'Reality pole' and 'Mind pole'. The Reality Pole is the 'reality' for the non-philosopher; it is considered 'reality' by the philosopher, that is to say representation closest to the inaccessible essence of reality. The Mind pole is 'the mind' for the non-philosopher; for the philosopher it is the part of the mind that considers, the set of representations that experience themselves as 'I'. There is therefore a 'reality', a 'mind' (collective), and a multitude of versions of the Reality and Mind poles, each specific to the individual mind that hosts it. Each brain hosts its reality and its specific 'I'. Now the answer to your question: 'the mind' is the result of 'reality', and the 'Reality pole' is the result of 'the mind', in its version reworked by the dialogue with the 'Mind pole' 'within each individual mind.

            "answer_text": "The question reads differently when:1. The word reality refers to the one objective actuality.2. The word reality refers to individual subjective realities. Mind is a brain function. Each persons reality is a subjective opinion about actuality. Actuality is the objective universe we share subjective opinions about. Some peoples realities are closer to actuality than others. ",
