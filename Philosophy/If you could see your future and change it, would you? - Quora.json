            "answer_text": "Not possible. If I see my own future, then nothing I do could change it, otherwise I would not end up being that same person that was shown to my own past self at that moment. Or, maybe this is merely an example of somebody who very, very closely resembles what a future me might look like, in which case I can rest assured that it isn\u2019t me, and so what I\u2019m seeing isn\u2019t my future. Let\u2019s say CERN (Conseil Europ\u00e9en pour la Recherche Nucl\u00e9aire, or the European Council for Nuclear Research) already invented a time machine back in 1975. I end up working for CERN, and in 2016 gain access to the time machine, and use it to show my 1975 self what I have become today. Forty-one years of a series of coincidences and intertwined events led me to the very special place where I had access to a time machine, and due to the butterfly effect, certainly any tiny change during that 41 years could have led to any number of radically different outcomes, nearly all of which involve me not hijacking that time machine. So, for that to still be \u201cme\u201d that\u2019s using that time machine (and I assure you it truly is me, the real me, not one of CERN\u2019s shapeshifters), and for that to be the real \u201cpast me\u201d that\u2019s seeing it, every single infinitesimal fraction of a second that the \u201cpast me\u201d experiences between that very instant in 1975 and when I used the time machine in 2016 must be exactly the same. It would literally be impossible to do anything any differently. Now, let\u2019s say I use this opportunity to have the past me go track down an old IBM 5100 workstation which still has a tape in it with the schematics for a time machine that I invented during my time at CERN. In 2016, this oversized pocket calculator has long turned to dust in a landfilll, but in 1975 it\u2019s cutting-edge tech, and in perfect condition, save for the pizza grease on the keys. The 1975 me finds it, builds the device described on that tape, and so invents time travel. But\u2026who actually wrote those design schematics? It was me, right? But where did the actual information come from? If it was the future me that gave them to the past me, at what point did I actually write those schematics? It\u2019s as if those plans just materialized out of nothing, that is, there\u2019s an effect that never once had a cause. Backwards time travel may not be allowed by the laws of Nature. Rather than speculate about what you could\u2019ve done better, what you should\u2019ve done, focus on what you can do right now, today, to improve. It\u2019s pointless to cry over the past. The present is where we all live, where we\u2019ve always lived, and where we will continue to live. ",
