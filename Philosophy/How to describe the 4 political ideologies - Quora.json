            "answer_text": "There are many more than just four ideologies so I will focus on the primary four that are referred to in the modern day. Liberalism - Nations today have mostly abandoned the classical liberalism of say Rousseau or Locke but continue a state capitalist government while exporting labor to what are called periferial countries. Periferial countries manufacture for first world companirs and are reliant on them for survival. Represenitive democracy is an important feature of liberalism with an emphasis on political liberties in the first world. Not so much in the third. Liberalism ranges from the social democratic welfare state such as Sweden to the lazzez faire capitalist oriented mode such as the United States. One can also observe the more government oriented capitalism of China as well. Fascism - Totalitarian state which seeks to unite all conflicting classes through the loyalty of the government and exponential nationalism. Not always xenophobic but in a sense always a feeling of superiority of over nation states. Typically expansionist. Ideologies range from Bonapartists ( those who support the government structure of napolean ) to Mussolinis fascism whos ideology stem from Giovanni Gentile Socialists - Wish to achieve a society where workers democratically control the means of production. This ideology ranges to many such as the Utopian socialists to the free market mutualists. There are as well anarcho collectivists and communalists all of which want to achieve this specific goal. It should be said that all communists are socialist but not all socialists are communists. This ideology has nothing to do with government control but those of this left wing ideology typically support welfare programs or anything of the sort that assists in supporting the working class. Communism - Marx coined the term Utopian Socialists because of their lack of scientific reasoning and ability to come about even achieving socialism. Marx manifested scientific socialism with both economic and philosophical structure to prove the flaws of capitalism and the continuation of historical development. The stages of development go as feudalism \u2192 capitalism\u2192socialism \u2192communism. Communism is defines by marx as a stateless classless society each according to their ability according to their need. This was later refined by Leninism as Lenin believed the need for a vanguard party to educate the working people. After this there was a split between Trotskyists and Stalinists. Trotsky being for democatic worker councils and Stalin believing a centralized government was necessery for the time being. (I am aware that Stalinists are known as Marxist Leninist and Trotskyists prefer just to be called Leninist) That is just a basic overview of the more popular ideologies of the time. There are many more ideologies but the question refers to four. ",

            "answer_text": "I thought there was five\u2026 Anarchism: The belief that the best government is absolutely no government is known as anarchism. This ideology argues that everything about governments is repressive and therefore must be abolished entirely. A related ideology known as nihilism emphasizes that everything\u2014both government and society\u2014must be periodically destroyed in order to start anew. Nihilists often categorically reject traditional concepts of morality in favor of violence and terror. Anarchism and nihilism were once associated with socialism because many anarchists and nihilists supported the socialists\u2019 call for revolution and the complete overhaul of government and society in the early to mid-twentieth century.  Absolutism: Traditionally, much of Western civilization\u2019s history was dominated by absolutism, the belief that a single ruler should have control over every aspect of the government and of the people\u2019s lives. Absolute rulers had a variety of titles, including chieftain, king, shah, pharaoh, emperor, sultan, and prince. In some cultures, the absolute ruler was seen as a god in human form. Other peoples believed that their ruler had the divine right of kings, meaning that God had chosen the ruler to govern the rest. As a result, many cultures with absolute rulers practiced some form of caesaropapism, the belief that the ruler is head of both the governmental authority and the religious authority.  (I guess the pope could count as well. Also a theocracy)  Liberalism: In the early modern age of the Western world (beginning roughly in the early 1500s and running for about 200 years), a number of changes occurred that led to new ideologies: The European discovery of the Americas, the rise of Protestantism, the beginnings of the free-market economy, and the early stages of the scientific revolution fundamentally altered Europe. People began developing different ways of thinking to take account of these changes. Perhaps the most important of the new ideas is liberalism (also known as classical liberalism). This type of liberalism, which began in England in the 1600s, differs from American liberalism. Classical liberalism developed when such thinkers as John Locke (in his Second Treatise of Government in 1690) rethought the relationship between the individual and society, as well theorized about the rights and responsibilities of the individual. These ideas formed the foundation for many political systems still operating today  (Liberal protest in action) Conservatism: Conservatism (also known as classical conservatism) began as a reaction against the liberal ideas taking hold of Europe during the French Revolution in the late eighteenth century. This type of conservatism differs from American conservatism. Edmund Burke, a British member of Parliament, observed the early stages of the French Revolution with great distress and predicted the violence and terror that would ensue. His book, Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), is one of the founding texts of classical conservatism. Burke and other conservatives attacked liberalism for many reasons. They argued that liberalism destroyed tradition. In its rush to overturn the old and bring in the new, liberalism and capitalism ruthlessly attacked traditional institutions and beliefs.  I picked images of people protesting yes, because if they werent they would look like everyone else until they say something. ",

            "answer_text": "Which four political ideologies? I assume that you mean liberalism, conservatism, socialism, and absolutism. Classical liberalism emerged in the 18th century and believes in 6 ideas and concepts; rights, freedoms, liberties, secularism, capitalism, and individualism. Modern social liberalism believes in all those things but also that the state should heavily regulate the economy to ensure equality of opportunity, or statism and egalitarianism. Classical conservatism emerged to combat liberalism and was based off of 4 ideas and concepts; social order, inequality, and hierarchy, monarchism, organisation of institutionalised religion, and respect of traditions. Modern conservatism is just classical liberalism or neoliberalism (classical liberalism which believes you cannot have true freedom if the economy and markets aren\u2019t free and favours low taxes and little government regulations) plus Judaeo-Christian ethics and patriotism. Socialism also was invented in the 18th century and is the political and economic philosophy and theory of social organisation which advocates for the means of production, distribution, and exchange of goods to be owned and managed collectively by the workers. Absolutism, or despotism is the belief that a single person should possess all political power and have complete control over all aspects of daily life. ",

That said once you introduce divisions, there are really only two: The individual alone can determine how best to live her peaceful life.The individual is the property of the state.Beyond this we have various flavors of the second one.. none of which can be justified via pragmatic, principled, logical, or moral justifications. NO ONE has the right to own other people. Period. Full Stop. ",
