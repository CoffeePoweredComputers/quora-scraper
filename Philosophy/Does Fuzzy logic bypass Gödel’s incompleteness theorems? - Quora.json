            "answer_text": "Question originally answered: Does Fuzzy logic bypass G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems?  Fuzzy logic subsumes classical logic. By that I mean that classical propositions are fully interpretable in fuzzy logic. Taking for our propositions only those that are either fully true or fully false as the \u2018fuzzy\u2019 equivalent of our classical propositions suffices to understand this. And for those \u2018classical\u2019 propositions the classical consequences hold. One of those classical consequences would be the incompleteness theorems! So, no fuzzy logic does not bypass the incompleteness theorems. ",
