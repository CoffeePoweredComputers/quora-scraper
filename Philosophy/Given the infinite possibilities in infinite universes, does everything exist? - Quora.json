            "answer_text": "Our universe isn\u2019t infinite. It is however expanding. We have no way to observe other universes. Or if they would even follow our physical models. So we don\u2019t know what may be going on in other hypothetical universes, or even our local galaxies or other planetary systems. Our observations do point to some things we might expect. Some molecules like water have amazing properties at the temperatures we see on earth. So we might expect life to occur on other planets that have similar properties. We might not be able to recognize a life form based on other chemistry. We might not be able to even recognize some chemistry in a different world. I don\u2019t know what \u201ceverything\u201d means but we model our understanding of the universe on our observations and experimentation. ",

            "answer_text": "Infinite possibilities does not mean everything is possible. Infinite possibilities refers to combinations and permutations. Impossible combinations are impossible. Possible combinations, however, are infinite. Words can be confusing, but the statement essentially means \u201ceverything possible is possible, and everything impossible could never occur.\u201d This makes it sound pretty mundane, and it kind of is. Typically any definition involving infinite seems confusing, but it is actually fairly simple. The word infinite just skews your intuition. ",

            "answer_text": "If one can rap oneself around the concept of FOREVER without melting your brain, it really puts things into perspective, especially if you can think about multiverses. Anything you can conceivably imagine has happened, is happening, and will happen an infinite amount of times. So, you name it you got it. Physics and mathematics is not going to get us there. If we just use the word information, then all information exists. We just have to find a way to tap into this information layer, if you will. I think we can do this, it's just going to take someone a whole lot smarter than me. Bringing our imagination to reality is the key, let's team up and do this. ",

            "answer_text": "May or may not exist. There are infinite possibilities of existence of multiple universes which means that everything that can happen may happen in one or the another universe. If there are really infinite possibilities in infinite universes then every possiblity have a chance to be a outcome but it is not necessary that every possiblity might become an outcome. It MAY be possible that all the universes are parallel universes , so there could not be time when all possibilities exist. Hope that helps. ",

If it doesn\u2019t exist it evidently must not be possible - conversely if it is possible it must necessarily exist. ",
