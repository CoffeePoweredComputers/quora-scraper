            "answer_text": "Obviously this question is based on the Hindu belief that cows are sacred animals, but I'm going to answer on behalf of most all other religious beliefs, in a very general sense, to give a different point of view. A cow is not any human's mother. A cow is only a mother to other cattle and so on and so forth. Per the Bible (Leviticus 11:1-3), meat from any animal that chews cud and has cloven hooves is clean to eat. This includes cattle (oxen, cows, steers, heifers, bulls, calves, etc.), as well as deer, antelope, sheep, goats, and other ruminant animals.  Hence for Christians, and I believe Muslims as well, eating beef is certainly not wrong or to be shunned from being served at the dinner table. ",

            "answer_text": "How can cow can be human's mother and how can eating beef be wrong? This question is obviously about the Hindu belief in the sanctity accorded to cows. No one says that the cow is a human's mother: in fact what is said is that a cow is equivalent to mother for humans. The reasoning is simple, it is the cow's milk that nourishes a person after their mothers milk. Hence the cow is accorded the same respect. Consequently its meat is shunned since it becomes akin to cannibalism/ literally eating one's mother. Aside, cows historically have been symbols of wealth and a symbol of the earth. Hence killing of cows is destruction of wealth and destruction of the earth (which is again likened to one's mother because it nourishes us). ",
