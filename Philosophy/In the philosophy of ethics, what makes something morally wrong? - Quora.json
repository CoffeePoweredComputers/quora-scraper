            "answer_text": "First, \u2018things\u2019 have no moral valence. A \u2018thing\u2019 is not good or evil, right or wrong, moral or immoral. It merely is, and only takes on a moral valence when it become part of a human action. A bomb, a teddy bear, a boat: these mean nothing unless they are used in some way. We can use a bomb to threaten or kill people, or we can use it to clear a hillside for construction; we can hug a teddy bear or throw it at someone in anger; we can sail to discover the world or sail to destroy it in war. Second, a human being in isolation has no objective moral valence. For someone stranded on a deserted island the concept of morality is useless; s\u2019he can do as s\u2019he likes and it will affect no one else, and so s\u2019he cannot possibly do anything good or bad. Morality is something that appears between people when they come into contact with each other, precisely because they must find some way of creating common values for interaction. People who live in communities naturally create common values, which means creating a shared ethic (a moral worldview). Further, these shared ethics always reach for the same basic principles: egalitarian, communitarian, integrative\u2026 There is an ideal ethic that we can treat as an objective feature of human communities, even if we cannot define it precisely, and even if no culture achieves it fully. The point of all this is that philosophical ethics are never purely about the behavior of individuals; they are about the interrelation of individuals within a society; about the systems that arise as individual freedoms interact with social responsibilities and obligations. Something is morally wrong when it excludes or brings harm (physical, emotional, economic, societal\u2026) to others. There is often disagreement about what constitutes \u2018harm\u2019: think about the current debates over repealing Obamacare, where GOP alternatives may take away access to health care from many seriously ill people. There are often efforts to exclude one group of people or another so that they are outside the bounds of moral consideration: consider the treatment of Muslims and blacks by the US far right, who treat them as outsiders with no intrinsic rights. But moral behavior always tends toward inclusion and compassion. ",

            "answer_text": "I think we ought to clarify some things about the structure of philosophy \u2013 the question seems to be folding a few different levels together, so let\u2019s disambiguate: Ethics, as a branch of philosophy, both examines and makes claims. But unlike all other branches, ethics is inherently value-laden, rather than merely descriptive \u2013 its claims are not simply of a factual nature, but also of an evaluative sort. A caveat here that in reality, all philosophy is value-laden (all science, too). But \u201cin theory,\u201d metaphysics for example would merely be uncovering a truth about the world \u2013 what is. Ethics is about what ought to be. It\u2019s virtually impossible to ground even descriptive conclusions. The infinite regress presents a problem for logical argumentation of every sort. However, that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s necessarily the same flaw in reality itself \u2013 it\u2019s a problem with the structure of logic, not with the world, in other words. We may never be able to satisfactorily ground an \u201cis\u201d argument, but it may still be the case that its conclusions are true. Oughts don\u2019t \u201cexist\u201d externally in this way. The infinite regress problem is fatal to ethics almost immediately if you\u2019re hoping to get to an absolute ethical statement with logic alone (which is part of why I\u2019m not an analytic \u2013 you need emotional appeal to make it really work). It\u2019s easy to break down any ethical statement using some form of the Socratic method in no time at all (I\u2019d be happy to demonstrate if anyone would like an example!) Moreover, ethics isn\u2019t unified under any one central set of assumptions or definitions beyond the basic premise (there are things we ought to and ought not to do, and we can figure out and argue for what those are). Individual theories have vastly different takes on what we ought to do or not do, not to mention differing views on how those oughts figure into something like a concept of \u201cmorality.\u201d Very few ethicists use the term \u201cmorality\u201d in their work. In general, the distinction is something like: morality concerns what is right and wrong even if there is no one else around to be harmed by it. That\u2019s how you get things like religious arguments against masturbation \u2013 it\u2019s wrong because it\u2019s wrong, it doesn\u2019t matter if doesn\u2019t hurt anyone (it\u2019s also why most people making such arguments will resort to claiming that it hurts the one doing it - but that\u2019s a betrayal of sorts of the actual religious justification, which is \u201cbecause God says so.\u201d Maybe God says so because he doesn\u2019t want you to hurt yourself, but if one of his rules was designed to make you suffer, you\u2019d be equally obligated to follow it). Ethics is at least in part about the effects of actions, and is thus easier to argue for logically. Morality in the sense I\u2019ve used it simply cannot be argued for. It can be stated or asserted, but there can be no formal argument. The most fundamental definition of what is ethical is \u201cthose actions which are right to do, or are not wrong to do.\u201d As far as what qualifies? Views, to say the least, differ greatly. The fundamental shared value of most ethical systems is a concern with the well-being of either an individual or some group, or both. Some systems eschew self-concern for group well-being, some do the opposite. But almost all assert, passively at least, that there is some ethical \u201csubject\u201d which warrants consideration because its well-being is important. So a step further: that which is ethical is that which is good for, or not bad for, whatever subject warrants consideration. The particulars, again, are up for grabs. ",
