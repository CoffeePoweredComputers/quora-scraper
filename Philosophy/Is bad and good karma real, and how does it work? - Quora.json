            "answer_text": "Karma literally means \u201caction\u201d and in a spiritual context, it refers to how one\u2019s actions impinge spirituality. The spiritual concept is related to the Sanskrit term \u201csamskara\u201d or \u201clatent impression\u201d [in the mind left from experience]. Ancient spiritual texts had no concept of modern science or modern physiology, and so their meaning is very difficult to understand in modern terms and often misinterpreted. On the superficial level, karma merely refers to action and reaction: if you do something stupid, like touch a hot stove, you get burned; if you eat a tasty meal, you get to enjoy that tasty meal. If you do something bad, people will tend to treat you badly; if you do something nice, people will tend to treat you nicely. On a deeper level, karma relates to memory: all actions will leave memories; good actions, leave good memories; bad actions, leave bad memories. ON an even deeper level, we get to samskaras: the impressions left in the mind which tend to randomly pop up and take us away from our silent resting state \u2014 our True Self (atman) \u2014 which has no qualities other than a simple I am. When one has an experience, it may not be processed efficiently and so, in modern terms, it is called \u201cstressful.\u201d Even an entirely pleasant, positive experience, if it is overwhelming, can be stressful. From a spiritual perspective, any experience a non-enlightened person has is overwhelming and so at least somewhat stressful. In ancient texts, this damage from stress is called \u201csamskaras.\u201d When one rests, the brain is able to repair damage from stress; samskaras are eliminated, to put it in ancient terminology. The deeper the rest, the deeper-rooted the stress-damage that can be repaired. This repair activity is appreciated internally as random thought (\u201csamskaras become more apparent\u201d as ancient texts put it). During the practice of truly restful meditation, there is no attempt to control the process and so the process proceeds only on the basis of this principle: resting leads to repair-activity; repair activity is appreciated as increased mental activity; once that repair-activity subsides, meditation leads to even deeper rest, which leads to repair activity, appreciated as increased mental activity, Rinse and repeat. It turns out that this inward turning of attention during meditation actually starts to turn down awareness-of activity in the brain. This is appreciated as \u201cmore subtle\u201d mental activity. Should this dialing down of attention go far enough, attention simply ceases. This is samadhi \u201cwithout seed,\u201d though samskaras may remain even if you are not aware of them during samadhi. Normally ceased attention is referred to as \u201cdeep sleep\u201d: not only are you not aware of anything, but your brain isn\u2019t doing anything either. However, during samadhi, the brain remains in an alert mode, and so continues to repair itself. Should this repair activity become great enough, it overcomes the cessation of awareness-of activity that we call samadhi, and so one becomes aware of the repair activity: thoughts \u2014 stress-repair activities \u2014are again perceived in the mind since samadhi is no longer present. And this is where past life assumptions come in. Normally, repair activity is associated with memory: the stressful event in one\u2019s life that led to the samskaras left memories that are triggered when the damage from stress (samskara) is repaired. However, sometimes there is no known event that is being remembered: the mental activity associated with stress-repair is related to nothing you ever experienced. The modern explanation is that the perceived mental activity isn\u2019t an actual memory but random activity in the brain that emerges when the same repair mechanism is dealing with inherited weakness, rather than repairing an actual stressful event in your life. The traditional explanation is that the same repair mechanism is dealing with samskaras caused/brought-about by karma (actions) from a previous life and that these random thoughts that emerge during deep meditation are actual memories from a past life. . Your choice as to which explanation you prefer. Both explanations deal with the same phenomenon. but one is based on Western science, and one is based on philosophies that evolved to attempt to explain reality before Western scientific theories evolved. You can reconcile the one with the other, if you like, using whatever justification suits your fancy. It matters not one bit as far as becoming enlightened goes, but one explanation leads to court cases declaring meditation a religious practice, and the other leads to world religions promoting meditation as stress management suitable for children and adults: Impacting Children\u2019s Health Through Meditation Globally  Medical students learn meditation to counter stress, promote physician wellness ",
