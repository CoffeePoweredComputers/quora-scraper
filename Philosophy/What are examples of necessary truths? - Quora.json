            "answer_text": "What are examples of necessary truths? Necessary truths are contingent truths. If this, then that. \u201cNecessary\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean useful, here. Only that the truth follows necessarily from the premise being true. For example, \u201cIf a claim is true, its negation cannot be true.\u201d This principle is called \u201cthe law of the excluded middle\u201d or something. How it\u2019s used matters more than what it\u2019s called, in every useful case. If the claim \u201cHumans cannot survive without oxygen\u201d is true, then \u201cHumans don\u2019t need oxygen to survive\u201d must be false. It follows necessarily. The \u201cmiddle\u201d position: humans both don\u2019t and do need oxygen to survive, is excluded. Trivial! Truism, they call it when it\u2019s so obvious, maybe too obvious to mention. Tautology, when it\u2019s true by definition, to the point you\u2019re just restating the definition in different words. The trivially true adds nothing new. But useful to keep the exclusion in mind while reasoning, so you don\u2019t stumble into a bungle and look like a clumsy oaf - gasping for the oxygen you forgot all about! Let\u2019s have some examples, then shall we? You can think of some, I can think of some. Let\u2019s just throw a bunch out there. \u201cLife reproduces itself, therefore there is always male and female.\u201d False! What about asexual budding, bud? What about reproduction by division? Anytime you can contradict the claimed necessary truth by showing examples where different conclusions entirely can follow from the prior truth, do it. This is called whataboutism.Kidding. It\u2019s not called whataboutism - sometimes you\u2019ve got to liven up these dry topics. Or: \u201cHumans are animals, therefore it necessarily follows that humans poop.\u201d Well we do! Again, not particularly useful. Everybody poops, it\u2019s a truism. Also: it doesn\u2019t follow. Because not all animals poop. In \u201ceverybody poops,\u201d \u201ceverybody\u201d is understood as people.\u201cGravity is a curvature of spacetime, therefore its effect would necessarily be observable very near very massive objects, such as the sun.\u201d This necessary truth proved the nail in the coffin for Newtonian gravity, and sparked the ascendancy of Einstein\u2019s view (mind you, not really - Newton\u2019s view was right - just not so infinitely precise as it could be). Scientists saw what Einstein\u2019s theory of gravitation implied. Saw what necessary truths flowed from it, and planned to take some observations during a solar eclipse. Bingo!That necessary truth proved useful. So useful that when NASA was gearing up all sweaty to get to the moon, they used Newton\u2019s math not Einstein\u2019s. Well, it was precise to an nth degree, and easier to figure. Easier means fewer mistakes; couldn\u2019t afford any mistakes: Newton\u2019s it was. But in the increased refinement of our view of gravity, and the further explorations it enabled, Einstein\u2019s was still a very useful truth. How about some more trivial examples. I think, therefore I am. The logic here\u2019s a bit biased, me I\u2019d say I think, and I observe I think I am - but that would not be a necessary truth. Plus, sounds hesitant and dumb. The first is formulated as necessary: \u201ctherefore.\u201d I am follows necessarily from I think. What if you\u2019re some kind of hypothetical thinking figment, dude? But Descartes didn\u2019t fuss on that. To him, he was like, well clearly I am thinking. Therefore I am. Not bad. If I am anything, then I am. For what it\u2019s worth, it might be better if you didn\u2019t slap an I think on the front of it. Check the effect: \u201cChicken-Brad is a true friend of mine. It is necessarily true then that Chicken-Brad is not secretly my enemy and therefore no friend at all.\u201d That follows. It\u2019s airtight. Excluded middle! If Chicken-Brad = friend is true, then Chicken-Brad = not friend is false! BUT: \u201cI think Chicken-Brad is a true friend of mine. It is necessarily true then that Chicken-Brad is not secretly my enemy and therefore no friend at all.\u201d Uh. No. Nothing about Chicken-Brad follows necessarily from you think Chicken-Brad. Which gets us to the crux. There isn\u2019t a necessary truth unless it follows as the inevitable consequence of a prior truth. If the prior truth is in doubt, so is the consequence. Capisce? As a further general rule of logic, I don\u2019t know how much trust you want to put in a dude called Chicken-Brad. ",

            "answer_text": "The necessary truths to ascertain any knowledge are the two laws of being: the law of noncontradiction and its corollary, the law of cause and effect or causality. If you deny these truths, you\u2019re just talking nonsense, even when scientist do, they are talking science fiction, not science. This is the foundation of all learning and truth. All truth is God\u2019s truth and meets at the top according to Augustine and Aquinas (two giants who probably have no peers). God is the God of truth and truth sets us free. Jesus came to bare witness of the truth and is the incarnation or personification of it. Truth is knowable and we have erred from it. The Dalai Lama said that truth is the ultimate realtity. ",
