            "answer_text": "I did. I could. May be I was lucky. May be I was gifted. I could graduate by 18. Yes, after losing 1 year due to sickness before the final examinations, I passed Bachelor of Science (Special) examinations with a First Class in 1966. I applied for and got selected for the very prestigious Training School Programme of Department of Atomic Energy and joined the 10th Batch of Atomic Energy Establishment Trombay Training School (shortened as AEETS) in the Physics branch. That was in August 1966 when I was 18 years and a few months. I was getting a monthly stipend of 300 rupees - probably worth 30,000 rupees today\u2026 Even today, you can pass 12th standard or its equivalent like Intermediate examination by 17th or 18th, find some work (full time or part time) and join a degree college that has shifts or take up the degree programs online (distant education). But then why don\u2019t many do it? Because their parents will prefer that the children (yes, to the parents, they are still children, though legally they are adults) focus on their education - and the parents take care of the expenses. That is what we did - we encouraged our first son to fulfill his dream of getting into IIT. Even he had to sacrifice one year - he passed his intermediate examination in 1996 but had to wait one more year to get into IIT (in his second attempt). In 1997, he too was 18. I escorted him all the way from Hyderabad to Guwahati where he got admission into B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering branch. We (myself and similar parents) took the children by train from Hyderabad to Howrah and from there by flight (for many, that was the first flight, including for my son) to Guwahati, stayed with them in their hostel for a few days, bought what they needed (mattresses, buckets, bed sheets etc.) and returned. The IIT people set up their bank accounts. So, we used to transfer funds once in a few months and give them the college fee etc. once in six months when they came for vacation. So, if parents can afford, try to study or do what you want to do and try to fulfill your dreams\u2026 When he got married in 2005, his wife (our daughter in law) wanted to pursue a 2 year post graduate program MBA in IIT, Mumbai. So, she resigned her hob in Wipro. Her parents or her husband (our son) could not accompany her to Mumbai from Hyderabad and she was OK with that. But we did not like that and we escorted her to Mumbai and ensured that she settled comfortably in her hostel at IIT, Powai campus. So, for parents, grown up children are still children. We try to make their lives as comfortable as possible because of our love and affection to them. They too reciprocate the affection. If the economic situation does not allow you to study or you really want to be financially and otherwise independent, go ahead. ",

But later when you are experienced then you will get a good amount. 18 years of age is too early to start earning. Try to focus on your studies. If there is financial problem then you can definitely opt for earning options. ",
