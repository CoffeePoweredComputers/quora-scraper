            "answer_text": "The answer depends upon the definition of \u201cEducation Philosophy\u201d or a \u201cPhilosophy of Education\u201d. (The terms refer to the same thing.) Definitions vary and that becomes critical. For example, one definition that commonly appears in searches, suggests that it is a personal philosophy that an individual teacher has, which is a vague definition. It suggests that somewhere, in some country, there is a single individual teacher, and that specific teacher has a \u201cphilosophy\u201d of education. Is that personal philosophy of that individual person about education something that the rest of the world should regard as important? Here for example, is the result of one search about http://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/cte/ncteb-edphil.pdf Educational Philosophies. Look very carefully at some of the \u201cwording\u201d used. For example, look at the title: Educational Philosophies in the Classroom This looks\u2026.rather plain does it not? Most people would look at that and never think that there is something \u201cmanipulative\u201d about the words being used. What it does is suggest to you, that Educational Philosophies exist in a classroom or can be applied in a classroom. As a result, your thinking is guided to think of a single room, and you might think of some students their paying close attention to what a teacher is saying. Your imagination suggests to you that a teacher is speaking about a subject in pleasant but firm tones which stimulate thinking in the students. Your mind is guided to thing of an \u201cEducational Philosophy\u201d as a set of forward-thinking rules or guidelines which help this particular teacher perform in a job. What is the problem with suggestive language like that? The answer is like this. It directs the thinking and understanding of anyone reading it to understand that there is a rather pleasant set of philosophical guidelines which help a nice teacher, and this exists \u201cin a classroom\u201d. All of which stimulates familiar and pleasant images. It is rather like someone writing to tell people about a \u201cGambling Philosophy\u201d and they write something which suggests that a \u201cGambling Philosophy\u201d in a card game so that individual persons can win money. Is that true. It is partly true. However it guides your thinking so that you think that an Educational Philosophy does not exist anywhere else. Where else could an Educational Philosophy be? If an Educational Philosophy exists somewhere, besides in the mind and thinking of a 4th grade elementary school teacher, where else could an Educational Philosophy exist? To answer the question, it is necessary that the mind and the thinking about the question, rise above the level which might suppose, for example, that a luxurious gambling casino is built by a bunch of really nice fellows whose charitable and compassionate sentiments motivate them to offer people in the community an inspirational opportunity to win money.  Consider if you will, that there are highly suggestive and misleading statements offered and these appear in many searches. This one for example, at the conclusion of the cited essay which defines \u201cEducational Philosophy\u201d. Look at the concluding sentence: \u201cThese philosophies are beneficial to all students and should be applied in school environments.\u201d\u2014\u2014 http://www.doe.in.gov/sites/default/files/cte/ncteb-edphil.pdf That showed 8 different Educational Philosophies. If a person has any intelligence at all about the modern world, they will recognize that an \u201cEducational Philosophy\u201d is embraced and used by a lot more people in a lot more domains than the mind of some teacher in a classroom in some prairie town in the State of Kansas, U.S.A. Does anyone really believe that governments spend millions of dollars, and billions of dollars, on school buildings, and teacher salaries, and administrations and textbooks. in which the only place the Educational Philosophy exists is in the thinking of individual \u201cteachers\u201d in classrooms at various places? Who is it who \u201cdecides\u201d that those 8 Educational Philosophies should all \u201c\u2026be applied in school environments.\u201d? Ah, but you see, that is the Wizard of Oz. That is \u201cthe man behind the curtain\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "In an honest, sincere setting, philosophies of education do what any philosophy has always done, Try to define reality. And say helpful things about it. However, in a dishonest insincere setting, philosophies of education become just another kind of ideological sophistry. They become another weapon in the propaganda war, another sort of agitprop. John Dewey and his bunch were not working toward philosophical truth. They were fashioning education theories that would take the country where they already knew they wanted to go. Progressivism was not a search for truth. It was a name for the type of socialism they wanted you to accept. One interesting aspect of all the socialist coups and outbursts was what retailers call bait and switch. Lenin said the people would have land, bread, and peace. They never again had any of those. Think about Pol Pot going back to Cambodia to build a workers paradise. He got a little tangled up in his thinking and had to kill a few million people. Hitler promised a thousand-year Reich but tens of millions died young. Stalin said that the Russians were getting a chance to have a brand-new, world-class civilization. But then he executed 20 or 30 million. Who can keep an accurate count? When progressives promised a better kind of education, who imagined that meant 50 million functional illiterates? There's a lot of salesmanship in socialist philosophy and education philosophy. ",
