            "answer_text": "In every logical system there must be unproved premises, that are assumed to apply to the universe of instances that satisfy the premises. Often both distributive laws are taken as premises without proof. But by interpreting the equivalence in terms of subsets, we can easily show that each element in one of the two subsets is also in the other, thus showing they are equivalent. Remember. Boolean algebra is just subset algebra. ",
