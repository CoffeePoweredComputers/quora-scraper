            "answer_text": "First impression is the mental image a person portrays, of himself, during the first meeting. A fake first impression might do good for once but it might not be good for a long time. At first, you might feel great by making the other person see a fake personality of yourself. But, one thing that needs to be kept in mind is that you are who you are and you cannot fake your personality forever or even multiple times. What I mean is that no matter what, you should not try to fake your impression on someone just for the sake of a favour. That might have some short term benefits but no long term benefits at all. So, keep some points in mind if you want to really grab an opportunity in future without any fake impression of yourself, Never be afraid of your weaknesses. You can surely work upon them from time to time. No need to rush about it.Have full confidence in yourself , no matter what the situation .Do self introspection from time to time. That might be a great way to learn more and more positive things about yourself.People judge easily and that is the reason you need to try a fake impression. What you should do is never worry about people\u2019s judgemental opinions, never ever!! You are unique in your own way and you dont need anyone\u2019s opinion.Do know that being true to yourself will only help you in future\u2026AND, LOVE YOURSELF",

When someone asks , how are you doing and you respond I'm good,or I'm ok, but you're not, is that fake? People do that all the time, it may not be right but they don't want to burden others with their problems or are uncomfortable Sharing their feelings. ",
