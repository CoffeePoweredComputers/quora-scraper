            "answer_text": "Platonic dualism means the separation Plato posited between the body and the soul and the separation he posited between our world of visible matter and the invisible world of what he called The Forms. For Plato, the visible world around us was not completely real; it was only a \u201cresemblance\u201d of that which is \u201creally real,\u201d a reality found only in the realm of The Forms. The Forms, for Plato, were the original \u201cmodels\u201d or \u201cprototypes\u201d (if you will) of all the physical objects we see on earth. For example, Plato would argue, each tree on earth is only identifiable as a tree insofar as it resembles the perfect TREE that exists in the realm of the Forms, a place our minds were familiar with before we were born and of which we have retained only a vague and imperfect recollection. An analogy might help here. Most of the items we use each day are made by tool and die machines. The machine takes a chunk of metal and grinds it into the shape of the product to be mass produced. So the coffee cup you have on your kitchen table is a copy of an original prototype\u2014the metal one. Think of the original metal prototype as the Form of all later copies. These cups on all our tables look similar to us, Plato might say, because our minds are aware of a prototype of this cup that exists in a world we came from before we were born. We still remember that original cup, and we recognize all other cups as cups because they remind us of THE cup. So, for every object on earth, there is a Form of that object in the World of the Forms. This accounts, also, for the ideas we have of how things differ in \u201cdegree\u201d from each other. We find, for example, one face more beautiful than another. We judge statements as being true or false. We judge men to be good or bad, a situation to be just or unjust. Plato would say that such evaluations are indications that somewhere outside our immediate sense experience there must exist a thing that is \u201cmost beautiful,\u201d \u201cmost true,\u201d \u201cmost morally good,\u201d \u201cmost just,\u201d etc. So, for Plato, even ideas and concepts have their original models in the world of the Forms. For Plato, there existed \u201cmatter\u201d and \u201cform,\u201d but for him they were not contained together in the same object. A physical object had \u201cmatter,\u201d but its \u201cform\u201d was in the other-worldly realm, the world of The Forms. Plato believed that the soul was superior to the body, because the soul could remember what it once saw in the world of the Forms, whereas the body had no such transcendent capability. The body, for Plato, was a hindrance to the soul\u2019s ability to see reality clearly. The soul\u2019s desire was to be free from the body, for only when it was free could it contemplate the Forms without encumbrance. This, then, is Plato\u2019s idea of dualism. ",

            "answer_text": "Platonic dualism refers to Plato's Theory of Forms. A very basic outline of this idea would go something like this. If you draw a circle on a piece of paper, it will not be a perfect circle. Your hand cannot manage that - there will be little jerks, it will be a bit oblong, the ends won't meet at the same point, etc. Even an atomically perfect circle, drawn by the most perfect machine imaginable, would still have little jogs where one atom began and another ended. What is the \"perfect circle\" that we are comparing all these imperfect circles to? It certainly doesn't exist here on earth, or out there in the rest of the physical universe. Plato's idea was roughly that there is another world, a world of ideas, separate from the imperfect physical world we know through our sense organs. In this world, which moderns often call Platonic Heaven, there were the Forms. There are Forms of everything - of tables, love, Man, circles, catenoid functions, and presumably even guacamole... you name it. These forms were supposed to be more real than the mere world of matter; Matter is only shaped by virtue of having some particular Form. Thus the world is dual according to Plato - the base world of Matter perceived by the senses, and the higher world of Forms perceived by the intellect. Although modern philosophers mostly don't drink too much of Plato's Kool-Aid, the question of whether, and in what sense, numbers/mathematical objects/patterns/concepts \"exist\" is still troublesome 2500 years later.
