            "answer_text": "Hi A2A An argument is a series of statements with the goal of persuading someone of something. When they\u2019re successful, arguments start with a specific point of view, something that the reader doubts; by the end of the argument, the reader has been convinced and no longer doubts this view. In order to argue well, you have to put yourself in the reader\u2019s position and imagine what doubts they might have about your claim. Argument is not the same as fighting! Three common types of argumentation are classical, Toulminian, and Rogerian. You can choose which type to use based on the nature of your argument, the opinions of your audience, and the relationship between your argument and your audience. Convince readers that the topic is worthy of their attention. Types of Argument There are three basic types of argument: deductive, inductive, and mixed. They are based on three different types of inference. Deductive arguments are built from deductive inferencesInductive arguments are built from inductive inferencesMixed arguments are built from both types of inferenceDeductive inferences have to be true. You start from a basic statement or \u201cpremise,\u201d and as long as that premise is true there is no logical way for the conclusion to be false. Deductive arguments, on the other hand, are based on absolute certainty. Inductive inferences don\u2019t have to be true, but probably are. For example the whole history of human experience the sun has risen in the east and set in the west; therefore, the sun will do the same thing tomorrow. This is almost certainly true! Most people would readily accept this line of argument. However, notice that it\u2019s a matter of probability, not a matter of logical certainty like a deductive argument. After all, it\u2019s possible that aliens could come and destroy the sun, meaning it wouldn\u2019t rise or set ever again. That\u2019s extremely unlikely, but not logically impossible. inductive arguments have one crucial advantage, they usually matter more. In our day-to-day life, almost all of our decisions are based on inductive inferences. Mixed inference are mixed sets of argument where we use both infrerences deductive and inductive, according to the situation to defend our point then we use both. Regards Asad ",
