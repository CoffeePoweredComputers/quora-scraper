            "answer_text": "Original Question: What would happen if there was no freedom of speech? Utopian Answer: Everyone thinks and believes the same thing. Everyone has the same goals in life. Every action is by permission and is for the benefit of the whole. No dissension of thought or of action. Even the expression of joy and happiness must not come into doubt. Communist Answer: Just to pose this question would cause you and your entire family to disappear or be moved to a detention center for forced labor. As is done still today in China, North Korea and other nations where freedom of speech is not a fundamental right. Free Socialist Nations: If your speech is considered disruptive even though it is the truth. You will go to jail. If the ruling party disagrees with your belief on what rights and benefits people should have. You will find yourself unemployed or worse. If you dissent against the sate. They can and will take your home. If you cannot wait for medical care in the lines that your government agency makes up for the people. Then you must go to another nation with superior medical care like the USA. Yes, The USA has superior medical care. Do not question how your socialist leaders or famous people or wealthy people receive all of the medical care they can get. So as long as they keep their mouth shut. USA Answer: Even in this nation where freedom of speech is waning. You can lose employment and access to social media. The Christians seem to be losing all of their freedoms more than any other group. It is becoming a common belief that Christians do not have the right to participate in government. It is becoming that Christians do not even have the right to participate in any aspect of society. The freedom to sin is becoming more of a legal right every day. Religious Answer: Yea, Not really much here. You either follow with the plan of the religious institution or you go away. Unless, your in Islam. In which you have no choices or freedoms of any kind. If you dissent in any way. You risk getting killed even in public. ",

            "answer_text": "What would happen if there was no freedom of speech? U.S. perspective here. There is no freedom of speech except as a prohibition against government interference with speech. I can \u201cpunish\u201d people in my own place over their speech. I can warn them, \u201cKeep that sh!t up and sorry, you\u2019ll have to go.\u201d Suspend them: \u201cYou\u2019re banned for a month! Get out of here!\u201d Or exclude them permanently: \u201cLeave now\u2026and never come back.\u201d Whatever they\u2019ve scrawled on my living room walls, I can cleanse, expunge, sponge off and wipe away - even if others are still there happily scrawling! I invited them, they\u2019re welcome to. I can disinvite you. I can do this based on any principle or reason or whim I want, because it\u2019s my place. Private censorship in America - the shaping and exclusion of speech that appears in one\u2019s own venue - is actually a form of protected speech. It is protected because government has no power to come in and say we can\u2019t do that. Government can\u2019t come into my place, step between us and say whose turn it is to speak, and what we have to let them say. Step between us and say what we can\u2019t say, or have to say. We don\u2019t hire government for such jobs. To be honest, it\u2019s kind of unnecessary. We\u2019re grownups, we can handle that ourselves. The price of your free speech is everybody else\u2019s free speech. If we don\u2019t like what you say we can have our say in response. Out on the street or in anybody\u2019s place, anyone we interact with - if we don\u2019t like what they have to say, we can say so. Or we can withhold our sweet selves from voluntary association with them. No one is owed our attention or company. No one is owed our regard. Our regard for them can suffer based on what they freely express. Consequence of speech, in fallen regard, in gift of self withdrawn (which gift we were always free to give, to discontinue, to keep) is part of the bargain. Up there, I put \u201cpunish\u201d in scare quotes in the phrase \u201cI can \u2018punish\u2019 people in my own place.\u201d That\u2019s because it\u2019s not really a punishment. We deprive them of nothing that was theirs, thereby. In our own place (which includes really our company and our regard as well - but in those cases they may have a right to be in the location, and it may be we who have to leave in order to effect the penalty), nobody has a right to be there except by our welcome. We can revoke our welcome of anyone for any reason or none at all. You can\u2019t by speaking (still less by speaking offensively or unwisely) secure a right to be there that you never had to begin with. So. Free speech is pretty limited, as we see. Private individuals and entities can lay such sanction upon you as is in their gift, because of your speech. That is because their power is limited by what\u2019s actually freely in their gift. They can\u2019t go beyond that. They can\u2019t use force against you - only speech, or revocation of welcome. If they tried to use force, that would fall afoul of a number of already laid-down crimes. These haven\u2019t to do with speech, specifically, but illegal use of force. If the people decided to abolish free speech, all they\u2019d be saying is \u201cCome on in, government! We do hire you to step between grownups in private concourse and lay down who gets to speak, who doesn\u2019t, what they can say etc. We do approve the vast increase in government oversight and funding all such interventions will require. You\u2019re hired for the job. We\u2019ll pay for it. Insert yourself between us in matters of speech!\u201d This isn\u2019t a job we\u2019ve so far been inclined to hire government for. In fact it\u2019s so far from what we need or want government to do that we put it down cold in cut granite from the get-go: \u201cHands off, government. Our speech is not yours to meddle and muddle in. You have no power here to act. We\u2019ll handle that as needs be, using such judgments and allocations as are already freely ours to dispense.\u201d Good system. ",
