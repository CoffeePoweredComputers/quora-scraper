            "answer_text": "One sees in this essay that the theory of probabilities is basically only common sense reduced to a calculus. It makes one estimate accurately what right-minded people feel by a sort of instinct, often without being able to give a reason for it.(Laplace, 1825) The theory of probability supplies a good deal of counterintuitive results. (See, for example, bear cubs problem, birthday coincidence, e.t.c However, the theory of probability arose from practical applications and is, in essence, a formal encapsulation of the intuitive view on chance. This page presents a collection of probability problems whose solution is based on intuition and common sense and does not require any theoretical knowledge. Which situation is more likely after four bridge hands have been dealt: you and your partner hold all the clubs or you and your partner have no clubs? (A game of bridge is played by two pairs of players, with players on a team sitting opposite each other. answer If there is no magic or cheating, the probabilities of the two teams of getting any specific combination of cards must be thought equal. Now, observe that the event \"I and my partner got no clubs\" is the same as \"The other team got all the clubs\". The latter event has the same probability as \"Me and my partner got all the clubs,\" implying that the two events in question are equiprobable, i.e., have equal probabilities.A secretary types four letters to four people and addresses the four envelopes. If she inserts the letters at random, each in a different envelope, what is the probability that exactly three letters will go into the right envelope? solution Since there were just four letters and four envelopes, the fact that some three letters were placed into the right envelopes implies that the remaining letter has also been placed into the right envelope. Therefore the probability is 0 that exactly three letters went into the right envelope.A pencil with pentagonal cross-section has a maker's logo imprinted on one of its five faces. If the pencil is rolled on the table, what is probability that it stops with the logo facing up? solution it is impossible for the pencil to stop on en edge as to make a face - with or without the maker's logo - show on top. The probability of the event in question is zero.Find the probability that if the digits 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 be placed in random order in the blank spaces of 5_383_8_2_936_5_8_203_9_3_76 the resulting number will be divisible by 396 solution The problem is obviously contrived. The last two digits of the longish number are 76, implying that the number is divisible by 4 and 396/4=99=9\u00d711. We need to check that, however the ten digits are distributed over the empty spaces, the resulting number is divisible by 9 and also by 11.number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. The sum of the missing digits is 0+1+2+...+9=45. Which is divisible by 9. The sum of the present digits is 5+3+8+3+8+2+9+3+6+5+8+2+0+3+9+3+7+6=90 Which is also divisible by 9. It follows that the resulting number is divisible by 9 regardless of the placement of the missing digits. To check whether a number is divisible by 11 we compute two sums: that of the evenly placed digits and the sum of the oddly placed digits. All the missing digits come together along with 8, 3, 0, and 6, which add up to 45+17=62. The sum of the remaining digits is the 90\u221217=73. The difference of the two sums is 73\u221262=11 which is divisible by 11, and we are finished. ",
