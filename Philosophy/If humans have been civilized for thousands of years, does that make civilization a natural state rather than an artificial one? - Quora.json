            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question which \u201cbegs\u201d the question: \u201cWhat does it mean to be civilized?!\u201d Who decided that we are civilized. Of course, it was us, we determined ourselves that we became civilized because we wear clothes, we eat in a certain way, we behave according to certain social norms. Mostly we separate ourselves from other animals by this distinction, or this is how we separate social classes naming one class more civilized than others. But this is all artificial! It is all subjective, and it is always according to the most accepted, prevalent values in a given society! Are we actually civilized according to Nature\u2019s system, Nature\u2019s laws?! The answer would be a resounding NO! We are the most barbaric creatures who - with all of their pompous sophistication - destroy everything around them until they also destroy themselves. We cause constant misery for our own species, survive at each other\u2019s expense, and create slavery in all kinds of different forms. At the same time, all other elements in nature from the inanimate to vegetative and animate are instinctively integrated into the system, only serving the wellbeing of the whole, even at their own expense. Humanity will become civilized when we learn how to live within the fully integrated and interdependent framework of Nature and use our technological, cultural sophistication for the benefit of the whole system. Then we will merit the title of \u201ccrown of evolution\u201d, the most advanced, civilized species in the system.

That will make our civilization a natural states because of our hopes and dreams to survive in these survival of the fittest world. Human species are capable of all evil things and evil deeds. Just why discrimination will never ever be stop. Civilizations is all about being proactive about the advancement of our technology and human business endeavors. So that we will not be ignorant and stupid in our life existence. That means to be part of these human race we must always remember to be proactive in our life existence to live our life without regrets. ",

People used to ask it seriously all the time, particularly regarding European societies. The answer is, as far as I\u2019m concerned anyway, no. Civilization is entirely artificial, albeit there are more natural influences (such as territorialism, hierarchies and sexual dynamics) than are ever admitted to. ",

By current anthropological reckoning, human beings have been on earth for at least 200,000 years. In terms of available relics, human civilization and religions, are not older than 6 to 7 thousand years. This would suggest that civilization, like religious tolerance, is not exactly a natural state of human societies. Peace! 14 June 2020 ",

Sometimes it\u2019s used to mean \u201cwithout human interference\u201d in which case it doesn\u2019t make sense to apply to humans. If you consider humans part of nature however then everything we do is natural. In other circumstances it seems to be used as a synonym for \u201cnormal\u201d but that doesn\u2019t apply here. ",
