            "answer_text": "First thing I would like to clear is 'Facts can never be wrong ' because facts are just the pure representation of truth and reality. But also whenever a fact is presented it is almost always tinged with the presenter's opinion. And opinions cannot be right or wrong, they can just be varied and this variety can sometimes differ enormously and even clash. Opinions are like adjectives.... They are different for different people. For example: what may be beautiful for one man be ugly for the other but that doesn't mean that either of this opinion is wrong it just means that both of them are different. Another example is of conservatives and liberal minded people. The former might feel that women are in some way less than men but the latter has the opposite opinions. Now we cannot say that the former or his opinion is wrong because it's the way his thinking process is guided. And whenever we talk about change we don't intend the former to change his/her opinion we just intend that no one 's opinion should be dominating in the light of right on wrong. ",

A: absolutely opinions can be wrong many people base their opinions on \u201calternative facts\u201d Say someone could have the opinion a wall could slow or even stop weapons, illegal immigration, drugs, and human trafficking from coming to the U.S. But they would be absolutely wrong as the majority of these products are trafficed through underground tunnels. http://www.newsweek.com/us-mexico-border-drug-tunnel-costs-rewards-386978 ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and No both. No Because everyone have his own opinion and for him his opinion is correct, for some other person his own opinion may be diffrent and correct in his own views. Hence no opinion is wrong or right every person's opinion is correct in his own views. Yes A\u2019s opinion may be not as same of B\u2019s. So for A- B\u2019s opinion is wrong and for B- A\u2019s opinion is wrong. But bot are correct as per their own oponion. Hence a opinion can be right or wrong opinion. ",

Arguments are just that\u2026 not understanding. \u201cI am wrong\u201d ends the controversy, and the trigger opens our mind to bigger understanding from the other side. Notice the other side sneaks into our focus but recall of my original view is retained and I am on my way to intermingling sides\u2026 the road to understanding. ",
