It\u2019s about seeing that there are many people but if you realize that you two have a generally good connection then you must realize what was the reason why they walked away, if it\u2019s something you did you need to be aware of that but if they did something and just walked away then you let them go chances are they will come back but if they don\u2019t then that\u2019s the end you can\u2019t do anything about it.
