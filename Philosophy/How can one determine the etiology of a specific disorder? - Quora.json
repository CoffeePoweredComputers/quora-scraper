            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cHow can one determine the etiology of a specific disorder?\u201d Very few psychological conditions in adults arise out of any current events. Those that do, such as in some cases of PTSD, \u2018shell-shock\u2019 and the like, still cannot be fully understood without reference to our earliest psychological/mental development in infancy. This is why cognitive approaches to therapy must be limited; we had no language in infancy, and consequently a large part of our mental life, both emotional and intellectual, is now beyond easy reach of conscious awareness. It seems very strange how almost up until the Freudian revolution, society generally seemed prepared to ascribe little psychological importance to our childhood, as if small in body means small in significance; this attitude persists - \u2018she\u2019s too small to worry\u2019, \u2018he\u2019s too young to understand\u2019. No; he\u2019s not. It seems obvious, judging from every other developmental process we come across, that the earlier an influence occurs, the greater its eventual consequences are likely to be. Some ascribe this relative blindness to the need to manage our emotional world in the face of very high infant mortality. Maybe, but there is some sort of universal denial here; as any mother can tell you, an infant is a little ball of passion and intensity, which will never be repeated at any later stage of life. A wise supervisor I once had in training advised me that whenever I have trouble understanding a human situation, try translating it back into the nursery, and all will become clearer; I have always found that works. Aetiology almost universally can be found there (so long as you include \u2018the family\u2019 as an aspect of the nursery), although it may require a psychotherapeutic investigation, since the nursery is no more, and only its echo survives.
