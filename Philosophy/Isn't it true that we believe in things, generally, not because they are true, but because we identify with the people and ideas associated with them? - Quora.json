            "answer_text": "What you say is more or less true at least of many of the \u201cwe\u201d that hold beliefs, but there is also more to it than that. There are three aspects at play: emotion, intellect, and intuition, with the emotion being more often the most dominant for most persons. The more emotionally or devotionally polarized person tends to believe because of persons that they look up to, while the more mentally polarized person believes (often in the sense of accepts as probably true) based on reason. There are also people who are truly intuitive and more of their beliefs derive from an inner knowledge that is really the result of becoming more in touch or in tune with their own soul or higher consciousness. And people are blendings in various proportions of the devotional, intellectual, and intuitive aspects of consciousness so their beliefs are mixes of these things. But most people are more emotional, with the intellectual and intuitive being relative inactive much of the time. So, in general, most people don't believe as they do because of external evidence and reasoned arguments Rather, they believe as they do and see as they do by virtue of what they are. The so-called reason comes in as people tack that on as a justification for their emotionally based position, that position often being the result of fear and desire, especially where religious belief is concerned. So often people have been heavily conditioned by the society into which they are born or the school of thought into which they have desperately crashed: \"Everyone cleaves to the doctrine he has happened upon, as to a rock against which he has been thrown by tempest\" (Cicero) And what this often means is, as someone put it: we can not reason a person free of something that they were never reasoned into in the first place.

            "answer_text": "The examples you gave are all examples form science, so I will restrict the discussion to the framework of science. There are in fact other kinds of truth, but you defined the space. In any complex space in science you have choices: you can listen and believe (or disbelieve) what you are toldyou can learn enough of the space so that you can test the information provided and determine if it is true or more correctly if it is obviously false (many people can not master complex thermodynamics but when posed with a perpetual motion machine can model energy inputs and outputs and deduce they are false)you can learn enough to fully master is and make contributions of your own to the spaceIf science is considered daunting to an individual, and for many individuals from a religious background science can be daunting: using math to define things is typically foreign to them, then you are reduced to the first category. But if you are in the first category, it is critical to realize that you do not have the background to make an informed opinion. For you making strong claims of truth in the space is ridiculous. If you make the effort to master at least the fundamentals, then one can sometimes enter the second space, and at this point you can begin to have informed albeit amateur opinions. If you master the field to the third level, then you are in a position to give expert opinions and even to potentially make controversial nontraditional opinions. This is in fact a 10,000 hour problem (since doctoral work is often a four year effort). Now we have discussed this for science but peculiarly (or not) it holds for other field as well including religion. Unless you do rigorous study in religion and its associated theological and historical space, you cannot have sound opinions in this space either. Religion is also at least a 10,000 hour problem and it requires 10,000 hours of rigorous not amateur training. ",
