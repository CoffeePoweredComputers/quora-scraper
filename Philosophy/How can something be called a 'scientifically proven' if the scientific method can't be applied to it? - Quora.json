            "answer_text": "Proof is, in reality, not a scientific concept. It is a logical and mathematical concept. Science deals with theories and experiments. The simplest theory that explains the experiments is accepted as representing what we know about Nature. This is not proof, because there is no way to know whether or when a theory will be replaced by a better one in the future. The proper form of the question would be, How could science develop and test a theory of a phenomenon to which the scientific method cannot be applied? And the answer of course is, It could not. The very idea makes no sense. There is a question whether science can in principle explain all phenomena. But this is a philosophical question, not a scientific one. To work, science goes ahead and assumes that in the end it can explain everything. This is called naturalism or materialism. But there are reasons to doubt materialism, including the difficulty of explaining consciousness, the difficulty of doing without concepts such as good and evil and freedom of the will, and possible logical fallacies involved in science that explains everything including itself.

            "answer_text": "Nothing is truly \u201cscientifically proven\u201d as far as scientists are concerned. Proof is the province of mathematics. A properly-derived equation or formula represents mathematical proof. Science merely makes observations and comes up with hypothetical explanations for those observations. Hypotheses are then opened up to critical scrutiny, forevermore. But if a hypothesis becomes accepted or favoured by the general scientific community as \u201ccorrect as far as it goes, beyond reasonable doubt\u201d, it is elevated to the level of theory - the current standard explanation. Science is a bit like a murder case that goes to court. We, the prosecution, can\u2019t absolutely \u201cprove\u201d that the prime suspect, person X, was the murderer because we weren\u2019t there and nobody but the murderer knows what really happened. But we have reason to believe that person X did it. That\u2019s our hypothesis \u2026 though in all honesty we could be wrong and maybe it was person Y, or persons unknown. So what we have to do is piece together all the available evidence and look at it objectively. We don\u2019t try to cherry-pick the evidence to put our prime suspect in the frame. Indeed, we should be on the look-out for any evidence that clears our prime suspect altogether, because if we overlook that in court you can be damn sure his defence lawyers won\u2019t, and then the case will be dismissed and we will look like idiots. Science is much the same. We gather evidence, look at it objectively, suggest our hypothesis, run it by others for their criticism, try not to overlook the obvious, try not to look like idiots, and the best we can hope for is to have our hypothesis accepted \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d.

            "answer_text": "\u201cScientifically proven\u201d probably refers to the process of verifying the predictions of a model. If you cannot verify a model, then it\u2019s not much of a model to begin with, but it also cannot be said to be \u201cscientifically proven\u201d. Note that \u201cproof\u201d in science is not deductive, like in math, but inductive. Therefore, we tend to avoid using the word \u201cproof\u201d in science, as that\u2019s mainly a mathematical concept. But you have to specify what you\u2019re talking about, because I don\u2019t know of any examples of what you\u2019re talking about. Perhaps someone made an incorrect statement, simply? ",
