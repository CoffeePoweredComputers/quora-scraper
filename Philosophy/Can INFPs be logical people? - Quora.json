            "answer_text": "One thing I\u2019ve noticed that seems to get lost pretty often in discussions about introverted feeling in the MBTI community (who, as a group, seem strangely determined to characterize it solely as The Emotional Function\u2122) is how rational and analytical Fi can be, especially in the dominant position. Fi and Ti, both of which are classified as introverted judging functions (Ji), are primarily concerned with achieving an internal congruence and consistency of ideas - the only difference is that they prioritize different types of information to apply their judgments to (Ti is primarily concerned with logical consistency, while Fi is more concerned with moral consistency). Fi acts as a filter for inconsistent moral values in the same way that Ti acts as a filter for inconsistent logical ideas, and for this reason, Fi-doms tend to be extremely rational. If you ever managed to get an INFP talking for long enough, you may be surprised by how analytical they are.  Edit (12/20/2018): I already pretty much answered the question in full ^ up there, but I coincidentally ended up having a debate with someone about this exact topic on Facebook a few days ago, so I figured I\u2019d tack some of what I said to them in here too. Fi makes value judgments in the same way that Ti makes value judgments (which is why they're both considered subjective, since they're based on an independent system of morality or logic rather than an objective one, like Te and Fe are). Since the goal of Fi is to seek internal harmony and consistency when it comes to values and morality (just like the goal of Ti is to seek internal harmony and consistency when it comes to logic), Fi-doms are actually extremely analytical and intellectually precise in the same way that Ti-doms are. That doesn't mean they aren't still emotional, obviously; but since Fi-doms interact with the world through their auxiliary perceiving functions (Ne or Se), they will naturally appear to be much more flexible and 'loose' externally than they ACTUALLY are in reality; and so IxFPs will actually end up feeling much more internally rational and analytical than they know they come off as in real life. But if you listen to an Fi-dom talk for a while, at least to me, I can always \"see\" the golden thread of logic that ties their whole idea together. (Although this is true for all IxxPs, really.) And: The way I like to see Fi and Ti is that they're like two identical models of a car that just run on different types of fuel - where Ti runs on logic, Fi runs on values, but the actual process by which they assimilate that data is the same. It's like a sieve that filters out everything that doesn't belong until they're left with a shining golden nugget of Ti logic or Fi morality, discarding everything else that doesn\u2019t \u201cfit\u201d. The same goes for Te and Fe, Si and Ni, and Se and Ne. (Comparatively, Fi and Fe are like two completely different models of car that run on the same type of fuel - values. The only difference is that Fe\u2019s values are external and objective (because they\u2019re based on consensus), while Fi\u2019s values are internal and subjective (because they\u2019re more iconoclastic and individually developed). It\u2019s much easier to understand Fe and Fi when you interpret them as being centered around values rather than emotions, which is a mistake that most people make when they talk about the feeling functions. Where the issue with Fi becoming irrational and unrealistic is this. I wrote the following paragraph as a response to two INTPs who were trying to argue that Ti logic is never faulty, but everything I said can be applied to Fi, and I also touched on it a little bit at the end of what I wrote. While Ti logic truly is flawlessly reasoned, it often fails to incorporate real world data into its conjecture - it\u2019s built a house on a foundation of sand, and so the Ti-dom ends up coming to a completely inaccurate and unrealistic conclusion because they got so caught up in ensuring the accuracy of their reasoning process that they just never bothered questioning whether the premise they started with was even correct in the first place. When this happens, it\u2019s almost impossible to convince an INTP that they\u2019re wrong because the only evidence that they\u2019re willing to accept would have to be argued from the framework that was based on inaccurate suppositions in the first place. Ti-doms and Fi-doms both also suffer from this sort of error in judgment (I'm not sure what to call it) where as long as there are no inconsistencies in their position (whether it's based on logic or morality), they just sort of stop caring about whether or not their ideas are even applicable in reality at the end of the day. This is where you see a lot of INxPs building up these systems like Marxism that are absolutely flawless on paper, but don't actually work in real life because they didn't incorporate objective reality into their viewpoint. As long as the theory is perfect, then they don't really care much about whether or not it actually works. This is the opposite of Te and Fe (as I outlined in a previous post about the reason why INTJs are so good at reading people despite their lack of Fe), who don\u2019t care about why something works just so long as it does. (The problem for Te and Fe as a result is that their understanding of emotion and logic is not as accurate, deep, or nuanced as it is for Ti and Fi, and so they end up losing a lot of the complexity and precision that Ti and Fi retain in those areas. This is true of all extroverted functions - their range is generalized and broad, as opposed to the intensive, narrow, and deeper focus of the introverted functions.) INFPs often end up basing their conclusions on what SHOULD be true (in a flawless Fi world where everything makes perfect sense all the time, and humans never behave in ways that are immoral, contradictory, cruel, unfair, or unethical) instead of what IS true, and so when the real world becomes too harsh and unforgiving for them to deal with, they stubbornly choose to hold fast to the idealistic utopia they\u2019ve constructed in their heads - and to the people who don\u2019t understand the INFP\u2019s motivations, this behavior can end up looking like a complete denial of logic and rationality. There is also, of course, the issue of INFPs choosing to follow their heart, even if their heart is leading them over a cliff. To a lot of people (especially thinkers) that can look like a lack of rationality, especially from our perspective as dispassionate third-party observers who aren\u2019t emotionally involved, and can see the full picture much more clearly than the INFP can. DO THEY EVER LISTEN TO US, THOUGH? NO, OF COURSE NOT. D=< ",

            "answer_text": "INFPs are in fact, logical people. You might be surprised to read my answer. Well then, let me elaborate : INFPs have their own logic. They create their own logic. They do not follow the socially agreed upon/ socially acceptable definition of logic. Absurd is the word that I am trying to imply. INFPs will easily understand what I am trying to say. Others will dismiss them as absurd. But you have to understand (if you can) that logic is not that precious or mandatory as everyone makes it out to be, absurdity has its own place too in human lives. If human life is a spectrum, then you can say that a human being lies somewhere between logic and absurdity. Even Albert Einstein said that logic might take us from A to B but imagination will take us everywhere. ~~~~     ",
