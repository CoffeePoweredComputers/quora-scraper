What\u2019s the word \u201cstill\u201d doing here? Are you just asking about what people think? Or are you somehow asking about \u201creality\u201d? The second sort of question would be odd. It may be that there were once universally held opinions that are no longer universally held. And it may be that there\u2019s less agreement than there once was about what\u2019s true. But that\u2019s a matter of what people think and not how things actually are. The world is however it is; our opinions don\u2019t settle the matter. And I\u2019ve never heard a remotely good reason for thinking that there are no truths about how things actually are, whether or not we manage to get it right. ",

            "answer_text": "Truth is truth. If it was, it is; if it was not it is not. I don\u2019t know the answer. I am a subjective being with subjective thoughts and feelings. Nobody knows the answer. If someone tells you they know the answer into the nature of some truth, they are lying. To you or to themselves. Metaphysically, truth can be altered. Universal truths exist, in so much as one sees the truth. Do I see the truth? No. I see what I perceive to be truth and call it truth because I have no other way to call it. You, me\u2014the people who wrote the Bible, Plato and John Elway\u2014know only what they perceive to be the truth. Any and all witnesses to an event may or may not be wrong about their perceptions. All we can do is accept what we believe and deny what we do not believe. ",
