            "answer_text": "Your mileage will vary from mine, since I have different interests from yours. However, to me, there are some fascinating areas where interdisciplinary research is being done: Robotics. Marrying computer science and machine learning with mechanical engineering research has been fascinating. Look for greater use of GPS and other technologies for wider connection.Geotechnical engineering. Again civil engineering, computer science, and materials engineer research is helping in remediation and even new, more environmentally conscious approaches to planning and building.Prosthetics. This is a combination of medical devices, artificial intelligence, and neurobiology. I have read with interest about prosthetics that connect directly to the impulses in the brain to activate the limb and follow instructions. There\u2019s quite a ways to go, but it sounds pretty exciting to me.Fuels and energy. Biofuels and other alternative energy forms combine biology, engineering (various disciplines), physics, and infrastructural considerations.Just a scan through Google seems to indicate a lot of great research at MIT, North Carolina State University, and the University of Arizona. Take a look if you\u2019re looking for a good overview. ",
