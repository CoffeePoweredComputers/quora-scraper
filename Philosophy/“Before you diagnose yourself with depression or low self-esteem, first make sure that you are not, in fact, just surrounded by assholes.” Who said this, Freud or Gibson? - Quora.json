Let alone ones born before the 1950\u2019s. So upon research, I found this hilarious story: Again, Gibson confirmed it was a tweet he liked, and simply retweeted. He attempted to give credit to the twitter handle @5tevenW, where Gibson saw the quote and had first retweeted it. This Twitter user, Steven Winterburn, did indeed try to claim the credit. However, Mr. Winterburn first used the quote on May 24, 2011, 16 months after Debbie Hope. Debbie Hope, owner of the Twitter handle @debihope, tweeted it on Jan 24, 2010. That\u2019s where the story ends. They did a deep dive into Freud\u2019s writing, and concluded he isn\u2019t the author. There is no backing evidence. Comment below if you have any further information on the whereabouts of Debbie Hope, and or statements regarding this. Footnotes[1] PhilosFX",
