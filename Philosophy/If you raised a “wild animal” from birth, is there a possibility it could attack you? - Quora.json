            "answer_text": "Yes, Just because an animal is raised by humans or even another animal, instinct still applies. We raised a kitten from day 2 when its mother abandoned it. We were told that it wouldn\u2019t know how to hunt since its mother never had a chance to teach it. That cat by the time it was a year old, basically ended the existence of all rabbits, squirrels and other rodents in a two block radius. We had to move and it disappeared. A few days later, my brother went by the home and his way to another state, and found the cat waiting on the porch for someone to let him in. My brother took him to his home in California. He said that with in a few weeks, even the seagulls had left his neighborhood because this cat would hunt anything. The cat was never aggressive with humans, but if you were a small animal or bird, that cat loved to hunt and he was very successful. ",
