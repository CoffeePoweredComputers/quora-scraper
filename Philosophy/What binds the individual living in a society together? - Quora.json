            "answer_text": "As it is with all socially-oriented animals in nature, our tendency toward social behavior is a universally inborn and inherent instinct. It is easy to forget that human beings are just animals just like all other animals in Nature. And, much of our behavior is programmed into us by the very same DNA and genes that determine that we have two legs, walk erect, and use language to communicate with each other. Just because we are not consciously aware of all of the motives of our conduct doesn\u2019t mean that those motives are not there but submerged in the unconscious aspects of the mind. Don\u2019t underestimate human nature. It is a very powerful but largely hidden motivator \u2014 especially when it comes to sex, mating, and reproductive behavior. When one person harms or kills another more often then not it involves a so-called \u201clove triangle.\u201d There are strong instincts and emotions aimed at reproduction and survival buried within you. Plus, your desire to be liked and valued by others is primarily an inborn instinct that is more important to you than you realize. That is the inner manifestation of our sociability instinct. No man is an island. ",
