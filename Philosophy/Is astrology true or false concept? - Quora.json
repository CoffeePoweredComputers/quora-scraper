The planets, the stars, the Sun, the solar system, even the object next to you do have their influence on you. The clouds that bring rain have an influence on your plans, then why not Astrology will influence you. In a stressful, data-driven era, many young people find comfort and insight in the zodiac\u2014even if they don\u2019t exactly believe in it. Astrology is a divine will. If time is not ripe for a person, he will not meet the destined astrologer or palmist. Even if he meets them they will not be able to answer a particular query. if you are not getting the right guidance, you cant blame the subject/ science for it! Rather you need to approach the knowledgeable person of that field. Forget all the reasons why it wont happen and believe in the only reason why it will. Afterall, man is the master of his own fate Astrology proved a boon and blessing for me.  this picture illustrate how with the help of umbrella ( astrology remedies ) i got unaffected with rains ( problems of my life). All credit goes to Astrology remedies by my mentor and living God who is my Astrologer. ",

Treatises of many sages have many approaches but in principle adhere to horay, even though thumb impression predictions called nadi system is in the villages of Tamil nadu, started an online facility too. The art of probability thus declined to commercial purposes, some using fake copies of software that the mentor is deprived. Everybody knows that if a equal to b them b should equal to a, but a pirated a is unequal entity. One person shared his experiences that he purchased some pirated CDs, that faced difficulties exerted by planet ketu and he abandoned the unlawful discs. You have all the rights to unbelieve. Many beliefs lack scientific explanation but astrology as probability exists, only the interval of quantity vary, asfotida has 82%wheat, gold has 8.4% copper, 1 mg adrenalin injection can kill a person. Everything has its own time and value depending time. Astrology has many intricacies that a single author cannot handle everything, so is a practitioner who has to oversee many things for practical purposes. Anyone looking for 100% accuracy can believe astrology as false, maximum accurate assured cannot exceed 50%, anyone search for direction of wife may have 3 conditions and there are only 4 directions in simple astrology but eight directions in 12 magnitudes in prasnam marg, one need to spend for each question cast separately, if something precipitate can be allowed to believe, psycho cure often stands on the front line.
