            "answer_text": "This is a very difficult question to answer. I have been in your shoes, and I know how hard it is to find meaning in your life when everything seems bleak and pointless. I struggled with severe depression for two years, and it has only been a year or so since I finally got my life back on track. I would like to share some things that help me find purpose and meaning today. Firstly, I sought help for my problems. I knew I needed it, and though it seemed hopeless at first, it was the crucial starting point for me. I confided in my mom and in my guidance counselor, and both of them helped me to realize that my life didn\u2019t have to be so empty forever. I would recommend that you do the same. What\u2019s the point in holding back from getting help, if all of your self-dignity and confidence is gone anyway? Once I got the moral support that I needed, I really started to get to know myself. I tried my best to learn all of my weaknesses. I learned more about the way I communicated and viewed the world. I took personality tests online, as well as self-tests for depression and anxiety. I found out that I had social anxiety disorder, and I read articles outlining ways to get a hold on anxiety so that it does not control your life. You may or may not suffer from anxiety or depression, but it is a good idea to find out if you do so that you can start the healing process. After that, I found out the true purpose of my life: helping others. I learned that the world truly is a dark and cruel place, but that if you stand by the few people out there who work to penetrate that darkness and let a little light shine through, then you will be happier and more fulfilled. This, and your relationships with others, are the only things that can bring you lasting joy and peace. Once you learn what you are good at doing, then you can use that knowledge to do good in this world. For instance, I learned that I was good at breaking people\u2019s walls, and getting them to open up about what was really going on behind their fake smile and perceived outer confidence. I use my own experiences to help them feel that they are neither alone nor hopeless. I know that you can do this, even if it feels as if you can\u2019t. You are much stronger than you think, and you can make a difference in this world by simply embracing your strengths and using them for everyone\u2019s benefit. ",

            "answer_text": "The moment when you find yourself asking this question, you\u2019re in a big trouble my friend. Never search for REASONS TO LIVE. Always live the life to ENJOY every moment of it. No\u2026., life will never be boring. You\u2019re not experiencing it in the right way, my friend. Life is full of EXCITEMENT believe me. Winning and and loosing the game doesn\u2019t matter. The thing that matters is, how best you\u2019ve played to make your side comfortable. The figures you got at school or your college has got nothing to do with life. If you\u2019re good at gaming then just do it. There are so many games which needs to be unlocked, and you can give the cracked version of the games to the users of it. Many people are looking out for these kind of unlocked games. You can make nice income out of it. You want to hang out with friends, indirectly it means you\u2019re good at social gatherings. You\u2019re well acquainted with social gatherings. There are so many companies willing to have social gatherings with its customers. You can run some consultancy kind of thing so that you can arrange a social gathering based on their requirements. This will give you huge income. Or you can combine both hobbies. Just start a new startup of Virtual gaming with your friends. You\u2019ll never be a looser dear. Play it hard. Play it heart-fully. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. There are so many people out there who can successfully do that (quote copied). For that kind of people, just give them the standing ovation of your middle finger. (These are just suggestions given keeping in my mind that your parents wants you to take the responsibility of your life. Discuss with your parents. Tell them what you like and how you feel and what you wanted to do with your life) (the reason i\u2019ve mentioned income is, generally people who are our neighbors will have more concern on us rather than parents. so to f**k them up i\u2019ve mentioned INCOME. this is according to \u201cneighbors bullshit law of attraction\u201d :P) LIFE is waiting for you my friend. ENJOY it. :) ",
