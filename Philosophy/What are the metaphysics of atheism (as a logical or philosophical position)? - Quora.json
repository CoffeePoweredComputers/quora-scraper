            "answer_text": "What are the metaphysics of atheism (as a logical or philosophical position)? I am not a philosopher, so these are my untutored thoughts. I would say that atheism (which I would prefer to call \u201cthe unreality of god\u201d) is based on these premises: Reality can only be defined in human terms. It is what we can know.What we can know is what is accessible through the sensorium (see note).The human sensorium is a reliable tool for accessing reality.What cannot be accessed through the sensorium is not real.God is not accessible through the human sensorium.Therefore, god is not real.Note: sensorium. We can only interact with the reality of the universe by processing and applying information accessed through sensory organs including touch, vision, hearing, taste and smell. Without a sensorium we would be vegetative: incapable of imagination or thought. Would the universe be real if we were vegetative or did not exist? We can\u2019t know that.] ",

            "answer_text": "Metaphysics is one of the three major branches of philosophy. Metaphysics examines the question of what is real. The second major branch of philosophy, epistemology, examines what we can know about what is real. The third major branch, ethics, examines what we ought to do about what we know. Atheism rests on a metaphysics of materialism. A metaphysics of materialism holds that there is no separate, invisible, immaterial world, over, above, or \u201cbehind\u201d this one, that pervades this one and affects it but is unaffected by it. Materialism holds that such a notion is groundless and that no invisible, immaterial world exists. The world of matter and energy is all there is. In other words, atheism is not merely a position that yes, there might be an invisible, \u201csupernatural\u201d world, but it just happens to be vacant and unoccupied. No. Atheism, metaphysically, is the position that there could not, in the nature of the case, be an invisible, immaterial, supernatural Supreme Being because there is no supernatural world for Him to be in, to begin with.
