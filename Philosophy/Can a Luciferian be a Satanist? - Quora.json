            "answer_text": "Lucif'r and his rebellion wast 'gainst the ways of the w'rlds. Whoev'r ent'rs this w'rld, though innocent, leaves this w'rld with a life w'rth of sins. Lucif'r in his state of Satan is michael too and jesus eke. All of those folk doth god\u2019s w'rk, and god is not all valorous as theological judeochristianity auspices. God is the day and the night. God is valorous, and that gent is evil eke. God is nature. God is the univ'rse, and m're. Replaceth the t'rm \u201cgod\u201d with the oft hath used t'rm of the contemp'rary zeitgeist \u201cuniv'rse,\u201d yond is lief to beest did replace by \u201cmultiv'rse,\u201d thee shalt then receiveth to und'rstand the nature of thy ontologic epistemol existence a dram bett'r, and thee shall lief receiveth to und'rstand the purpose wherefore thee existeth. Hence, a lucif'r can advance towards satanism by becoming \u201cm're evil,\u201d at the risketh of suff'ring damnation, yet any f'rm of suff'ring, beest t yond of jesus, 'r yond is in the despair of lucif'r at which hour that gent down to the state of being the condemn'd and reject'd \"satan,\" endues thee towards thy enlightenment. And keepeth in mind yond lucif'r as an entity is in a state of p'rpetual 'rbital revolution 'round god, as that gent becomes lucif'r the archangel, then goeth backeth to being Satan, then becomes jesus, and then his counteth'rpart archangel michael, all separateth aspects of one soul, of which thee and i art eke parteth of, the infinite soul yond is the seen and the unseen \"univ'rse,\" since dark matt'r/en'rgy encompasses most of the univ'rse, hence the w'rld yond thee seeth 'round thee is not the totality of the suff'ring yond is existence. The ascension and damnation, i. e. from being lucif'r to being Satan, is a continuous unending cycleth, liketh the passage of the day of the night, and the continuous cycleth life, then death, then rebirth. And this hast been happening f'r all of et'rnity. Thy current corse is thy vessel, t is not thee, yet thou art did confine to t. And what maketh thee bethink thee haven't did exist bef're? and what maketh thee bethink thee shall not existeth aft'r thy death? and what maketh thee bethink yond thee existeth even but now in this plane of existence only?
