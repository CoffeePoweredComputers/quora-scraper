            "answer_text": "Kissing is not really the standard to be measuring such things by. You can kiss your grandparents and parents, brothers and sisters, strangers and friends. There are sexual kisses to be sure, but other acts are much more cut and dry. For example: Who do you want to get naked with? Who do you want to make love to? Who do you fall in love with? Why would you be feeling guilty about your dreams\u2026 and why do you use baby talk for things like masturbation\u2026 which I presume is what \u201cguilty pleasures\u201d means? Sexuality is normal and adult. Nothing to be ashamed of or guilty over. So before you decide what your orientation is, I would be examining your feelings of guilt and shame and why being a normal human embarrasses you. It sounds like you are some degree of bisexual\u2026 leaning much more to the gay side of bisexuality. Once you have your guilt issues worked out, go out on some dates with both genders. Enjoy yourself and discover who you are. You don't have to have sex to date and see how you feel. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Dude, you\u2019re gay\u2026. I was thinking about your question some more this afternoon because you had written \u201cwhich I\u2019m not proud of\u201d, when talking about you thinking of guys in your guilty pleasures. I think the main issue here for you is that you need to stop viewing being gay as wrong \u2026 there\u2019s nothing wrong with you thinking of men in a sexual way - if you\u2019re gay then it\u2019s a natural thing to do. Your issue is being \u2018ok\u2019 with you being gay. I can\u2019t think of much aside from your religious background that perhaps is making you feel guilty? If this is the case, I relate to the feeling and the fear involved. What I learnt on my journey to becoming \u2018ok\u2019 with being gay is that God, or whomever your Higher Power is, created you and loves you for who you are - the REAL battle comes in not from your Higher Power but from you .. your Higher Power will love you irregardless .. the battle is for you to start loving yourself as you are and with no excuses .. you have nothing to prove or explain to anybody. To ensure happiness in your life you have to try as hard as you can to always remain true and authentic to yourself - as long as you\u2019re ok with you, then all will be ok with what\u2019s around you. Good luck my friend ",

            "answer_text": "If you are not gay, you may be bisexual. But you may be straight. You see, straight people often explore homosexuality in their fantasies and vice verse. The way to know is to engage in sexual behaviors with another guy. If you enjoy it and want to do it more, then you are bisexual if not gay. Then, if you engage in sexual behaviors with a girl, and don\u2019t enjoy it, and don\u2019t feel like doing more, then you are gay, in all likelihood. That is the best way to know that I am familiar with. In any event, play safe, use condoms, etc\u2026 ",
