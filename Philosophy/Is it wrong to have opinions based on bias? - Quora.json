            "answer_text": "Almost all of our naive opinions are based on bias, and it is only wrong when those opinions fail to help us or, in some way, injure anyone else. As participants in society, it is generally our obligation, at least, to avoid disruption or creating dissension, if not to actually make positive contributions to this shared enterprise. With that goal in mind, any opinions, beliefs, or attitudes that may have negative consequences should be reconsidered and adjusted. ",

It would be nearly impossible to eliminate all bias. Bias is only a bad thing if we are not willing to listen and learn. ",
