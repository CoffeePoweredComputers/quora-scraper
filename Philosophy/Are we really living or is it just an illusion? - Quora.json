            "answer_text": "Well, I keep asking this question to myself for a long time. What will you answer if I ask you a question - Does light has a color or it is colorless? Well, some will say the light is colorless (white), while some will say light has color. Neither the person who is saying the light is colorless is wrong, nor the person who is saying light has color is wrong. Hence we\u2019ve reached a state of duality, this is also a very proof of human nature, i.e. we exist in duality. The truth is none of them are wrong, it is only when we learn that if a colorless light passes through a specific medium it breaks into different colors. Light is colorless but all the colors are in the light itself.   Same goes with the life. If you ask this question to a monk, the monk will tell you- that this body is an illusion, you\u2019re not your body but a soul, get rid of this illusion. If you ask a worldly man, the man will tell you- can\u2019t you see I\u2019m working hard to feed my family, providing shelter to them, taking care of their health, educating children, how can you say it is an illusion. You see a duality here, and none of them are wrong. As Sandeep Maheshwari has put it- There is an underlying reality in this whole universe, which is the very substance for everything. There is a source of everything, we see, hear, feel, act, think. There is nothing in that source but all these possibilities are in that same source. There is nothing in that source, it is true and everything is in that same source, it is also true. Transcending this duality will set us free and will let us merge ourselves with our creator. He is not Eternity or Infinity, but Eternal and Infinite; he is not Duration or Space, but he endures and is present. He endures for ever and is every where present; and by existing always and every where he constitutes Duration and Space. - Sir Isaac Newton! Happy Transcending!. Hope I am able to answer your question. Thanks for A2A Ayush. ",

The body has a mind and an intellect known as BMI to carry on its daily chores. It has an ATMA or SOUL, which is a silent spectator with no role to play with BMI. No one knows why we are here, why we behave in a particular way, why we have lust, greed, passion, lust, jealousy, hatered etc. We feel, percive, enjoy, suffer, the good, bad and ugly. We crave for food, sex, fellowship and love. Life is a drama, play, we all are playing our part as heroes, villans and Jokers. All born has to die, no one remembers it and are crazy to get physical pleasures and materialistic possesions by subjugating others. All said and done, we are here as a gross body to go through the process of this illusionary life, till we become a suttle or cosmic body. ",

That\u2019s what really matters. Assume anything as being real or as an illusion and work towards being happy within those boundaries. One day you will realize that there are no boundaries and the deeper you go into finding out the truth, the happier you will be. Personally I enjoy assuming everything to be a mixture of reality and illusion. Suits any circumstance and keeps you happy, doesn\u2019t it? Start with basic questions for they are the most important ones to ask - Why are we here? Where do we go? Seek your answers - keep digging. And if you find something interesting please let me know :) I\u2019m a seeker just like you. Enjoy your journey! ",
