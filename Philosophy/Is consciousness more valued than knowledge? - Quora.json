            "answer_text": "Please do not confuse consciousness with knowledge. They are different but equally important. Let me explain. Consciousness: It is derived from a word, conscious, which means being aware or conscious of different things, objects, or subjects etc. There are four kinds of consciousness. Unconscious Consciousness: The deepest layer of consciousness. Invariably we are not aware of it and is due to the deeds of the previous lives. The state of blissfulness experienced after a deep sleep is due to this consciousness.Subconscious Consciousness: This is the second layer of consciousness and is experienced during dreams.Conscious Consciousness: This is called Waking Consciousness and is due to thoughts, actions, and accomplishments of the present life.Superconscious Consciousness: We experience the beauty of this consciousness after Spiritual Awakening and Enlightenment. This is the reflection of the unifying Universal Consciousness.Knowledge can be divided into the following sections. Data: The collection of basic data (irrelevant and relevant) of a subject.Information: Relevant data is called valuable information.Philosophical Knowledge: This brings forth the different aspects of the subject.Scientific Knowledge: The scientifically proven knowledge which can be explained and concluded with certain known laws of nature.Absolute Wisdom: This brings forth the underlying mathematical design of Nature, with which every perfect object of Nature is designed and created and which cannot be challenged by anyone. Divyank, the Divine Constant, is the proof of this absolute wisdom. It is the reflection of the unifying Universal Consciousness.Hence, both consciousness and knowledge are complementary. For detailed knowledge, please read and comprehend the wisdom of Akhand Sutra. The ebook can be downloaded from Akhand Vidyashram free of cost. ",

            "answer_text": "There is relation between consciousness and the ultimate knowledge attained. When there is no consciousness, where is the question of more knowledge or less knowledge gained by individuals. You are confusing me using some words known to you. However, we have to travel a long journey to know these two interactions with body. When the time is ripe, the advancement of a person toward self- knowledge comes about as naturally as the physical body of a child grows in to full- fledged form. The growth of the physical body is worked out by the operation of natural laws, and the progress of the aspirant toward self- knowledge is worked out by the operation of spiritual laws pertaining to the transformation and emancipation of consciousness. The physical body of a child grows very gradually and almost imperceptibly, and the same is true of the spiritual progress of a person once he has entered the path. The child does not know how its physical body grows; in the same way, the aspirant also is often oblivious of the law by which he makes headway toward the distination of his spiritual progress. The aspirant is generally conscious of the manner in which he has been responding to the diverse situation in life but rarely conscious of the manner in which he makes progress toward self-knowledge. Without consciously knowing it, the aspirant is gradually arriving at self- knowledge by traversing the inner pass-through his Joy's and sorrows, his happiness and suffering ,his success and failures, his efforts and rest, and through his moments of confusion and conflict. There are the manifestations of the diverse sanskaras that he has brought from the past ; and the aspirant forges his way towards self- knowledge through the tangles of these sanskaras like the traveler threading his way through a wild and thick forest. Human consciousness might be compared to a flashlight that reveals the existence and the nature of things. The province illuminated by this flashlight is defined by the medium through which it works , just is a person confined to a boat can wander anywhere on the surface of the water but can have no access to remote places on the land or in the air. The actual working of the flashlight of consciousness is determined by the accumulated sanskaras, just as the course of the rivulets flowing down a mountain is determined by the channels created by the natural contours of the mountain. God bless you. ",
