            "answer_text": "The key to living our lives to the fullest is to simply care less about what others think. There\u2019s a fine line between doing what we want versus being disrespectful don\u2019t get me wrong, but more often than not I find that I hold myself out of fear of being judged. The reality is we waste tons of energy trying to maintain a public image when people could honestly care less. Our self-perception isn\u2019t limited to how we view ourselves, it\u2019s also what think others view us as. I call these self-limiting beliefs.  You\u2019ve probably heard this answer a million times. Living by our own standards instead of other peoples expectations is repackaged in dozens of ways and fed back to us all the time. Books like The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck by Mark Manson, quotes from movies like \u201cFight Club\u201d (which was released almost 20 years ago by the way), and comics like the one above all convey the same message. It\u2019s a testament to how valuable this tip is; so why aren\u2019t we living by it everyday? The truth is, ignoring other peoples opinion\u2019s to commit to our own is a lot harder than it sounds. For example, as much as I know dropping my life to live abroad in another country for a year would be an amazing experience, it\u2019s terribly frightening to make it happen. That sort of drastic change comes with sacrifice. Going against the grain to do what we think is right also involves breaking out of our safe zone. Living by our own expectations can dramatically change our relationships with the people around us! Staying selfish despite what your family expects of you, being the person who speaks their mind against their boss for something they believe is right, or saying no to your close friends when they want to have fun can bring forward tough ramifications.  \u201cLiving life to our fullest\u201d isn\u2019t all what it\u2019s cracked up to be. Personally I\u2019ve lost many friends who I valued dearly as I shed old values. I\u2019ve also made new friends as I picked up new habits, but it can be hard to find that spark without a shared history. Staying with what\u2019s comfortable and familiar is easier. On the flip-side, I\u2019ve noticed focusing on what we want causes two things to happen: It moves control over our lives from other peoples hands into our ownIt involves embracing who we really are and letting the world judge it however they wantBy shedding the weight of outside opinion we embark on our own unique journey. It\u2019s only when we start living our lives for ourselves that we start to live our lives to the fullest. Thanks for reading. If you like what you see feel free to follow me on Quora. I\u2019m also open to any direct messages for feedback, thoughts, and suggestions. ",

            "answer_text": "What I have become today within these 22 years is a complicated person, a mixing blend of positive and negative aura. I am still at this stage of exploring and discovering things which would define the real me. But one thing is for sure.. I don't want to regret a thing in my life.Just like any articles posted all over the net, I want to list down all the things I want to share to those of you who spend time to read this. Some of these are cliche, but I totally agree and live by it. Lessons learned are:1. Don't try to please everyone, you just can't. Be yourself. If someone doesn't like you, you don't have to change yourself and apologize to him/her. We all have different personalities. It is normal for a clash.2. Never feel inferior to anyone. Even if it is your boss, a geek, or some pretty face, you shouldn't be frightened or intimidated by his position or skills. We are all created equally. You also have some traits they just can't have.3. Always treat your misfortune or missed opportunity in your favor.Believe that any unfulfilled dream or mistakes are part of reaching your true destiny. These things only redirect you to the path where you should be.4. Don't be a puppet. Do not be controlled by people around you. It is your life you are living. No one should dictate what you should try and take in life.5. Dream. Make plans. If Plan A failed, there are 25 more plans to go.6. Learn to wait. Wishes and dreams are not for instant. It takes time. The longer you wait and the harder you work for it, the more fruitful it would become.7. Critics are everywhere. Whatever you do, may it be good or bad, someone will always notice and judge you. You should not give a shit about them. You know yourself better.8. Family, friends, do not forget them.We all have priorities in life, but one should not forget to allocate time for their loved ones. You can not turn back the hands of time.9. Trust is everything in a relationship.When you say you trust a person, it means you believe in anything that person would say. You believe in him no matter what. And when they say you are trusted, make sure you are completely honest. Trust is what keeps you related to the person. Sometimes, broken trust entails relationship over.10. Believe in Him. I am not the type who is religious. But I must say that He is there through my ups and downs. Trust him and raise it all to Him. He got you.It turns out you can not simply know and understand how it feels to be 22 until you are actually living it. Commitments. Responsibilities. Relationships. Career. These are just words, 22 is just a number, there is more to life. Color it! ",
