            "answer_text": "A.: No. Quarks are fermions and can be made (created) only in quark-antiquark pairs. In turn, \u201c[quark-gluon plasma] state is thought to consist of asymptotically free strong-interacting quarks and gluons,\u2026\u201d says the Wikipedia entry on quark\u2013gluon plasma. Note: \u201casymptotically free\u201d is not \u201cfree-roaming.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Quark gluon plasma, according to the current understanding, behaves like a perfect fluid, that is quarks and gluons move without any viscosity effects but are manifesting collective effects like vorticity. In this sense single quarks are not free-roaming particles of this special liquid reaching temperature hundred thousands higher than that of the Sun\u2019s core. Heavy ions and quark-gluon plasma ",
