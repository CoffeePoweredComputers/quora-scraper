            "answer_text": "Yeah, I think we should question everything. Because why not? Everyone has varying reasons for their beliefs. All being formed through life circumstances, and whatever certain experiences occurred that led to those conclusions. To question with the intent to disprove is perfectly understandable, but when this is over done it becomes malicious. There\u2019s no desire to actually understand what led the person to their beliefs, or see their perspective. Only to enforce personal beliefs, ironically judging them by their own personal beliefs and standards. Whether they hold the ruse of \u201crationality\u201d or \u201cintellect\u201d, it\u2019s all the same in the end. If the person believes in something there is usually a perfectly rational explanation for it, you\u2019re just not them, so you don\u2019t have it. But to question for the desire to learn, to add a new perspective to the mind seems the most beneficial and genuine. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s extremely important we get people comfortable with the idea that it\u2019s ok to have their beliefs questioned. We get into problems when we start saying there are some beliefs that need to be respected, purely on the basis that someone believes them. One of the most, if not the most important bedrocks of society, needs to be that it\u2019s ok to have your beliefs question so you can practice your intellectual arguments. It actually makes you a better person because it gives you the chance to practice being the owner of a brain that can think. For example, if you walk into a room and say \u201cI believe Elvis is still alive\u201d there is nobody that would say that belief is beyond reproach. Yet the belief which should never be questioned is the idea that god had a child with a woman 2000 years ago - and if you disbelieve that, or have gay sex, you\u2019re going to hell. So live you\u2019re life accordingly to this belief. You\u2019re supposed to just change your entire life around, because it\u2019s disrespectful just to question this idea. If you could step out of your own belief, you could see just how pernicious this idea becomes. Imagine someday if the dominant belief is not your own, but something else. Say, for example if someday Scientology is the dominant religion. Would you still think a belief should never be questioned when the majority of people were actively prodding you to join scientology? The crazy thing is that the belief about this god man has far more broad implications about how we as a society choose to live our lives, versus the belief that Elvis might still be alive. But the idea that has drastic implications for society is the one that can\u2019t be questioned - not the benign belief that Elvis is still alive. Please question my beliefs every day. Make me a smarter person. It\u2019s only those that are complacent with sloppy thinking that are angered at the opportunity to strengthen their own ideas by thinking about the holes in their own beliefs. ",
