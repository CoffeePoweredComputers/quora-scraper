            "answer_text": "Question: Has God ever wondered why he exists? We are in a temporary primary stage like the children who were asked to learn reading and writing but those kids struggle to understand the rocket science. In our temporary stage, we have been asked to obey God and to do good deeds to help others, but we are debating what we cannot comprehend like \u2018who is God\u2019, soul, or \u2018what is afterlife\u2019. We believe that God knows everything; he knows our future actions We also believe that God does not predetermine our decisions about resisting temptations, self-constraints, good or bad deeds, or anything related to rewards or punishments. The above is just one of many things which we do not know Just compare the human knowledge few hundred years ago with our knowledge now. What would be the additional knowledge after hundreds, thousands, and millions of years from now. We cannot comprehend God in that temporary stage of life, in Qur\u2019an 42:11 God has notified us that \u2018There is nothing like Him\u2019 \u02f9He is\u02fa the Originator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you spouses from among yourselves, and \u02f9made\u02fa mates for cattle \u02f9as well\u02fa\u2014multiplying you \u02f9both\u02fa. There is nothing like Him, for He \u02f9alone\u02fa is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing\u2019. We are here for testing; test environment necessitates struggle between good and evil. Testing missions are not supposed to be easy and comfortable. The test questions are not supposed to be known in advance. Our life on earth is a very short period compared to the universe time scale; It could be a temporary test period. There are hundreds of verses and teachings about that as mentioned in the following answer: https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-... (Sabri Shahin's answer to How do we know our purpose of existence in this world?) We have been asked to believe in God and Heaven but we have not seen God or heaven. Our fate will be determined based on that belief and on our good deeds. Why did God make it a difficult test for us? Although God knows what\u2019s in our hearts and what each of us might do, he tests us and wants us to witness our own test results in order to admit that we have been fairly rewarded according to our achievements as recorded in the test results Before the wealthy father distributes his wealth, he may want to record which son is obedient, the records are not for the father who knows, but as a testimony for people who might question the justice of their father The wise father disciplines his children and prepares them for a better life Although the wise teacher knows the hard-working student and the lazy student, he prepares regular exams as testimonies so that the students would not say that the teacher had favored some students over the others. Exams also urge students to get prepared in order to succeed Students should not wonder about the intention of the teacher; they are supposed to focus on what the teacher asked them to do If God wants to set up the testing environment to test people, then we are not supposed to advise God on how to set up the terms and conditions of the testing. The students are not supposed to advise the teacher on how to prepare the exams. God has created us, and he knows how to test us. The testing questions and answers are not supposed to be disclosed before the exam; testing environment necessitates some doubts and enables different choices and different decisions. The test does not depend on the level of education, a child may say \u2018I do not see the plane any more, it is going far away, it is still there but my sight does not reach it; God must be there but my sight does not reach him\u2019, but a scientist might conclude that, \u2018I do not see God, then there is no God\u2019. The test does not depend on the level of religion education, maybe someone who never heard of the religion teachings could pass the test based on the natural original gifts of conscience and reason \u2018What I do not want done to myself, I will not do to others. We may find some scholars who know the religion teachings but they accept to persecute and torture others, those are the bad trees which the prophets have warned us of them and of their bad fruits. The wise teacher sets different evaluation criteria for different grades; the students in the first grade are not evaluated as the students in the advanced degrees. We expect that the fair and wise God would evaluate people according to what they have been provided. The person who never heard of Prophets would have an easier test based on the gift of intelligence and conscience; he might get rewards for his good works and he might not be punished if not wicked. Qur\u2019an 17:85 They ask you about the spirit. Say, \u201cIts nature is known only to God, and you have been given but little knowledge.\u201d After thousands or millions of years, that verse will be still valid \u201c\u2018you have been given but little knowledge.\u201d regardless of the expected huge progress in science and knowledge. Qur\u2019an 5:48 To you, We have revealed this Book with the truth. It confirms whatever has remained intact in the scriptures which came before it and also to safeguard it. Therefore, judge between people according to Allah's revelations and do not yield to their vain desires diverging from the truth which has come to you. We have ordained a law and a Way of life for each of you. If Allah wanted, He could have made all of you a single nation. But He willed otherwise in order to test you in what He has given you; therefore try to excel one another in good deeds. Ultimately you all shall return to Allah; then He will show you the truth of those matters in which you dispute. Qur\u2019an 22:69 Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning the matters in which you differ Verse 6:165 teaches that: He is the One Who has made you the inheritors of the earth and raised some of you in ranks over others so that He may test you in what He has given you. Surely God is swift in retribution; yet He is also very Forgiving, Merciful. Those who can see the miracles in everything around them and in their own creation then deny the existence of God, those must be mistaken. God has sent prophets to notify people that he has created and fine-tuned everything for them like the father who prepares good environment for his children to live. There are many verses in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam to teach that God has created everything in heavens and earth. There are many other verses to teach that we are here for testing and there is an afterlife. https://www.quora.com/What-are-Gods-greatest-teachings/answer/Sabri-Shahin If the disbeliever wants a strong evidence about the existence of God (like to see God or someone should rise from the dead), then life will not be a test environment anymore. Even if that miracle would happen, unbelievers might not be convinced and might find other excuses for their disbelief. Those who can see the miracles in everything around them and in their own creation then deny the existence of God, might not believe even if someone should rise from the dead. In Luke 16:19-31, Jesus taught the parable of The Rich Man and Lazarus and explained that If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead. \u201cAnd even if We had sent down to them the angels and the dead spoke to them and We gathered together everything in front of them, they would not believe unless God should will. But most of them are ignorant\u201d Qur\u2019an 6:111 The following answers include the details: https://www.quora.com/What-are-Gods-greatest-teachings/answer/Sabri-Shahin https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-know-our-purpose-of-existence-in-this-world/answer/Sabri-Shahin https://www.quora.com/What-makes-us-happy-in-our-lives/answer/Sabri-Shahin https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-life-philosophies-that-cut-across-all-cultures/answer/Sabri-Shahin https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-the-Holy-books-of-different-religions-Do-all-of-them-promote-love-humanity/answer/Sabri-Shahin https://www.quora.com/If-God-is-loving-and-caring-why-does-evil-and-suffering-still-exist/answer/Sabri-Shahin https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-everyone-is-born-innocent/answer/Sabri-Shahin ",

            "answer_text": "If you can exist outside of time, that must be exactly the same as being everywhere in time, thus you could come into existence and be eternal all at once. Likewise if God is omnipresent, meaning that God is everywhere at once, then all things must exist within the awareness of god. In other words that the universe is saturated with the essence of God. God fills the spaces between the atoms, having manifested all matter within the cosmos. Mind is the awareness of God, observing matter at play, matter is the body of God, there to be observed by mind, together both make up reality. Mind observes matter, matter obeys all physical laws enacted by God, life is merely matter undergoing chemical processes, yet a mind observes them all at different levels of resolution. One of those levels of resolution is you. Your body belongs to the entire universe and is a part of God, being made from the same stuff as God. Your mind belongs to the entire universe and is a part of God, being made from the same stuff as God. You are God\u2026 So if you\u2019ve ever wondered about why and how you\u2019ve come into being, then the answer to your question must be \u2018Yes.\u2019 ",

So regardless, God never wonders why God exists. In fact any being that doesn\u2019t know why they exist can\u2019t be God and should know it. If it\u2019s even within a beings imagination to ask why they exist they obviously on some level believe there may be an answer outside them for their existence. Any real God would know why everything exists including themselves or believes or suspects the existence of some other power. Any being that claims to be God is either God and knows why or a fraud.

            "answer_text": "Sort of.  Jewish sources ask what God is \"doing\" right now.  That can't really be asked in a literal sense because God does not exist within space nor time.  Nevertheless, the answer is that God is said to be playing games with the Torah.  That means, doing something for the sake of doing something--without the potential of any personal benefit.  If there were a benefit then it wouldn't be a game, it would be a learning tool and we'd call it as such, and if there were a benefit then we'd have a contradiction as God is considered to already to be without any needs whatsoever. Anyway, playing games with the Torah seems to me to have the possibility of wondering why certain words are in such a place, and what they truly mean.  Sounds to me to be roughly along the lines of wondering why God exists.  Perhaps not a complete answer but I hope that helps a little. ",

And so God was able to be everywhere at the same time and was able to experience whatever each soul experienced anywhere, as some souls chose to be minerals, some chose to be vegetables and some chose to be animals. God did not want to miss anything; so He/She created creatures to cover every nook and cranny of the universe, air, land and sea as by giving us eyes to see what we see, noses to smell what we smell, tongues to taste what we taste, mouths to speak what we speak, ears to hear what we hear, hands to touch what we touch, feet to walk where we walk and feelings to feel what we feel to distinguish between hot and cold, love and fear, to be His/Her mobile monitoring system.

If He would contemplate His own being than He would not be God, because He would have to have a \u2018creator\u2019. Thus God is the Creator and do not need to question His own being.The Trinity that of God is a strong argument for this point. God is three beings in perfect unison with each other and can thus never question His own being or get bored. A perfect being knows His orgins and that is eternal. For in the Trinity He will always have someone to speak to and to love, thus elimanating all the other problems.God has alway existed so there is no way for Him to question Himself, because He has always been there. Eternaty those not have a starting point.",

So, we can conclude that the word GOD is not in our experience. It means this thing does not exists in our domain. Which means, asking a question on things which does not exists for you is senseless. Even if I tell you the answer, how will you know I am right? LESSON- YOU CAN ONLY TESTIFY THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE IN YOUR EXPERIENCE. ",
