            "answer_text": "Absolutely!  If you do not get attached to \"the having or not having of pleasure\" only then you can truly appreciate pleasure.  The ones who get attached to the \"high\" of their pleasure end up suffering more and more as it is practically impossible to keep feeding on pleasure.  Moreover, there is law of diminishing return where by \"more and more is needed for the same impact\". Take an example, of me being a social drinker.  Since I drink only occasionally and not get affected if I do not drink, when I drink, I feel good even after one drink and enjoy / appreciate that.  Compare that to a situation where the pleasure has a grip on you (attachment).  With that the whole dynamics changes and we almost can become slave of the pleasure. ",

            "answer_text": "Can you see black on a black backdrop or white on a white backdrop? I'd say not too distinctly, if at all! However, the \"backdrop\" to pleasure is the relative lack of pleasure and similarly the \"backdrop\" to pain is the relative lack of pain. They need not both be experienced to experience the feeling of any one. However, extreme pleasure immediately after cessation extreme pain (on the same spectrum) and vice versa would at least theoretically be more keenly experienced. ",
