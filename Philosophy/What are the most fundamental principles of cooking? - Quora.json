            "answer_text": "Safety is critical. When cooking, you're going to be dealing with very sharp objects, potentially mechanized; high to extremely high temperatures, potentially including open flames; items that can have explosive interactions if not properly handled; and the potential to transmit illness/disease to whomever eats the food you cook (including yourself), just off the top of my head. Sharp objects (especially knives, but the are other sharps in cooking areas): keep them sharp; dull sharps are far more likely to cause injury than dull sharps, due to the fact that when dull they must be used improperly to perform their taskkeep yourself and anyone sharing your cooking space aware of any sharps movement, so nobody turns around, comes around a corner, etc., into the business end of a sharp.always use sharps with appropriate accessories (e.g., cutting board for knives) \u2014 it not only keeps the sharp from dulling as quickly, it also helps keep damage to other kitchen spaces to a minimumHigh temperatures: A great deal of cooking deals with temperatures that can cause permanent disfigurement with a touch of less than one second. Be aware of what is hot, and use appropriate protective gear (e.g., oven mitts, aprons, etc) to protect your body. It's (so far) the only one you get.In addition to direct contact, fires may inadvertently happen if the flash point of an ingredient is not understood and crossed \u2014 suddenly that pan with oil in it is a column of fire that has to be addressed before it starts a structural fire. o.OIf cooking with flames, be aware of the things that you might do that would cause a \u201cflare up\" \u2014 where the flames will momentarily get significantly larger in area and volume. Sometimes this is necessary, so I'm not saying prevent it \u2014 I'm just advising that you maintain awareness, and be ready to evade.Also be aware of hot liquids \u2014 spilled liquids often require more time to remove from skin contact, and the entire time they're in contact, they are cooking that skin.Disease/illness transmission: Every time you cook you may be taking the health of everyone \u2014 who eats the food you prepare - into your handsWash the foods that need washed before preparing themwash your hands properly, and oftenmake sure that foods which require a minimum internal temperature reach itwash tools and utensils to avoid cross- contamination. rinsing, even in hot water, is not sufficientwash your hands. more.That said, it can be quite an enjoyable experience \u2014 I personally quite enjoy cooking. But safety is, I believe, the most important thing to know about cooking. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say the most fundamental principal of cooking is understanding the relationship between time and temperature. We cook food for three reasons. 1) to make it more palatable or digestible. 2) to improve texture and colour. 3) to kill off any harmful bacteria. For example, we know that a piece of meat generally has to be cooked to a safe internal temperature of 62C/144F. We can do this in a number of ways. We could cook it at a high temperature for a relatively short period of time, or we could cook it at a low temperature for a long period of time. However, the results will be different. High temperature cooking can cause the outside of the meat to be overcooked, leaving the inside less well cooked. If left for too long, the meat will start to shrink as water within the meat will turn to steam and evaporate. Low temperature cooking does the opposite. It reduces evaporation and ensures a more evenly cooked piece of meat that retains its juiciness. However, the trade off is time. In high temperature cooking, the meat may cook in less than an hour, whereas in low temperature cooking, it could take several hours. The choice of method will depend on the result you want. If you need food quickly and don\u2019t mind variations in degree of doneness and a degree of shrinkage, then higher temperature cooking will work well. But if yield and retention of juiciness is more important, use lower temperatures. With things such as vegetables, the relationship is less important because almost all vegetables will be cooked in liquid at high temperature (above boiling point). However, time becomes the more important factor, particularly with green vegetables. Cook for too long, and the food will loose its colour and the flavour will change. Cook for too short a time, and the texture may not be quite as nice. By understanding the time/temperature ratio, you will be able to cook almost anything to perfection. The choice of utensils, ingredients or cooking method, although important, is very much a personal preference. ",
