            "answer_text": "Newton. My vote goes to Newton for two main reasons: A) His thinking was much MUCH ahead of his time, when science was just beginning to get an edge over the Church. True, that he partly built upon the works of people like Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler whose works were under much more direct scrutiny and critique of the Church. But the danger was there nonetheless, of being labelled crazy and/or his work not being taken seriously. Thankfully, his work WAS taken seriously by the growing scientific community. So Newton ftw. B) He attacked the underlying assumptions of the time and redefined them, like gravity. What then happened was society adapted to proven science, and was able to develop much rapidly thereafter. Applications of his works were tremendous. He was honoured, prefixed, made the Lucasian professor of Mathematics etc. Now for Einstein. He is probably known for the most famous equation in history, e=mc\u00b2. Even a person living under a rock knows that equation. Of course general relativity changed modern science. But there is a difference between Newton and Einstein. As said, Newton had to REDEFINE phenomena. Einstein had to speculate, essentially BUILD UPON already existing phenomena. I'm not trying to undermine his achievements by saying this. The man was indeed a genius. Just that his observations and theories weren't accepted by the already advanced scientific community as radically as Newton's were. True, today his work on spacetime and relativity are much more significant than why an apple falls to the ground, but Newton's theories PONDERED TO THE NEED OF THE HOUR. That draws me more to Newton. Einstein changed Modern Science. Newton changed SCIENCE. ",

            "answer_text": "It's sad these are the only two names that come into one's head when it comes to scientists. Anyways, both of them were great scientists in their own era. One primary difference between them is that Newton had touched upon almost all fields of physics and some in mathematics too. You take up any subject in physics, you'll come across his name in the form of a law, or an equation. Albert Einstein on the other hand has touched only a few fields in physics, but the depth of his research is very very deep. That's the fundamental difference between them. Debating about two scientists who have spent all their lives in their jobs, so devoted that they were judged as retarded, doesn't make sense to me. If we have as much as a tenth of the dedication they had we can go places. ",
