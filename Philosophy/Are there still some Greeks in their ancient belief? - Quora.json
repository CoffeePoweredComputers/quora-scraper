            "answer_text": "To answer your question. Yes, there are! But. And here is the big BUT. The ancient Hellenic religion was not really totally eradicated. The proto Christians tried everything they could, defacing ancient statues and even turning the Parthenon into a Christian church. The Greeks resistance to the new religion was much stronger than people realize. The reason is to be found in the Greek philosophy which is the philosophy of life itself. The Greeks were willing to listen and debate on the basis of reason. When Paul, a Greek-educated Roman citizen of Jewish origin, knew that if somehow could get the Greeks to listen to his arguments, perhaps he could appeal to the quest of the Greeks forever seeking the existential reason of being. This quest of their\u2019s was portrayed by the statue dedicated to the unknown God. So, when he visited Athens, which was the place of knowledge, he seized the opportunity to talk to the Greeks of the existence of this God. The everlasting physic of the Greeks questioning everything and everybody did not convince them in their totality. This is clearly evident in Pauls letters, and in particular in the subject of the male organ. He knew the Greeks would never accept this. In this particular passage of his letters, he dispenses with this obligation for the new believers, the Gentiles as he is referring to. But it was not until the 3 hierarchs (Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian, and John Chrysostom enriched the new faith by introducing this very ancient Greek philosophy (of life) was the new religion finally been accepted by the Greeks. Many if not ALL of the religious festivities of the new religion is an adaptation of the old religion. As an example the prayer of Odysseus to Athena calling upon her assistance to return to his home, she told him < don\u2019t pray to me but pray to my FATHER>. Q. Who was her father? A. Zeus. The father of Gods and men. Q. To whom Jesus prayed at the mount of the olive trees? A. To his father. The ancient festivity of celebrating the birth of the sun in the middle of winter was replaced by Christmas. The ancient festivity of celebrating the return of Persephone from the world of the dead to the word of the living was replaced by Easter. And the list goes on. One only needs to see what is there in front of him/her to make the corelation. ",
