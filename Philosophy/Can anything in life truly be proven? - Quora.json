            "answer_text": "No. I think we must have a knowledge of truth in order to prove anything. I think the best we can achieve is a reasonable approximation of truth. We are limited creatures with limited awareness. Our senses and cognition did not evolve to \"prove facts\" but to interpret sensory input to optimally navigate and survive in our environment. We can use observation and testing to circumvent our faulty senses and fuzzy cognition to \"prove\" things within a reasonable range of error. Using scientific method we can build upon reliable results to take actions and construct machines with low risk of failure, such as relying on Newtonian physics to launch an aircraft. We know that there is more to physics than Newton was aware of, and today we have mysteries yet unsolved. This progression gives an impression that we will at some point \"understand it all\" and be able to \"prove everything\", but I believe this is not the case. I think our species has a scope and a limit of understanding that we cannot escape. I think we will face a horizon of knowing that will always recede as we approach it. Maybe we will become different, augmented creatures with the aid of massive computing and artificial intelligence, but even then, our tools are limited by our scope and limit.  It may be fine to say 2+2=4, but there are schemes of mathematics that could be implemented that might bag you 2+2=5. Godel has his incompleteness theorem, I don't claim to follow how he gets there but I get the idea, that there are relations between natural numbers that are true but unprovable. That doesn't \" prove\" that nothing is provable, but I wanted to point out that even mathematics and science are not complete. I think we can reasonably prove many things, but I'm not convinced we can absolutely prove anything at all. ",

            "answer_text": "Decartes suggested that the only one he could come up with was \"I think, therefore I am.\" He tried to build a unified knowledge framework based on that.    It seems that the smaller we can see things, the more mysterious they become.   We have to constantly invent words to describe the actions and impacts of the particles and forces that make up the matter and energy in the world.  All of the basic concepts get closer to philosophy than reality the farther down we burrow.    At the other end of the scale, we see enormity that can stop your heart if you consider its magnitude and your own irrelevance.  I mean... you can drive to LA in a week from New York at  70 MPH.  But can you really get your hands around the fact that you would need a 100,000 earth years (5.2 million earth weeks)  to reach the other side of the galaxy where you now live and read this?  Travelling at the speed of light.  Which would make your car trip across America take a few milliseconds.  Faster than you'd know you were dead if I shot you in the face with a cannon.   Faster than your consciousness can operate by a factor of 100.   You'd need a billion earth years to get across many galaxies.  You would need hundreds of lifetimes just to count the stars in this one, at 100s stars a second.   Search your soul for a word large enough to represent this truth.  You don't have it and never will.   Many quantities are defined in relationship to other quantities.  Circular definitions, if you will.  What is A?  A is not B.  What is B?  Not A.   Truth may have to always exist as probability.  It's the conundrum of truth.... you maybe can never find it, but you can draw ever more accurate borders around where it lurks. So is it absolute?  Maybe not. The speed of light in a vacuum seems to be close to absolute.  Beats the hell out of Descartes. Some mathematics seem to contain truth.... truth that's easily proven, but it's in relationship to other math concepts, not actual stuff.  (I got into a minor war with an ex girlfriend once when I told her that there are no straight lines in nature.... only in mental construct. )  A point is a concept you can grasp, but not demonstrate. A line segment is a two dimensional entity in an 13 dimensional universe.  But in mind-land, that line can be bisected.   The point can be imagined. Pi can exist.   That process is truth, even though the line is imaginary. This is the stuff of college sophomores discovering beer.  At some point you have to start constraining your questions better to get anything useful out of pondering them. You have to go through this.  It all seems so important.  It's a good exercise. In retrospect, after a long life, I would have spent more time chasing girls.  And that's the absolute truth. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably not. I think it makes sense to consider the threshold of proving something absolutely. In this case, the \"absolute\" threshold tasks us with exhausting unknown limits. It would require all possible knowledge related to the question. We would need to prove another question first: Is knowledge exhaustible? But where I think it gets trickiest is in the categorical or binding aspect of the subject. When we talk about something in an \"absolute\" sense, how can we neatly isolate the subject in question? Let's take the classic Cartesian Cogito: How can we be sure what exactly the \"I\" is in \"I think therefore I am?\" The \"I\" part of the Cogito has assumptions behind it. It isn't bulletproof. We must settle for \"near certain\" rather than \"absolute.\" ",

In a theoretical ten-dimensional omni-verse in which anything has existed, can exist, does exist, and/or will exist whether we've imagined it or not (infinity for eternity), anything could happen.  Doesn't even need to have been observed. True or false does not apply here, especially since it doesn't apply to light.  Light can be both particle and wave for example. Nothing is truly certain, we just keep filtering for the information we want and then put it all together to try and get a picture.  It's the best we can do. Sod's law that just when you find the Higgs Bosun for certain that you smash it and find yet more particles.  Or that you finally develop a means of measuring a planck in real-time and then discover that you can actually measure smaller measures of time.  Or that the the known universe enters entropy stage and energy is distributed completely evenly everywhere, and then a white hole suddenly appears and, oh, look, another one, and another, and then one of them turns into a big bang...

Lots of answers to this question quote Descartes cogito (I think therefore I am), the cogito has been attacked on several fronts, including that we cannot be sure of the I, there are thoughts, that is it. I contend, however, that we cannot ever be certain that time passes, without assuming that time actually does pass we cannot look to the changes in the world or in our own minds to assure us of the reality of the appearing world. Go ahead, try to prove the passage of time without assuming a priori the passage of time - which means that you cannot appeal to causation. ",

There is an important distinction between definitions and descriptions that is often misunderstood. A description is what someone thinks of something. We cannot be certain of descriptions because, by their very nature, they are non-definitive. A definition is precisely what something is. We can be absolutely certain of definitions because, by their very virtue, they are definitive. Now, definitions are decided by humans, so they are man-made. Some are more constrained than others, and some are more refined than others. So definitions themselves can evolve and can be wrong. However, at any given time, we can still be certain of a definition regardless of its integrity or permanence. We can just look them up. Examples: Words and grammar are defined, mathematical axioms are defined, scientific axioms are defined, system specifications are defined, architecture is defined. By definition, what is physical defines what is real. Physics is what we do to hone in and identify physical definitions as defined by nature, not by us. But our representation is still abstract (mathematical symbols, grammar), and can never perfectly equal the natural representation.The natural representation is of course, non other than nature itself. Nature is neither more simple or more complex than it has to be. ",

This flow is basically random change, and random change is the second sure thing. At certain scales a reliable probabilistic succession of images emerges. We call this reliable succession of images physics. By allowing us to predict the future and match expectations with future experience physics fulfills the predictive role of science. It is important to remember that the laws of science are contingent and only very good estimations. Self-aware people define a set of values and ethics for themselves. They intelligently use physics and ethical actions to reshape probabilities such that future experiences align with their values. As they master this practice, they become more sure of themselves. ",

Most of these comments imply one thing,  that reality is based on what we think reality is.  I, on the other hand, believe there is a true and absolute reality that is not affected by what we see, feel, or think.  I seek that reality everyday. That reality I am sure of. Seek REALITY, and it will reveal itself to you. ",

It's just a humbling thing to keep in mind as you do anything throughout the day, that there is no understandable meaning in the universe, and everything is just perception and linear thinking. ",
