            "answer_text": "\u201cIs ignoring  the question a  logical fallacy?\u201d Two issues are involved here. (1) Question  (2)  Ignoring. A  question is a \u201cconditional\u201d.  Of itself,  a  question is not regarded as an argument. If  a  claimant    offers  a  statement,  and the statement  is a standing point, which is to say,  something  offered as true or factual or reasonable,  the claimant must also satisfy the  Burden of Proof Rule  and defend  the standing point or statement if asked to do so by the challenger. It is vitally important that  a person  understand  that dialogue generally does not consist of two parties asking questions. It is  part of dialectical method that two parties  offer each other statements. You can state, by a  declarative  sentence,  that the other party  needs to satisfy the Burden of Proof Rule, and show evidences or reasoning that supports a  statement. You can  indicate by a Declarative Sentence that no objective data has been provided by a  claimant to substantiate or support their assertion or their standing point. That means that their claim  is dismissible, and does not have credibility. If I am discussing  Relativity Theory,  and I claim something as true or factual, and I quote Albert Einstein  to support my claim, I have credibility. If I simply claim something to be true, without evidence or reasoning to support it,  I am merely arguing a Fallacy of the Bare Assertion and have no credibility. The failure to satisfy the Burden of Proof Rule is cause for dismissal.  (2) Ignoring In dialogue,  when  a  person  offers supporting evidences or supporting arguments which are logically coherent,  the other party can ignore the argument or the evidence by adopting the common logical error designated The Fallacy of Invincible Ignorance. Such persons  do not even care if facts or reasoning shows their  standing point to be disproven. They just ignore the facts or the argument. The proper response at that point is to dismiss their argument by pointing out that they  cannot obtain  credibility for the reason that they have adopted  the Fallacy of Invincible Ignorance for a standing point. Consider again, the example of a quote from Albert Einstein as the support for my claims about Relativity.  I publish my claim,  and I quote Albert Einstein  from his writings on the subject, and I show that my claim has objective support. I have satisfied the Burden of Proof Rule. If  my challenger denies  my  statements,  the challenger\u2019s is arguing a logical fallacy called The Fallacy of Invincible Ignorance, and as a result, the challenger  can be regarded as discredited.
