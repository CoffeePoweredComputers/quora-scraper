            "answer_text": "John D. Rockefeller, the oil titan who had multiple strikes filed against him, put workers down, and made a fortune off the backs of thousands, voted for Abraham Lincoln, gave money the Union during the Civil war, and founded the Rockefeller foundation. Andrew Carnegie, know as the \u201cSteel king\u201d, was a much of a bastard as Rockefeller, payed his workers terribly, crushed labor unions, and essentially stole the ideas laid before him by Bessimer. He has a concert hall named in his honor because he felt it was the duty of the wealthy to help society. Sir Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of great Britain from 1940 to 1945 was a racist, jew and islam-hating bastard, but he still fought the Nazis, the biggest and nastiest regime that the world ever saw, and led Great Britain through the second world war by upholding the morale of his country with a bravado that I wish the politicians of today could fathom. All this before United States involvement, because before pearl harbor, our participation was unlikely. Sam Walton, founder of Walmart and Sam\u2019s club, might actually fit the bill, he seemed to be a good Businessman, took pride in his stock being \u201cAmerican Made\u201d, and even let his employees model in clothing ads! Of course he founded his store during the baby boom, so there\u2019s no telling if his dedication to his employees was dedication or trying to save on hiring actual models. Still, today Walmart is known as one of the most evil companies of all time for its practices toward the first world labor market. Bill Clinton is obviously most well known for getting a blowjob from an intern, but he did bring on an era of economic prosperity and participates in Humanitarian work post-presidency. He left with some pretty high approval ratings, too. Maybe you don\u2019t agree with his policies, but at the end of the day he did pass the state children\u2019s heath insurance program. We can agree that giving kids healthcare is a good thing, right? Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, engages in some serious anti-competitive tactics and was the target of Multiple lawsuits throughout the nineties, was said to force people to work so much that the couldn\u2019t leave the office, earning Microsoft the nickname of a \u201cVelvet sweatshop\u201d. He and his Wife Melinda founded a charity to help prevent the spread of disease in third world countries, and if you\u2019re reading this on a windows computer, some of the code he wrote is might still running on it. Keep in mind that all of these people, whether or not you think the pros outweigh the cons, are in fact people, and both the good and bad that they\u2019ve done in their lives will be magnified by the lenses of history and hindsight. At the end of the day, they\u2019re people. People do good stuff, and they commit evil acts and everything in between. Of course there\u2019s successful bastards that just do the evil parts of what these people did, I\u2019m not arguing that all successful people are \u201cjust people\u201d, some are truly evil bastards. When you work hard to build something, be it your career, your business, or your country, others will come along looking for a way to take you down so they can have it for themselves. They will have to fight, and fighting is messy, and not something a \u2018really good\u2019 person might be willing to do. Maybe this list doesn\u2019t suit you, maybe for you, the evils of these people outweigh the good. I don\u2019t think it matters who I picked, nobody will approve of any arbitrary list of businessmen and politicians. I think even if we restrict the definition of \u2018really good\u2019 to literature terms, people will always find some example or another of when person X was dishonest, or wrong, or bad in some way. So to answer your question, No, I don\u2019t think anybody falling under the literary definition of \u2018really good\u2019 could ever be successful, because \u2018really good\u2019 people just don\u2019t exist.

            "answer_text": "The structure of societies can be faulted directly for the circumstance you reference. The types of behavior a society allows to receive a reward says alot about the society. The structure should reward positive behaviors and allow consequential repercussions to pursue those who make irresponsible decisions detrimental to themselves and others. Responsible, moral decisions should be those obtaining the greatest reward for practice and repetition. Consider the socialist ideology of sharing, or wealth confiscation. A responsible citizen is punished while undesirable behavior is rewarded. Consider the following example. Two high school females both 17 years old and juniors in the high school system. Student Jill has a high gpa, works part time, volunteers, shuns drug use, refuses to drink alcohol and hopes to go to college despite her parents poverty.Student Margaret has a low gpa, loves to party, known to smoke marijuana, drinks to excess on weekends, has promiscuous sex frequently, and cares nothing about college pursuits.Now let's see what happens in America. Jill works hard saves money and applies to multiple universities. She enrolls in advanced placement classes to get college credit in high school. Jill does very well making high grades despite the curriculum. Jill seems to be busy and misses many parties and social events. Jill works hard even on weekends doing research papers and studying. Jill\u2019s father is in a car collision and her father is badly injured. The medical bills pile up but Jill picks up her work hours to help the family. The struggle gets deeper as her mother takes a second job. Jill keeps working and is in the fight for a brighter future she refuses to give up enrolling in summer classes at a junior college. Jill may be forced to wait she can only take a couple of night classes with summer beginning she must help out by watching her younger brother and helping her dad get to rehabilitative therapy. Jill may be forced to cut down to one class next semester but she is determined to keep going. Margaret somehow finds herself pregnant. Margaret files for welfare, wic, federal housing assistance, afdc, and federal utility assistance. Margaret recieves these benefits and also is informed of free and reduced tuition for college, babysitting assistance, and special programs offered for students allowing them to attend universities that are state sponsored. Margaret recieves remedial education assistance is partnered with a mentor and receives incentives to attend university. Margaret works hard and manages to qualify and begins attending university. Margaret does not work, has free food, free rent, free medical care, free tuition, free books, and free transportation. Margaret does well despite her average intelligence. Jill can't afford to continue and puts off college for a year. Jill knows this delay may not be temporary but has no choice but believes she will return to school next year. We see here the problem. Jill is thrown to the world to be ravaged by a situation created by an irresponsible individual. Jill has no culpability or responsibility for the situation she is in. Margaret having provided herself every indulgence of hedonistic pleasure finds herself doing well. Her baby is doing well too and Margaret knowing the father but not listing him as known but unknown now turns her attention to the dead beat dad. Margaret doesn't formally claim he is the father rather she threatens her love machine with revealing him as the father. The individual promises her help to avoid the public knowledge of his illegitimate love child. Love machine agrees to pay 200 dollars a month to keep his secret. Alternatively the grandparents become involved since dead beat has no funding to spare. Margaret is doing well. You get the idea, the irresponsible is rewarded while Jill is left to struggle in her chastity. Welcome to America and we wonder why we have a problem. Margaret parades around her meal, eduation, housing, and assistance providing illegitimate child. Margaret can't help laughing when she sees Jill miss goody too shoes working a petty fast food job. Margaret enjoys driving her new car provided by the grandparents of deadbeat and brags about her success having her degree and a local government job with benefits. Margarett actually asked if they could reduce her salary since it was cost effective tI insure her salary was just below the income limits set by the government to keep her benefits. Jill wonders where she went wrong in her hard work, responsible, chaste lifestyle. Welcome to America. ",

            "answer_text": "It is subjective - It depends on what you mean by \u201cRich and Successful\u201d. By the way the term \u201cReally Good\u201d is subjective too, what you call \u201cReally Good\u201d is what most people see it as, others may not. What business is it that doesn\u2019t have a negative impact on the environment. If you really want to be \u201cReally Good\u201d then you have to give up using machines that use fossil fuel, maybe live in the fringes and try to harm nature less. Since we\u2019ve established that trying to be \u201cReally Good\u201d in the modern society will pass you off as a hypocrite, what chances do you have making it in the corporate world. It\u2019s a dog eat dog world there man, slack off and you are toast. ",

Anyway I am getting ahead of myself here and giving your question my own interpretation. You see I immediately thought of the famous well known billionaires, your Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and the others. For that level of wealth and success your \u201creally good person\u201d definately doesn't stand a chance. ",
