            "answer_text": "Your principal limitation is imagining that anyone can \u201cplan\u201d transcendence, as if it were a two-week vacation, the blueprint for a new office building, or a catered wedding. Transcendence is not a commodity, and it does not adhere to a fixed schedule. It cannot be put on a budget, or marked in advance on a calendar. As Hamlet would say, it defies augury. It also defies those rooted in mindless convention and steeped in bourgeois kitsch. You can\u2019t order transcendence from an online catalog, or achieve it by doing exercises and practicing yoga, no matter how faithfully. It comes unbidden, because it is always unwanted. Transcendence means death\u2014figurative if not literal. Death does not mean transformation; there are no round-trip tickets, no money-back guarantees, and no way of knowing when (let alone, whether) it will happen. You can\u2019t will it into being\u2014that contradicts itself. You must wait for it, as for Godot. Even then it will probably never occur, no matter how patient you are. If it does occur, you won\u2019t be ready for it, nor ecstatic that it has finally arrived. On the contrary, you will be terrified, and wish you\u2019d never been born, let alone wished or hoped for it. If you survive the ordeal, and come out of it intact, either in this world or some other, only then will it dawn on you what it was about, and why it saved you, or spared you from an even worse fate. Yet it will still be a mystery, long afterward\u2014as we are to ourselves, even in our ordinary lives, with transcendence hovering nigh, yet infinitely remote. So stop planning, and start ridding your mind of all the garbage heaped in it. That won\u2019t prepare you for transcendence, but it will help you to understand the world, and not let it destroy you before you are even ripe enough to rot. ",
