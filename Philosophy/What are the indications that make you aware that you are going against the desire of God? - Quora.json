            "answer_text": "God is most pleased when we cultivate our pure spiritual consciousness in a relationship with Him. Spiritualism and materialism go ill together. They are like two sides of a weighing scale. As one increases, the other decreases. If our material desires and attachments are increasing this is less pleasing than if our spiritual aspirations towards purity and surrender to the Lord are. Ultimately the Lord wants us to be detached from material desires and reunited with Him in a pure spiritual relationship, but He will not deny us our material desires as long as we are attached to them. If we find we are losing whatever attraction we may have for Him, losing interest in hearing about Him, and serving Him, it\u2019s a sign we are not being favored by the Lord. It\u2019s a sign we are going against our best interests which is not what the Lord desires for us. If our material attachments are still strong and influence us, it\u2019s not exactly a sign of going against the desire of God, but it\u2019s a sign that we could be doing better. If we are becoming detached from all material considerations, not just gross but subtle also, meaning we have no interest in being important, famous or respected in general, or if we are undisturbed by the coming and going of happiness and distress, it\u2019s a good sign that the Lord is pleased with us and we are in tune with His desire for us to give up all attraction to material life. Try not to see the Lord as a slightly crabby, judgmental person who wants us to run around fulfilling all His desires. Try to see Him as someone who doesn\u2019t need us at all, but even so will gladly enter our hearts if we make room by tossing out our material attachments and endearing ourselves to Him. One who is equal to friends and enemies, who is equipoised in honor and dishonor, heat and cold, happiness and distress, fame and infamy, who is always free from contaminating association, always silent and satisfied with anything, who doesn't care for any residence, who is fixed in knowledge and who is engaged in devotional service -- such a person is very dear to Me. Bg 12.18-19 Those who follow this imperishable path of devotional service and who completely engage themselves with faith, making Me the supreme goal, are very, very dear to Me. Bg 12.20 ",

            "answer_text": "Its your desires that matters in the end not God's desires. Yes if you frame the question as what are indications that you are going away from God? Well then if you see darkness or dark energy is increasing in your path then you are going away from him. God wishes everyone well he is not Devil that he would want you to fulfill his desire. He asks you to follow your heart which is a gift from him. In the end hearts that are attracted to light and positive energy follow the path to God gets to be with him. Not everyone is the same. But God never forces you to make choices its completely dependent on you. You make your choice learn when mistakes are made by you and rectify yourself if you want to. God is the leader of resistance against evil. He is the creator of free will. Even if you choose evil\u2019s side away from him and that makes you happy he has no objection to it. But then you can't blame him when you perish coz at the end evil always loses and perishes. ",
