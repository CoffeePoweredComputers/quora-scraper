            "answer_text": "Morality has to do with right and wrong, good and bad. Moral principles are ideals that we try to follow in our attempt to live right and be good people, instead of bad. Some common examples of moral principles are honesty, respect, and kindness. If I accept these principles as worthy of guiding my life, then I try to be honest with people, show respect for them, and be kind to them. Most of us have some moral principles whether we know it or not. For example, if someone does something really nice for us, most of us will feel good and say thank you. This is the principle of gratitude, which we may have without really thinking about it. But not everyone has a well-thought-out system of morals. One common approach today is when people just do just about whatever they feel like doing at the moment. Some people avoid having many moral principles so that they feel better about this approach to live. Others may have some principles and use some restraint instead of doing whatever they feel like. Others still may have some principles but go against them whenever they really want to do something would violate them. There are many different moral principles, and people will not always agree on which ones should be followed. One person may think a moral principle is good and someone else may think it is bad. For example, the principle of paying a person back what they deserve for for something they have done wrong may seem like a good principle to some people but others may feel they need forgiveness or a second chance instead. Others still may think it depends on the person and situation. Personally, I believe in God and think it is good for us to gain our moral standards from him. I believe we need someone wiser and less biased than most human beings are that can let us know which principles really are good and which are not. I also believe it is very difficult to live according to our moral principles. If we sincerely try to adopt some good principles and seek to live by them, it will be hard for us to be 100% consistent. I believe that\u2019s a part of our humanity. I don\u2019t believe we should pretend we are 100% consistent when we\u2019re not because that would be hypocrisy. The word hypocrite means pretender and originally referred to an actor in a play. We should not pretend we are better than we are. But if we are honest about our failures, we are not hypocrites merely because we fall short of our principles. At least we are trying to live right. If we are honest about our failures and avoid being judgmental toward those who do not share our principles, people will generally give us a break. Some may still be critical of us for a variety of reasons, but if we want to live well, we try hard to stick to our principles in spite of our own failures or other people\u2019s criticisms. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of values we as parents need to instill in our children. But it has to be follow my lead, and NOT do as I say, not as I do. I started out with empathy. My kids were around other kids with special needs from a young age. I placed them in inclusion preschool. I really wanted them to be used to people of all differences. I taught them everyone is the same. Everyone has one heart, two lungs, a liver\u2026. Skin color differences are no different than eye color differences. And because someone can't see or walk, that doesn't make them any less than we are. This worked great. My mom was a home health worker. Her main client for 18 years was Ruthie. My mis called her Aunt Ruthie. She read in a large wheel chair. Kids in her own family wouldn't come near, they were terrified. But my kids weren't. She had holidays with us for 18 years. When my girl was little, she would stand on Ruthie's sneakers to see over the table on her chair and play with her. I got upset. Ruthie said, leave her be, with tears in her eyes. No child had ever come that close to her. They loved each other. Tell the truth. I always told them, if you tell me the truth, you will get in less trouble than if I finds out you lied about something bad. And, I always find out. They found out this was true, and I could tell when they were truthful. I didn't have to worry. Bring your friends here. We'r have an open door policy. Their friends are always welcome. The was only one friend, among 3 kids whom I had a bad feeling about, and I was right. I ended up calling her mom, and ending that in Middle school. She ended up being promiscuous with boys, and a terrible maker. My house is the hang out. I don't bother them, once I knew their friends. If I know they are coming, I have their friends favorite foods. This way, my kids were never out partying. They were always here. And sometimes they'd even ask my husband and I to join them. I didn't serve alcohol or drugs, but was still the fun parent. Insist on homework being done and good grades from the start. This healthy habit is the start of a good life. Even if they don't go to college, it inspires good work skills. My son did c- tech in high school and at 20 is the youngest deli manager in the district for shop rite. When he was promoted, he was told If he kept up the good work and worked his way up, the DM saw him managing his own store in the future. That is a goal at 20 years old. No one is better than any one else. We all put our pants on one leg at a time! If someone is bullying your kid, you be pro active so he doesn't have to be. Someone read bullying William away the bus stop in 2nd grade. (Another mom took him since I had to work). I went to work late one day, found out where the bully lived. Went to house, mom was a nurse, dad was a fire fighter, they were appalled their child did this. It stopped immediately. Maybe don't do that, but you be an advocate for him, so he doesn't have to be afraid. Bullying is now a crime, schools have to stop it. For us going to church as a family and having friends with the same values was a huge help. We instilled tay others how you want to be treated. And Jesus said when I knocked you opened the door, when I was Thirsty you gave me drink, when I was hungry you fed me. Share with others. Some mis have nothing. It isn't their fault, they are kids, they can't get s job. So share what you can. And let me know if there's a problem, I may be able to help. That's how we ended adopting our 3rd child\u2026. But that wad something we had planned to do for 20 years, we were waiting for God to show us the child. Spend time as a family, make it a priority. We still do and our kids are adults. We are taking a family cruise this summer. We will all be there. We like each other. Give them chores for responsibility. And don't be afraid to punish them, and remember you are their parent right now. You can be their friend after they are adults doing great in this world! There will be plenty of time for that! ",
