            "answer_text": "Lao Tzu thought there is a nature principle or more definite a system called Tao governing the nature and the human society. He thought if the rulers want themselves to be the good ones, they should observe the rules of Tao to protect the environment and the normal order of the human society.Dialectical thinking is another important theme. Most of paragraphs of Tao Te Ching contain this. For example, even though one thing has one feature, it can turn out not to have it at all. Lao Tzu wanted us not to consider something's feature as immobile for the reason that it can always change and, more important, when compared to other things, this feature may not be as notable as it used to be. In addition, anything appeared good may turn out to be a bad thing, and vice versa.Lao Tzu warned the rulers not to take bold steps. He is a advocate of non-action governing. But non-action is not as easy as it sounds. By non-action, in my opinion, rulers should follow the rules of Tao and don't take action against the Tao. I assume it's a insightful warning for nowadays Chinese Government because of the ongoing worse and worse contamination. Some parts of Tao Te Ching teach us to be a calm person. No matter we encounter a failure or a success, we should just remain the same to maintain the routine of our life. If you do anything a little bit a day, this can eventually lead to a big success. ",

            "answer_text": "The importance of Lao Tzu\u2019s insights is in the eyes of the beholder. Everyone responds differently because many thoughts expressed in the Tao Te Ching are open to interpretation. One overriding \u201cmessage\u201d of Lao Tzu, and of the nation of Tao in general, is this: First there is Nature, then there is human, who is a mere temporary guest in the cosmic garden we call Earth. Humans developed millions of years after Tao, so it stands to reason that human life operates on the very same principles as Tao. The Chinese reasoned that if Tao governs the universe, humans would be well to study Tao. A deep understanding of Tao - how it operates, what its qualities and tendencies are - can help humans to \u201cinsert\u201d themselves into the Tao-based universe with the minimum amount of friction.
