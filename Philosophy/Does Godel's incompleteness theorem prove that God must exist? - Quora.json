            "answer_text": "Question originally answered: Does Godel's incompleteness theorem prove that God must exist?  Let\u2019s first start off by pointing out that it\u2019s not \u2018G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorem\u2019, rather it is \u2018G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems\u2019. Then let\u2019s take a look at what it even is that they[1] say: Any effective logic, capable of interpreting Robinson Arithmetic, must eitherHave a proposition [math]{\\sf P}[/math], which is both provable and disprovable (i.e. be syntactically inconsistent), orHave a proposition [math]{\\sf P}[/math], which is neither provable nor disprovable (i.e. be syntactically incomplete)Any effective logic, capable of interpreting Robinson Arithmetic, if it satisfies 1b above, (i.e. is syntactically consistent and therefore syntactically incomplete), has among its undecidable propositions, the proposition that expresses its own consistency.Now, since these are rather precise assertions, that put no further restrictions on the language of the logic than that they can express Robinson Arithmetic and be effective (itself a precisely defined concept, which basically amounts to being able to enumerate all possible proofs of the logic, in some specific order), one must ask one\u2019s self how we could even come to the conclusion that we could even express the proposition that \u2018God exists\u2019, which is of course a necessary precondition for further reasoning on that proposition and its provability/disprovability. And if we cannot even express that proposition, than how, in God\u2019s name (invocation of a deity intended), can we ever come to the conclusion that God exists. Furthermore, even if we could express that proposition, how does the OP know that this proposition even is an undecidable proposition as the first theorem guarantees to exist. If the proposition is provable, then it is not undecidable and one questions the relevance of the incompleteness theorems in the first place. And if it is an undecidable proposition such as the first theorem guarantees to exist, than you should consider the fact that any such logic, if it is a first order logic, by another of G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems, the completeness theorem[2], is semantically complete. That is to say, that any such logic can prove all propositions that are necessarily true in all models of the logic. Therefore, from the fact that \u2018God exists\u2019, would be an expressible and undecidable proposition, it follows that \u2018God exists\u2019, is not necessarily true at all, otherwise it would be provable (by the completeness theorem). Perhaps more explicitly, the proposition \u2018God exists\u2019, is at best contingently true, true in some worlds and not in others. And since we do not know whether or not our world is even sufficiently similar to any of these models worlds, where we already have at most a contingently true proposition, we can conclude nothing at all about whether or not God exists in reality. Logic cannot prove anything at all about reality.  Now, lest you think that when you reason about a logic, you are reasoning outside of the logic, I would hasten to point out that you might be reasoning outside of the object logic you are looking at, but you are not reasoning outside of any logic at all. Specifically, you are still reasoning inside of the logic you are using to even speak about your object logic (one to which the incompleteness theorems apply), the meta-logic, and it\u2019s language. And, curiously enough, a meta-logic is still just a logic! It is a logic that has as its domain of discourse, propositions as strings of symbols, deductions as a structure consisting of applications of inference rules to object propositions. It features it own propositions as well, the meta-propositions, which are built up from meta-symbols, such as [math]\\vdash_{\\mathfrak{L}}[/math], which represents the notion of derivability of an object proposition from some collection of object propositions. An example of such a meta-proposition would be the incompleteness theorems themselves. If [math]\\mathfrak{L}[/math] is the class of all logics satisfying the prerequisites of the incompleteness theorem and if [math]\\mathfrak{l} \\in \\mathfrak{L}[/math], is such a logic then we have the first incomplete theorem expressed as: [math]\\forall \\mathfrak{l} \\in \\mathfrak{L}. \\mathrm{SynInconsistent}(\\mathfrak{l}) \\lor \\mathrm{SynIncomplete}(\\mathfrak{l})[/math]where [math]\\mathrm{SynInconsistent}(\\mathfrak{l}) \\overset{\\text{def}}{\\iff} \\exists {\\sf P} \\in \\mathrm{Language}(\\mathfrak{l}). \\vdash_{\\mathfrak{l}} {\\sf P} \\land \\vdash_{\\mathfrak{l}} {\\sf \\lnot P}[/math][math]\\mathrm{SynIncomplete}(\\mathfrak{l}) \\overset{\\text{def}}{\\iff} \\exists {\\sf P} \\in \\mathrm{Language}(\\mathfrak{l}). \\not \\vdash_{\\mathfrak{l}} {\\sf P} \\land \\not \\vdash_{\\mathfrak{l}} {\\sf \\lnot P}[/math]We are never reasoning outside of some logic. This false popular idea that we can somehow recognise a necessary truth of logic, by \u2018stepping outside\u2019 of logic, is simply non-sense. We step outside of one logic logic straight inside of another, to which the incompleteness theorems quite possibly also apply, and in fact must, since use enumeration over proofs of the object logic.  All of the above is utterly ignoring the fact the incompleteness theorems are not even about truth of propositions at all, but are about provability of propositions. They are a computational result on the computability of strings from strings. These strings need not even be interpreted as \u2018statements on models\u2019. The incompleteness theorems are independent of any interpretation of the language of the logic. Perhaps more clearly, the proposition \u2018God exists\u2019, is just a string of symbols without any meaning at all, sans an interpretation, and yet the incompleteness theorems would still apply.  The theorems have no theological relevance at all. Footnotes[1] G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems - Wikipedia[2] G\u00f6del's completeness theorem - Wikipedia",

Apparently, it is essentially a restatement of the ontological argument that there is a single greatest thing in the universe, which we then just simply declare to be God. If that makes any sense to you, then you are either smarter or dumber than I am, or you are just emotionally bound in a way that I am not to the idea that God is logical and is somehow subject to logical proofs. If it is the latter, there is always the Babel fish to dissuade you.  Footnotes[1] G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems - Wikipedia[2] G\u00f6del's ontological proof - Wikipedia",

Godel\u2019s incompleteness and ontological proof shows why he was a Platonist. In other words, attributes like goodness are infinite and exists outside of the physical realm. Godel\u2019s Incompleteness is clear proof of a metaphysical reality that exists outside of physical reality. This metaphysical reality is necessary while we\u2019re contingent. This closely ties into the qualia space of Giulio Tononi. In other words, any system described by mathematics will be incomplete and will need to appeal to an unprovable truth outside of that system. Godel\u2019s incompleteness theorem says this: \"Any consistent formal system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there are statements of the language of F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F.\" WOW!! If you look at the universe, which is described by mathematics, then according to Godel, there are things about the universe that can\u2019t be proven by anything in the universe. So at some point the physical universe ends(Planck\u2019s constant) and this metaphysical reality begins(Tononi\u2019s Qualia Space, Quantum mind?). ",
