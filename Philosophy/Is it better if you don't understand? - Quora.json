            "answer_text": "Until you learn, that\u2019s the default state for everyone. While I agree that it\u2019s okay, if its something potentially important to you, it really is something you should try to learn. I have more of a problem with people who somehow believe that they know something to be true without actual evidence that they are right and have no rational argument for why the facts that contradict them are wrong. I call these people the \u2018believers\u2019, because they don\u2019t have actual knowledge, they simply have belief based on nothing but their emotions. Some of them use a kind of circular \u2018reasoning\u2019 (and I use that term loosely). In the case of fundamentalists, they may believe that something is true because it\u2019s in the bible, And the bible is true because it came from god and they believe in god because of the bible. But there are examples in all sorts of fields. Conspiracy theorists believe that others believe they are wrong because of the conspiracy, and they know that something is true because everyone else says that it\u2019s wrong, so they must be part of the conspiracy.

            "answer_text": "If you can identify the knowledge gap, you can close it, or find someone else who has the knowledge you need. Pretending to know everything is a classic marker of the under educated and over confident. Everyone has knowledge gaps. I remain in the position of perpetual student; each day I try to learn to be better, and identify more of the areas that I don\u2019t understand. To be a seeker of knowledge is to understand the vast amount that you do not already know. My ego is of a fairly decent size, yet I am constantly humbled by people who have a different perspective or understanding of the same objective events. To understand more perspectives is to get closer to actually knowing what a thing is, and that is the very goal of the sciences. ",
