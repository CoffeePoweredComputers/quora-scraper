            "answer_text": "Honestly, rational explanations for natural phenomenon. Thales was the first to explicitly break from religious explanations for natural phenomenon and explained the world as fundamentally composed of water. If you have a sharp mind's eye, you can see where this is going. As soon as philosophy opened up a new avenue of thinking, it stopped there and most pre-Socratics after Thales basically wrote about physics rather than what one might consider philosophy. It wasn't really until Heraclitus and Parmenides that this changed. Parmenides in particular is very critical of reducing philosophy to physical models of the universe in his section of \u201cOn Nature\" which is typically translated to \u201cway of opinion\u201d. Parmenides expands philosophy to logic and ontology whereas Heraclitus expands it to politics and meta-ethics. It isn't until Plato that you see extremely broad and inquisitive understandings of what philosophy can be. ",
