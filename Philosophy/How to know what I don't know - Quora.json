            "answer_text": "The best way to know what you don't know is - Curiosity -The important thing is to not stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day --- Albert Einstein. Question - People are sometimes afraid to ask questions out of fear of seeming \u201cstupid.\u201d And yet the smartest people on the planet are often the ones who ask the most questions. Case in point: Albert Einstein. Don't limit the horizon : God and Nature first made us what we are, and then out of our own created genius we make ourselves what we want to be. Follow always that great law. Let the sky and God be our limit and Eternity our measurement --- Marcus Garvey. Read widely : There is no end to education. It is not that you read a book, pass an examination, and finish with education. The whole of life, from the moment you are born to the moment you die, is a process of learning --- Jiddu Krishnamurti. Be mindful : Being mindful means being more aware of your emotions and your surroundings. Try to become more conscious of curiosity. Make an effort to remind yourself to find something to spark your curiosity each day Embrace the unexpected : Many people find themselves plagued by their own doubts, which causes them to miss out on new places, flavors, people, and experiences. But often times, doing something unexpected can trigger a chain of reactions -- both positive and negative -- that you can learn from and formulate questions based on.  S T A Y - C U R I O S ! ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question, and this answer may sound very strange to most, even outrageous nonsense to a few, but then who can expect anyone to know what they don't experience? At the foundation of all creation, beyond the Planck Scale, is the metaphorical blueprint of everything, the eternal holographic nothingness of everything, the seed form of creation containing all possibilities. Directly knowing That by being awake to it is what Maharishi Mahesh Yogi referred to as \"Pure Knowledge\". (For lack of a more familiar term without widely divergent connotations, we'll use only that here.)  Total Knowledge does not mean knowledge of any specific aspects of creation, it is knowledge of the non-changing basis of creation yet it contains the seed of everything compacted in a dimensionless point. It is not known by thinking about it, it is known from the level of BEING IT. It's not waxingly philosophical, it is simply directly experiential.  It is incredibly fortunate that human life has the innate potential to be open to experience Total Knowledge because, although human life does not allow omniscience\u2014knowledge of all details of everything on all levels all at once\u2014knowing Total Knowledge is the basis for knowing anything at any time. To know any particular knowledge of something, the infallible answer is gained by starting with one's consciousness being fully awake to Total Knowledge. Being established in that eternal non-changing basis of everything, the individual attention can then desire to know anything in particular, which comes directly to cognition within consciousness. This ability to know anything through desiring is called ritam bhara pragya in Sanskrit, and is spoken about in Vedic literature.  It's nothing new. People throughout history have been discovering knowledge within themselves. One striking example is Nicola Tesla. Even before he began working for others, and without a workshop, he not only completely conceived of an alternating current motor within his mind, he even tested it within his mind. All he had to do was to get someone to agree to let him have the means to build it, which he did successfully the first time.  Ritam bhara pragya is not only about inventing things, it is about bringing any specific knowledge desired from the infinite possibilities of Total Knowledge. And that means literally ANYTHING. Of course, one's success in doing so is usually dependent on one's cultured ability. This direct approach to knowledge\u2014the subjective approach\u2014is in stark contrast to the objective approach of intellectual reasoning, theorizing, and fussing about in a lab to see if the idea is \"true\", all of which produces inherently partial knowledge if the researcher is lacking direct experience of Total Knowledge. Think Thomas Edison who became successful based on trying everything before finally getting something that worked. Persistence was his method, unlike Tesla. Objective knowledge is by it's very nature a partial knowledge because it relies on the senses and intellect to \"make sense\" of things. Relying on senses and intellect alone is subject to illusion because it excludes Total Knowledge which is essentially knowledge of the relationship of the knower, process of knowing, and object of knowledge as one unified wholeness\u2014totality. It's like the difference between the perspective of an audience at a magic show and that of the stage director who KNOWS what's really going on. The audience may have all sorts of guesses and theories of what is happening, maybe even good ones, but will never know for sure. Ritam bhara pragya is not about just looking for anything at all, there needs to be purpose to it, a direction. It's not just \"tell me something I don't know\" as that is not going to elicit any cognitions\u2014it's too general. It requires a specific desire to know something in particular; then the conscious attention goes deep within to more silent levels of attention and at the point where it comes out, the very fine delicate level where the eternal continuum of Being meets the ever-changing level of Becoming, the impulse of desire attracts and assembles the answer from the infinite possibilities within Total Knowledge\u2014all within one's own consciousness. I mentioned that the infallible answers are gained by first having Total Knowledge established in the awareness. It's like having a non-directional background light that makes everything clearer where the focus is directed, so there is no mistake, no illusion about what one sees.  So start with getting to know Total Knowledge. This you can easily and spontaneously do through the effortless practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique as taught by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.
