            "answer_text": "Quran is not copied from Bible. But it is written based on Bible. Bible has two parts, the Old Testament and the New Testament. Bible is the history of Salvation, nothing more, nothing less. Old Testament is the preperation for Christ event. New Testament is the Covenant of Love and every person is supposed to obey the New Testament and the guidence of Jesus Christ. The Arabic world was dominated by a group of war lords. People were very crude and social security and justice was far away. The power was the justice. When written Quran it has taken laws from Old Testament and mixed with the covenant of love from the New Testament. The objective was to change the people into a group of cultured and peaceful ones. Quran itself is asking people to read Bible for further clarification. When reading Quran many give undue importance to the \u2018words\u2019 rather than the message it gives. For example when we read you shall not kill, it is not an order for abstaining from murder. It is also a request to protect life, and whatever help is needed to your brother / fellow being. They had to protect themselves from others. Every being has a right of self defence. But taking some words and sentences from there and here and try to apply it in todays society does not mean we obey Quran. Need to understand the whole message of Quran. Laws are important. How they apply on people is more important. It should be always applied for the safety and comfort of the people rather than following them as rituals. Jesus has highlighted this many times (please read chapters 2, 3, and 4 of Mark in the Bible). Any law imposed on people to the extreme will be injustice. The attitude towards a law is important. A. G. Gardiner has written an essay (or rather a short story) \u2018All about a dog\u2019. It is trying to convey how a rule is applied ignoring the spirit of the law. Rules are for safety and freedom of man. It is not for destroying anybody. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Islam boasts that the Quran is the pure word of Allah, but only to find out that some of its contents are taken from other sources mostly from the Bible. Muhammad just altered them to cover the obviousness. Below are samples of statements in Quran as well as in Hadiths which are taken from outside sources. Here are some of them; COPIED FROM THE BIBLE: 1. [Koran 2:117] The Originator of the heavens and the earth! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is. Taken from [Psalm 33: 6&9] The heavens were made by the word of the LORD and all the stars by the breath of his mouth. . . He spoke, and it came into being. He gave the order, and there it stood. 2. [Koran 2:245] Who is he that will lend to Allah a goodly loan so that He may multiply it to him many times? And it is Allah that decreases or increases (your provisions), and unto Him you shall return. Taken from [Proverbs 19:17] Whoever has pity on the poor lends to the LORD, and he will repay him for his good deed. 3. [Koran 3:18] There is no god but He: That is the witness of Allah, His angels, and those endued with knowledge, standing firm on justice. There is no god but He, the Exalted in Power, the Wise. Taken from [Psalm 86: 8-9] No god is like you, O Lord. No one can do what you do. All the nations that you have made will bow in your presence, O Lord. They will honor you. 4. [Koran 17:12] And We have made the night and day two signs, and We erased the sign of the night and made the sign of the day visible that you may seek bounty from your Lord and may know the number of years and the account [of time]. And everything We have set out in detail. Taken from [Genesis 1:14] And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years. 5. [Quran 7:199] You shall resort to pardon, advocate tolerance, and disregard the ignorant & [Quran 24:22] And let not those of you who possess grace and abundance swear against giving to the near of kin and the poor and those who have fled in Allah\u2019s way, and they should pardon and turn away. Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. Taken from [Ephesians 4:31-32] Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ\u2019s sake hath forgiven you. : The above Koranic verses in 5. is one of the proofs that it is copied from the New Testament because these verses urge the Muslims to forgive and disregard ignorant person (who doesn\u2019t know Islam). But does Islam really teach forgiveness to non-Muslim? the answer is no, Koran and Hadiths teach slaughtering the non-Muslims esp. the Jews and Christians. MUHAMMAD COPIED HIS TEACHING FROM THE BIBLE: 1 [Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 93, Number 559] Narrated \u2018Abdullah bin \u2018Umar: I heard Allah\u2019s Apostle while he was standing on the pulpit, saying, \u201cThe remaining period of your stay (on the earth) in comparison to the nations before you, is like the period between the \u2018Asr prayer and sunset. The people of the Torah were given the Torah and they acted upon it till midday, and then they were worn out and were given for their labor, one Qirat each. Then the people of the Gospel were given the Gospel and they acted upon it till the time of the \u2018Asr prayer, and then they were worn out and were given (for their labor), one Qirat each. Then you people were given the Quran and you acted upon it till sunset and so you were given two Qirats each (double the reward of the previous nations).\u201d Then the people of the Torah said, \u2018O our Lord! These people have done a little labor (much less than we) but have taken a greater reward.\u2019 Allah said, \u2018Have I withheld anything from your reward?\u2019 They said, \u2018No.\u2019 Then Allah said, \u2018That is My Favor which I bestow on whom I wish.'\u201d Taken from [Matthew 20:1-16] \u201cFor the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard. He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard. About the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. He told them, \u2018You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.\u2019 So they went. He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing. About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, \u2018Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?\u2019 \u2018Because no one has hired us,\u2019 they answered. He said to them, \u2018You also go and work in my vineyard.\u2019 When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, \u2018Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.\u2019 The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius. So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. \u2018These men who were hired last worked only one hour,\u2019 they said, \u2018and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.\u2019 But he answered one of them, \u2018Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Didn\u2019t you agree to work for a denarius? Take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you. Don\u2019t I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?\u2019 So the last will be first, and the first will be last.\u201d 2. [Hadith Qudsi 18] On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said that the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said: Allah (mighty and sublime be He) will say on the Day of Resurrection: O son of Adam, I fell ill and you visited Me not. He will say: O Lord, and how should I visit You when You are the Lord of the worlds? He will say: Did you not know that My servant So-and-so had fallen ill and you visited him not? Did you not know that had you visited him you would have found Me with him? O son of Adam, I asked you for food and you fed Me not. He will say: O Lord, and how should I feed You when You are the Lord of the worlds? He will say: Did you not know that My servant So-and-so asked you for food and you fed him not? Did you notknow that had you fed him you would surely have found that (the reward for doing so) with Me? O son of Adam, I asked you to give Me to drink and you gave Me not to drink. He will say: O Lord, how should I give You to drink when You are the Lord of the worlds? He will say: My servant So-and-so asked you to give him to drink and you gave him not to drink. Had you given him to drink you would have surely found that with Me. Taken from [Matthew 25:31-46] \u201cWhen the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory. All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left. Then the King will say to those on his right, \u2018Come, you who are blessed by MY FATHER; take your inheritance, the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.\u2019 Then the righteous will answer him, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?\u2019 The King will reply, \u2018I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.\u2019 Then he will say to those on his left, \u2018Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink, I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.\u2019 They also will answer, \u2018Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?\u2019 He will reply, \u2018I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.\u2019 Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.\u201d 3. [Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 28, Number 3883] Narrated AbudDarda\u2019: I heard the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) say: If any of you is suffering from anything or his brother is suffering, he should say: Our Lord is Allah Who is in the heaven, holy is Thy name, Thy command reigns supreme in the heaven and the earth, as Thy mercy in the heaven, make Thy mercy in the earth; forgive us our sins, and our errors; Thou art the Lord of good men; send down mercy from Thy mercy, and remedy, and remedy from Thy remedy on this pain so that it is healed up. Taken from [Matthew 6:9-13] After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. 4. [Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 84, Number 63] Narrated \u2018Abdullah: As if I am looking at the Prophet while he was speaking about one of the prophets whose people have beaten and wounded him, and he was wiping the blood off his face and saying, \u201cO Lord! Forgive my people as they do not know.\u201d Taken from [Luke 23:33] Then Jesus said, \u201cFather, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.\u201d And they divided up His garments by casting lots. 5. [Sahih Al-Bukhari, Volume 9, Book 93, Number 589] Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, \u201cALLAH SAID, \u2018I have prepared for My righteous slaves (such excellent things) as no eye has ever seen, nor an ear has ever heard nor a human heart can ever think of.\u2019\u201d Taken from [1 Corinthians 2:9] However, as it is written: \u201cNo eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him.\u201d KORANIC VERSES THAT ARE COPIED FROM PSEUDO-GOSPELS AND STORIES OF THE PEOPLE: 1. JESUS CREATED BIRD OUT OF CLAY [Quran 3:49] And (make him) a messenger to the Children of Israel (saying): I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, that I determine for you out of clay the form of a bird, then I breathe into it and it becomes a bird with Allah\u2019s permission, and I heal the blind and the leprous, and bring the dead to life with Allah\u2019s permission; and I inform you of what you should eat and what you should store in your houses. Surely there is a sign in this for you, if you are believers. Taken from Apocrypha, [The Infancy Gospel of Thomas chapter 1] . . . Then he took from the bank of the stream some soft clay and formed out of it twelve sparrows; and there were other boys playing with him. But a certain Jew seeing the things which he was doing, namely, his forming clay into the figures of sparrows on the Sabbath day, went presently away and told his father Joseph, Behold, your boy is playing by the river side, and has taken clay and formed it into twelve sparrows, and profanes the Sabbath. Then Joseph came to the place where he was, and when he saw him, called to him, and said, Why do you that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day? Then Jesus clapping together the palms of his hands, called to the sparrows, and said to them: Go, fly away; and while you live remember me. . . 2. JESUS TALKS IN THE CRADLE [Quran 19:28-34] \u201cO sister of Aaron! Thy father was not a wicked man nor was thy mother a harlot. Then she pointed to him. They said: How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle? He said: \u201cI am indeed a servant of Allah. He has given me the Book and has made me a prophet. And has made me blessed wheresoever I may be, and has enjoined upon me prayer and almsgiving so long as I remain alive, And (has made me) dutiful toward her who bore me, and hath not made me arrogant, unblest. Peace on me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive! Such was Jesus, son of Mary: (this is) a statement of the truth concerning which they doubt. Taken from Apocrypha [Gospels of the Infancy of Jesus] \u2026 Jesus spake when he was in the cradle, and said to his mother: \u201cMary, I am Jesus the Son of God, the Word, which thou didst bring forth according to the declaration of the angel Gabriel, and My Father hath sent me for the salvation of the world.\u201d 3. JESUS TALKS IN THE CRADLE AND MADE BIRD OUT Of CLAY [Koran 5:110] When Allah will say: O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favour to thee and to thy mother, when I strengthened thee with the Holy Spirit; thou spokest to people in the cradle and in old age, and when I taught thee the Book and the Wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel, and when thou didst determine out of clay a thing like the form of a bird by My permission, then thou didst breathe into it and it became a bird by My permission; and thou didst heal the blind and the leprous by My permission; and when thou didst raise the dead by My permission; and when I withheld the Children of Israel from thee when thou camest to them with clear arguments \u2014 but those of them who disbelieved said: This is nothing but clear enchantment. THE STORY HOW MUHAMMAD RECEIVED THIS INFORMATION: [A. Guillaume, The Life Of Muhammad: A Translation Of Ishaq\u2019s Sirat Rasul Allah, 1998, Oxford University Press: Karachi (Pakistan), p 271-272] \u201cThe names of the fourteen principal men among the sixty riders were: `Abdul-Masih the `Aqib, al-Ayham the Sayyid; Abu Haritha b. `Alqama brother of B. Bakr b. Wa`il; Aus; al-Harith; Zayd; Qays; Yazid; Nubayh; Khuwaylid; `Amr; Khalid; `Abdullah; Johannes; of these the first three named above spoke to the Apostle. They were Christians according to the Byzantine rite, though they differed among themselves in some points, saying He is God; and He is the son of God; and He is the third person of the Trinity, which is the doctrine of Christianity. They argue that he is God because he used to raise the dead, and heal the sick, and declare the unseen; and make clay birds and then breathe into them so that they flew away; and all this was by the command of God Almighty, \u2018We will make him a sign to men.\u2019 They argue that he is the son of God in that they say he had no known father; and he spoke in the cradle and this is something that no child of Adam has ever done. They argue that he is the third of the three in that God says: We have done, We have commanded, We have created and We have decreed, and they say, If He were one he would have said I have done, I have created, and soon, but He is He and Jesus and Mary. Concerning all these assertions the Qur\u2019an came down.\u201d The above report is also the source of verses (5:116 & 4:171]) which tells about the wrong Trinity; 4. [Koran 5:116] And [beware the Day] when Allah will say, \u201cO Jesus, Son of Mary, did you say to the people, \u2018TAKE ME AND MY MOTHER AS DEITIES BESIDES ALLAH ?'\u201d He will say, \u201cExalted are You! It was not for me to say that to which I have no right. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, it is You who is Knower of the unseen. 5. [Koran 4:171] \u201cO People of the Book! Commit no excesses in your religion: Nor say of God aught but the truth. CHRIST JESUS the son of MARY was (no more than) an apostle of God, and His Word, which He bestowed on MARY, and a SPIRIT proceeding from Him: so believe in God and His apostles. Say not \u201cTRINITY\u201d: desist: it will be better for you: for God is one God: Glory be to Him: (far exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belong all things in the heavens and on earth. And enough is God as a Disposer of affairs.\u201d ISLAMIC PRACTICES THAT ARE COPIED FROM PAGANISM: Not just some Islamic writings or statements that are taken from other sources, but also its practices. Below is an article tracing back how Islam got its ritual practices. This story is about Ahmed Deedat, a Muslim debater, who attacked the Hindu religion with his video tape. In response, a Hinduism defender, wrote an article revealing evidence that Islam is originated from their Hindu Pagan worship. This revelation confirmed what many historians and scholars say that Allah is derived from pagan god. Here is the story quoted from the MUSLIM DIGEST; DEEDAT AND THE HINDU RELIGION (THIS ARTICLE WAS REPRODUCED BY THE MUSLIM DIGEST JULY TO OCT. 1986) \u201cDeedat has embarrassed the faithful followers of Islam, hurt, distressed and pained relatives and friends, violated basic principles, infuriated Christians and Hindus and insists on continuing his religious crusade that does more harm than good to the cause of Islam that he claims he espouses. The Church\u2019s attitude was correct and so was the attitude of its leaders for, in the process of denigrating Christianity, Deedat insulted Islam and Prophet Muhammed (s.a.w.) himself, for while quoting the Qur\u2019anic verse of how one should go about propagating Islam \u2013 that is, \u201cwith wisdom and beautiful preaching,\u201d Deedat has, time and again, flouted these lofty principles, with there being neither \u201cwisdom\u201d nor \u201cbeauty\u201d in his preaching methods. In fact, of late, his method of propagating Islam has even begun to stink to high heaven itself! IN RESPONSE TO DEEDAT\u2019S OBJECTIONABLE VIDEO TAPE ON HINDUISM Pamphlet headed: \u2018WAS KAABA A HINDU TEMPLE? IS ALLAH A HINDU GOD?\u2019 Distributed Mr Deedat\u2019s arrogance and the method of his preaching in attacking other religions knows no bounds. His recent attack on the Hindu religion prompted Hindus to react and make counter allegations against ISLAM, the KAABA and against ALLAH HIMSELF, for which Mr Deedat should be held responsible. A 13-page pamphlet headed: \u201cWAS KAABA A HINDU TEMPLE?\u201d \u2014 \u201cIS ALLAH A HINDU GOD?\u201d was very widely distributed in the Gujerati, Tamil, Telegu and the Hindustani sections of the Hindu Community recently. The author of this 13-page pamphlet is Mr P.N. Oak, M.A. LL.B., of Delhi, India. Among other things, the author had this to say: \u201cGlancing through some research material recently, I was pleasantly surprised to come across a reference to a King Vikramadity inscription found in the Kaaba temple in Mecca, proving beyond doubt that the Arabian peninsula formed a part of his Indian Empire.\u201d \u201cThis discovery changes the entire complexion of ancient history and to a great extent, the history of ancient India. For one thing we may have to revise our concepts about the king who had the largest empire in history. It could be that the expanse of King Vikramaditya\u2019s empire was larger than that of all others.\u201d \u201c\u2026The region of King Vikramaditya\u2019s empire extended from Bali Island in the South East Pacific to the Baltic Northern Europe, and from Korea to Kaaba. The only difference was that while Indian rulers identified themselves with the local population and established welfare states, Moghuls and others, who ruled conquered lands, perpetrated untold atrocities over the vanquished\u2026\u201d \u201cThe text of the crucial Vikramaditya inscription, found inscribed on a gold dish hung inside the Kaaba shrine in Mecca, is found recorded on page 315 of a volume known as \u201cSayar-ul-Okul\u201d treasured in the Makhtab-e-sultania (library) in Istanbul, Turkey.\u201d \u201cRendered in free English the inscription says \u201cFortunate are those who were born (and lived) during King Vikrama\u2019s reign. He was a noble, generous, dutiful ruler, devoted to the welfare of his subjects. \u201d Mr P.N. Oak, the author of the pamphlet, then goes on to quote the Arabic and reproduces the same in Roman script and quotes (page 315 \u201cSayar-ul-Okul\u201d). [something seems to be missing here but that is how it is in the original in the Muslim Digest] The title \u201cSayar-ul-Okul\u201d signifies MEMORABLE WORDS, says Mr Oak. Mr Oak further says: \u201c\u2026that the so-called Kutab Minar in Delhi could well be King Vikramaditya\u2019s tower commemorating his conquest of Arabia.\u201d \u201c\u2026The first modern edition of \u201cSayar-ul-Okul\u201d was printed and published in Berlin in A.D. 1864. A subsequent is the one published in Beirut in A.D. 1932.\u201d \u201c\u2026The book also contains an elaborate description of the ancient shrine of Mecca, the town and the annual fair known as OKAJ which used to be held every year around the Kaaba temple in Mecca. This should convince readers that the annual Hajj of the Muslims to the Kaaba is not an Islamic speciality, but a mere continuation of an earlier pre-Islamic congregation.\u201d \u201c\u2026Mecca, therefore followed the Varanasi (Benares) tradition of providing a venue for important discussions among the learned while the masses congregated there for spiritual bliss. The principal shrines at both Varanasi in India and at Mecca in Arbasthan (Arabia) were Shiva temples, even to this day the ancient Mahadova emblems. It is the Shankara stone which Muslim pilgrims reverently touch and kiss in the Kaaba.\u201d \u201c\u2026The main shrine in Mecca, which houses the Shiva emblem, is known as the Kaaba. It is clothed in a black shroud. That custom also originates from the days when it was thought necessary to discourage its recapture (by enemies) by camouflaging it.\u201d \u201c\u2026Muslim pilgrims visiting the Kaaba temple go around it seven times. In no other Mosque does this circumambulation prevail. Hindus invariably circumambulate around their deities. This is yet another proof that the Kaaba shrine is a pre-Islamic Indian Shiva temple where the Hindu practise of circumambulation is still meticulously observed.\u201d \u201c\u2026Another Hindu tradition still associated with the Kaaba is that of the sacred stream Ganga. According to Hindu tradition Ganga is also as inseparable from the Shiva emblem as the crescent moon. Wherever there is a Shiva emblem, Ganga must co-exist. True to that association a sacred foundation exists near the Kaaba. Its water is held sacred because it had been traditionally regarded as Ganga since pre-Islamic times.\u201d \u201c\u2026It might come as a stunning revelation to many that the word \u201cALLAH\u201d itself is Sanskrit. In Sanskrit Allah, Akka and Amba are synonyms. They signify a goddess or mother. The term Allah forms part of Sanskrit chants invoking goddess Durga, also known as Bhavani, Chandi and Mahishasuramardini. The Islamic word Allah for God is therefore, not an innovation but the ancient Sanskrit appellation retained and continued by Islam. Allah means mother or goddess and mother goddess.\u201d \u201c\u2026Vaidik descriptions about the moon, the different solar constellations and the creation of the universe have been incorporated from the Vedas in Koran, part 1, chapter 2, stanzas 113, 114, 115 and 158, 189; Chapter 10, stanzas 4 to 7.\u201d \u201c\u2026Recital of the Namaz five times a day owes its origin to the Vaidik injunction of Panchamayajnya which was part of the daily Vaidik ritual prescribed for all individuals.\u201d \u201c\u2026The Islamic term \u201cEed-ul-Fitr\u201d derives from the \u201cEed of Pitors\u201d, that is, worship of forefathers, in Sanskrit tradition. In India Hindus commemorate their ancestors during the Pitri-Paksha, that is, the fortnight reserved for their remembrance. The very same is the significance of Eed-ul-Fitr (worship of forefathers).\u201d ",
