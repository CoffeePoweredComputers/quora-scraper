            "answer_text": "The most positive effect of going to confession is that your sins are forgiven and you are no longer going to hell. Also, you may now receive Holy Communion in a manner which is going to save you not condemn you to hell which is what most Catholics are doing these days. This is from the website Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines. \u201cSt. John Vianney, the patron saint of priests, had some very interesting reflections on the matter. He listed five ill effects that go with \u201cunworthy communion\u201d. \u201cFirst, it outrages God more than all other mortal sins. John Vianney believed that a man who takes \u201cunworthy communion\u201d attacks the person of Jesus Christ himself instead of scorning only his commandments, like other mortal sins (St. John Vianney, The Cure of Ars, Eucharistic Meditations, 2001). \u201cSecond, whoever communicates unworthily \u201ccrucifies Jesus Christ in his heart\u201d. The saintly priest stressed that the death of Jesus in Calvary seemed to affect even the least sensible of creatures but by receiving communion unworthily, man shows insensitivity to Christ\u2019s humiliation and insults Jesus further. He said, \u201cMy God, how can a Christian have the heart to go to the holy table with sin in his soul, there to put Jesus Christ to death\u201d? \u201cThird, \u201cUnworthy Communion\u201d is a more criminal profanation than that of the holy places. When one does something abominable inside that of a holy place, it is called \u201clocal sacrilege\u201d, which is considered a grave sin. But John Vianney emphasized that it is more grievous to receive Holy Communion under sinful circumstances. The saint said, \u201cThat poor wretch unites the Holy of Holies to a prostitute soul, and sells him to iniquity. Yes, that poor wretch plunges his God into a raging hell. Is it possible to conceive anything more dreadful\u201d? \u201cFourth, \u201cUnworthy Communion\u201d is in certain respects a greater crime than the deicide of the Jews. Quoting St. Paul, the pastor said, \u201cSt. Paul tells us that if the Jews had known Jesus Christ as the Savior, they would never have put him to suffering or death; but can you my friend, be ignorant of him whom you are going to receive\u201d? He said further, \u201cIf you are guilty, unhappy man, do not draw near; or else tremble, lest the thunders of heaven be hurled upon your criminal head to punish you and cast your soul into hell.\u201d \u201cFifth, \u201cUnworthy Communion\u201d imitates and renews the crime of Judas. According to this great saint, if Judas delivered Jesus to his enemies by a kiss of peace, an unworthy communicant carries his cruel duplicity by hiding or disguising some sins with a hypocritical reverence on his face and place himself among the faithful destined to eat this Bread. \u201cSt. John Vianney truly considered \u201cunworthy communion\u201d a great abomination against Jesus and a scandal in the faith. An unworthy communicant may appear to be pious to those who do not know him. But a \u201ccrime\u201d may not ultimately be kept secret, especially since God sees beyond what man could not actually see.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d figured James Hough would respond to this one and I see he has (haven\u2019t read his answer yet). Since he normally provides the more theological point of view, bringing chapter and verse where appropriate, I will just refer you to his answer for that part. From a purely practical and daily-life standpoint, an important part of Confession is that you get advice from someone who is outside of whichever situations you\u2019ve bungled and can evaluate them impartially, then give you tools to avoid repeating those mistakes. If the confessor is someone who knows you well, or simply adroit enough at the task*, he can quickly figure out what parts are in your control and which are not, he can figure out the problem under the problem. He can tell you whether you\u2019re being too hard on yourself and others, or too soft on someone (be it yourself or another), point out repeating issues\u2026 and, he can help you learn to be better, to do better. And he\u2019ll do all that without talking with other parties involved unless you ask him to mediate (which is not part of Confession but it\u2019s a pastoral duty). This \u201chelping people to figure out, fix and avoid repeating their mistakes\u201d is a pastoral duty which is performed by pastors, priests or rabbis in other religions that do not have the Sacrament; it\u2019s also what a talk therapist does, and many of the tools used are common with psychological therapies such as behavioral therapy. Having someone that you can talk to in a secure environment, knowing that you will be evaluated but not judged, corrected without insult or contempt, is enormously important to the human psyche. (*) which, yes, all should be, but this is true of anybody at any profession aaaand\u2026 well, same as St Jean-Baptiste Vianney was a lot better at confession than most, there are some who\u2019re really bad at it.
