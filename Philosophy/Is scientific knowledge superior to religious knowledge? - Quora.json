            "answer_text": "It's a very big subject to cover in a short answer. From an Islamic perspective, religious knowledge is superior to scientific knowledge. For example, while it is stated in the Quran, we live in a seven-dimensional world, yet science has only discovered (mathematically) a three-dimensional world. To elaborate, here is something that will surprise most people: A man asked Ibn Abbas (An early Islamic Thinker and Non-Conformist), on the interpretation of the beginning of the verse from Surat \u201cThe Divorce\u201d From the Quran: \u201cGod, who created the seven heavens and of the earth seven like them,\u201d remained silent about it, to which the man said: \u201cWhat prevents you from answer me? \u201dIbn Abbas replied: \u201cHow do you know that if I tell you, you won\u2019t become an infidel?\u201c The man said: \"Tell me!\" Ibn Abbas said: \"Seven Earths, in each earth an Adam like ours, a Noah like ours, an Abraham like ours, a Jesus Like ours.\u201d The Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) also said that we live in the first level of the universe, and that there are six other universes, which are called the seven heavens (not the heaven we expect to end up in, but the ones that exists in parallel to our current existing universe). Between the one universe we live in and the next universe are 50 thousand years (that's is about 2.5e9 earth years). And, humans will never get through the gates to the next universe. There is a possibility of other dimensions parallel to ours that might have different historical events, civilizations, and cultures that exist beyond our reach. If you do more research, you'll learn that the the Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) indicated that we humans will never reach the other earth-like planets, but this does not prevent us from proving it mathematically; we have already proved that only a three-dimensional world exists, and we are not too far from proving that a seven-dimensional universe exists. This is hard for many people to accept, including Muslims because it takes them out of there comfort zone, and it might be overwhelming too. While it is written in the Quran, and mentioned by Ibn Abbas (who was described by the Prophet Mohammed to be the best scholar of the Islamic nation), most Muslim scholars will not talk about this because of the lack of understanding of advanced physics, mathematics, and astrophysics. So, keep an open mind, the more you know about science and the arabic language the easier for you to understand the Quran\u2019s hidden secrets. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think scientific knowledge and \u201creligious\u201d knowledge can even be compared. They both measure completely different worlds in different ways. Science holds knowledge of the physical world and and religious knowledge holds knowledge of the spiritual world. Many in the scientific community may not agree that there is exactly a spiritual world, but unless there is a way to test it I don\u2019t think anyone has any grounds to say that there isn\u2019t one. Especially when over the course of all of human history, there have been beliefs in a God or at least some sort of a spiritual realm. Religious knowledge isn\u2019t better than scientific knowledge and scientific knowledge isn\u2019t better than religious knowledge, because they both claim to know something that the other side does not know. In terms of reliability, the religious side is at a disadvantage because they claim to know the spiritual realm without having any physical evidence. There can\u2019t be any physical evidence for a spiritual world, since its whole concept is based on \u201cbelieving in what we cannot see\u201d and there can\u2019t be spiritual evidence for a physical world because its whole concept is based on \u201cbelieving only in what we can see\u201d. It\u2019s very interesting to compare the parallels. I still stand firm in saying that these two different sets of knowledge cannot be compared. ",
