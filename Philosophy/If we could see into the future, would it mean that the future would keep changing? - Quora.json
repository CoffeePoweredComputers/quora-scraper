            "answer_text": "If you have a time machine, you need to be able to lock up the time period you left from causality effects, effecting it. Imagine if the time machine you had could move things from the past, from the future. Move a quark out of place in an atom in a grain of sand, on a beach 1000 years ago. Something as little as this, is enough to change the whole history of the earth from that point on. If you watch videos on the grandfather paradox it is a misconception that you can have enough time to stand in front of him to pull the trigger, let alone have a conversation with him. You cannot go back in time and get the winning lottery numbers, you cannot kill Hitler, stop Pearl Harbor attack, you cannot save JFK, or stop September 11th. You can only change these things if the time machine can lock up causality effects (keep the time period you came from from causality effects effecting it) But the changes would never count in reality you came from, just the other dimension you went back into, and messed around in. If a machine can do something as amazing as recreate the past, then locking up causality should be no problem for the time machine to do. Maybe people from the future go into the past in the technique I described above, or have the technology to view the past from the future on a television monitor, without causing any causality effects. These are the only two ways I can think of that do not effect causality. Unless the aliens have a time machine, but they are not going to share, because we are about money, greed, exciting our neurotransmitters, and power, and cannot be trusted, even if we can understand the technology, if explained to us by them. The most visited place by a time traveler if possible would be the bookstore depository where Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK, or the Dinosaur period. Look at Ronald Mallet time machine on YouTube, but it can only send information back to the point when it was switched on. ",

            "answer_text": "If we could see the future, then what we see won't be like some HD movie. It would be a Blurred image of infinite possibilities happening all at the same time. All of those possibilities would be a probable future, and all would be true. Only when our timeline will move forward to that point, then one of the possibilities will be manifested in the material world as the Present. So, the answer to your question is NO. No, the future won't change because there is no fixed future. What lies ahead of us is just a collection of infinite possibilities, it is us who decide what the future will be through our actions and decisions. ",
