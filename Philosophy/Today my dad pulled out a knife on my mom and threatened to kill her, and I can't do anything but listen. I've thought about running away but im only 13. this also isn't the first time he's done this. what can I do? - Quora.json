            "answer_text": "Oh my gosh I'm so sorry your having to witness such a horrible thing. I really want to help you but there are many factors involved here. 1. Do you have other relatives might need to stay with. 2. If you don't have family you will have to go into foster care. But I think anything would be better than where you are. 3. QDo you get along with mom. 4.if you do get along with mom than both of you can go to a domestic abuse shelter. It's pretty good. But mom has to phone the police.once she does they will give her a yellow card with all the help and their phone numbers. Try and call 211 for help too. You really need to ask mom if staying with your dad is something she really wants to do? Because what there doing is called child abuse on you because you are there witnessing everything. I'm sure your torn and hurt about your dad. Tell your mom your scared.and worried about it. If mom says she doesn't want to leave tell her about the domestic abuse shelter. I don't know exactly but mostshelters especially the ones near the city are good. They are generally houses with several bedrooms for families such as yours . They have counseling while the kids are at school. It's a family environment which will be good for you and mom to heal. And then maybe your dad will realize he too needs help and start some sort of counseling. Maybe church. The main thing here though is this knifes threats etc. Should not be tolerated by anyone not even you. The shelter is there to help. The rules need to be followed always because of safety issues for everyone. .When you go to talk to mom make sure your dad isn't home. Ok please let me know how your doing after this. May God be with you always ",

            "answer_text": "Call 911. Record him threatening her as evidence, but don't record him making threats and try to use it to threaten him, that could get your and your Mom killed. Things aren't going to get better on their own. When you call 911 do so quietly don't even tell your mother, she may try to stop you. That might sound crazy, But if she doesn't call for help, it's likely she's afraid. Your dad has a serious problem.. another thing if you call the police and they're on their way\u2026 get out of the house so you can't become a hostage. I don't advocate calling the police for most reasons\u2026but in your situation , I wouldn't wait ",
