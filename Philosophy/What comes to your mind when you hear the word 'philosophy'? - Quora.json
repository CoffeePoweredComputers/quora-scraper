            "answer_text": "When I hear the word \u201cphilosophy,\u201d I think of its etymological derivation from the Greek, \u201clove of wisdom.\u201d It is different and more profound than \u201cphilology,\u201d that is essentially \u201clove of words;\u201d it is different and more modest than \u201ctheosophy,\u201d that is essentially the claim of \u201cdivine wisdom.\u201d Philosophy is the secular pursuit of wisdom in the western and non-western worlds that has occurred over the centuries. The study of philosophy deals with the evidence and arguments for the logically foundational beliefs about what is real, true and valuable in order to understand and improve the human condition. Philosophy provides a critical perspective on the limits of lives devoted to the love of power, the love of wealth, the love of fame, the love of sensual pleasure, and even the love of knowledge. Philosophy can provide guidance regarding decisions about the future, critical analysis of past decisions from which to learn and insightful appreciation of the experience of the present. Leaders who have not studied philosophy deeply usually end up unconsciously living out some dead philosopher\u2019s philosophy of life. Often they fall prey to the love of power or the love of wealth or the love of fame and neglect the development of leadership wisdom that addresses the needs of multiple stakeholders and improves the human condition.

            "answer_text": "I think of guidelines. Root word meanining \u201clover of wisdom\u201d and certainly the philosopher loves learning, as Socrates tells in Plato\u2019s The Republic Book II. I think of it as a law or moral, but it is superior to both those things. It is better because it provides for understanding. See in the traditional sense of moral or ethics, its adherence to the cultural sentiment, but a lot of times that moral is not well understood. So, gray area behavior is sometimes unfairly persecuted or changes the culture for the worse. In law, especially in law that is not important to the culture, anything can be used to argue it. With a philosophy, there is understanding. When things don't follow an ideal, you know where to bend and how to adjust. If a mechanic fixing a car follows moral (without question) he says \u201cI can't fix the car because it's not right. You have to get a new motor.\u201d The other mechanic who lets law govern (without question) says, \u201cyou maybe, could, fix it, the law is to get a new motor.\u201d A mechanic that follows philosophy says, \u201cI can fix it, but I shouldn't because of the potential to go wrong again, not to mention it's illegal because it's unsafe.\u201d Maybe owner of the vehicle comes to the same conclusion with each person. The difference is, the choice made after developing a proper philosophy is more wise. It's more informed, and if they decide to proceed, they know the risk, and you're fully prepared. ",
