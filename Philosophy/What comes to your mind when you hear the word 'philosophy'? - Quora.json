The study of philosophy deals with the evidence and arguments for the logically foundational beliefs about what is real, true and valuable in order to understand and improve the human condition. Philosophy provides a critical perspective on the limits of lives devoted to the love of power, the love of wealth, the love of fame, the love of sensual pleasure, and even the love of knowledge. Philosophy can provide guidance regarding decisions about the future, critical analysis of past decisions from which to learn and insightful appreciation of the experience of the present. Leaders who have not studied philosophy deeply usually end up unconsciously living out some dead philosopher\u2019s philosophy of life. Often they fall prey to the love of power or the love of wealth or the love of fame and neglect the development of leadership wisdom that addresses the needs of multiple stakeholders and improves the human condition.

            "answer_text": "I think of guidelines. Root word meanining \u201clover of wisdom\u201d and certainly the philosopher loves learning, as Socrates tells in Plato\u2019s The Republic Book II. I think of it as a law or moral, but it is superior to both those things. It is better because it provides for understanding. See in the traditional sense of moral or ethics, its adherence to the cultural sentiment, but a lot of times that moral is not well understood. So, gray area behavior is sometimes unfairly persecuted or changes the culture for the worse. In law, especially in law that is not important to the culture, anything can be used to argue it. With a philosophy, there is understanding. When things don't follow an ideal, you know where to bend and how to adjust. If a mechanic fixing a car follows moral (without question) he says \u201cI can't fix the car because it's not right. You have to get a new motor.\u201d The other mechanic who lets law govern (without question) says, \u201cyou maybe, could, fix it, the law is to get a new motor.\u201d A mechanic that follows philosophy says, \u201cI can fix it, but I shouldn't because of the potential to go wrong again, not to mention it's illegal because it's unsafe.\u201d Maybe owner of the vehicle comes to the same conclusion with each person. The difference is, the choice made after developing a proper philosophy is more wise. It's more informed, and if they decide to proceed, they know the risk, and you're fully prepared. ",

            "answer_text": "Human beings have the unique ability to engage in long range planning. Consequently, we can either work on providing ourselves the best answer to the question, \"How should I live my life,\" or we can ignore the question. \"Philosophy\", a word coined by Socrates or Plato, was intended by them to mean the loving pursuit of genuine wisdom. In other words, Philosophy is the systematic search for the best answer to the question, \"How should I live my life\" undertaken with the passion that arises when one understands that a good answer to this question is the cornerstone of a well lived life: a good life. Understood in this way, a person engaged in Philosophy experiences it in a way that is similar to the joy of eating a highly nutritious and delicious meal. Thanks to the variety of issues, it is a joy that never grows old. It is also like the joy of designing and building a wonderful home. This home being designed is the one called \"mind\". It is the home we spend our entire lives in. It is a joy that is not only artistic, and intellectual, but also social, because it turns out that good answers to the question, \"How should I live my life\" are fully entertained with good answers to the question, \"How should we live our lives together.\" A philosophical life is any life in which the systematic pursuit of good answers to these questions has risen to a place of prominence. At the heart of the philosophical life is a paradox. To systematically pursue our two leading questions, we need to answer the question, \"How should we understand the word \"should\"? It would seem that we must already have the answer to the question in order to develop an answer it. But, that would seem to mean that any answer would be tainted by errors in our pre-existing assumptions about what \"should\" should mean. The resolution of this paradox is to be found in what has been called \"dialectic\". Our idea of \"should\" is not frozen. It develops. We are creators designing the basic terms of our life (like our idea of \"should\") based on situations we have been given. Included in those situations are prior understandings of \"should\". Those prior understandings do not imprison us, but guide us toward better, even more useful, understandings. Thus, the idea \"should\" has a history. We have been creatively negotiating with each other about it from the dawn of history, and we have succeeded in developing a more useful concept. One proof of our success can be found in the extraordinary reduction in violence that has occurred during human history which has been documented by Steven Pinker in The Better Angels of our Nature. Philosophy is not properly understood as a limited enterprise or academic discipline. It is an all encompassing way of organizing life through an at least partially reflective project of planning how to make our human lives better. It draws on all of the academic disciplines, not only the one we call \"Philosophy\". ",

Arthur asks him what he does for a living he answers, \u201cStand up philosopher.\u201d She writes down, \u201cBull Shitter.\u201d Philosophy talks a good deal about hypothetical situations but never seems to come to a conclusion. It\u2019s like talking to my attorney or accountant. I ask a question and I get a number of choices but in the end I have to choose one. And no philosophy seems to present a system in actual operation but you have to borrow from others to form a system you can agree with. For instance I like Free Market Capitalism but realize it needs some degree of regulation or we\u2019d be eating bread made with a measure of sawdust mixed into the dough. Socialism produces nothing and ends up eating all the capital until it\u2019s bankrupt. Libertarianism tends to selfishness with the individual being a power unto himself and incapable of existing in a society. So I think the only solution is an amalgam of the three to form a fourth system that tries to avoid the extremes. I believe it was Hegel who posited that theses produce antitheses which produce more theses infinitely. And the bullshitting continues. ",
