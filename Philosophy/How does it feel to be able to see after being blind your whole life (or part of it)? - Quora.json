I could still hear (thank goodness) but all I could see is if it was dark or light.If the doctor/nurse didn't talk to me I had NO clue what was going on. I'm 27 now (I was 19 then) and I'm still afraid of the dark. Being able to see again was AMAZING.  ",

Second, they are definitely that they can be more mobile. Lastly, they love their loved ones.  BTW, people with total blindness from birth are not likely to see like sighted people. Their cortical cells are not present for even retinal implants to work well. ",
