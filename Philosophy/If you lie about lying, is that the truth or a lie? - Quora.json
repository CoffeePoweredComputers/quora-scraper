            "answer_text": "I remembered this from an original Star Trek episode. In philosophy and logic, the classical liar paradox or liar's paradox is the statement of a liar who states that they are lying: for instance, declaring that \"I am lying\" or \"everything I say is false\". If they are indeed lying, they are telling the truth, which means they are lying. In \"this sentence is a lie\" the paradox is strengthened in order to make it amenable to more rigorous logical analysis. It is still generally called the \"liar paradox\" although abstraction is made precisely from the liar themself. Trying to assign to this statement, the strengthened liar, a classical binary truth value leads to a contradiction. If \"this sentence is false\" is true, then the sentence is false, but if the sentence states that it is false, and it is false, then it must be true, and so on. ",

            "answer_text": "Lets break the concept down: to lie about telling a lie means to claim to have told the truth and is therefor a lie because the end result is misinformation. To lie about the content of a previous lie in order to correct it along the lines of \u201c2+2=5\u201d then later \u201cI said 2+2=4\u201d is a lie that contains a fact, which is allowed in the structure of deception without invalidating the dishonesty so therefor is also a lie. If the phrasing is a little more vague like \u201cOh I always said it was somewhere around 4\u201d that is not a lie even though it is a deliberate framing of the truth in a manner that does not align with the past as well as it might. Not a lie, but very close. For whatever reason you wanted to know this, I hope it helps. ",
