            "answer_text": "This is a controversial position of mine but I support it regardless: Absolutely, the sooner the better. Freedom of speech is the notion that we can say whatever we please without fear of government repression and on paper this sounds like a great idea, don\u2019t get me wrong. One can make the argument that freedom is something we all strive for as it\u2019s part of our nature. However this doesn\u2019t change the f!act that humans are not able to handle such a thing. At least in my view. I feel these two incidents will best illustrate my viewpoint: PizzagateDuring the 2016 US Presidential Elections, a conspiracy theory was spread online and became known as Pizzagate. The theory was quite simple, American politician Hilary Clinton along with other high ranking members of her party, the Democrats, were engaging in sex with kidnapped children in restaurants owned by Comet Ping Pong. To many this may sound strange and outlandish but to large sectors of the American population, it came to be accepted as fact this even resulted in a shooting at Comet Ping Pong. 'Pizzagate' conspiracy theorist gets four years in prison  Edgar Welch being arrested after he opened fire in Comet Ping Pong demanding he search the restaurant for the child sex slaves. This is my point. Freedom of Speech allowed people to come up with this drivel, it then permitted popular news outlets to report this drivel as if it was fact. Infowars' Alex Jones apologizes for pushing 'Pizzagate' conspiracy theory Which led to people believing it was fact and nearly cost people their lives, it\u2019s a stroke of good fortune that Welch did not decide to massacre everybody on sight. Nor is it just conspiracy theories that Freedom of Speech permits, it also permits false statistics inciting hatred and racial strife. Take this:  Here\u2019s a fun tidbit, there is no FBI bureau in San Francisco! Yet some American decided to make up those statistics to promote the belief that Black Americans are violent and are an inferior race. The worst part is that a large number of Americans endorsed this, including prominent ones:  Trump's Pants on Fire tweet that blacks killed 81% of white homicide victims This is Freedom of Speech in action and why I consider it dangerous. Freedom of Speech removes all restraints on the innate desire of humans to be intolerant and violent towards those they perceive to be is different. I can start promoting racial supremacy and be protected by Freedom of Speech.I can start promoting genocide and be protected by Freedom of Speech.A bedrock principle of U.S. jurisprudence is that the First Amendment allows for hate speech, including that which denigrates people on the basis of their race, gender or sexual orientation. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2011 that the Westboro Baptist Church, known for its vitriolic \u201cGod Hates Fags\u201d anti-gay campaign, could not be prevented from picketing at military funerals. In the landmark 1969 case Brandenburg v. Ohio, the high court upheld the free speech rights of a Ku Klux Klan member. \u201cThe vast majority of speech that could be deemed hateful is protected by the First Amendment,\u201d said Will Creeley, a lawyer with the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a free-speech watchdog group. Factbox: When can free speech be restricted in the United States? This is why I believe that abolishing such a thing is good and beneficial, there should be restraints on speech. Take Jason Richwhine, an American scholar who wrote that non-Whites are inherently inferior due to their lesser intellect. Why Did Harvard Give a PhD for a Discredited Approach to Race and IQ? American freedom of speech allows him to roam around the country preaching White Superiority and acquiring a following.  Jason Richwine being interviewed on national television despite his racist views And I understand why many people feel this way, yes Richwine is a racist but does this mean he deserves to be in a prison cell for his views? This I cannot answer, but I still find it abhorrent that he gets to peddle his nonsense and profit off racism while giving it an \u201cintellectual\u201d face. This is why I think Freedom of Speech is wrong. ",

The thing is everybody should be allowed to voice their opinion,if your not happy about that opinion then you explain to the person who made it why and that's called a discussion,that's how things get sorted,they might not change their opinion but at least both sides are aware of the others stance and understands why. What is happening now though is the left and the SJWs will not discuss,they will call you a nazi,homophobe or whatever and then shout you down and talk over you,usually using what their social studies Tutor has told them.You cannot discuss with these people as they are brainwashed,you sec it all over you tube as they promote there agenda and yet will call you a fascist whilst not letting you get your point across,who's the fascist there?
