            "answer_text": "Firstly, let me tell you that I can explain you something about it, but for a complete knowing of this argument you should read the books that this incredible philosopher wrote on ethic. Aristotle had a very positive view of friendship, he considered it to be almost a virtue, he thought that every living human had to have friends if he wanted to live an enjoyable life. In his view of friendship he divided it in three different types: the first and the most important kind of friendship is the one based on the virtue of the two friends, the bond the connects the two friends is quite strong and certainly very hard to break; however because there are few virtuous people there will be few friendships of this kind. The other form of friendship is the one based on pleasure, more specifically the pleasure that a friend gives to the other. In other terms we can say that the bond between the two friends is only based on pleasure. This kind of friendship is very frail and it lasts only for a short period of time. Usually it belongs to young people. The last form of friendship is completely built on the utility of a friend for the other, this type is usually typical of old people. As for the second one, the relationship is frail and easy to break. Some other important aspects: For Aristotle it\u2019s better to have few friends than many, for the reason exposed in the fourth and fifth line of the first paragraph. To be really defined as a friend of someone you have to live with him/her for a period of time. A friendship between two equals in age is ( usually ) going to be more stable than one between two non peers. Surely i forgot something, but I hope i\u2019ve helped you. ",

            "answer_text": "Aristotle is much too verbose for modern readers. In a nutshell close friendships are usually formed between two humans with a similar morality or set of ethical principles, many common interests, approximately the same educational level and age, and similar goals in life. Yes, other friendships can be formed out of necessity or for networking purposes but they are usually not close friendships. ",
