            "answer_text": "The traditional answer is parentage and where you are born. For if your parents are from America but you are bon overseas you can claim American citizenship. In fact, if an American male goes overseas and has a fling with a foreigner and the baby is raised entirely outside of the United States the child can claim American citizenship when they turn eighteen. (I leave out the reverse case as most American women generally return to America, sooner or later, and quite often before the baby is born.\u201d Though maybe a better answer should be loyalty. Do those who were born here, deserve to be treated as citizens if they have no loyalty to this nation? Of course there is a flaw with my definition too, for what if those who seem to be loyal to our nation are the ones who are dragging it down while those who oppose them are actually more loyal to the core values of my nation than those who merely sound patriotic? In countries like Nazi Germany to be though of as a traitor was a complement. Who is loyal to our ideals of truth, justice and the democratic process, and whose only real goals are power? Let me give you a hint: Today, some do not even believe that truth exists, why, because they lie so much that they could not stand themselves without imagining that their opponents are equally corrupt.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I don\u2019t think there is a formal definition\u2014 or if there is, it probably differs slightly from country to country. I guess in the end, it is ultimately determined by what passport or passports one holds. Certainly, I have heard of people holding dual nationality. I remember many years ago, when I applied to join the Canadian Army, I was asked on a form for my Nationality and I put Canadian. I was told that there was no such thing. I had to put British. I think what they were really asking was my ethnicity. This was in the mid-60\u2019s. A lot has changed since then. ",
