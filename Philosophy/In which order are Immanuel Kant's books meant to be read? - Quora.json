            "answer_text": "There is no order intended by Kant. Since 1781 there are several changes in his ideas, why for example two more Critiques became necessary. His book on religion (1793) had a huge impact on the ideas of German Idealism. If it\u2019s is your interest, start reading here. This book is also important for his ethics, for it places Kantian ethical rigor in its perspective. ",
