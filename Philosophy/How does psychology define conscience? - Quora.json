            "answer_text": "The definition of conscience has always been the central matter of Psychology, because it bears a paradox: to become a science, Psychology must acknowledge that the conscience, the mind, can not cause behaviours, but is instead a furher byproduct of behaviours, as Skinner famously put it; this acknowledgement can not redund in a methodological refraining from introspection, as there are behaviours that can only be preceived and described by the person themselves, be it a headache or a love investment or a hate feeling - and this was the error by Watson that Skinner points out. So there are many antimentalist and externalistic definitions of conscience: the first one was made by Freud (and that is why that Skinner says that Freud\u2019s formulation of the unconscious garanteed the scientificization of whole Psychology, in the same sense that the formalization of field force by Newton garanteed the scientificization of Physics) - all psychic system is unconscious (not subconscious, unconscious - and this precision matters!), and the conscience is a formation of the unconscious (a sort of a symptom to which lacks a body);the definition of Radical Behaviorism, debunking the suposed \u201cinaccessibility of the conscience\u201d of the Methodological Behaviourism, and taking part in the Freudian Revolution, is that conscience is the capacity of the person to self-observate and comunicate private intern behaviours to others, externalizing it (you see in Psychoanalysis a symptom is a social lace, and so conscience is a social lace too and this definition by Skinner contemplate that);the definition by the Sovietic School of Lev Seminovich Vigotsky which rellies heavily in Karl Marx and his dialectical-historical materialism, in which conscience is the material register of the development of tecnologies by the man - like wrinting, tools, numbers, songs, etc - as you see, here again the concept is extremely external and antimentalist.I suggest you reading some classical texts about that matter: Freud\u2019s metapsychological articles The Unconscious and Repressment as much as his Introductory Lectures and New Intruductory Lectures (which are neither introductory nor lectures, by the way..) and also his Five Lessons on Psychoanalysis that he gave in Brown University, USA;Buhurs Frederich Skinner\u2019s About Behaviourism and Beyond Freedom and Dignity;Vigotsky & Alexander Luria\u2019s Studies on the history of human behaviour: the ape, the primitive men and the child.",
