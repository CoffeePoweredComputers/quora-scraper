            "answer_text": "Almost every Upanishad is a unique piece of spiritual science and a simple version of the hidden wisdom of Vedas, the oldest surviving scriptures of the world. As a Spiritual Scientist, let me take the question as a golden opportunity to represent the real scientific beauty of Vedas, Upanishads, Brahm Sutra, Holy Gita, Tantra Vidya, and Yogasutra in an integrated and sequential form of Akhand Sutra, Integrating Thread of Nature. According to Akhand Sutra, the sequence could be, Perfect and Integrated Universal Consciousness: 1. Brhad-Aranyaka Upanishad (V.1.1), \u201cPurnam Adah, purnam idam, purnai purnam udacyate, Purnasya purnam addaya purnam evavasisyate\u201d That is full; this is full, from fullness proceeds fullness. If we take away fullness from fullness, fullness still remains. It means that every manifestation of Nature is indestructible, in-exhaustible, irreducible, perfect, vast, and complete. It means that the sum of everything in the universe is constant. Purnam could also be represented as Akhand, which means integration and integrated. This above verse made me realize the real meaning and significance of the following very important spiritual statements of Vedas and Upanishads, 1. \u201cTat-Tvam-Asi\u201d means that everything (Tvam) in the universe is identical (Asi). 2. \u201cEko-ham-bahusayam\u201d means that every object of Nature has come from one source. 3. \u201cAham-Brahmasmi\u201d means that every human being is created with a divine design. The Essence: A perfect, single, and ultimate Divine Constant of Nature is hidden in the above verses. The Origin and Unmanifested Source: Primordial Space (Akash) According to Akhand Sutra, the ultimate, formless, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and all-pervasive Universal Consciousness is called Nirakar-Nirgun-Brahman (God-Nature-Paramatma) and it is the source of everything in the universe and Nature. Before the Creation of Cosmos: Darkness and Inertia (Tamas) Vedas: Before the creation of the cosmos, the Primordial Cosmos (Akash) was filled with darkness (Andhakar) and everything in the cosmos was in a state of inertia (Tamas). Brhad-Aranyaka Upanishad (I.2.1), \u201cNaivecha Kimcanagra Asit, Mrityunaivedam Avrtam Asit!\u201d There was nothing in the Primordial Space in the beginning. It was indeed covered by death (Mrityu). The verse reinforces the above message of Vedas. The concept of Blackhole of Dark matter is also hidden in the verse. Now, let us contemplate on the above concepts. Can anything come out of nothing? Nothing can come out of nothing. This is an eternal Law of Nature. Hence, there was something in the Primordial Space, which was in a state of darkness, inertia, and death. What was it? A New Hypothesis: Isomers of Neon-21 The above three profound statements of Vedas and Upanishads made me recognize, conceive, and reveal that the Primordial Space was filled with the isomers of Neon-21. Now, let us study, understand, appreciate, and apply the concept of the above hypothesis. Neon element is an inert matter. Neon forms a stable noble gas. The isomers of Neon-21 contain 10 protons, 11 neutrons, and 10 electrons. Neon is smaller than the preceeding elements of the second period of the Periodic Table. The ten electrons of Neon-21 are fully focused towards the center (protons and neutrons). As a result, there is darkness outside. The Scientific Proof: Neon Sign Boards do not exhibit any light until they are charged with electricity. The Essence: The ancient Indian description of the inherent attributes of the Soul (Atma-Atman) and the inert matter, like Helium Atoms or Neon Atoms is identical in every way. Is the phonetic resemblance of Atom and Atma a mere coincidence? Now, let us comprehend the science of five elements of Nature. The First Manifestation: Five Basic Elements \u2013 Panch-Bhutas The energy, after losing heat, produced the five elements (Panch-Bhuta). The five elements are made of the following, 1. Akash-Bhuta: Quintessence. It is responsible for sound vibrations and hearing. 2. Vayu-Bhuta: Air Element. It is responsible for touch sensation. 3. Agni-Bhuta: Fire Element. It is responsible for heat, light vibrations, and vision. 4. Apa-Bhuta: Water Element. It is responsible for the liquid taste sensation. 5. Prithvi-Bhuta: Earth. It is responsible for smelling sensation. The First Representation: Maha Brahmand \u2013 Macrocosmic Universe. The Spiral Galaxy of Milky Way is an integral part of Maha Brahmand, the Greater Universe. The Second Manifestation: The Microcosmic Universe: Solar system \u2013 Brahmand: Our Solar system is considered the microcosmic representation of the macrocosmic universe. Now, let us comprehend the science of three major manifestations of Nature. Brhad-Aranyaka Upanishad (I.5.16), \u201cAtha trayo vaha lokah, manusya-lokah, pitr-lokah, deva-lokah iti\u201d \u201cLet there be three worlds, the world of humans (earth), the world of ancestors (intermediate sphere), and the world of gods (heaven)\u201d. It means that our Solar system is made of three parts; earth, atmosphere, and planets. It also means that every created object of Nature is made of the three major parts. The Scientific Proof: Three parts of the Cell. Under the compound microscope, we see only three parts of the cell; cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. The Essence: The three debts of human birth and life in the service of earth, ancestors and divine beings and the three integral components of Divyank, the Divine Constant, are reflected in the verse. Now, let us explore, enumerate, and explain another important Upanishad. Chandogya Upanishad (VIII.7.1), \u201cYa atma apahata-papma vijaro vimrtyur visoko vijighasto'pipasah satya-kamah satya-samkalpa, so'nvestavyah, so vijijnanasi-tavyah sa sarvams ca lokan apnoti sarvams ca Kaman, yas tam atmanam anuvidya vijnati; iti ha prajapatir uvaca\u201d. \u201cSelf, which is free from evil, free from old age, free from death, free from grief, free from hunger, and free from thirst, and whose desire is real, whose thought is real, that Self should be sought, desired, and understood. A person, who knows and understands that Self, obtains all worlds and all desires\u201d. This is the essence of the spiritual preaching of Prajapati (The Lord of Public-Brahma). Indra (King of Gods) and Virochana (King of Demons), who heard Prajapati giving the above sermon, were fully impressed with his discourse. Indra and Virochana were curious and wanted to learn more about the Self. Hence, they approached Prajapati. Prajapati asked them to become students and stay in his hermit (ashram) as celibates (Brahmacharis) for thirty-two years. In the end, Prajapati explained to them about the importance of physical health, wealth, and the waking (Jagrat) consciousness. Both were impressed and happily left for their respective abodes. Virochana was fully satisfied. He, in turn, explained the beauty and importance of physical health, abundance of wealth, and gratification of physical desires and pleasures to the demons. In fact, this advice is strictly followed by the majority of people even today. Indra doubted the eternal beauty of the perishable body and came back. Indra was asked to stay in hermit for another thirty-two years. He was then taught about the dreaming (Swapna) consciousness. He was impressed and went away but before reaching heaven, he realized the futility of dreaming consciousness too. He returned. Indra was asked to stay for another thirty-two years. He was then taught about the deep-sleep (Sisupta) consciousness. Indra went with tranquil heart and mind but shortly realized that in this state of deep sleep consciousness he is not aware of \u201cHis True Self\u201d. He came back again. Then Prajapati asked him to live with him for just five years. Before the end of five years, Prajapati explained the nature of Soul, which is beyond dualities and death, and reaches the highest state of enlightenment in his own True form, the Supreme consciousness, called Turiya, which is eternally in tune with the Ultimate Soul/Self. What is the hidden Wisdom? The total time spent by Indra is 101 years (32+32+32+5=101). Let us consider that thirty-two years are equal to seven parts. Then, one part will be equal to 4.57 (32/7=4.57) years. I suppose, 4.57 years were expressed as 5 years, for convenience. The Essence: Pi (22/7): The three phases of thirty-two years each represent 21 (3x7) parts. The last phase of 5 years represents the twenty-second part. The total period of 101 years represents the numeral value of Pi (22/7). 1. The number, 22/7 represents Pi, one of the most important natural mathematical concepts. 2. Pi is used to calculate the circumference of a circle, the symbol of space (Akash). Chandogya Upanishad (II.10.5), \u201cEka-Vimsaty Adityam Apnoti, Eka-Vimso Va Ito'sav Adityo!\u201d 21 (Eka-vimsaty) stages of the Solar system can be measured with 21 steps. The Essence: It means that the three major parts of the Solar system are made of 21 parts. Chandogya Upanishad (II.10.5), \u201cDva-vimsena param adityaj jayate; tan nakam, tad visokam!!\u201d With 22 (Dva-vimsena) steps, one conquers the world beyond the Sun, where there is absolute bliss without any sorrow. The Scientific Message \u2013 The First Stage of Creation \u2013 22/21: During the first stage of creation, the 21 parts of the cell with the division of one centriole into two centrioles and the total number of parts of the cell become 22 parts. Chandogya Upanishad (II.10.6), \u201cApnoti Hadityasya Jayam, Paro Hasyaditya-Jayati Jayo Bhavati, ya Etad Evam Vidvan Atma-Sammitam Ati-Mrityu Sapta-Vidham Samopaste, Sampaste\u201d. Knowing this, the wise and enlightened Soul obtains an eternal victory over the Sun. He obtains still higher victory over death (Atimrityu) when he meditates on the sevenfold (Sapta) knowledge (Vidham). This verse implies that there are seven parts in every aspect of Nature. The Essence: The Significance of Number Seven. According to Akhand Sutra, the three independent parts of the Solar system, namely, the earth, the atmosphere of earth, and heaven are also made of seven parts each. Now, let us explore, enumerate, and explain the application of number seven in Nature. Sat-Chakra-Nirupana: 7 Chakras. According to Sat-Chakra-Nirupana, there are 7 major Chakras, namely, Muladhara, Svadhisthana, Nabhi, Anahata, Visudhi, Ajna, and Sahasrara, in the human body. Maha Gayatri Mantra: 7 Maha Vyahritis. Maha Gayatri Mantra from Maha Narayani Upanishad has 7 Vyahritis, which represent the 7 Chakras of the human body. The shape of Kundalini \u2013 Pi - 22/7: According to Sat-Chakra-Nirupana, the shape of Kundalini is Trivakrit, which means that there are three-plus coils and they are represented as 22/7 or 31/7. Pi (22/7) and the First Stage of Creation (22/21): This concept reinforces that every aspect of Nature is made of 3 sub-parts. The Conclusion: For various reasons, we observe that the prime emphasis was more on the sequence of one, three, seven, twenty-one, and twenty-two numbers in the ancient Indian documents. Now, let us do contemplative meditation on one important section of Aitreya Upanishad. Aitareya Upanishad (Chapter 1): The Essence: 1. In the beginning, there was only Self (Atma) and nothing else in the world. 2. The Self-created three worlds; the heaven, atmosphere and the earth. 3. From the water, the Self drew forth Lok-Palan, the Guardian of the world or Cosmic Person. 4. The Self carved the Mouth, Nostrils, Eyes, Ears, Skin, Heart, Navel and the reproductive organ in the Cosmic Person. 5. The Self-created food for the Cosmic Person from the Primordial Ocean water. 6. Then, the Cosmic Person was subjected to hunger and thirst. 7. The Cosmic Person sought the food with Speech (Mouth), Breath (Nostrils), Sight (Eyes), Hearing (Ears), Touch (Skin), Mind (Heart) and the reproductive organ respectively. 8. The Cosmic Person was unable to catch the food with the above seven vital organs and eat. 9. There is absolutely no confusion up to this stage of the story. 10. The other associated knowledge has also been explained in the light of modern sciences. Aitareya Upanishad (I.3.10), \u201cTad Apanenajidghrksat, Tad Avayat!\u201d Then, the cosmic person sought to seize it (the food) by the Apana, the out-breath/the outlet and he was successful in getting the food. The Essence: It means that the food was received through Apana, an outlet. How can we receive food through an outlet? The commentators of Aitreya Upanishad have acknowledged their failure to explain the above verse. No wonder, the above verse is considered one of the greatest mysteries of Upanishads. As a result, many people call Vedas and Upanishads as blabbering of an infancy civilization. To comprehend the hidden wisdom of Vedas and Upanishads, we have to be in tune with the Universal Consciousness and the consciousness of the Sages, who compiled and composed Vedas and Upanishads. Now, let us comprehend the real meaning of Apana, the outlet. Panch-Pranas: 1. Prana-Prana: It is associated with the chest, inspiration, intake of oxygen and expiration, the expulsion of carbon dioxide gas. 2. Samana-Prana: It is associated with the ingestion, digestion, absorption, and assimilation of nutrients, water, and electrolytes. 3. Udana-Prana: It is associated with the supply of oxygenated blood to the head, neck and the brain for intellectual purposes. 4. Vyana-Prana: It is associated with the skin and bio-plasmic body (Aura) around the physical body. It is responsible for integrated health. 5. Apana-Prana: It is associated with the expulsion of sperms, menstrual flow, delivery, babies, gases, fecal matter, and urine. Now, let us decode the underlying question and eliminate confusion. Big Question! How can an outlet become an inlet and seize the food? I am convinced that the translators thought that the Sage Aitreya was talking about the spontaneous creation of the first human being as Cosmic Person. In reality, the Sage Aitreya is talking of a growing fetus in the mother\u2019s womb. Let us change the perspective and see a new picture. New Perspective: 1. The sea becomes the amniotic fluid and the Cosmic Person a fetus. 2. For the fetus, the food and other essential requirements come from the mother through the umbilical cord attached to the navel of the fetus 3. The expulsion and elimination of the waste products of the fetus are also through the same umbilical cord. 4. Both, inlet/artery and outlet/vein are present in the umbilical cord. The Vedas and Upanishads are filled with such mysterious stories. Conclusion: The ancient Indian Sages were in tune with the Universal Consciousness. The Sages were extremely intuitive and intelligent. Now, let me add another dimension to Vedas and Upanishads. Honest Admission and Acknowledgment: As a Spiritual Scientist, I am fully convinced that the prime objective of the human birth, life, breath, brain, senses, mind, and consciousness is to unite with the ultimate, formless, omniscient, omnipotent, omnipresent, and all-pervasive Universal Consciousness called Nirakar-Nirgun-Brahma (God-Nature-Paramatma), the source of the perfect and most beautiful objects of the universe and Nature. I am glad that with the study of Vedas and Upanishads, regular practice of the ten stages of Akhand Yoga, and conscientious chanting of Akhand Gayatri Mantra, I was able to recognize, perceive, conceive, and reveal Divyank, the Divine Constant, with which the perfect and most beautiful objects of the universe and Nature are designed and created for the first time in the history of mankind. Divyank, the Divine Constant, represents the core of the Universal Consciousness. Divyank is represented as (22/21)10.34419)=1.618034. 1. The number, 22/21 represents the first stage of creation (Brahma Consciousness). The number was recognized, conceived, and perceived by decoding the stories of Vedas, Upanishads, and Puranas, which are attributed to the fundamental nature of Lord Brahma. The number, 22/21 is equal to one third the value of Pi (22/7). This concept was perceived from the study of Sat-Chakra-Nirupana, the ancient book of Tantra and Kundalini Yoga. According to Tantra, the sleeping Kundalini is \u201cTrivakarit\u201d, which means three-plus coils. \u201cTrivakarit\u201d represents the natural concept of Pi, 22/7 or 3 and one-seventh. Note: 22/21, the first part of Divyank, is one-third the value of Pi (22/7). Is it a mere coincidence or an integral part of the Ultimate Divine Design of Nature? Brahma Consciousness is associated with the sacral parasympathetic nervous system. 2. The number, 10, represents the ten stages of development (Vishnu Consciousness). This concept was perceived by recognizing the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu. According to Vedas and Upanishads, there are ten inherent dimensions of Nature. According to Akhand Sutra, there are ten major Chakras in the human body. These Chakras are associated with the ten major endocrine glands, the ten major autonomic nervous system ganglia, and the ten planets of the Solar system. The above absolute wisdom of the ten inherent centers of consciousness was perceived with the practice of Kundalini Yoga. Vishnu Consciousness is primarily associated with the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is associated with 14 segments of the spinal cord (first thoracic to second lumbar segments). There are 28 preganglionic nerve fibers of the sympathetic nervous system. There are 22 ganglia in the left (Ida-Nadi) and right (Pingala-Nadi) paravertebral sympathetic chain. The left and right chains unite in the bottom to form Ganglion-Impar or coccygeal ganglion. As a result, there are 45 ganglia of the paravertebral sympathetic chains. Divyank Ratio: 45/28=1.618. Is this a mere coincidence? 3. The five digits, 0.34419, represent the last stage of maturation (Shiva Consciousness). Shiva, Lord of Dissolution and Regeneration, is associated with the five elements of Nature. Incidentally, the five digits, 0.34419, add up the number 21, the first part of Divyank. This fact shows and proves that Lord Shiva represents Dissolution and Regeneration stages. Shiva Consciousness is associated with the cranial parasympathetic nervous system and the higher centers of consciousness in the brain. 4. The sum, 1.618034 represents the most economical algorithm of Nature. 5. It also represents the most approximate decimal value of the Golden Ratio. 6. Divyank can be called \u201cThe Divine Mother of the Golden Ratio\u201d. Divyank Ratio: 61.8034% and 38.1966%. 1. The square of 61.8034 % is equal to 3881.966, which is equal to a hundred times the value of 38.1966%. 2. This precision is not observed in the known Golden Ratio (1.61803397\u2026). 3. The Golden Ratio, with never-ending infinite numbers of confusing digits, is derived with the man-made mathematical formula, is considered one of the greatest discoveries of the modern science. 4. The known Golden Ratio fails to demystify the mysteries of the universe and Nature. 5. Divyank Ratio demystifies the most of the unresolved mysteries of the universe and Nature. Divyank Sequence: 61.8034 \u2013 100.00 \u2013 161.8034 \u2013 261.8034 and so on and so forth. 1. This precision is not observed in the known Fibonacci sequence, another discovery of modern science. 2. Divyank Sequence represents the genuine Divine Infinity. 3. Divyank Sequence does not merge, converge, or diverge at any stage. The Scientific Proof of Divyank: 1. The Formation of Red Blood Cells: The irregular and spherical pluripotent hemopoietic stem cells, which lead to the formation of the mature red blood cells, are 21 microns in size and have a volume of 900 cubic microns. The size of a pluripotent hemopoietic stem cell increases to 22 microns and then goes through the exact ten stages of development to become a concavely shaped mature red blood cell in 21 days and the volume reduces to 90 cubic microns. Note: Are 21, 22, and 10 numbers mere coincidences? 2. The Perfect Double Helix: The length of Double Helix is 21 Angstrom. Each spiral is 22 Angstrom and there are 10.34419 strands. The length and breadth are in the ratio of 38.1966% and 61.8034%. The Scientific Applications of Divyank Ratio: 1. With the absolute values of Divyank Ratio, we can easily calculate the single and most reliable value of every vital biophysical parameter of the perfect adult human anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry. 2. If we can maintain these values for life, we can curtail aging, prevent the most common ailments, and make optimum of the human birth, life, brain, mind, consciousness, and potentials. 3. With the help of Divyank, Divyank Ratio, and Divyank Sequence, we can eliminate the confusion created by the wide spectrum of values of different aspects of biophysical parameters of the body. 4. With that, we can simplify medical education, research, and treatment modules. 5. With the help of Divyank Ratio, we can lay a strong foundation for Preventive Medicine. 6. It is well known that prevention is better than a cure. 7. I am fully convinced that the perfectly healthy, wealthy, wise, and happy human society can create harmony, equilibrium, and peace in the world, the urgent need of the day. The Scientific Application of Divyank Sequence: According to Akhand Sutra, the known information about the perfect human female menstrual cycle is highly deficient. I am glad that I was able to identify and rectify the deficiencies with scientific evidence. The Essence: With the absolute wisdom of Divyank, Divyank Ratio, and Divyank Sequence, we can, 1. Decode the hidden messages of Vedas, Upanishads, and Puranas. 2. Recognize, conceive, and reveal the hidden secrets of the universe and Nature. 3. Resolve the unresolved mysteries of Nature. Now, let us contemplate on the essence of Akhand Yoga. 5. Akhand Yoga: An Integrated Form of Yoga. Patanjali Yogasutra talks of the eight limbs of Ashtanga-Yoga, namely, Yamaha, Niyama, Yogasana, Pranayam, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi. These eight stages can lead to the stoppage of fluctuations of the human body, senses, mind, consciousness, and brain and cannot give an experience of Antaryami Antaratma. Akhand Yoga talks of the ten stages (Dashang-Yoga), namely, Yamaha, Niyama, Yogasana, Pranayam, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, Samadhi, Chakra Yoga, and Antar Yoga. With Antar Yoga, the tenth stage of Akhand Yoga, we can easily have a conscious and superconscious experience of the real beauty of the Universal Consciousness of Nature. Now, let us contemplate on the essence of Tantra Vidya 6. Tantra Vidya: Sat-Chakra-Nirupana talks of the seven major Chakras, namely, Muladhara Chakra, Svadhisthana Chakra, Nabhi Chakra, Anahata Chakra, Visudhi Chakra, Ajna Chakra, and Sahasrara Chakra. With the regular practice of Akhand Yoga, I realized the presence of the ten major Chakras, namely, Muladhara Chakra, Svadhisthana Chakra, Nabhi Chakra, Manipura Chakra, Anahata Chakra, Visudhi Chakra, Ajna Chakra, Vigyan Chakra, Pragyan Chakra, and Sahasrara Chakra. I also realized the association of the ten major Chakras with the ten major endocrine glands, the ten major autonomic nervous system ganglia, and the ten planets of our Solar system for the first time. As a result, I was able to decode some of the mysteries of the ancient Indian wisdom too. 7. The Advance Neuroscience Research: The modern Neuroscientists are not aware of the precise and concise functions of the three outer layers of the neocortex of the human brain to date. With the regular practice of Akhand Yoga, I was able to explore, enumerate, and explain the actual function of the three outer layers of the neocortex of the human brain. These layers act as an antenna to the higher consciousness of the universe called Akash-Kosh, which stores the imprints of the records of the past, present, and future events of the universe. The mean frequency of Akash-Kosh, which can be equated with the ionosphere layer of the atmosphere, is between 7 and 10 cycles per second (Hertz). Any person, who can produce a predominant and coherent frequency between 7 and 10 Hertz can tap the secrets of the universe. The Single Case Study: I have demonstrated that I can produce an abundance of predominant and coherent alpha rhythm of 8.5 cycles per second (Hertz) throughout the brain with closed and open eyes. This research is first of its kind in the history of neurosciences. The results are part of my Ph.D. Degree from the University of Madras in 2001 as well as my latest book, Akhand Sutra, Integrating Thread of Nature, published in 2018. 8. Mantra Vidya: Akhand Gayatri Mantra: \u201cAUM* - Bhur, AUM*- Bhuvah, AUM* - Suvah, AUM* - Maha, AUM* - Jana, AUM* -Tapah, AUM* - Gyan, AUM*- Vigyan, AUM*o - Pragyan, AUM* - Satyam! AUM*, Tat Savitur Varenayam, Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi, Dhio Yo-nah Prachodayath!! AUM* - Bhur, AUM*- Bhuvar, AUM* - Jyotir, AUM* - Vayur, AUM* - Amaruta, AUM* -Paramatma, AUM* - Ishvara, AUM*- Surya, AUM* - Antaratma, AUM* - Jivatma, AUM*!!!\u201d Akhand Gayatri Mantra has 10 Maha Vyahritis. They activate, awaken and integrate 10 major centers (Chakras). AUM* is repeated 22 times. 9. Yantra Vidya: With Akhand Yoga, I was able to design \u201cSri Akhand\u201d, an integrated symbol. Every aspect of the human body, the Solar system, and the Universal Consciousness can be observed in the symbol, \u201cSri Akhand\u201d. It adorns the front page of my book, Akhand Sutra, and the center of Home Page of Akhand Vidyashram. The Conclusion: I am certain that the above knowledge can help every person comprehend the real scientific wisdom of Vedas and Upanishads. For detailed knowledge, please download and read Akhand Sutra from Akhand Vidyashram. The eBook is free. ",

If you haven't heard of the author yet, let me introduce you to Acharya Prashant, an IIT-IIM alumnus, Ex-Civil Services Officer and the founder of the Advait Movement. He is often invited to premier universities throughout the country, where the young minds put forth their queries regarding Career, Passion, Relationships, Fear, Love, Profession, Leadership, Goals, Ambition etc., i.e. all the fundamentals of everyday life.
