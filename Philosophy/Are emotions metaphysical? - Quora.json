            "answer_text": "By \"metaphysical\" it sounds like you mean to ask if emotions are beyond the physical body and universe, and actually part of the soul or spirit instead.  First, we need to decide what emotions are exactly.  Well, it turns out emotions are simply mental experiences.  For instance, let's say someone surprises you with a brand new car of your dreams.  First you process what you have seen and your mind determines this thing should excite you.  Then your mind sends a variety of messages to your body to excite it.  Then your body feels excitement, but interestingly enough it's only your mind that feels everything in your body, so your mind actually feels the very same excitement it just created, and the body is basically just a mirror in which the mind could experience itself.   So what's the point of that? Why would the mind spend so much time communicating with itself through the body, when it could just communicate with itself more effectively without an intermediary anyway?  Obviously the mind needs the body to experience the world around it, but why does it need the body to experience its own emotions?  Sometimes the emotion has a function, in that the body needs to get ready for a response.  For instance, if the emotion is fear because a hungry tiger is nearby, then the mind communicates with the body to ready it for flight with increased heartbeat, faster breathing, etc.  But there are so many emotions we feel in our bodies that require no action on our parts except to enjoy or dislike the emotion being experienced.  For instance, deep love is felt in the areas around the heart.  Depression has a strong feeling that radiates over virtually the entire body.  There are many other emotions we physically feel on various levels that don't require any survival action, like pride, despair, etc.  So it appears that at times the mind uses the body as a canvas upon which to express its feelings, and then responds to those feelings based in large part on how they feel in the body.  Weird huh?  You mind uses your body to feel itself.  So the emotion starts in the mind, but it doesn't really materialize into what we consider \"emotions\" until the feeling has been expressed through the body, and then analyzed by the mind again based on its experience of that emotion as sensations in the body.    So an emotion is simply a thought that must be experienced with physical sensation, before it is fully understood by the mind.  Therefore whether you consider an emotion to be spiritual rather than physical, should parallel whether you think your mind is spiritual rather than physical.  Because emotions are just a way for the mind to express, understand and experience itself.       ",

            "answer_text": "Emotions are not metaphysical. Emotions are biopsychological.  Metaphysics is a traditional branch of philosophy concerned with explaining the fundamental nature of being and the world that encompasses it, although the term is not easily defined.Traditionally, metaphysics attempts to answer two basic questions in the broadest possible terms: Ultimately, what is there?What is it like?Emotion, in everyday speech, is any relatively brief conscious experience characterized by intense mental activity and a high degree of pleasure or displeasure. Scientific discourse has drifted to other meanings and there is no consensus on a definition. You can find more information on this topic here - Emotion (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) ",

            "answer_text": "Emotion is real; metaphysics is not. Metaphysics literally means beyond-physics, i.e., supernatural. Euclid's geometry is metaphysical as Euclidean geometrical objects aren't real. You cannot find perfect circles, or dots that occupy no space, lines having no width and surfaces without thickness in nature, i.e., this reality. There is no such axiom in this reality - \"Things which equal the same thing also equal one another.\" Mathematics is metaphysical. Being metaphysical means eternal, dead, never changing. On the contrary, your emotion is real. It's the real indication of life. Life is not metaphysical or perfect, but it's real, dynamic, alive. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean by \u2018metaphysical\u2019. Emotions are definitely physiologically rooted, therefore, it has a physical basis \u2014 the body apparatus perceives and interprets something (internal or external) through the senses and the nervous system, and has a physiological and energetic reaction called \u2018emotion\u2019. Since energy is not always seen, touched, heard, smelled or tasted, then you can say that it is not entirely \u2018material\u2019 or corporeal - it is beyond the material body, it is beyond the \u2018physical\u2019. But the physical body is necessary for the experience of emotion. At least, the earthly, human body. ",
