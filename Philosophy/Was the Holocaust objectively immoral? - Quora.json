            "answer_text": "Yes. Only a deranged post modern mind would ask whether the holocaust was objectively immoral. Twenty five hundred years of philosophy from Socrates to Wittgenstein, and we\u2019re not simply at a dead end, as some would suggest -- which would be bad enough. After twenty-five centuries, we seem to be right back where we started. But unfortunately, we don't seem to be back among the Presocratics like Thales and Anaximander, or Heraclitus and Parmenides, Pythagoras, Zeno or Empedocles, men who used their ability to reason as they struggled to understand the essence of the universe. These men understood that the truth could be extremely elusive, but they nonetheless never seemed to doubt its existence. Instead, we seem to be back among the Presocratic philosophers who refused to use their rhetorical skills in the pursuit of knowledge. I am referring to the sophists who specialized in language, who taught the art of rhetoric for a fee but never spent much time teaching virtue. These were the men who taught rhetoric because they believed it was a device that could be used in the political arena, and in democratic Athens they viewed it as a path to power. These men valued skepticism, they questioned Greek traditions, they doubted the existence of objective truths and moral absolutes, and they believed as Protagoras famously stated that \u201cMan was the measure of all things.\u201d The holocaust was objectively immoral. And it was objectively immoral regardless of whether certain evil individuals genuinely thought it was the right thing to do. And it would have been objectively immoral even if every person on the planet thought it was the right thing to do -- including the victims, had they, hypothetically, been brainwashed into yearning for their own deaths. And if anyone needs this explained to them, they should look for another answer. This is where I draw my line. I refuse to explain why genocide is wrong. The postmodern moral and epistemological relativism which protects these questions from the revulsion that all decent, mentally healthy people with a fair amount of common sense would otherwise feel reminded me of the absence of any concern for truth and virtue displayed by certain ancient Greek sophists who taught rhetoric for a fee.

            "answer_text": "Did the Holocaust cause suffering beyond calculation? Yes, it did. Did it do so unnecessarily, to no point? Yes, it did. Was it immoral? Yes, beyond calculation. Is this a subjective judgment? No, not in the least. Let\u2019s take a much simpler example. Hang your thumb on the desktop, take a hammer, and bash it really hard. Does it hurt? Yes. Is the pain a bad thing? Yes, very bad. Is that judgment, that the pain is a bad thing, subjective in any way? No, of course not. The pain is a bad thing, period. And here is the proof: If a bystander says no, your pain is not a bad thing, he is clearly mistaken. It is in fact a bad thing, and as those words \u201cin fact\u201d imply, this is an objective matter. Now suppose that someone bashes your thumb in the same way, just for the fun of it, on a lark. Is that immoral? Yes, of course, in that he has inflicted severe pain on you unnecessarily. Is it immoral objectively? Yes, of course, in that your pain is a bad thing objectively. The same reasoning, however, applies to the incomparably vaster example of the Holocaust. Was the Holocaust objectively immoral, then? Yes, certainly. Technical postscript: The difficulty here is that most people do not yet understand that consciousness is a physical phenomenon. Even philosophers who agree that suffering is intrinsically bad almost always add that it is impossible to say why it is bad, or to prove it. But this is a mistake, and a major one. Suffering in any given case consists of neural activity in the brain. There is no more to it than that neural activity, and that neural activity is bad in that it has a certain physical configuration. To behold that physical configuration on the screen of a brain monitor is to behold the face of evil, if you will. And needless to say, the fact that the neural activity that constitutes your suffering has that configuration is entirely objective. ",
