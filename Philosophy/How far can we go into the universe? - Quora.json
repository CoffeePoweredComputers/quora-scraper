            "answer_text": "You can travel forever (even at the speed of light) and never reach any ending. The reason is shown below: Just look at these cross-sections of the Universe (according to the Hypergeometrical Universe Theory - HU):  Here you can see us at position A, looking at a galaxy at position C when the Universe was 8 Billion Years Old. Each circle corresponds to points along ANY direction in the Sky\u2026 ANY. This means the the cross-section is the cross-section of a lightspeed expanding hyperspherical Universe. To understand that, just reduce dimensionality once as in: Our 3D Universe is located on the Surface of a lightspeed expanding Sphere. Under those circumstances, cross-sections of the Universe would look like CIRCLES. As you know, a circle has no edge, or end. SHORT ANSWER: If we are traveling (surfing) a lightspeed expanding shockwave, as you travel, the wave radius increases, so unless you can travel faster than the radius increases, your angle will never change and you will never be able to go around the circle. ############################################################# Despite of having no edge, it has structure since any fluctuations (Neutronium Acoustic Oscillations) would result in the seeding of Galaxies. Those fluctuations would be called Hyperspherical because they would be seem as modulations on the angle Alpha above. Notice that any density fluctuation along alpha maps to fluctuations along DISTANCE in the outermost circle. The outermost circle maps to our CURRENT (Instantaneous) UNIVERSE. HU has the means to project Galaxy on position C, into the outermost circle. The reason for that is that HU maps motion to the deformation of the local metric.  The Universe is like a hyperspherical wave that we surf on it. If the Fabric of Space is twisted to the left, we will go to the left. If the Fabric of Space is relaxed, we will only move RADIALLY. That is how HU projects the motion of Galaxy at position C to position d in the CURRENT UNIVERSE. Once you have all 1.3 Million Galaxies from the SDSS BOSS Dataset mapped into the CURRENT UNIVERSE we can finally see what is happening. SDSS is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a robotic telescope that characterized 1.3 million celestial objects in the last 10 years. Once you have the CURRENT UNIVERSE galaxy positions, you can make a MAP.  You can see an edge. That edge corresponds to a high galaxy density and it is located AROUND us at 30% of the radius of the Universe. This is evidence that the Universe is exactly what HU states it is - a lightspeed expanding hyperspherical hypersurface. Once you plot the same data in Celestial Coordinates (spherical coordinates) and look perpendicularly to the angular space, you see these amazing images:  Here you can see the Neutronium Acoustic Oscillations (NAO \u2014 SDSS scientists prefer the pronunciation NOOooooooo because they had the data but could never create my theory)\u2026:) So, HU proves that Space is not Homogeneous as General Relativity, L-CDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter is the current Mickey Mouse Theory of Cosmology). L-CDM is based on this Hubble parametrization:  You can see ALL EVIDENCE of Dark Matter ([math]\\Omega_c[/math] stands for Cold Dark Matter), Dark Energy ([math]\\Omega_{DE}[/math] is Dark Energy). So , you can figure out that Dark Energy/Matter comes out of a FITTING to observations. That is how flimsy is the reality support to Cosmology these days. Below is the Big Pop and Many Bangs Cosmogenesis proposed by the Hypergeometrical Universe Theory. It debunks the Fiery Singularity Based Big Bang, General Relativity, Higgs Mechanism for mass creation, Standard Model of Chromodynamics\u2026etc.  ",

            "answer_text": "Other than the distance we could travel if eternally and continuously traveling into the universe at light speed, there is no smaller limit on how far we could go into the universe \u2014 if we, first, make radio contact with an alien civilization; then, second, clone ourselves as digital avatars; then, third, radio broadcast our A.I. digitars from a huge antenna toward the alien civilization\u2019s \u201cinternet cloud\u201d as self-booting programs of 0s and 1s; and finally then repeat steps one, two and three from our newly-adopted alien planetary homeworld, as many times as we want (or are permitted). But those are 3 very big ifs. If any of our 3 steps fails during Homo sapiens\u2019 next 1000 years, then it\u2019ll be just us \u201cmeat puppets\u201d hitching rides on Sol and the Milky Way \u2014 or, at best, carving out a few asteroids into generation ships to crawl to Alpha Centauri Bc-f \u2014 all at a pathetically minuscule fraction of c.

Better that we count on real-world applications of Star Trek\u2019s fictive social initiative, \u201cIDIC+Logic\u201d (i.e., plurationalism), so that our species completes its potty(-mouth) training and matures soon enough that we don\u2019t destroy ourselves before we\u2019ve created our digital (and thus light-speed traveling) progeny species.

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by \u201csee.\u201d With our naked eyes, the best you can do under the best conditions is a nearby galaxy, which for most people on a clear dark night is the Andromeda Galaxy at about 2.5 million light years. Telescopes, of course, greatly extend the distances we can see, with the best observations detecting the earliest bright objects a few hundred million years after the beginning of the universe, at something like 13.5 billion years ago (which in terms of actual distance now has more than tripled due to the ongoing expansion of the universe, as the intervening distances get stretched out). The light from these distant objects is also being stretched out so that what was visible light then is in the infrared, and what we would now detect as visible light was originally in the ultraviolet. But if \u201cseeing\u201d means detecting any wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, then the furthest we can see is the cosmic microwave background radiation that originated about 380,000 years after the beginning, when the universe had cooled down to the point that neutral atoms of hydrogen and helium could form (which is when photons could then propagate unimpeded, and the opaque universe became transparent). Beyond that, we cannot \u201csee\u201d anything unless we make use of phenomena such as gravity waves, which can give us hints as to what was going on in the first seconds of the universe\u2019s existence.
