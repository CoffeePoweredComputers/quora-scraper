            "answer_text": "Philosophers do not advocate particular moral imperatives. That is something religious and political movements do. Philosophers study the many moral imperatives that are practiced or preached and try to identify the different types of criterion that are used in judgements to justify that actions are considered to be either good or bad, right or wrong etc. Philosophers look for the, otherwise hidden, presuppositions that the cultural norms of behaviour imply. Unfortunately, some writers who having identified several kinds of moral justification such as: what furthers the human developmental fulfilment of the person doing an action; or focusing the judgement exclusively on the aggregate outcomes of an action; or whether an action complies with an accepted rule etc then feel obliged to make the judgement that there can only be allowed to be one true type of moral justification and go on to argue against the other ways in which moral judgements are justified. When a government body discusses a proposal for a new law they might be guided by imagining the outcome. When a new law exists people expect everyone to be treated absolutely fairly and be judged on whether they actually broke the law or not. From this example it is clear that we all use more than one type of basis for moral judgements and that it is not really philosophical to argue that there is only one true basis for moral judgements. Particular considerations of potential actions are best informed by taking into account the several general moral principles that can be acquired from the resources of philosophy. Free individuals cannot avoid responsibility for their judgements by mechanically following any abstract principles or systems. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a good question with an unexpected answer. First of all philosophy doesn't have moral values, you are mistaking philosophy as a more rigid ideology such as a religion. If philosophy did have a first moral rule however it would be to allow open and free debate to reach reasonable outcomes. However not all of life's big questions have final answers, some questions are ongoing and by nature change with circumstance. What philosophers would do is discuss morality. The nature of morality, what is right and what is wrong and how human beings have morals to begin with. The discussion would lead to a common agreement, however as I said there are currently many disagreements between intellectuals on the subject of morality. The moral values we live in today are associated with a term called \u201cliberalism\u201d, liberalism was developed over the last 500 years since the Renaissance with the help of many philosopher, politicians and activists. It's values consist of but aren't restricted to, women's rights, freedom of speech, religious freedom, homosexual rights, the equal rights of foreign people, open borders and many more. These are the values which craft our laws today and without them our society would be very different. ",
