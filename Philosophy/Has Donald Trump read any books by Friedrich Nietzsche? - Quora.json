            "answer_text": "I do not know the president of the USA, so I do not know what he reads or not. But what I can see is that he is the embodiment of the American dream. His wife, his home, his work, his attitudes and all he is and says\u2026 IS the American Dream. Rich, selfmade man, young and liberal voluptuous wife (one of several) that knows how to be a model for women and satisfy men - a golden house with a very (in all manners speaking) a strong business man with a taste for all the \u201cgood\u201d and what money can buy things\u2026 he even is a \u201cchristian\u201d. So the picture of the dream Hollywood man is complete. Says what he wants and does what he wants with that eternal charm that is so typically american and makes people all around love them. He reminds very much of the Wolf on Wall Street and therefor is an icon and ideal for most western men and women who all want to have the same lifestyle and not sit there with an \u201cold and ugly woman on the subway to some work that no-one wants to do\u201d, due to the good scriptwriters and the good screenwriters in this sort of movie - he is THE future man. The icon and embodiment of world leaders, their lifestyle and their mission. The new MAN. Yes, well he does not have the slave attitude or the \u201cservant\u201d attitude of Christ - but that (as Nietzsche said) is something for the weak and the stupid. And the president is neither. Nor are other world leaders that all play the same ballgame stupid. Would they be - then they would not have all the power, the \u201cglory\u201d and therefor being able and capable of swimming in dollars. The latter being easy as the printing system of dollars is on a all time high and with the right connections you just get them fresh from the printer - almost still damp. ",

Listen to his public speeches when he is reading from a teleprompter or script, he doesn\u2019t \u201cspeak\u201d the words, he \u201crecites\u201d them like a 6\u2032th grade student reading his book report for the entire class. Notice when he reads from a script he rarely lifts his eyes. Why is that? Probably due to the fact that he is incapable of reading a normal sentence, remembering it long enough to repeat it, then finding his place on the script again. This is what happens when you elect a President with Zero political experience, questionable educational background, and who questions every scientific expert when their findings shed a negative light on his actions. You get exactly what you paid for. ",

There have been instances where Trump had trouble repeating back something he read. This could indicate either poor comprehension skills, or partial illiteracy.
