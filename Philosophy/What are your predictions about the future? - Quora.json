            "answer_text": "Fandoms will eclipse religions  \u201cHave you heard the good word of our savior: Batman\u201d The idea that mere atheism will become the dominant belief is a bit silly. Atheism is not a belief, and it doesn\u2019t offer any instructions or path. What it\u2019s only good for is mocking the notion of a mythical creature being in charge of reality. Religions will become more spiritual, and worship of pop culture icons will become more common place. Everyone will [be able to] see most everyone else naked  Whether it will be from the internet having all your photos - even the ones you don\u2019t want them to have - or from people hacking people\u2019s at-home cameras, and drones - or from just a general relaxing of laws about casual nudity, everyone will be a lot more naked in the future. I\u2019ve often predicted nudists will eventually begin wanting the same provisions many of these other movements are requesting. I think Robocop and Starship Troopers was not off base with the idea of co-ed showers. That\u2019s not even counting the number of events and gatherings, such as Burning Man, which have pretty relaxed ideas about nudity and are growing in popularity. Additionally, one of the less talked about attributes about Trump\u2019s Presidency is having a nude model as a first lady, meaning future first ladies, and perhaps Trump if that pee tape is real (*hurls*) will remove the stigma in the future. Dwayne Elizondo Camacho was a porn star, after all. Driving without AI may be made illegal, or extremely restrictive.  It\u2019ll be almost impossible to obtain a license to simply drive an old car around for fun in the future. I assume it\u2019ll be like trying to get a pilot\u2019s license for a plane, where you\u2019ll have to prove you are an incredibly safe driver. There may always be an audience for race car drivers who resist AI in the same way Football and Baseball ban steroids, but there may even be divisions that are enhanced by the AI allowing them to perform even more death-defying feats. For the average individual though, simply seeking a license, they\u2019ll have to settle for the AI-assisted or AI-driven cars. It\u2019ll be a ways off until cars completely drive themselves to the point where we don\u2019t even have to pay attention, but even before then, most cars on the road will have to have a robot in them to reduce accidents. They may even have the ability to communicate with the street and traffic signals. Many people will opt to spend the majority of their time in virtual reality.  People waste their lives watching TV, movies and playing video games - and many don\u2019t feel that is wasting their lives. This will only get more prevalent when virtual reality gets into that uncanny valley of seeming completely real. There may be people who feel sufficiently marginalized in society who simply lose themselves in fantasy. This may lead to only certain people wanting to be social, particularly when a digital alternative is provided. Want to have sex with the woman of your dreams? Well now you can without the real-world rejection that woman would deliver! People won\u2019t go to the store.  No more grocery shopping, or collectible shopping, or any kind of shopping because seriously? Who likes this? It\u2019s inconvenient, particularly if what you want is gone or out of stock. People want to do things they enjoy, and this is not really a hobby. When you can pick your time of delivery and can plan and keep on a shopping list you no longer need to worry about shopping. There will probably be more brick and mortar stores devoted to more hobby-based things, but even they will have a significant online business consumer base. ",

            "answer_text": "Read most of these so I will try not to be repetitive and keep the scope to 50 years: -Automation will eliminate millions of jobs. Governments around the world will have no real choice put to implement a Universal Basic Income system for (nearly) everyone. -First openly gay man or women inaugurated as the President of the United States. -Self-driving cars. Some hiccups and increased roadside assistance. Might not be a bad thing to consider investing into now\u2026Road side assistance. -Electronic language translators become near instant, it looks just like something out of a future movie/tv show. Big boost of tourism in many areas, to where some will complain. -Some surprising things to come from Gen Z and beyond,, monogamous marriage makes a big comeback, some generically made church demoniations that are very accepting of LGBT, these will give church attendance a boost. -Big shift in what is seen as fame and glamours. Happening already but will only grow,, being a Youtube Star or social media star. It\u2019s no longer seeking to become an actor, singer, athlete to become famous, it\u2019s hoping large numbers of people find your everyday recorded life interesting. No mentioned above skills required. But as the cycle goes that will become so saturated there will be a subconscious demand for those older fields that will get fame attention. -Exodus of cashiers and most shop assistants! it's now about opening the app upon entering the store and letting your phone scan the barcode, or your cart will automatically scan it when placing it, etc. Some spikes in loss prevention..again, another investment consideration, loss prevention firms with emphasis on technolgy. -Retail extinction. Current shopping centers and malls will close and be remodeled into housing or \u201cdata farms\u201d for tech companies. Movie theaters will go the way of large bookstores, one per every town, and some successful locally owned ones. Profitable but no longer lucrative. -Chips are coming and they won\u2019t go away. No parent will ever have to wonder where their child is..Health alerts\u2026Cardiovascular issues, cancer, and others will be more early detectable than ever. -HIV becomes virtually curable. -Not only do VR games take off but VR used for educational purposes. Experiencing daily life (in the length of a day) and big moments for historical figures (Henry 8th, John Lennon, JFK, Martin Luther King JR, the great Pharaohs) through their eyes! -Students won\u2019t be writing essays in the traditional sense anymore but creating holograms of their arguments for their instructors and others to experience. -Life expenecy goes up in an alarmingly fast rate. More and more Gen Y and Zs and beyond will live to be and beyond 100! -The Gig Economy officially begins. Or the rise of Independent Contractors. Yes, resultants, airlines, retail, etc will call upon an automated system for \u201cseven cooks for the next three days\u201d for nights they know they\u2019ll be busy, no company training, benefits, etc. On the other side of the coin, automation with the ability to do many office jobs from anywhere thus the rise of contract jobs. -Academic schools will transform completely! majority of it being done virtually. Students will only go to school on college style block scheduling (pick their required on campus classes for M,W,F or T, and R) I would not be surprised if schools start boosting social clubs just to advocate for students to socialize. -Same with the change in police deptartments. I foresee a big increase in community constables (elected, fundraise for their own equipment) ",
