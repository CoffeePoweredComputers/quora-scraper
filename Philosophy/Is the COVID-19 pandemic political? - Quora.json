            "answer_text": "Nope. That nasty little virus will kill you, regardless of your personal politics. A virus just moves, from host to host, replicating itself. It does not care about your good looks, your celebrity status, your Sunday morning church-going habits, your gender, your race, your sexual orientation, your skin pigmentation, your color of hair \u2014 or whether you even have. It cares not about your educational degrees (or lack thereof). It does not even care about the fact that you posted a link from a propaganda resource which makes up fictional stories. The virus will invade, regardless of the fact you are naive. The virus will invade, even if you are a Trump cultist. That said, if you happen to live in the United States, the odds are much greater that you will become infected than if you live in other nations. And, that also means the odds are much greater that you might die \u2014 if you happen to live in the United States. That is because, nationally, the one person whose job it was to respond in the United States, bungled this. He bungled it, beyond all belief. \u2014 A timeline: [Donald Trump was first warned of Covid-19 (before it had a name) and was warned that it was in one area of China, by US intelligence agencies, in late November of 2019. Trump ignored these warnings.] [The entire planet was warned, by legitimate journalists, throughout December, as they covered China\u2019s response. Trump ignored all of those warnings. [The World Health Organization privately warned Donald Trump, in writing, on December 31. Trump ignored that warning.] [Trump was warned by the CDC three times, in January, and a fourth time, on January 19. On January 20, the World Health Organization warned the entire world that this disease was being spread human-to-human, and that it appeared it would probably reach pandemic levels. Trump ignored that warning.] Then \u2013 January 23 -- \u201cWe have it totally under control. It\u2019s one person coming in from China. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d [Donald Trump, January 22.] February 2 - \u201cWe pretty much shut it down coming in from China.\u201d [Donald Trump, February 2.] February 24 - \u201cThe Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA\u2026 Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d [Donald Trump, February 24.] February 25 - \u201cCDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus.\u201d [Donald Trump, February 25.] February 25 - \u201cI think that's a problem that\u2019s going to go away\u2026 They have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we\u2019re very close to a vaccine.\u201d [Donald Trump, February 25.] February 26 - \u201cThe 15 (cases in the US) within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.\u201d [Donald Trump, February 26.] February 26 - \u201cWe're going very substantially down, not up.\u201d [Donald Trump, February 26.] February 27 - \u201cOne day it\u2019s like a miracle, it will disappear.\u201d [Donald Trump, February 27.] February 28 - \u201cWe're ordering a lot of supplies. We're ordering a lot of, uh, elements that frankly we wouldn't be ordering unless it was something like this. But we're ordering a lot of different elements of medical.\u201d [Donald Trump, February 28.] March 2 -- \u201cYou take a solid flu vaccine, you don't think that could have an impact, or much of an impact, on corona?\u201d [Donald Trump, March 2.] March 2 -- \u201cA lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they\u2019re happening very rapidly.\u201d [Donald Trump, March 2.] March 4 -- \u201cIf we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work \u2014 some of them go to work, but they get better.\u201d [Donald Trump, March 4.] March 5 -- \u201cI NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work.\u201d [Donald Trump, March 5.] March 5 -- \u201cThe United States\u2026 has, as of now, only 129 cases\u2026 and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!\u201d [Donald Trump, March 5.] March 5 -- \u201cI think we\u2019re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down\u2026 a tremendous job at keeping it down.\u201d [Donald Trump, March 5.] March 6 -- \u201cAnybody right now, and yesterday, anybody that needs a test gets a test. They\u2019re there. And the tests are beautiful\u2026. the tests are all perfect like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect. Right? This was not as perfect as that but pretty good.\u201d [Donald Trump, March 6.] March 6 -- \u201cI like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it\u2026 Every one of these doctors said, \u2018How do you know so much about this?\u2019 Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for president.\u201d [Donald Trump, March 6.] March 6 -- \u201cI don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault.\u201d [Donald Trump, March 6.] March 8 -- \u201cWe have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus.\u201d [Donald Trump, March 8.] March 12-- \"But it'll be -- it'll go away very quickly.\" [Donald Trump, March 12.] March 12-- \"You know, you see what's going on. And so I just wanted that to stop as it pertains to the United States. And that's what we've done. We've stopped it.\" [Donald Trump, March 12.] March 12-- \"Let's put it this way, I'm not concerned, OK?\" [Donald Trump, March 12.] March 13 \u2013 \u201cI am officially declaring a national emergency.\" A national emergency. Those are two very big words.\u201d [Donald Trump, March 13.] March 14 \u2013 \u201cAs of this moment we have 50 deaths, which is \u2014 a lot of good decisions were made, or that number could be many times that. But that\u2019s based on a lot of good decisions, one or two in particular.\u201d March 15 \u2013 \u201c\"My administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible, avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people, avoid discretionary travel and avoid eating and drinking in bars, restaurants, and public food courts.\u201d March 20 \u2013 (Reporter: \u201cWhat do you say to Americans who are scared?\u201d) Donald Trump: \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter, that\u2019s what I say!\u201d [Donald Trump, March 20.] March 21 \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re giving relief to affected industries and small businesses, and we\u2019re ensuring that we emerge from this challenge with a prosperous and growing economy because that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s going to pop. One day, we\u2019ll be standing, possibly up here, and we\u2019ll say, \u201cWell, we won.\u201d And we\u2019re going to say that. As sure as you\u2019re sitting there, we\u2019re going to say that. And we\u2019re going to win, and I think we\u2019re going to win faster than people think, I hope.\u201d [Donald Trump March 21.] March 24 \u2013 \u201cWe are going to save American workers, and we\u2019re going to save them quickly. And we\u2019re going to save our great American companies, both small and large. This was a medical problem. We are not going to let it turn into a long-lasting financial problem. It started out as a purely medical problem, and it\u2019s not going to go beyond that. We\u2019re just not going to allow that to happen.\u201d [Donald Trump March 24.] March 24 \u2013 \u201cOur time comes up, Monday or Tuesday are the allotted two weeks, but we\u2019ll stay a little bit longer than that. But we want to get open very soon. I think that was a big reason it\u2019s gone up. I also think that the fact that the Senate and the House, we seem to be getting along as much as you can get along. We seem to be getting along now on a bill. I think that may be had even less of an impact and the fact that we\u2019re opening up this incredible country because we have to do that. I\u2019d love to have it open by Easter, okay. I would love to have it open by Easter. I will tell you that right now. I would love to have that. It\u2019s such an important day for other reasons, but I\u2019ll make it an important day for this too. I would love to have the country opened up and they\u2019re just raring to go by Easter.\u201d [Donald Trump March 24.] (Easter, for the record \u2013 occurred on April 12, 2020.) March 28 \u2013 \u201cQuestion, from a reporter: \u201cYou\u2019ve suggested that some of these governors are not doing everything they need to do, and suggested that these governors are at fault. Can you be specific? What more, in this time of a national emergency, should these governors be doing? So what I\u2019m asking is: What more, specifically, do you want the governor of Washington and the governor of Michigan to be doing?\u201d Answer from Donald Trump:\u201d \u201cAll I want them to do \u2014 very simple \u2014 I want them to be appreciative. And I think the governor, who\u2019s a failed presidential candidate, as you know \u2014 he \u2014 he leveled out at zero in the polls. He\u2019s constantly chirping and \u2014 I guess \u201ccomplaining\u201d would be a nice way of saying it. We\u2019re building hospitals. We\u2019ve done a great job for the state of Washington. Michigan, all she does is \u2014 she has no idea what\u2019s going on. And all she does is say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s the federal government\u2019s fault. All I want them to do \u2014 very simple \u2014 I want them to be appreciative. I don\u2019t want them to say things that aren\u2019t true. I want them to be appreciative. We\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d [Donald Trump, March 28.] March 30 \u2013 \u201cThe vaccines are moving along very rapidly. The vaccines are an answer, but I\u2019d like to see if we could do something therapeutically so that we could take care of the people that are already sick. I want to point out that the hydroxychloroquine is being administered to 1,100 patients \u2014 people in New York.\u201d [Donald Trump, March 29.] (Side Note -- The hydroxychloroquine \u201cstudy\u201d Trump refers to -which he will later officially order his staff to begin \u2013 had not begun, as of March 30. It did begin, in April, after Trump publicly said \u201cI want to see that done.\u201d That hydroxychloroquine study has now already ceased, after too many test patients died, or suffered coronary attacks.) April 7 \u2013 \u201cAmerica performs more tests than other nations and that is probably why we have more cases. We have done over 1.8 million tests.\u201d (Side Note: both statements are absolute lies. As to the issue of \u201cmore tests,\u201d the statement is wrong, regardless of whether one uses real numbers, or per capita numbers. As to the total number of tests, it was not 1.8 million. It was actually less than 750,000 \u2013 the official tally on April 7 is 758.964 tests conducted.)  As I write this \u2013 there are now more than 1,770,384 confirmed cases in the United States. As I am writing this, there have been at least 103,784 confirmed deaths in the U.S. due to Covid-19. Those are real human beings. But remember -- \u201cFebruary 25 - \u201cI think that's a problem that\u2019s going to go away\u2026 \u201d [Donald Trump, February 25.] https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 ",
