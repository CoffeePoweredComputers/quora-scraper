            "answer_text": "A priori / a posteriori and analytic / synthetic Kant distinguishes between two closely related concepts: the epistemological (knowledge-related) a priori/a posteriori distinction and the semantic (truth-related) analytic/synthetic distinction. They are defined as follows: A proposition is a priori if it can be known or can be justified independently of experience.E.g. \u201cTriangles have three sides\u201d: we need not consult triangles to know this.A proposition is a posteriori if it can be justified only based on experience of its objects.E.g. \u201cThe triangle I drew is red\u201d: we need to have perception or some other means of experience (e.g. testimony) of the triangle to know whether it is indeed red.A proposition is analytic, if it is true based on the mere interrelations of its concepts, i.e. based on their meaning alone.E.g. \u201cBachelors are unmarried\u201d: this is true based on the very meaning of the concept bachelor, for it means an unmarried man.A proposition is synthetic, if it is made true only by something outside its mere concepts, i.e. by the objects of the concepts.E.g. \u201cBachelors are jovial\u201d: this is not true based on the meaning of bachelor alone, but it is made true or false by whether the entities referred to by the concept bachelor are also jovial.Synthetic a priori Now, analytic judgments are also clearly a priori: since they are true based on the very meaning of the concept, we need not consult any experience about e.g. bachelors to know that they are, indeed, unmarried. Similarly a posteriori judgments are all synthetic: since they are known to be true only based on experience, something else than the mere meaning of the terms makes them true. But Kant makes also the famous and contested claim that not all synthetic propositions are a posteriori, but that some of them are a priori. This would mean that some things are known to be true without consulting experience yet not simply by analysis of the concepts. Kant thinks that there lie in the human cognitive faculties certain forms which are necessary for things to become objects of our cognition. If this is true, then synthetic a priori judgments are possible, for since the forms are necessary for there to be any experience whatsoever, we know a priori, i.e. independently of any particular experience, that all objects will conform to these forms. That is, the objects will have all those properties that the forms impose on them. This Kant calls transcendental idealism. (See Toni Kannisto's answer to What is Kantian transcendental idealism?) Thus we get finally to answering our question, for these forms allow us to generate examples of synthetic a priori judgments, for instance the following. Mathematics and Geometry Most, but not all, propositions of mathematics and geometry are, according to Kant synthetic a priori, for they rely on time and space which are a priori forms of our sensibility. E.g.: 5 + 7 = 12, and every other numerical statement. (Based on iterations in pure time.)The straight line is the shortest line between two points. (Based on pure intuition of spatial relations.)The sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two straight angles. (Can be constructed and proved in pure intuition of spatial relations among the sides of triangles.)Mathematics, according to Kant, also includes analytic judgments, through which many other results can be derived based on synthetic a priori judgments. An example is: The whole is greater than any of its (proper) part. Natural Science Certain fundamental propositions of natural science, which underlie all others, are also synthetic a priori \u2013 specifically Newton\u2019s Laws. These are based on what Kant calls the semi-empirical concept of matter, defined as the movable in space, when the categories of understanding are applied to it. E.g.: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.Matter can neither be created nor destroyed.Ontology Ontology, or metaphysics of nature, also has synthetic a priori judgments. They arise when the pure concepts of the understanding, or the categories, are applied to time. E.g., Every event has a cause \u2013 and an effect.In every alteration, there is a substance that persists through the alteration.Every natural thing has an extensive and intensive magnitude.Kant also claims \u2013 a point not often noticed \u2013 that all ontological propositions derivative of these fundamental propositions are synthetic a priori. He refers the reader to ontological textbooks (primarily Alexander Baumgarten\u2019s), where there are plenty of such propositions. E.g. based on the fact that a causality involves such concepts as force, action, and passion. This shows that Kant meant to save much of classical ontology by proving the synthetic a priori nature of a variety of its propositions. (He also continued doing such ontology in his lectures on metaphysics, even if he did not discuss these issues much in his published works.) Ethics Kant even states that the moral law affords synthetic a priori propositions (of practical reason). It is not altogether clear what he means, but it seems reasonable to assume that the different formulations of the categorical imperative are what Kant deems synthetic a priori knowledge, e.g.: Act only on that maxim [subjective rule of conduct] by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.Since these are normative claims or imperatives, and not propositions, it is not clear how these relate to the other examples (which is why Kant also says they are synthetic a priori but practical propositions). It could perhaps be said that our knowledge that these are indeed categorical imperatives is synthetic a priori (not derived from the meaning of the moral law, nor from experience). This would take us too far afield, however. ",

            "answer_text": "For our purposes here, we\u2019ll say that \u201cknowledge\u201d is knowledge of a proposition. A synthetic a priori proposition is one in which the predicate contains information that is not present in the subject, but the truth value of the proposition can be obtained without recourse to experience. An example might be \u201cA triangle\u2019s interior angles are equal to two right angles.\u201d Kant argues that the information \u201cequal to\u201d and \u201ctwo right angles\u201d is different from (and not contained in) \u201cA triangle\u2019s interior angles.\u201d That difference makes the proposition synthetic rather than analytic. But since triangles do not exist in the empirical world, our knowledge concerning them must be other than experiential. Also, once the truth of this proposition is ascertained, it is understood that additional examples of triangles\u2019 conforming to its pronouncements do not strengthen the claim. It\u2019s truth is independent of iteration. Philosophers call knowledge that is independent of experience \u201ca priori knowledge\u201d in contradistinction to knowledge acquired through experience, which is called \u201ca posteriori knowledge.\u201d Kant claims that many propositions concerning pure mathematics, logic, and metaphysics are synthetic a priori propositions. Other examples would be 2 + 3= 5. The circumference of a circle is equal to its diameter times 3.146. Red is not green. ",
