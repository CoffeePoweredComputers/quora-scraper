            "answer_text": "There is this book written by Michael Lewis, who is in his late 60's and was an addict to heavy drugs for about half of his life and then went clean, earned a PHD and is a prestigious professor. In his book, he tells his personal history of how he stopped addiction for good, and it wasn't easy at all, but he did.
