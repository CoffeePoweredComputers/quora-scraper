            "answer_text": "Yep, pretty much. But there\u2019s a lot of depth and nuance to that. It\u2019s about HOW you live your life. If you pursue becoming the best person that you can be, in every context, you\u2019re on the right track. Cultivate interests in things that please you, without causing harm to others. If possible, cultivate interests in things that actually benefit others, but at the very least do no harm. Find things you are good at, and practice until you are even better. Try things that are hard, and don\u2019t give up at the first go-round. Challenge yourself, physically and mentally - always push your own boundaries. You may not be great at everything, and that\u2019s ok, but in the process you\u2019ll find things you do really well, and those will give you satisfaction that will carry you through the inevitable low points. By working on yourself, and being honest with yourself about your strengths and weaknesses, you\u2019ll be the kind of person that other people will respect. Be honest, with yourself and others, and keep your word. All the rest will fall into place. It might sound simple, and in one sense it is - just be honest and true to yourself, push yourself to be better tomorrow than yesterday, set some goals and stick to them. Life just happens - it\u2019s what you do with it that counts. ",
