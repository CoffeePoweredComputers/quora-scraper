            "answer_text": "I think the main criticism is that human morality or humanist morality has no objective basis. It's subjective (based on our emotions and feelings of compassion as well as experience) and it's employed in a situationally based way, which is also rather subjective and causes different individuals to come to different conclusions about what is or is not moral based on prior experience and knowledge. To use such a subjective morality effectively requires education, knowledge and active attempts to improve thinking. After all, the quality of your moral reasoning is entirely dependent on a) whether what you think you know is even so and b) how good you are at thinking logically and rationally in general. Despite the difficulties associated with a human or humanist based approach to ethics, the results are far superior to arbitrary objective approaches to morality specifically because it's reality based.  Assuming an objective basis for morality is flawed from the start because all knowledge we humans have is ultimately known subjectively - even though we can agree there is an objective reality we can learn about, all our knowledge about that external objective reality is ultimately subjective. Accepting that is the first step to wisdom and therefore the first step to a full morality. The 2nd reason why a subjective human based morality is better than arbitrary objective moralities is because all supposedly objective moralities are arbitrary. We can't know objectively what might be truly true so any positing of what might be truly true is subjective and ultimately arbitrary and that's not a good basis for morality. The 3rd reason why the subjective human based approach is better is because it is flexible and adaptable to the real situations we find ourselves in.  Being good at moral reasoning isn't about deciding what is good or bad. Those are easy decisions to make. Real moral reasoning requires us to decide which is the greater of two goods and/or which is the lesser of two evils. Attempts to have an objective morality fail because they fail to understand that the goal of morality isn't good or evil. What we really use morality for is to decide what's less evil and what's more good. Arbitrary objective measures of morality are incapable of helping us make these sorts of decisions and are therefore not very useful as moral frameworks go.

            "answer_text": "The religious folks refuse to accept that morality and ethics can be inferred or discerned through empirical plus logical means.  Why?  Because it would imply we don't need an epiphany to know the difference between right and wrong.  Therefore God is of little use in teaching us the difference.  If morality and ethics can be achieved by natural means than belief in an unseen God for which there is not one crumb of empirical evidence is a useless and wasteful  denial of logic and reason. ",
