            "answer_text": "\u201cIn fact,\u201d at the start of the first ice age the Gaian mind knew she had a few million years to go from primates to off planet because the sun became unstable. After 5 billion years of no glaciation suddenly 2.6 million years ago there's a mile thick blanket of ice covering the earth. That is like there being a sacred ceremony carried out by zealots every day at noon like clockwork for 160 years then one month they forget to perform it 5 times. You would be very worried if that ceremony was your existential landlord or whatnot. Anyway, the planet sent out a distress call through all of the dimensions that it was capable of reaching, and advanced beings began to elaborate on the rough objective through the covert use of the capability of the human subconscious to use the observations of the conscious mind to piece together an understanding of the ecology of ecosystems. Sorry I keep getting off track, monotheistic religions are planted in the childhood of your childhood of your literal childhood because we are losing our celestial father relatively soon(probably millions of years from now but eventually this moment will become that moment). Once the sun dies there is no more need for this entropic universe because entropy is the result of taking a perfect base material and creating complex ecology, its natural state of equilibrium is unified. The sun is the embodiment of the base material, the one above all, and its death symbolizes that the base material now reaches equilibrium in two equal parts. That is how we are constructed with memory from the earth, and imagination from the sun. They communicate everytime you imagine something new based on memory or remember a thing you imagined, the language is three components of information, emotion, and creation. Everything in the celestial consciousness field of our solar system is in a trinity based reality. So, the humans were pulled off the mother mind grid and these hyper intelligent beings began executing their plan that is still in development technically, and monotheism was the center concept of the culture of most of earth for thousands of years as a placeholder. We told a lie so that the truth will have a place to sit when he finally gets here, basically. I am personally going to dedicate my life to God's faith in man. ",

You can\u2019t help but look at the creation. It\u2019s all too phenomenal. you\u2019d have to repress something to think this is all about the evolution.\u201d- MARVIN OLASKY \u201cReligion is that tie that binds one to ones creator, and whilst the body perishes as it has to, religion persists even after death.\u201d - MAHATMA GANDHI Religion, is basically a source of the mankind to reach the creator of this mighty universe. Existence of mankind do depend upon the faith and the beliefs the person carries along with himself, wherever he goes and the morals and the utmost respect towards the religion and mankind, is reflected in the persons deeds in day to day life. The religion helps a person to form a base and faith within the soul, which encourages the person to move in the direction, where a person can attain a connection with the almighty creator and work for the purpose, for with very existence of the human have created by the creator of this holy universe. The religion we can say is a path, walking on which we can attain the goals and the peace for which, the religion has been giving us the teachings and preaching in many ways, since the very existence of the human race. If we look into Shrimad Bhagwat Gita, Holy Kuran and The Bible along with the other religious texts of different religions, at the same time, you will find that, the teachings which have been given in all the religious texts are same. They all carry the same meanings, the same morals have been provided by all of them and the same paths have been suggested by all the religious texts to attain the connection with the lord, the creator of the mighty universe and the things beyond. So, we can here say that, yes the religion help the existence of the human, and the morals which have been given under the religious texts, pave a path to have a connection with the almighty god. ",

As a child does, so did humanity learn to crawl, stand and walk, talk and think. In that order. But in that process, it had phases where its cognition (recognition/discrimination/seeing patterns) would be ahead of its ability to understand them. This is when, like children humanity called animism. Infering that which you can investigate and gives you the possibility to investigate, without you knowing it is so: your own mind. In that sense, humanity did what children do: They think all things around them have the same properties as they themselves have. That is how religion came to be in short, always shifting goalposts.

This causes a dichotomy of thought, and reasoning. One has to choose between developing a world view with a relationship based in the sciences, or one based in the constructions of whichever religion elected. A substantial subset try to meld both, which I find cumbersome at best. The next major religion will have to satisfy some or most of the concepts of Science, while providing a clear explanation and development of why we are here. Science, A.K.A. Emergent Biology and Abiogenesis, so far has utterly failed to provide a rich context for the human endeavor. As the Context of Information develops and more people are influenced by the fact that absolutely everything is defined and animated by information, this will generate an opportunity to rekindle a construction of reality paralleling science yet rewarding humanity with a relationship with the universe and the IS.
