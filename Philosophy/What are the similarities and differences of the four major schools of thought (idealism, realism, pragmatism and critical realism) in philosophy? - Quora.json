            "answer_text": "The question presumes that \u201cIdealism, Realism, Pragmatism and Critical Realism\u201d comprise the \u201cfour major schools\u201d of Philosophy. Actually, there are many other schools with just as much right to be counted among any list of the \u201cfour major schools.\u201d Existentialism and the Dialectic are only two. Anyway, I would answer this question in this form: \u201ccompare and contrast Idealism, Realism, Pragmatism and Critical Realism.\u201d To undertake this potentially mammoth task in a brief space, I will make my text as terse as I can. Idealism: Reality is ultimately Ideas, so that Ideas and Ideals not only predominate, but also \u201crule\u201d over Material objects. Plato was the first Westerner to write out this \u201cdualist\u201d approach to Reality. Today we call it, \u201cMind over Matter,\u201d or \u201cSpirit over Nature,\u201d or \u201cWill Power over the Appetites\u201d and so on.Realism: Reality is ultimately Material objects, which exist independently of Ideas and the Mind. Matter predominates and even \u201crules\u201d over Ideas. Aristotle is credited as the first Westerner to imply this \u201cdualist\u201d approach to Reality. Today we call this \u201cbeing realistic,\u201d and \u201caccepting things as they are.\u201d (Traditionally speaking, Idealism and Realism are opposites.)Pragmatism: Reality is ultimately comprised of those Material objects that the Mind chooses to Experience. Some objects are \u201cimportant\u201d and most objects are \u201cunimportant.\u201d Reality is always lived in this ranking of objects, and the ranking is entirely Ideal, although the objects are entirely Material. (Traditionally, this view is a synthesis of Idealism and Realism.)Critical Realism: Reality is ultimately comprised of those Material objects that the Mind can control scientifically. Anything that the Mind cannot control turns out to be irrelevant, no matter what our opinion of it might be. This view presumes some degree of Science, no matter how slight. (Traditionally, this view is an elaboration of Pragmatism.)There, in very brief terms, is a comparison and a contrast of those four generic schools of Philosophy. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure what you mean, but I\u2019ll take a shot. Within one particular area of philosophy, the philosophy of perception (itself only a part of epistemology), there might fairly be said to be the four major schools of thought you name. The specific question addressed by each school is: what is the relationship between what is perceived on the one hand, and the image of the perceived thing WITHIN a perceiving mind on the other? That question has, one might say, four answers. Idealism: there is no duality, The apple I perceive and the idea I have of it when I perceive it are the same fact, because \u201cto be is to be perceived.\u201dRealism: there is a duality. When I perceive an apple my senses are conveying to my mind various data about the apple and my mind is putting it together. The synthesis of those data is imperfect, prone to error, but for people with normal healthy senses and nervous system it is usually pretty accurate.Pragmatism: there are different contexts. If I am a painter, the \u2018reality\u2019 of the apple is not my concern. It is part of the scenery that is inspiring my brush strokes and that is sufficient. If I am starving and in desperate need of food, I can assure myself of the reality of the apple by grasping and biting. In either context, my concern is what works.Critical realism. It is true that there is a duality, it is also true that the apple comes to us in different contexts, and it is further true that many of those contexts are social \u2014 shared ideas about what an apple is supposed to look and smell like, which determine my perception of this one.If I\u2019m right about what you meant, then I believe I have answered you well.
