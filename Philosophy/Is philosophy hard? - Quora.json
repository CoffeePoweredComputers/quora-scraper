            "answer_text": "Many people find it hard. Philosophy is counter intuitive, and it is uncertain. Those two things are rarely found together, and that is what makes it hard. Maths is counterintuitive - it has crazy things like pi, and imaginary numbers, and (for children) things like negative numbers. But, all those things operate according to rules. You can learn the framework - the rules - which make those counterintuitive things makes sense. Literature has no rules, it\u2019s fuzzy like most arts subjects. But in return, apart from a few areas like post-modern criticism, you are talking about fairly obvious things like text, plot, cultural context, motivations of characters, and so on. Philosophy has MANY deeply counter-intuitive ideas, from the idea that nothing exists at all, to the idea that truth isn\u2019t even a meaningful concept, to the notion of qualia. But, because almost no concepts in philosophy are solved problems or widely agreed upon, there are very few rules beyond fundamental logic (which is pretty limited, it turns out). So you really are floundering in a sea not only of unfamiliarity and complexity, but also uncertainty. So, why did you find it so easy? I\u2019ll suggest three things, although I\u2019m unfamiliar with Crash Courses: You are happy dealing with abstract concepts, so that didn\u2019t faze you.The course only addressed a few common topics, and failed to point out that much of what it treated as \u2018foundations\u2019 were in fact nothing but sand.The course was not actually Philosophy at all, but the history of philosophy. That\u2019s where someone tells you \u201cPlato thought like this\u201d and \u201cDescartes had this idea\u201d and \u201cHere is what Kant contributed to ethics\u201d, and you understand the various things those philosophers thought. That\u2019s all well and good, and maybe very interesting, but it\u2019s not philosophy. Philosophy is when you try to work out whether Kant, Plato and Descartes were not merely interesting, but *correct* . You may or may not want to study the philosophy of Truth before doing that, but then, can you read a book on truth without studying Wittgenstein\u2019s philosophy of language first? So it goes.",

            "answer_text": "I'd answer this question by dividing philosophy, or the consumption of philosophy as a reader or student of it into three different sections. The first section is logic. Either through studying logic or by reading any philosophical texts with a focus on the reasoning process rather than the content, a reader may learn how to reason. I'd say this process is the most rigorous and difficult of the philosophical process overall. The next section is content. I'd say this is the second most difficult process, not because of the bulk of the reading, as I find texts that write mainly by logical reasoning easier to read due to their predictability, but due to the topics and subjects that are written about. Oftentimes, philosophical topics are mind-bending, mind-blowing texts that circulate in multiple directions at the same time. In other words, reading philosophy is like one of the ways of doing brain gymnastics. One reason why many people sway away from studying philosophy is because they find the topics too difficult to digest. The third section, is the overall reading process. Every now and then, a person comes across a philosophical topic that they are naturally interested in, and paired with the easy reading that logical reasoning provides, a beautiful river of words flow into the stream of consciousness that is the reader's mind, and the reader begins to appreciate philosophy. This tends to be the reason why those who appreciate philosophy persevere, as the prior two parts tend to be more difficult. ",
