He did not have all those things so in the specifics he may seem out of date, but in terms of the mutuality of the values between, or valuing the same types of things, and of being an \u201calter-ego\u201d (another self), then yes, Aristotle is still very relevant. Where he may have gone to see chariot races, you can go see automobile races. Ayn Rand once summed up what friendship means and has many friendly relations between friends in her novels as examples, but here is what she said: \u201cLove, friendship, respect, admiration are the emotional response of one man to the virtues of another, the spiritual payment given in exchange for the personal, selfish pleasure which one man derives from the virtues of another man\u2019s character. Only a brute or an altruist would claim that the appreciation of another person\u2019s virtues is an act of selflessness, that as far as one\u2019s own selfish interest and pleasure are concerned, it makes no difference whether one deals with a genius or a fool, whether one meets a hero or a thug, whether one marries an ideal woman or a slut.\u201d http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/love.html -Ayn Rand Lexicon ",

            "answer_text": " Ask yourself if any of this still matters. We have friendships that exist on many levels; Aristotle understood that. He spoke of three types each based on different goals; friendship based on utility, pleasure, and the good. The first two are rather accidental, and also are determined by the strength of the perceived achieved goals. The third is much more \u2018other\u2019 oriented. One cannot call another a friend and \u2018use\u2019 that person solely for one\u2019s own end, but there are friendships based on utility. Each of us has something to \u2018give\u2019 to the other, and our skills and gifts become complementary and have a certain relevance of interdependency. You help me move to a new house, and I\u2019ll help you do your taxes. This isn\u2019t a quid pro quo, but there\u2019s a friendship of utility that builds between people. This is not a deep friendship, but it is one nonetheless. It will last as long as the utility is present. With friendships based on pleasure, think of the colloquialism, \u2018birds of a feather flock together\u2019. Those who enjoy sporting events, rock climbing, certain types of movies, etc., all develop a friendship based on the mutual pursuit of enjoyment. We all need this type of friendship, but it\u2019s clear how this can be temporary and will cease when the pleasure is no longer present. The last type of friendship is that based on the good. This is the mutual pursuit not of some \u2018use\u2019 each has for the other, and neither simply the \u2018pleasure\u2019 one experiences with the other. Rather, this is the recognition of virtue in the other that each share, and both work to promote and nurture in the other. This is a very difficult relationship to cultivate, and it takes quite a bit of time to allow this friendship to develop and mature. If you or I live a long life and can count among ourselves three or four friendships based on \u2018the good\u2019, we should count ourselves among the fortunate. A final caveat is that these are not entirely mutually exclusive categories. Even friendships based on the good are often uplifted by the utility they afford (can you pick up my medicine?), or the pleasure they bring (we enjoy watching film noir). But the obvious distinction is that the friendship is not predicated on utility or pleasure. I think this reflective type of consideration on the idea of friendship allows us to see the \u2018other\u2019 for who they are in relation to us personally. It\u2019s difficult to imagine how that cannot still matter today. ",

            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t read the relevant books of the Nicomachean Ethics in a few years so forgive me if I get sloppy with some of this. The short answer is, yes, it is more relevant than ever and one of the central pieces of ethics and politics that modern moral theories neglect. Imagine that you find yourself hurt in a car accident and have to spend a few weeks in the hospital. After many days in a hospital bed, bored with no visitors, your closest friend comes to visit you. You\u2019re going to be pretty happy about that, right? Only in your conversation, you learn that your friend only came there because he felt like duty required him to visit you. He\u2019s not there because he cares about you, or because your friendship is intrinsically worthwhile, or because your well-being is his motivation. He\u2019s there because of duty. That\u2019s pretty underwhelming, isn\u2019t it? The point with this kind of example is that we don\u2019t find the value in friendship in such cases. Reasoning with ethical theories in hand, we can spin all the reasons, arguments, and justifications we want \u2014 but we haven\u2019t found our way into the moral motivation. Modern moral philosophy is chock full of this sort of procedural thinking, replacing the details of the person, the individual being who is supposedly the object of our concern, with abstract rules, principles, theories, and impartial choices. Aristotle, in contrast, invites us to remember the pleasures, virtues, and values of friendship \u2014 both in having friends and in being a good friend to others. Something deeply important about morality and the human condition gets lost with our abstract, rational theories of impartial justice and maximum utility. ",

            "answer_text": "Aristotle taught us to examine the world empirically, and he inspired generations of thinkers and philosophers to consider the role and value of ethics in the everyday conduct of our lives. For the average person, however, the most relevant of his ideas relate to the importance of good relationships. He was particularly curious about the intention of friendship. While he saw the value in accidental friendships based on pleasure and utility, he felt that their impermanence diminished their potential. They lacked depth and a solid foundation. One the utility or pleasure are gone, so is the friendship. Instead, he argued for the cultivation of virtuous friendships built with intention and based on a mutual appreciation of character and goodness rather than on some transactional value. He knew that such a friendship could only be strengthened over time and that if it did thrive, it would last for life. To Aristotle, few things came close to the value of such a relationship. It makes sense. At the end of the day, the bonds we forge with those close to us directly shape the quality of our lives. We are, and we live through, the people we spend time with. For most things, life is long enough. It is, however, too short for the wrong kinds of friendship. His theories are valid today and even more so in a society that that is disconnected due to the internet and social media. It\u2019s important to know the difference is what makes for permanent friendships and which are short lived. It\u2019s easier to let go when we realize the purpose of the friendship has ended and it\u2019s easier to understand which friendships are worth cultivating into long term, mutually satisfying relationships. Best wishes and good luck. ",
