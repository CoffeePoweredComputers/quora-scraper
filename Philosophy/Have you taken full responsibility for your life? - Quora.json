            "answer_text": "I took the responsibility of raising myself when my parents failed to do so. I tried to be their perfect daughter but I was no match for the image they had dreamed up for me. Their principles were clouded and only came clearly into the picture when they needed something from me. Other times I could go ahead and murder someone and they wouldn't bat an eye. I realised pretty early on that this wasn't the way I ought to live. So I built my own moral code. I found out things that could hurt others and things others would accept. I found the extent to which I could put myself ahead of others and where they came first. I learned to survive and live without ever stepping on someone else for it. I was always a good manipulator since that's what my parents taught me. But while they use it to force people to do as they say, I use it to survive. It is my way of fitting in with people even if I feel left out. Through it I can show my parents that I am their good daughter so they don't abuse me more than the usual. I learned the hard way how much pain abuse could cause to a person and vowed to myself that no one would suffer because of me. Since then I have ensured my actions don't have such consequences that hurt others. I plan my every move carefully to make sure I don't unintentionally cause someone pain. I found out on my own what it was like to trust someone or be with people who care about you. To have a family even if you weren't born into one. I took risks for what I believed in and fought my demons with every bit of strength I possess. I pieced myself back together after my blood family left me broken. So from early on I took the responsibility of raising myself. And I have to say even though it wasn't an easy job, I am happy with the results. ",

I assume full responsibility for my acts. There is no assumption that a decision won't cost my life. Since I feel like I have made good use of the time I've had in this body I am prepared to let it go when the time comes. Further more I feel that I have taken such good care of the body as to have fulfilled my promise to the one who endured the pain so I could experience this journey in the flesh. Every day I take responsibility for my life. I give the best of myself to whatever I'm engaged in and am willing to give my life for everything that I do. If I didn't live my life in this way I would succumb to indulgence and lose my sanity. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you taken responsibility for your life? I think so. I accept that I must conform to physics and its progeny including psychology and do so with civic integrity. For example, if warned of a tsunami with 30\u2019 waves, I will move my family to higher ground without harming fellow global citizens. In a land where many people build in flood plains and insure their buildings, I studied the flood maps and built my home at 38\u2019 above sea level. In a family wounded by PSP, I do all I can to preserve the finest time in our monogamous spouse hood with family. The most important element is the happiness of our PSP afflicted family member. Reaching out to the community, I earn income, pay taxes, and appreciate every fellow citizen I encounter. I try to avoid places where fellow citizens are looking for trouble. In summary, I accept the principles: I am a human being; am charged to constrain chaos in my life; accept the individual power, the individual energy, and the individual authority (HIPEA) to develop the practice of integrity; attend to perfection of my unique individual and stay out of fellow humans\u2019 paths to their perfections; stay open minded to need to reform written law so as to approach statutory justice; and appreciate ineluctable goodness. I look to fellow citizens for suggestions I might choose to apply in order to improve my acceptances. ",
