            "answer_text": "\u201cWas Alexander the Great Greek or Roman?\u201d Thank you for A2A, Mike Ingram. Alexander was a Macedonian and the Macedonians were a Greek people. They spoke Greek and shared the same religion, cults and customs with the rest of the Greeks. Moreover, they identified themselves as Greeks: \u201cNow that these descendants of Perdiccas [i.e: the Macedonians] are Greeks, as they themselves say, I myself chance to know and will prove it in the later part of my history.\u201d (Herodotus, \"Histories\", 5.22.1) Alexander an the Macedonians were not Romans, as the Roman Empire was established in 27 BC, that\u2019s almost 300 years after the death of Alexander the Great. Summing up, \"We must remember too that Philip and Alexander were Greeks, descended from Heracles, wished to be recognized as Greeks, as benefactors of the Greeks, even as Heracles had been.\" (Nicholas Hammond, British scholar and expert on Macedon, \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d, p.257) ",

His father was Philip II King of the Macedons and his mother the fourth wife of King Philip was Olympias the daughter of Neoptolemus I King of Epirus. He was a decedent of the Argead (\u0391\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2) dynasty. On the day he was born his father was preparing a siege of the city of Potidea. The same day he received news that his horses had won first prize in the Olympic games. For all those who dispute the Greekness of Alexander must note that only free Greeks could participate in the Olympic games. Therefore if Philip was was not Greek would not have been allowed to take part in the game. His Tudor until the age of 16 was the Greek philosopher and celebrated scholar Aristotle. Alexander is said to have quoted << I owed my life to my father and my good life to my Tudor>> ( \u03a3\u03a4\u039f \u03a0\u0391\u03a4\u0395\u03a1\u0391 \u03a9\u03a6\u0395\u0399\u039b\u03a9 \u03a4\u039f \u0396\u0395\u0399\u039d \u039a\u0391\u0399 \u03a3\u03a4\u039f \u0394\u0399\u0394\u0391\u03a3\u039a\u0391\u039b\u039f \u039c\u039f\u03a5 \u03a4\u039f \u0395\u03a5\u0396\u0395\u0399\u039d). By the age of 30, he created the largest Empire the world had ever known at the time. His Empire was extending from Greece to Hindus river in India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders. ",
