            "answer_text": "Not really. You could go live like a hermit and try not to see anyone. But the way your mind is organized, how you view the world, what you hope for \u2014 all of this has been influenced by the society you were born into and your family, education and friends. For the most part, these are good things. They are the results of eons of learning how to work together in a group; how to communicate and thereby have a life not bounded totally by the brutish need to survive from moment to moment. But beyond that, by being part of a society you can enjoy the music of the best musicians, see art made by the most brilliant artists, read books that let you live, for a little while, the life of others in worlds of the past, present, and future.

And there you have everything to be free from societal affairs. If not then become \u2018\u2019 SANYASI \u2018\u2019 and take samadhi or go to himalaya. ",
