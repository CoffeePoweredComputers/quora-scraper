            "answer_text": "Does time exist? To answer this question, we first need to understand what time is. For one, time is not the measurement of duration. Time is fundamental. Time determines duration. Get ready for a completely new way of thinking about time. One which no philosopher or scientists has ever considered. This is an actual definition of what time is. Let me start with an analogy. Does movement exist? Yes I know things move, but is movement a physical thing? Can we see movement or can we only see things move? Can movement go faster, or make things move faster? Can we touch movement? Weight it? No! Can we measure it? No, but we can measure how far things move. Movement exist as a physical phenomena. It's something that physical things do. Well, so is time. Time is a term describing temporal motion. That's motion from the past to the future. From the present moment, to the next. You see, our universe exists in a 2 dimensional fabric which I call temp-space. One temporal dimension and one spatial dimension. We move through the spatial dimension and we time through the temporal dimension. So time is a physical phenomena similar to motion. It's temporal motion. Time doesn't move. Time is not something we move through. Time is not the rate of motion through space or the duration of events. Time is the motion of objects through the temporal dimension. Temporal distances are not like spatial distances. Instead of meters and feet, we have seconds, minutes, hours, etc. These are actual physical distances things move through an actual physical dimension. Distances which we can physically measure with the aid of clocks, which are basically temporal tape measures. It's the rate at which things time, which determine the duration of events. Our temporal velocity determines the speed at which atomic, biological and mechanical processes occur and as I said earlier, our temporal velocity is inversely proportional to our spatial velocity. This is why clocks tick slower the faster you move through space. Not just our wall clocks but our biological clocks as well. We actually age slower. I'm gonna take a break here, but feel free to read my other answers on time, attached below. Zane Scheepers's answer to How can gravity slow down time, if time isn\u2019t something tangible you can touch? The speed of light is 300,000 km per second. Why does light not travel faster/slower? Can we describe the nature of time? ",

And this perception is based on the light path that illuminates the events and reflects this information back to the eyes of the observer. Time can thus only be described in terms of the simultaneity/causality of events as described by the light path. Using these events, we can define time in a relative sense. For example, if I say that the sun rises at 6 A.M, then what I mean is this \u201cThe pointing of the small hand of my watch to 6 and the occurrence of my shadow at a particular point of space (which you can choose arbitrarily in the absence of standards), in my immediate locality, are simultaneous events.\u201d Now, note that I say \u2018in my immediate locality\u2019. This is because the finite speed of light(which is an experimentally observed fact) would not cause any significant effects on causality for very small distances(given the high speed of light). I cannot use the following definition: \u201cThe pointing of the small hand of my watch to 6 and the appearance of the sun on the horizon, are simultaneous events\u201d, because there would be significant effects on causality, given the distance involved. This definition is thus not independent of the observer. Common Time and Synchronization of Stationary Clocks So far, we\u2019ve defined a \u2018local time\u2019 for myself(A) and the observer at the horizon(B).We have not defined a \u2018common time\u2019 for A and B, for the latter cannot be defined at all unless we establish by definition that the \u2018time\u2019 required by light to travel from A to B equals the \u2018time\u2019 it requires to travel from B to A. Let a ray of light start at the \u2018A time\u2019 tA from A towards B, let it at the \u2018B time\u2019 tB be reflected at B in the direction of A, and arrive again at A at the \u2018A time t\u2032A. When the observer A sees the time in B\u2019s clock at \u2018A time\u2019 t\u2032A, he is seeing the \u2018B time\u2019 at tB, even though the B time has by then changed to something else. Let\u2019s clarify this with an example: Let\u2019s assume for example, that the time taken for light to travel from A to B (and B to A) is 1 minute. Let\u2019s also assume that when observed by a third observer who is in rest with respect to both A and B, \u2018A time\u2019 and \u2018B time\u2019 are separated by 10 minutes. So when \u2018A time\u2019 is 6 A.M, \u2018B time\u2019 is 6:10 A.M. Then, let at \u2018A time\u2019 6 A.M(tA), a light ray start from A. Let it reach B and be reflected back at \u2018B time\u2019 6:11 A.M(tB). Let the reflected ray reach A again at \u2018A time\u2019 6:02 A.M(t\u2032A). Then, at 6:02 AM \u2018A time\u2019, A sees a \u2018B time\u2019 of 6:11 AM, even though the \u2018B time\u2019 has changed to 6:12 AM. So now(at \u2018A time\u2019 6:02 AM), A changes his time to 6:11 AM. This is the new A time. Now, in the above example, the time taken for light to travel from A to B is taken as 1 minute(which is huge for normal distances) and is comparable to the time difference between the two clocks. And yet the difference between the two clocks has been reduced from 10 minutes to 1 minute.(which is the time taken by light to travel from A to B). In most cases, given the speed of light, the time taken for light would much much less than the time difference between the two clocks and the synchronization would be accurate to parts of a millionth of a second and the two observers would see roughly the same time. It is only when huge distances(astronomical distances for example) are involved, that the clock synchronization process introduces huge errors. Now lets see what happens when the time taken for light to travel from A to B is not the same as that from B to A. Let\u2019s suppose that the time taken for light to travel from A to B is 1 minute and B to A is 2 minutes. In this case, synchronizing A with B will introduce an error of 1 minute, while synchronizing B with A will introduce an error of 2 minutes. However, you might ask how it matters as long as the time difference between them remains constant. The problem starts when you introduce a third clock to be synchronized with both A and B. In this case, synchronizing C with A will introduce a different error than when C is synchronized with B. Hence we will never be able to synchronize more than two clocks. This is why we need to define the time taken for light to travel from A to B to be the same as that from B to A. One might wonder why the above equality needs to be defined rather than being experimentally verified. Remember that to experimentally verify the speed of light from A to B, we need the clocks at A and B to be synchronized in the first place!!! This is a circular requirement. Hence there is no alternative but to define the time taken for light to travel from A to B to be the same as that from B to A. Once the clocks are synchronized, we can write: tB\u2212tA=t\u2032A\u2212tB The above equality can also be written as: ABv=ABv where v is the velocity for light traveling from A to B(and B to A) In agreement with experimental results, which find the velocity of light to be the same in all inertial frames(or put another way, no relative movement between the earth and the light), we assume this speed v=c - the speed of light in free space. Thus c=2ABt\u2032A\u2212tA Thus we have now defined what is to be understood by synchronous stationary clocks located at different places, and have obtained a definition of \u2018simultaneity\u2019 and of \u2018time.\u2019 The \u201ctime\u201d of an event is that which is given simultaneously with the event by a stationary clock located at the place of the event(in the above example A\u2019s clock , the event being reading B\u2019s time at the place where A is located), this clock being synchronous, for all time determinations, with a specified stationary clock(B\u2019s clock, with which A tries to synchronize his clock). It is necessary to understand what is meant by the phrase \u2018for all time determinations\u2019. It means that once the two stationary clocks are synchronized, they remain synchronized forever. This is not possible with clocks that are moving with respect to each other. Even if you synchronize them when they are at rest, they drift apart when they are subjected to relative motion, as I have discussed here: Nikhil Panikkar's answer to If all motion is relative, then how can any speed or light speed be an absolute constant? Let\u2019s say two objects are traveling towards each other and both are traveling at 0.75c, wouldn't their relative speed exceed the speed of light? So, to summarize, time is: Dependent on the Causality/Simultaniety of eventsDependent on the light path taken, that illuminates the events and reflects this information back to the eyes of the observer.Dependent on the space where from where we observe the events.Now that we have an idea about what time is, I would like to discuss some common fallacies associated with the Special Theory of Relativity and its notion of time. Fallacies Fallacy - 1 - \u201cIt is possible to hypothetically Freeze time and Define an Absolute \u2018Now\u2019 \u201c A lot of people have this notion that it is possible to define an absolute moment of time - which they call \u2018Now\u2019 - by \u2018freezing time\u2019 across \u2018all\u2019 inertial frames. According to them, only the perception of now is different. A common example given to support this notion is the example of a cosmological event, like a supernova exploding. According to this notion, if a star which is 10 light years away, goes supernovae right this instant, we won't know anything for the next ten years. That doesn't change the fact that it's going supernovae at the \u2018present moment\u2019. Explanation - The first fallacy associated with this description is the notion that freezing time across \u2018all\u2019 \u2018inertial frames, is somehow physically different from introducing an additional inertial frame, from which we observe these other frames. Any time you compare n frames from the outside, it is physically equivalent to introducing an n+1 th frame, from which you compare the n frames. And this process can be continued ad infinitum.If you are saying that the phrase \u2018freezing frames\u2019 is somehow different from introducing an additional external frame, then you are only playing with words, as physically there is no difference.(That\u2019s why I use the word \u2018equivalent\u2019) You can\u2019t compare n inertial frames from the outside without introducing an n+1 th frame. Whatever you describe from this n+1th frame is valid only from that frame\u2019s point of view. It has no universal significance. So for example, if you try to send a light signal to freeze clocks across inertial frames \u2018Now\u2019, then that \u2018now\u2019 has meaning only in your frame. By the time, the light reaches the other frames, it is not \u2018now\u2019 for you. It is already in the past for you.This is a true even if all the inertial frames are stationary and equidistant from your frame. If the frames are stationarity with respect to each other and equidistant, it might be possible to freeze times across all other n frames. However, time has not frozen in your inertial frame. It has flowed past your \u2018Now\u2019. This is something one must understand thoroughly, that the relativity of simultaneity does not require inertial frames to be in motion with respect to each other. It can also occur even when the inertial frames are stationary with respect to each other. This is because the relativity of simultaneity is a consequence of the finite speed of light. As such it is the most fundamental relativistic effect. It is present even where other relativistic effects like time dilation and length contraction are not. If the other frames are not equidistant or stationary then the light signal will take different times to reach each frame and you\u2019ll never be able to freeze times across them. Coming to the supernova example mentioned earlier, saying that there is some universal \u2018now\u2019 or \u2018present\u2019 moment somewhere out there is just another way of saying that there is a universal clock out there, in some frame of reference, that can see the supernova happening at the same instant as that of an observer in the frame of reference of that supernova, which is not possible given the finite speed of light -which is an experimentally proven fact. If you still think that it is possible to define an \u2018absolute moment of time, then try the following fun exercise: Give me a scientific description(that is, one which can be used for making deductions and measurements) of a moment of absolute time without using any reference frames or events.. And if you can\u2019t give such a description, then it doesn\u2019t exist from a scientific point of view. Fallacy - 2 - \u201cNow, is our current temporal position. Time isn't something that flows. The word time is a term describing our motion through the temporal dimension. We time from one moment to the next. From the past to the future. Everything in the universe is timing, but, at different temporal velocities.\u201d Explanation: This is the same fallacy as above, in a slightly more sophisticated terminology. It talks of absolute time being perceived by observers in terms of different time scales. How do we compare time scales? Let\u2019s consider that you are comparing the orbital velocities of two bodies in the solar system. How do you know that the orbital velocity of one object is not the same that of the other? Answer: With the help of events. So for example, an Earth solar year is not qualitatively different from a Mercury solar year. It is the time when either completes a revolution around the Sun. So how do we know that they are on different time scales? We do so by comparing the location of Earth and Mercury in space. Without the comparison in space(in other words, an event), there is no meaning of the term relative time scale. In fact, there is no meaning of the term absolute time scale too, because qualitatively there is no difference between Earth completing one revolution and Mercury completing one revolution. So for example, if I decide to mark my current location in space and decide to call the moment when I reach the same location after completing a revolution around the earth as \u2018Now\u2019, does it have any meaning different from that of another person doing the same on another planet? No. Because both are qualitatively the same. And if you are arguing that there is a difference, then you\u2019re assigning a uniqueness to a spot in space - which is highly questionable. This is because space is again dependent on time. We are constantly moving through space. In empty space, we decide our location in relation to distant stars, which themselves are moving, but appear to be stationary because of the distance. If I\u2019m in empty space, without any astronomical objects to observe, then does the term \u2018time scale\u2019 have any meaning? No. Does the term \u2018location in space\u2019 have any meaning. No. Hence there is no absolute time or space. Both are relative to each other. Fallacy - 3 - \u201cTime is felt\u201d. Explanation: This is the most fundamental fallacy of the three. In fact, It is this fallacy that leads to the above two fallacies. According to this fallacy, absolute time is intuitively \u2018felt\u2019 without any reference to events, and it is relative time that is observed with respect to events. Since absolute time is \u2018felt\u2019, it exists, even if it can\u2019t be described. A common question that is asked to support the above fallacy is the following question: \u201cWhat feels longer? Six hours of sleep or six hours of wakefullness\u201d? The idea is that both are six hours long, but we perceive it on different time scales. So there is an \u2018absolute\u2019(because we are talking about the same observer) time scale(of six hours), but we \u2018travel\u2019 through them in different \u2018temporal\u2019 velocities(perceptions). A counter-question to ask in this respect would be the following:\u201dWhich feels longer? Three hours of a written examination or three hours on the operation table(when you are given anesthasia and when you drift in and out of consciousness)\u201d? The answer is three hours on the operation table. The reason is that we \u2018feel\u2019 time with respect to biological events. When you have six hours of deep sleep you are not observing any biological events. Hence you don\u2019t have any perception of time, while you do, when you are waking through six hours. When you are in a state of semi-consciousness on an operation table, you are subconsciously observing biological events(like your heartbeat, breathing, hunger). This gives you a longer perception of time than when you are fully focused on answering your question paper and have subconsciously cut out any distractions - both external or biological. Historically this is how humans have discovered days getting shorter in winter and longer in summer. The events of sun rising and setting are not qualitatively different in summer or winter, but when they fail to align with our natural cycle of sleep and hunger, we realize that there is a relative difference between the same events(our desire to have a meal or falling asleep) and discover that days are getting shorter in winter and longer in summer. If the differences between biological events and astronomical events were small, we would not even notice the time difference. Hence when you are \u2018feeling\u2019 time you are actually subconsciously observing biological events. Without biological events, you have no sense of time. Fallacy - 4 - \u201cThe Big Bang can be used to Measure Absolute Time\u201d Explanation: Measurements with respect to the Big Bang are not absolute. While all observers in the universe will agree on the Big Bang as the first event of the observable universe(in other words, causality), they will measure different times from the event. However, there are two experimentally verified facts that come in handy for cosmologists: The speed at which Galaxies are moving through space is very small(around 500\u2013600kmph) compared to the speed of light.The anisotropy(that is the variation with respect to direction) of the Universe\u2019s expansion is very small(one in hundred thousand). [1][2]Both are verified using the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. As a result, we can neglect the relative variation in the speeds of observers and the relative skew in terms of position in space. This is similar to how we can neglect relativistic effects in Classical Mechanics because of the low speeds and distances involved, with respect to light. But this does not mean that relativistic effects don\u2019t exist. Hence for all \u2018practical\u2019 purposes(cosmological ones, that is) we can neglect relativistic effects and consider the time measured from the Big Bang to be a measure of absolute time.(This is how for example, the age of the universe is calculated.). However, from a strictly theoretical viewpoint, time measured from the Big Bang is not absolute. Also note that the \u2018absolute\u2019 measurements given by CMB radiation are valid only for cosmological purposes. For example, the error given with respect to the age of the universe is 0.020 billion years!!![3] This is virtually useless for any other purpose than cosmology. The only thing that Big Bang provides is an origin for time. All observers agree on the Big Bang being the first event in the observable universe. However, each observer measures a different time from the occurrence of the Big Bang. Summary There is no absolute \u2018time\u2019.Time is dependent and is measured with respect to causality/simultaniety of eventsTime is dependent on the space from which we observe the events and space, in turn, is dependent on the causality of events that we observe from that space. Thus space and time are not independent of each other.A rhetorical description of time, using phrases like \u201cTime is Now\u201d is useless from a scientific viewpoint. Absolute time cannot be defined in a manner that can be used to make deductions or measurements. And anything that can\u2019t be described in a scientific manner, does not exist from a scientific point of view.Conclusion The above answer has been written from the perspective of time in physics, which is based on the theory of Special Relativity, where space and time are not by themselves absolute , but spacetime is absolute. There is also the theory of General Relativity where spacetime is not absolute and can be influenced by matter. There is also the Quantum Mechanics framework, where the temporal spread of a particle\u2019s wave function can be greater than the separation in time between events A and B. This means that the causal order of A and B cannot be always be distinguished by a quantum particle such as a photon. Some theories treat this as an asymmetry between space and time, where conservation laws operate in a different manner over time than over space.[4][5] But this is still a work in progress. Then there is the topic of Time Flow(Arrow of time), which discusses whether it is possible to reverse the order of states in a process. This has to be dealt with in a Thermodynamics framework(entropy).[6] There is also the field of Time Perception, which occurs in the field of neuroscience and psychology and this uses a completely different framework than that of physics.[7] .

            "answer_text": "what is time? is it an illusion of us or something else let's find out. first, find out what we think about time. A day has 24 hours, an hour has 60 min and, a min has 60 sec. Did you ever think where these hours, min, and sec came from, I tell you these are the pure assumptions these are the quantities to measure the amount of time passed for us for your own convenience. If you didn't assume quantities to measure something then we never know how much it's gone. so we know that hour, min and sec are the assumptions made for your convenience to measure the time and know the existence of time. then what really time is? Time is an illusion. In 19's Einstein bring the concept of theory of relativity, according to him space and time didn't exist separately they are part of same fabric called spacetime. If there is no space there is no time. Take an example we experience time because of space between us, if there is no separation(space) between us then we can't talk out time. Take another example many of us ask what is before big bang all you are asking is that the past of big bang but this question is wrong to ask because before the big bang there is no space, in that case, we can not talk about time. After the event of the big bang happened space and time itself come in existence.  so it means we can say that time is an illusion because of space between us and theory of relativity explains it.  according to relativity time is not absolute, it means in different parts of the universe the rate of flow of time may not be same, time is affected by gravity and speed, as we know when we move fast enough to approaching speed of light time slows down for us, same in case of high gravity area like near black holes. This is called time dilation, but it is not right to say because space is also effected by gravity and speed and hence space and time are related. Therefore be can experience relativity in time because of space.   without space or time, we cannot define an event lets say you want to meet someone, you tell him a place to meet but you didn't tell him where and when you two meet. what do you think this person will never meet that person. space and time are inseparable. The dimension of time. what is the dimension of time well we call its a fourth dimension as combing space and time, 3 dimensions of space and 1-time dimension of time makes 4-dimensional spacetime.  But here is a question arrives in our heads, we can move forward backward right and left in space but in time we can only move forward why is that so? well for this we have to understand the second law of thermodynamics. the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. let me explain this. what is entropy? in simple words its amount of disordersness of a system, for example, a plane mirror falls by mistake and brake into pieces, it means that the entropy of mirror is increased because mirror becomes more disordered when compared to a solid plane mirror. so the law of thermodynamics says that entropy of the universe is always going to be increase. And we know that today, your universe is continuously expanding, the more the expansion, more the disorders and more the entropy but what time has to do with that let's find out.  arrow of time. expansion of universe means the expansion of space itself into itself and as we learn earlier space and time are related to each other and space is expanding that is why time is always increasing means moving forward this is called arrow of time. suppose space become suddenly start contracting than time moves backward, but that is not true because the entropy of an isolated system is always increasing, therefore, time is always moving forward not backward.  As of now science has working on it and maybe in the future, we will know more about space, time and universe. ***thanks for reading please upvote my answer if you like it.*** ",

            "answer_text": "I have not a great knowledge in Physics but I've read some of McTaggart. In perhaps his most famous work, the paper \u201cThe Unreality of Time,\u201d McTaggart argues that time, as we know it, cannot possibly exist.  In his paper, McTaggart defends a number of premises to prove his conclusion.  This week\u2019s post will focus on one of those premises: that the past, present, and future cannot exist. We have two main ways of thinking about events in time.  First, we can think of them as being in the past, present, or future, and McTaggart calls this the \u201cA series.\u201d  As I am typing this, I am aware that this piece will be published in the future.  In a few days, it will be getting published in the present.  In a few weeks, it will have been published in the past.  The other way to think about events is in terms of how they relate to each other.  For instance, I was born before Barack Obama was elected president.  This statement is as true today as it was a week ago, a year ago, or even a century ago.  It will be true tomorrow, the day after, and in the year 10,000 as well.  No matter what, the relationship between my birth and Obama\u2019s election simply will not change.  McTaggart calls this the \u201cB series.\u201d  As you may have noticed, events in the A series change (from future to present to past), but events in the B series do not change at all (they simply are either earlier or later than each other, no matter what). McTaggart argues that time cannot exist in terms of the A series.  In other words, there is no such thing as the past, present, or future.  We may naturally think and experience the world that way, but that does not mean that\u2019s how nature really is.  That just means our brains alter how we perceive the world in order to make it more easily understandable.  If you don\u2019t think our brains would really do that to us, just go and search for \u201cthe cutaneous rabbit,\u201d or \u201cOrwellian and Stalinesque revision.\u201d  Our brain literally alters how we perceive events in time in order to make things easier to understand \u2013 the notion of the past, present, and future may be just another one of those alterations. To prove there is no A series, we must first agree that no single event can simultaneously possess the qualities of being in the past, present, and the future.  Every event, when analyzed from a specific moment, is (relative to that moment) in the past, the present, or the future.  If this weren\u2019t the case, then there wouldn\u2019t be any meaningful way to distinguish between the words \u201cpast\u201d, \u201cpresent\u201d, and \u201cfuture\u201d \u2013 they\u2019d all mean the same thing.  So, in order for the A series to exist, events must be in the past, the present, or the future, but never more than one. The problem, now, is determining whether an event is in the past, the present, or the future.  How do you determine which label to apply?  Every event, depending on when you look at it, is in the past, present, and future.  As I write this now, Obama was elected in the past. But why should I prefer this moment in time as my way of deciding what label to apply to Obama\u2019s election?  Why not look at it from the year 2000 and say Obama\u2019s election is in the future?  After all, according to the A theory, the past is just as real as the present.  Why would we arbitrarily give preference to the present moment when deciding if an event is in the past or future?  Even if you do want to defend that arbitrary choice, the same problem still arises.  Let\u2019s say you do believe that we should use the present to determine whether an event is past, present, or future.  Re-read that last sentence.  We have to use the present in order to determine an event\u2019s relationship to the present?  To do that, we again have to assume the existence of the past, present, and future.  Now we\u2019re in a circle.  We need to assume the existence of a present moment in order to determine if an event is past, present, or future.  But why make that assumption?  Because it just feels like there\u2019s a present moment?  That\u2019s not good enough \u2013 recall the cutaneous rabbit and Orwellian/Stalinesque revisions.  We cannot blindly assume that our experience of a present moment is objective and true.  Every moment feels like the present moment.  Our brain regularly lies to us about temporal matters, and that feeling of a \u201cnow\u201d may just be another one of those lies. Think of your life like a timeline.  If McTaggart is correct, then our life isn\u2019t actually a steady point (the present) going from start to finish on that line.  Rather, it\u2019s the whole line.  The whole thing is \u201creal\u201d in some strange, timeless way.  In resume , having a life with no time dependecy is a virtue. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes time exists. It exists absolutely because everything can be referred back to the Big Bang, e.g. the origin of the universe. All events exist within this universe by definition and can be ordered with respect to space-time, which gives you an absolute measure of time. That said, clocks always measure relative time. This should not be surprising since it would be a very special clock indeed that had a reference to the big bang (presumably, a very sophisticated astrophysical measurement based on macroscopic properties of the universe like the microwave background radiation could be re-purposed to do this). There exists past, present and future. This is not just an artifact of consciousness as some would have you believe but a real property of the universe. One that physicists struggle with. But it is easily demonstrated in an intuitive way: what happens, with respect to time, when you impart some knowledge that only you know to someone else? Let us say that you received a phone call, you put the phone down and you turn to your brother and say \u201cour mother is dead\u201d. There is a definite past (mom is alive) there is the present (well that is the most interesting part of the question and there is the future (mom remains dead). Now, most of the other responses are based on magical thinking. In my terms, that would mean that somehow our Mother could be alive again and other completely wishful imaginings. But we should not confuse imagination\u2014which is wonderful and magical and the source of all creativity\u2014with reality where the past is the past. You cannot change it. You can certainly edit your view of the past, but I take this question to be a literal one. Credit where credit is due\u2014Richard Muller is my source for the big bang idea. But I don\u2019t have any idea how he would view this answer\u2026.so please don\u2019t revile him if you disagree\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "As crazy as it sounds, time is nothing more than an illusion created by our minds as we perceive changes in the state of the universe around us. Start by thinking about this thing we call the \"moment\", that point in time happening right now as you read this. It is an invisible barrier between what we envisage as the future and what recall as having already happened, the past. Exactly how long does the moment last? It can't be any particular measurable length of time, as no matter how impossibly small a unit you calculate, there is an infinite number of units smaller than that. The very moment you commenced measuring a moment, the moment has already passed. Is it nothingness then? An instant transformation between the future (which does not yet exist - it is something that has not yet happened) and the past (which also does not exist anymore, except in our memories). If so, then again this proves time does not exist - there is no future, no present and no past. It is an interesting thought. It means that what we think of as \"now\" is actually the exact same \"now\" that existed at the moment of the Big Bang, the moment life first evolved on the planet, the moment King Henry VIII was crowned, the moment the American Constitution was first written, etc. The moment never passes. It is always the same - this thing we call \"the moment\" or \"now\". This is not a new thought. Einstein concluded there is no such thing as \u201cnow\u201d and is quoted as saying \"....for us physicists believe the separation between past, present, and future is only an illusion, although a convincing one.\" (To ensure I do not quote Einstein out of context, it is important to point out that Einstein concluded that the past, the present and the future might exist simultaneously, a slightly different slant on the concept that time is just an illusion). So if time does not actually exist, why does everyone think it does? The perception of time arises because everything in the universe is constantly moving/changing. Day becomes night as the Earth rotates on its axis. We breathe. We eat. We age. Things around us move. Our perception of the changing state of the universe around us, gained through our continuous consciousness, gives us the sensation of the passage of time. This perception is influenced by external factors, such as the rotation of the earth. Right now you perceive it to be a very specific time of the day or night, but that is not reality. It is just perception. People all around the world are perceiving this very same \"now\" quite differently. Some think it is morning. Some are ready to each lunch, others are watching the sun set in the evening whilst some are fast asleep in the dead of night. All of them are experiencing \"now\" based purely on their perception. Our perception of time is not fixed either. It is a well documented fact that various substances can cause us to perceive time differently, even though there has been no change in the rate of changes taking place in the universe around us. Time appears to exist. However, time itself does not exist. If all this does your head in, don't worry. The possibility that time does not actually exist does not matter. We can still measure what we perceive as time. We have constructed devices to give us very precise measurements of \"time\". We can still predict what will happen in the future or schedule things for the future based on our perception of time. The past, although just memories or recorded information, still matters. Time can be used in calculations, to prove or disprove scientific theories and to help us run our lives, but as hard as it is to accept, it is really all just an illusion. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. No, time does not exist in the universe. There are such things as change, rhythm, and process, but not time. All the forms we experience as change in and of themselves are energetic processes. There is no third party agent called time that, as it were, forces change upon what would otherwise be changeless objects. Time is a human social convention. It is a method of of synchronising our behaviour in terms of socially defined symbols, so that we may function harmoniously together in regular, predictable patterns. Time is perhaps best thought of as one of the fundamental game rules that are the basis of human community. By compromising our intuitive, spontaneous behaviour as physical organisms in order to function together according to a set of symbols, human beings are capable of highly sophisticated cooperative action that (most of the time) increases the survival chances of every individual involved. The important thing to remember about this process of pinning spontaneous behaviour to symbolic order, however, is that all these symbols are created by us, for us, and do not exist except to the degree that we give them power to dictate our collective behaviour. Now, you may respond to this, \"But I literally perceive this thing called time. It's a physical experience. How can it be unreal?\" This experience of the flow of time, progressing from the past into the future, is what we might call a conventional illusion. Now, I have to be very careful in explaining what I mean by an illusion, because this is a word that is bandied about quite a lot in fuzzy and unclear ways. An illusion is a process that appears a certain way to an observer, but upon closer scrutiny, it is seen that the appearance does not reflect the true nature of the process. Once this is seen, one's perception alters to take into account the true state of affairs. The classic example is a mirage in the desert. Our perception of time is this kind of phenomenon. When we were children, we were immersed in the many symbols and conventions that the society into which we were born uses to synchronise and dictate behaviour. The human brain is very impressionable, and we quickly learned to use thought and language to govern our behaviour. What happens is that when we start thinking in terms of the symbols given to us by our society, it's very difficult to stop, and so we are not aware of how the very act of thinking itself distorts our perception of the true state of affairs of the universe. In other words, very early on we are taken in by a kind of necessary social hypnosis, that, because we are too young question it, and it is so essential to cooperative behaviour, we rarely, if ever, become explicitly aware that it has happened. We think in terms of linear patterns of symbols. What happens is that, because the human brain has such a sophisticated reflective capacity, this constant stream of thought, combined with more sense-based memories, leave a trace upon our conscious mind in the same way that a ship leaves a wake in the water. As we think incessantly, and are constantly referring to our memories as we negotiate the world, we feel that the world flows past us in a linear way. What we don't ordinarily realise is that it is the linear patterns of thought and memories themselves that create this vivid experience of a linear flow, and that this experience is not actually an intrinsic aspect of direct perception. The perception of time feels very real indeed because the symbols in which we think are so fundamental to our lives that they have an acute impact upon our nervous system and sensory experience. The constant comparing and contrasting between memory and direct experience by means of symbols and images is the experience of the flow of time. This is almost the opposite of our ordinary common sense wherein we suppose that we use thought and memory to guide our trajectory through time, but in actual fact it is the act of thinking and referring to memory themselves that create the experience of time. The more sophisticated a civilisation becomes, that is, the more subtle our use of thought becomes to direct experience, the more deeply entrenched the illusion of time becomes. Time is so essential to socialised human behaviour today that it seems absurd to question its reality. This is why it is quite rare that an individual comes into the realisation that time is an hallucination maintained only by social consensus. Nothing is more compelling than social convention, because the use of thought and symbols to govern our collective behaviour is essentially the fabric of our lives. As modern human beings, we rely on these things for our survival almost as much as we rely upon oxygen to breath. It is not difficult to see, then, why we should be unconsciously so reluctant to see through the distortions of perception created by incessant thought. If anything could be analogous with extracting oneself from The Matrix in reality, it's that. But if time doesn't exist, what is the true nature of experience? The great difficulty in answering this question is that we are almost unable to conceive of an experience of the universe in which we are not using thought to govern our behaviour, in the same way that a fish cannot conceive of life within a medium other than water. Through practices such as meditation we can silence the thinking mind long enough to realise that we exist within an 'ever-changing now', wherein change occurs spontaneously and without any inherent linear progression. Everything simply unfolds within this now in the same way that a piece of music or a dance unfolds; unforced and not going anywhere in particular. In other words, change simply happens of itself, for itself, without any particular origin or destination. Such a state of affairs seems radically counter-intuitive, but only because we are so deeply conditioned into a way of experiencing wherein we view everything in terms of the linear patterns and agendas of thought. How can change simply happen for itself without explicit purpose or agenda? To this one can only say, \"Stop thinking and see for yourself.\" For more on this topic, see my answers to How is time an illusion? and If we were to scientifically conclude that our perception of time is un-scientific and that all points in time exist simultaneously, what would the effects of such a conclusion be?

            "answer_text": "Time is and has always been referred to as a relative concept. Philosophy and physics may seem like polar opposites, but they regularly address quite similar questions. Recently, physicists have revisited a topic with modern philosophical origins dating over a century ago: the unreality of time. What if the passage of time were merely an illusion? Can a world without time make sense? While a world without the familiar passage of time may seem far-fetched, big names in physics, such as string theory pioneer Ed Witten and theorist Brian Greene, have recently embraced such an idea. A timeless reality may help reconcile differences between quantum mechanics and relativity, but how can we make sense of such a world? If physics does indeed suggest that the flow of time is illusory, then philosophy may be able to shed light on such a strange notion. McTaggart\u2019s argument against the reality of time has a number of interpretations, but his argument starts with a distinction about ordering events in time. The \u201cA\u201d series and \u201cB\u201d series of time form an integral part of McTaggart\u2019s argument, and I\u2019ll unravel this distinction with an example historical event. On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 became the first manned spacecraft to land on the moon. For argument\u2019s sake, consider this event to represent an event during the present. Several days in the past (July 16), then, Apollo 11 lifted off the ground. Additionally, several days in the future all of the mission astronauts will land back on earth, safe and sound. Classifying an event as \u201cseveral days past,\u201d or \u201cseveral days future,\u201d falls under the \u201cA\u201d series. For the moon landing, some events (e.g. Lincoln\u2019s assassination) are in the distant past; some events are in the distant future (e.g. the inauguration of President Obama); and other events fall somewhere in between. Under the \u201cA\u201d series, events flow from one classification (i.e. past, present and future) to another. On July 16th, the moon landing would have the property of being in the future. The instant the Apollo 11 landed on the moon, that event would be present. After this moment, its classification changes to the past. The \u201cB\u201d series, however, doesn\u2019t classify events on this scale ranging from the distant past to the distant future. Instead, the \u201cB\u201d series orders events based on their relationship to other events. Under this ordering, Lincoln\u2019s assassination occurs before the moon landing, and Obama\u2019s inauguration occurs after the moon landing. This relational ordering seems to capture a different way of looking at time.

            "answer_text": "Yes, time, just like consciousness, does exist from our perspective. You wrote a question in the past, now I\u2019m answering your question in my present, and you\u2019re (hopefully) reading my answer now (in your present and my future). Thus, this proves that time exists and you have consciousness. That said, there are still many things we probably don\u2019t understand about time or consciousness. Certain things we may never know in this life. If you\u2019re asking about time existing OUTSIDE of our plane of existence, that\u2019s where things get interesting. It\u2019s pretty easy to understand that one of the two scenarios probably exist outside/beyond our existence: A) Time does not exist. or B) Time is not governing. We know this because if \u201cnothing\u201d ever existed, then we would not be here, as it\u2019s impossible for something to come from nothing. The fact that I (and you) have consciousness proves that we do exist. Therefore, beyond our existence, there was never a \u201cbeginning\u201d and it can be further extrapolated that there will likely be ever be an \u201cend\u201d. At least something, possibly everything, always existed and will always exist. These ideas are very difficult to really wrap your mind around, as they are very incongruent with what we know in this existence. To come to the understanding that something always existed and never had a beginning is more mind-blowing to me than anything I have ever known. I feel like it\u2019s a small peak behind the curtain. If you think about it, it\u2019s possibly the only fact that could never really concealed about what\u2019s beyond our plane of existence. Trippy. ",

            "answer_text": "Technically, no ... time does not exist.  What we've ever been measuring when we measure \"time\" is the motion of matter.  Motion by definition has a rate, since objects exist within 3-dimensional space and a changing of position inherently has a rate of change.  This rate of change is from where we've distilled the concept and the measurement of what we call \"time\", and it's seemingly a reliable measurement for what we use it for. However, consider our most reliable timekeeping device, the atomic clock.  Suppose we developed an advanced timekeeping device that achieved a measurement 1000 times more exact, that could report 1000 times more slices of time every second.  What we'd like to do with such a timekeeping device is use it to verify the quality of the atomic clock.  We want to see how well the atomic clock keeps rhythm and how consistent its counts are.  One tick of this new clock we'll call a \"pixie\".  So we use this new clock to measure how many pixies there are per atomic-clock tick.  And predictably we find that it varies slightly and occasionally wildly, how many pixies go by in between each atomic tick. How can we determine what's going on with our atomic clock??  The answer is...  we can't.  Not only is it impossible to determine which clock it is that's varying to cause the inconsistencies, but some of the environmental effects that are causing the inconsistency could be affecting BOTH clocks simultaneously.   The inherent difficulty here is that timekeeping devices are a PHYSICAL standard.  They measure the motion of matter which is susceptible to skew from a huge assortment of physical forces. Time doesn't exist, only matter exists...  and matter can be in motion. ",

            "answer_text": "Time is a dimension much like space. So if time is an illusion, so is space. Also, time corresponds to energy, and space to momentum. Which would mean that energy and momentum are also not real. That seems unlikely to me, so I think that time is real. The so-called arrow of time is a different matter. There are three arrows of time:  The thermodynamic arrow (entropy increases)The psychological arrow (we remember the past but not the future)The cosmological arrow (the universe always gets bigger)The thermodynamic arrow is statistical, because there are more ways for entropy to be higher than lower. So if there's a change, it's far more likely that it's going to a state with more possibilities than fewer. In terms of heat, which was what it was originally about, heat flows from hot to cold. Put an ice cube in a glass of hot water, and you get a glass of lukewarm water later, not the other way around. The psychological arrow is because our brains are Shannon information processing systems, as are computers. The brain gets hot and then cools off. That's thermodynamic, too.  The cosmological arrow is that the universe always gets bigger. That may be the same things as well. It seems to me that a smaller universe has fewer states, and there's less range for entropy. Start off like that, and the only way to go is up.  There's a bit more funniness. If you look at Maxwell's equations, they should work just as well backward as forward. So why can't we hear tomorrow's radio broadcasts? The best idea seems to be that they do go back in time, but they always hit something that reflects a signal forward in time that completely cancels it out. Pretty cool. That would only work if the universe was smaller, down to a point, so there's always something to hit and reflect forward. You can't pick up the broadcasts because the reflection and cancellation has already happened. If the universe is always getting bigger, eventually, there's nothing to hit, so there's no reflected signal coming back in time to cancel it out. That's a pretty cool idea, too. Whether it's an accurate model is another thing. ",

God never gives a pop quiz about where the attention belongs.Education DEMANDS we commandeer the mind from God\u2019s grasp.Talk about rude! Talk about Grand Theft Mental. When we direct the mind, we feel like God.When we don\u2019t direct the attention we are God.See the diff? If we let go, we let God \u2014 duh! Obviously! See the secret?See the blessing.See the bliss? Between every dot.There\u2019s God\u2019s Mind moving. We don\u2019t decide what dot is the next one to attend.Almost constantly the normal life is God moving \u201cour\u201d attention. Almost always the average human is being divinely directed.Seriously. Actually. Blissfully. Wondrous. Now you know why the saint bows so deeply when meeting you. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess you mean does time have a tangible nature? Because if it doesn't, and its an abstract, then it exists only in our mind. Well, if time is a tangible thing, there would be evidence of its existence. You cant touch it, see it, hear it or smell it. There is NO evidence of it causing anything (don't make the mistake of confusing time measuring something with time causing something). All outcomes are the result of energy differential...time isn't an energy (at least there is no evidence of it being so). Time doesn't 'do' anything. ALL WE EVIDENCE ARE EVENTS HAPPENING.  Zillions and zillions of quantum events. That's not evidence of (tangible) time; this is merely evidence of events. So, if there is NO evidence of times tangible existence, we must start with the premise that it is abstract - i.e. time is just a word that we have attached meanings to (as opposed to a 'thing' that we have attached a name/word to such as a door or gravity). IF time is just a word, then its meaning is simply that which we (the originators of the word) choose to attach.Then if you look in a dictionary there appears to be many uses of the word time. BUT if you break those many varied uses down they split into two separate distinct though similar CORE definitions:-1 Time is the abstract framework (mental model) that we use to measure, calibrate and reference events. It is the T as used in mathematics and science. 2. Time is a non-specific set of events  - for example when we say \"time passes\" what we are really evidencing are events happening (there is nothing more we evidence). This dual definition of time is comprehensive for all uses of the word. [It therefore demands that space-time be recognised as an abstract reference framework too - you can't mix two paradigms of incompatible nature]. Time then is merely a word that allows us to frame events (and to calibrate intervals) either in a mathematical framework, or as a collective expression. So in answer to your question, yes, time exist, but only in our minds. The underlying fundamental (tangible) to which it refers are events. ",

            "answer_text": "What time is ? We have divided time into past, present and future. But if we closely observe our own life we will be surprised to know that we almost alway live in the past bypassing the present. The time called present is a very very thin line in between the past and the future and it moves in so tremendous a speed that, it is very difficult to stand on its first moving current. Before going to different parts of time, let us first try to understand what is time. What is time ? Is it a truth ? Is there really anything called time? There is of course space and there is continuous movement and change in it. There is also a birth or beginning of space , as science says, so there must be an end of it. There is beginning and end of things, birth and death of life. From this beginning and end , the concept of time is born, otherwise there is nothing called time. Time is , therefore , a concept of human mind to measure the rate of change of things, of life. Change is continuous and happening at this very moment which is called the present. So there is only one state of time, the present. Present is the only truth of time. There is nothing called past or future of time. Past and future are nothing but the expansion of time by the human mind. What we call past is just a heap of memories, an accumulation of memories lived or experienced by our senses in the time present, the reality of life. The present, the reality of life is moving or changing in such a tremendous speed , that we are not sensitive enough or our sense organs are not strong enough to live the present, live the realities of life always, each and every moment. So the mind collects and stores them as memories to live them again and again at leisure. These memories are lived or recurred as thoughts. To summarise, past is just a bunch of memories and thoughts, a reality that has already become a thing of the past, a dead thing, a death. And it is a paradox and also a matter of great surprise that all lower animals live in the present, live there realities sensitively but man having all abilities and sensibilities to live the realities of life live almost always in the past, in thoughts, in memories. Man lives not life but lives death. This is indeed a serious problem of human life and it is of utmost necessity to explore the cause and remedy of it. Though we call the past time Bhoota kala , not in the sense of ghost or apparition but surprisingly it seems nothing more than an apparition which has already been turned into a ghost riding on our shoulders. To get rid of that ghost, let us then explore how memory is formed to create the concept of the past. The realities that we live through our sense organs, create sensations of pain and pleasure on our body and the moment we react to them they turn into memories and are stored in our mind. We generally react in the form of desire s, that we desire pleasure and desire not pain. The more strong is the reaction or desire , the more deep and long lasting is the memory. So it is the desire that is responsible for the formation of Bhoota , the past. If there would have been no desire , there would have been no memory. If at all it would have then it would have been not so deep and strong to turn into a ghost to occupy and acquire our mind. Is it possible then to remain neutral and unaffected to whatever happens at the present , to the sensation of both pain and pleasure? Can we live life just as an audience not as an actor , just as a witness , as a drasta not as a bhokta ? Then only perhaps , we will be able to live the reality sensitively from moment to moment and there will be no bondage of the past, the ghost . Let us then try to know how to overcome the pressure of memories and impressions which creates division of time. Earlier we have seen that there is nothing called past and future of time. It is a creation of the mind out of its stored memories. If at all there is a state of time then it is only the present. The present is reality, is freedom. But because we do not live most of the time here and now , which is the present and caught by past memories that weighs on us making life a false movement. To overcome it's pressure , we must first know what memory is and how it is formed. Out of depisited memories a hard disc of Sanskar takes form. What is Sanskara ? In a life time whatever action is done, remains deposited in the genes of the cell as impressions and in the mental field as memories. The deposits of memories in the mental field take the form of Sanskara. In fact, all those actions that put a deep scar in the mind remain as Sanskara till the last moment of death, which acts as a seed for the next birth. After death, though the genes get destroyed with the decomposition of the body, there is no possibility of destruction of the Sanskara, being a very subtle world of feelings. What we call mind, is actually a state of consciousness in the body, where the deposits of memories take the form of mind. The destruction of the memories deposited in the consciousness become impossible with the death of the body, as they are the impression of subtle feelings very close to the nature of consciousness. To overcom the pressure of memorie or to be free from suffering, is therefore to be free from Sanskara and to be free from sanskara is needed change of the old habit pattern of the mind, which are churning of thoughts, instability, fickleness and netting of hopes and desires. What actually is the cause of the old habit of the mind? When the external world enters into the body through the sense organs, a wave of sensation runs throughout the body. When mind reacts to the sensation, which is basically of either pleasure or pain, gets automatically stored as memories in the mind. The deposits in due course take the form of Sanskara. Because of ignorance, though we search and see the cause of pain and pleasure in the outside world, yet, the cause lies in the reaction of the inner mind to the sensations of pain and pleasure created in the body. If the mind, without being attracted to the sensation of pleasure and repelled by that of pain, remains just a seer of those sensations, then there is no possibility of birth of Bikara (mental dirt) or Sanskara. It means, the mind which was so far an enjoyer of pleasant and unpleasant sensations, has to give up its old natural habits and remain as an unaffected seer. And it is possible only when mind is able to see truth of it, that the sensation of pain and pleasure is impermanent. To see the truth, the mind must first be calm, quiet, alert, and aware. We know a lot of the external world of living and non-living, but are ignorant of our own inner world, our body and mind. Though, we have some control over sense activities, but no knowledge and control over the activities, such as blood circulation, digestive system, respiratory system and nervous system. We can have a gross idea about the anatomy of the body by reading books, but it is impossible to know the action and reaction, movement and vibration, birth, decay and death taking place inside innumerable cells and innumerable atoms in the cells of the body. Also we are ignorant of the nature of the mind, the reality and activity of its subconscious and unconscious state. The activities on the surface mind are nothing but the reflection of the activities taking place in the inner mind. That is why, in spite of all efforts to keep the surface mind calm, quiet and pure through rituals and intellectual discourse, the deposited Sanskara of desire, anger, greed and lust in the subconscious mind come up like water bubbles through loopholes to make the surface mind polluted and unstable. It is therefore necessary to make whole sphere of mind pure and free from Sanskara. Let us now know, how Sanskara is made and grows with the interaction of the body and mind. The five senses, the eyes, nose, ears, tongue and the skin are the means for the formation of Sanskara and form, smell, sound, taste and feeling of touch of the external world are the subjects related to them. But the real creator of Sanskara is the mind. So long the mind is not conscious and active, senses do not bring any result. After the senses come in contact with their related subjects a wave of sensation is created throughout the body. Then a part of the mind becomes aware of the sensation, which is its cognitive activity. Another part of the mind then, investigates about the sense related objects and with the help of the memories stored earlier, recognises their state of realties and evaluates the nature of sensation created in the body. When the sensations are evaluated as either pain or pleasure, they become stronger to force another part of mind to react. The reactions manifested are in the form of craving towards pleasure and aversion towards pain, which are again deposited as memories in the mind. Through the process of cognition, recognition, action and reaction the Sanskara thus is made in and by the inner mind beyond the knowledge of the surface conscious mind. Desire is born out of craving for pleasure and aversion for pain. Mind always desires for pleasure and not for pain. The source of pleasure and pain are in the outside world which are in a flux as per the law of nature and therefore are impermanent. Along with the body and mind, the whole material world is changeable and impermanent. But mind desires pleasure to be permanent which is not possible. Therefore suffering becomes inevitable. Suffering as such is the truth of life. But because the desire for pleasure gives birth to suffering, it becomes an unending chain in which life becomes entangled. The ignorance of the mind of the truth of impermanence is the root cause of suffering. ",

            "answer_text": "Time does exist. If you understand the basic concepts of Special Relativity, you understand Time Dilation. If time did not really exist, it would have absolutely no deviations from its natural state of going in just one direction and not being dependent upon anything. If that were true we could hypothesize that time is just a man made construct which aids our understanding of various theories but in truth, there is only the present time, since we have no proof that time is not a \u201cconstant\u201d phenomenon, in other words, it does not really exist (or need to exist) since it only behaves in one way with absolutely no change. It is just something that we tend to experience (since our brain stores memories and always tries to predict the future). But Time Dilation has shown that all of this is not true. That time and space are very much dependent upon the observer. Both space and time work together on this (one affects the other), which is why we use the word \u201cspacetime\u201d. With so many experiments and applications of Special and General Relativity, we know that the theories are correct (it could be that they need to be extended or improved upon, but certainly, they have shown that time does change and vary with different observers). If you go near a blackhole (see: Interstellar), time for you moves very very very slowly compared to, say, the Earth. One hour near the blackhole could be 7 years on Earth! This change in experience of time because of being under influence (of the gravity of the blackhole) shows how time can be affected by gravity and hence begs us to believe that Time is real! It does exist! ",

            "answer_text": "Time does not exist. Only the illusion of time exists within a conscious observer (ie a time keeper).  To the conscious observer change of position within space creates the illusion of time. To model this, time is a function of a conscious observer, something moving, energy acting on this something moving and space for this something to move from one position to another position. Time is always the dependent variable. These factors create the illusion or perception of time. If time was real and moved, it would require or even would create energy, it does neither. Unfortunately, our society's need and desire to over simplify processes commonly leads to time's misuse as a independent variable (i.e. x/bottom axis in graphs). This misrepresentation of time acting to \"cause\" phenomenon is taught and reinforced in our society almost everywhere. We are taught that time causes action. Time \"causes\" the recycling bin to overflow that needs to be taken out on Wednesday, my children to move to the next grade in school and us to get old. However, time causes nothing to happen, it is the byproduct of observable action. Of course, that does not negate the practical fact that the recycling goes out on Wednesday. One comes to this question, \"Does time exist?\", perhaps in search of the fundamentals to their own existence. When I think about my life and it's \"obvious\" beginning and end, time becomes the perceived vehicle of my demise. If I intelligently deny time's existence then I also, in a way, deny my own possibility of non-existence (though subconsciously).   While physics is commonly used to define time or defend its existence or not, this topic is more personal, psychological and philosophical than physical. Time is constructed by the conscious observer (you) and thus it's existence or illusion of existence is only relevant to the you. ",

            "answer_text": "There's no doubt whatsoever about the existence of time. If we didn\u2019t have it, we wouldn\u2019t have causality, and if we didn\u2019t have causality, it would be next to impossible to just coincidentally have this extreme complexity around us, emerging out of nowhere. It is because we do have causality inside this time dimension, which made it possible to start with this nearly perfectly homogeneous, dense, expanding quark plasma, right after the Big Bang, which had both very low entropy (a measure of disorder) and very low complexity, to be causally interacting to slowly change this soup into the high complexity, medium entropy as we find our universe today, ultimately ending with low complexity again, but maximum entropy: the heat death of the universe. It\u2019s analogous to the change inside a glass of milk and coffee;  Entropy continually increases, but the most complexity is right in the middle.  It is this continuous increase of entropy towards one direction of time that is completely responsible for what we call \u2018time\u2019 in our day-to-day lives. Think of entropy as the measure of disorder of a system, referring to the number of microscopic states it can be in. For instance, when we shoot pool, and hit the orderly cluster of billiard balls inside the triangle, entropy will be most likely to increase. But if all those balls somehow happen move in the exact opposite direction and speed, after our first shot, they would actually meet again in the lower entropy triangle shape.  According to physics there is nothing that says that the reverse situation is an impossible situation, but it is just highly unlikely. Imagine then how incredibly unlikely this must be for the particles that makes up our Universe! When we look at a video recording that\u2019s played back in reverse, all the things that look strange to us there, are phenomena that simply show an unnatural decrease in entropy. All the strange phenomena in reverse are explained by it. All of it. Balls starting motionless and suddenly bumping higher and higher, because the chaotic motion of molecules (heat) from the floor are suddenly \u2018tunneled\u2019 in unison at just the right moment into one single direction into the ball. Luke warm water in a bathtub, changing to hot water on one side, and cold water on the other side. Shaking a box with black and white balls, resulting in neatly separated black balls on the left and white on the right. Infants solving Rubik\u2019s cubes. Eggs un-frying. Etc., etc\u2026. Even though all these unnaturally entropy-increasing phenomena are technically physically possible to occur like that in real life, it is just ridiculously unlikely, similar to the (much likelier) situation of billiard balls meeting up into an orderly triangle shape. But if we\u2019d actually zoom in to only a few particles within any of these weird entropy reversed examples, it now actually looks perfectly normal. Every single interaction between just a few particles always looks perfectly natural, played either forward in time or backward in time, just like any collision between two billiard balls always looks perfectly normal when played either backward or forward. It all has to do with there being more possibilities for the system at large to go into an increase in entropy, than a decrease in entropy. All laws of physics work the same way forward in time as they do backwards, except for this statistical law, known as the second law of thermodynamics. The only reason for why there are so many more possibilities for an increase in disorder, why we always see entropy increasing, and why we experience this direction of time, is because at one side of the time dimension there somehow was this extremely low state of entropy, right after what we call the Big Bang. With a Big Bang at the \u201cother side\u201d of the time dimension, we\u2019d simply experience time flowing away from that direction of low entropy, but our current particles would then look like their CP reversed anti-particles. Maybe all of time before the Big Bang has entropy increasing towards the other direction, and is that the side where all our missing anti-particles went. Time seeming to have a fundamental direction is somewhat analogous to space seeming to have a direction for us as well, being near a source of gravity.  The reason it is so much easier for us to know the details of the past, and not the details of the future, is because it ends up being more precise and easier to calculate towards the lower entropy direction, even when only processing just a fragment of the information provided, like for instance a small part of the light reflected by a surface. The higher entropy direction of time on the other hand is much less precise to calculate to, especially when handling only a fragment of information. With just a small calculation error, the difference might escalate to set other things in motion that wasn\u2019t taken into account, even ignoring the probabilistic nature of our reality. If just one billiard ball happens to hit some other orderly triangle of billiard balls on the table, we see a completely different situation at the future side of time. But calculating the other way around is much easier. We just have to look at a broken egg on the ground, and we immediately know that was an unbroken egg before. But when we look at an unbroken egg, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s gonna fall, gets eaten, or ends up rotting away somewhere: there\u2019s just too many branches for which we need more detailed information to calculate. Of course, our brains calculate both the future and the past side, it\u2019s just that one side is a lot clearer than the other, even though we lose a lot of details of history as well, the further we go. But we lose the details of the future side much faster. As long as we are alive, our evolved bodies are fighting against increasing entropy where it\u2019s unwanted, by consuming low-entropy energy sources, and excreting back what we've eaten in a higher-entropy form. It\u2019s not enough to just receive energy, we need free energy: F\u2261U\u2212TS, where F is free energy, U is regular energy, T is the temperature, and S is the entropy. Note that the term TS comes with a negative sign. For instance, the sea has a lot of heat energy, but it\u2019s by no means free energy. We get a lot of free, low-entropy energy in the form of short-wavelength radiation from the Sun, which then largely re-radiates back into space. The difference? Earth's radiation goes out as long-wavelength light with added entropy:  Our own bodies consume low-entropy energy from food and emit high-entropy long-wavelength radiation back, and tries to keep itself in a low entropy state, by continuous repairing and avoiding, as long as we\u2019re alive. The information in our brains, on the other hand, depends a lot on the natural mechanism of increasing entropy. Just think of a nice, orderly packet of data in the form of photons, entering our eyes and hitting our retinas, which sets off this collision course of interpretations inside our brains. Again, the reverse is also technically possible, but extremely improbable: our brains setting off signals to our eyes, shooting off photons from our retinas. ",

            "answer_text": "Take two pendulums of different lengths. You will find that their oscillations don\u2019t coincide. We can take some oscillations from a quartz crystal and we an quantify the difference in the period of oscilation of the two pendulums in a number of quartz oscillations. So we have a quantity that can be measured and, by convention, we call this quantity time. Its units should be a certain number of cycles that we deem to be stable. In fact the unit of time (the second) is defined as follows: \u201cThe second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom.\u201d But, in practice, we find the second, just like the metre is variable according to the relative velocity and acceleration (or gravitational field strength) of the observer. So time exists in the same sense as space exists, not as an object, but as a measurement system and which, together with space, differentiates events. But \u201cspacetime\u201d exists in another sense: It is the \u201cmetric\u201d or \u201cfield\u201d which is deformed around a mass which gives rise to these differences in our measurements of space and time. We are used to the idea of an electricomagnetic field being deformed by the presence of a charge, a magnet or a current. We can also think of a four-dimensional field called \u201dspacetime\u201d distorted by the presence of mass which affects our measurements of time and distance. To sum up, time exists as a measurement system of a number of cycles, and spacetime exists as a field which can distort these measurements. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe some of these explanations will help with your questions.  If you orbit a black hole, if you look at things outside of the black hole from your perspective you see things speed up, if another person looks at you outside of the black hole, from their perspective, they see you slow down. So while you are inside the black hole you see things speed up, and I guess your seeing a different place in a different time. This video below is a good example of what I am talking about.  Some people think time will stop, or reverse when the speed of light is broken. I think that time would continue to stretch with time dilation. Speed of Light (c): Light travels at a constant speed of 1,079,252,848.8 (1.07 billion) km per hour. That works out to 299,792,458 m/s, or about 670,616,629 mph (miles per hour). That is just a random number. If you could see a light clock, on a light beam exceeding 670,616,629 mph, I doubt you would see it freeze, and stop, but this is my opinion, I could be wrong. As for going back in time, by exceeding the speed of light, I doubt that would happen also. If you could see the behavior of a light clock as it travels at the speed of light. You would see the the beam move from the top of the clock to the bottom, and back to the top again, to complete 1 second, as the light clock moves forward through space. If you are not familiar with what a light clock is you can see how a light clock works in this video below, you can skip to 20 minutes, and 30 seconds to see the explanation about how a light clock works.  So you see the light clock create a V shape, as it moves from the top to the bottom, and back to the top again. So no matter how fast you are going the V shape is just going to get longer, and longer as speed increases, from point A to point B, even if the distance from point A to point B is googolplex long amount of distance in light years. The V shape of the light clock, would never stop growing longer as speed is constantly increased, or stop, or reverse, why would it, it can't. Even if it takes a googolplex amount of time in light years for the light clock to move vertically by 1 cm, time has not stopped, message me if I am wrong. If you have a time machine, you need to be able to lock up the time period you left from causality effects, effecting it. Imagine if the time machine you had could move things from the past, from the future. Move a quark out of place in an atom in a grain of sand, on a beach 1000 years ago. Something as little as this, is enough to change the whole history of the earth from that point on.  If you watch videos on the grandfather paradox it is a misconception that you can have enough time to stand in front of him to pull the trigger, let alone have a conversation with him.  You cannot go back in time and get the winning lottery numbers, you cannot kill Hitler, stop Pearl Harbor attack, you cannot save JFK, or stop September 11th. You can only change these things if the time machine can lock up causality effects (keep the time period you came from from causality effects effecting it) But the changes would never count in reality you came from, just the other dimension you went back into, and messed around in. If a machine can do something as amazing as recreate the past, then locking up causality should be no problem for the time machine to do. Maybe people from the future go into the past in the technique I described above, or have the technology to view the past from the future on a television monitor, without causing any causality effects. These are the only two ways I can think of that do not effect causality. In another causality experiment I thought if its the interactions with people, and other things which cause causality, then what if you went back in time into a solid thick steel container, that was buried ten miles deep down in the in moons crust, it would be one mile thick in every direction up, down, left, right, forwards, and backwards. So if you go back in time into the container on the moon, it should not create any causality effects, because you do not interact with anything. The ripple effects of causality have been subdued. There would be dampening systems in the container to stop your vibrations, but it may not be enough, and not work at all. Just interacting with the air molecules could be enough to cause causality, even the space in the container. Dark matter, and energy is still not understood, and time travel into the past into the steel container could have an effect on the way dark matter, and dark energy effect other objects, to maybe cause causality.  Unless the aliens have a time machine, but they are not going to share, because we are about money, greed, exciting our excitatory neurotransmitters, and power, and cannot be trusted, even if we can understand the time machine technology they created, if explained to us by them.  Aliens explaining how their time machine works to us, It might be like explaining calculus to a ape. Maybe we are just not smart enough to understand it. The most visited place by a time traveler if possible, would be the bookstore depository where Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK, or the Dinosaur period.   Maybe there is some clues around there of future time travelers, especially in the Zapruder film of JFK being assassinated.   Some people think this lady in this picture is a time traveler, they call her the Babushka Lady. Short term time travel though like 10 seconds into the past, I am unsure about the outcome, in this other thought experiment. The time is 11:45 a.m. a time traveler decides to visit himself in the past, he would go into the past at 12:00 p.m. exactly, back in time to 11:50 a.m. He would go back in time from across the room from himself, (because both time traveler's cannot occupy the same space). So at 11:50 a.m. he knows that he will see another copy of himself appear from the other side of the room. But he says to himself before the time travel experiment, that no matter what happens, it must be set in stone that he must go back at 12:00 p.m, because if he does not, who is the other person standing across the room from him. So can the time traveler visit himself, have a conversation with himself for less than 10 minutes, before going back in time. I am unsure to what's the answer? Will time and space, not be able to handle this paradox, and causality would instantly kill him.Causality would thrust him instantly somewhere else, but not kill him.If it is allowed a endless loop would be created, where time would never go past 12:01 p.m. ever. Because it was set in stone that the time traveler would always go back in time at 12:00 p.m. no matter what happens. So what the 4th possibility.Look at Ronald Mallet's time machine on YouTube, but it can only send information back to the point when it was switched on. Orbiting a black hole to time travel into the future is a lot safer than using a neutron star, because of gamma waves, and there would be a problem with the landing, neutron stars have an escape velocity of about 33% the speed of light. Which means that any object caught in a neutron star\u2019s gravity would be accelerated to a tremendous speed. If you are not ripped apart during your descent (you would be), all of your atoms would most likely be destroyed upon impact, for the most part you would be turned into a pile of neutrons. There is also this YouTube video below, of Stephen Hawking explaining how to a black hole can be used to time travel into the future, by orbiting the black hole. Hope this helps.  ",

            "answer_text": "Entropy exists - and as a consequence, so must time. The second law of thermodynamics essentially states that the entropy of the universe is always increasing, and it never decreases. Not even if the entropy is pulled into a black hole - which one would think may be a good way of removing it. It is this knowledge of entropy that allows us to determine the direction in time that any given particle or object is moving. Thus, there is a direction. And there is movement, or magnitude of difference between one moment and the next. Sounds like we have a vector - a mathematical object with a magnitude and direction. From what little I know about it: time is considered to be a scalar quantity (and not a vector). It is said to be a scalar because it lacks \u201cdirectional\u201d quality. But entropy irrevocably binds a direction to time. Thus there may more than one way to consider time: we could remove entropy from the measurement and hold it to be a scalar quantity - or we could include entropy in the dimension of time - whereby it would seem to take on a direction, and thus, become a vector quantity. Perhaps this would be known as entropic time, or absolute time? Then again, absolute time would not be the best name, as absolute value removes directionality and reduces vector quantities to scalar quantities. Something to think about\u2026 and then again, I expect relativity theory would shred my idea of absolute time as being completely blockheaded. But we still must account for the increase in entropy providing for direction to events that occur in the universe. This does seem to impart some kind of absoluteness to the mix. Regardless of absolute time or not - the quantity of entropy - and it is a real quantity (measured in Joules or Watts per Kelvin) - makes time an imperative phenomenon in the universe. If time were not real - then violation of the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics would be possible. But at this moment in time - we know of no phenomenon capable of violating this law, and as such, time must exist as a correlation to this law. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A: From my rather simple (minded?) understanding this seems to be a pretty complex and challenging topic. On one hand it is very clear that time does exist in the form of the measuring system we use to order and understand sequences of events. Just as fathoms, pounds, and liters don\u2019t occur naturally but help us understand the physical properties of nature so do months, minutes, and milliseconds help us understand the temporal ones. Where it gets complicated is sorting out what exactly it is we are measuring and it's fundamental relationships to reality. It strikes me as somewhat similar to our understanding of gravity. We have the means to very precisely measure, model, and predict the effects of gravity but as far as I know it is still unclear as to what it is. I think it's safe to say that what we perceive as the passage of time is a property of the reality we observe. Whether this reality is some infinite realm of all possible outcomes through which we are charging one particular course, or if our course is the only one there is, or some other multiverse or similar model, or something we can't even imagine seems to me difficult or impossible to discern at the present time. Much has been written about this by people far more expert than I so I will leave it at that rather than embarrass myself with further rambling. ",

Time per se, time as such, it is-, and it does nothing. Time is a subjective construct, a mere effect, an epi-phaenomenon. The subjective construct, it has many names: INFORMATION, awareness, thought, idea, concept, PROPERTY, truth. My own favorized terms are perceived-hood, observed-hood, very real illusion My own praeliminary listing of them subjective constructs = very real illusions: !!!ALL!!! sensations, emotions, problems, values, ought-hoods, should-hoods, necessities, intentions, purposes, wills!!!ALL!!! parameters in the language of physics: MASS, distance, area, space, time, velocity, acceleration (gravity is an example), force, pressure, power, ENERGY, temperature!!!ALL!!! Constants, Axioms, and LAWS - of legislature, !!!AND!!! of logic, morality, physicsALL them so very well !!!KNOWN!!! G-Ds such as Mr.YHWH, Mr J(THE)C, Mr.AllahThe immediate subjective construct giver is the brain. It elicits the individual human consciousness, the entirety of the momentarily-being-elicited subjective constructs that is, as an {end-effect of a physical perception-process} TO-, ON-, OF, obtained/acquired FROM-, ABOUT- cause, the eventual objectIVE template = Information-SOURCE which is the [entirety of] matter [aka cosmos] The subjective construct as such (it-self) can not be detected, observed, perceived. It can only be symbolized, manifested, proclaimed, laid down, determined, defined, measured, asserted as it is since recently turning out on QUORA in an incurable and disgusting frequentness. The proclamations themselves, THEY! are a part of the cosmos (matter), the part which is man made. They are Secondary Information-SOURCES An example of (primary) Information-SOURCE is S\u263cNNE (well, in my language) An example of INFORMATION = subjective construct is time Time is an end-effect of causality. Via the perception-process \u201c \u2192 \u201c in the brain: S\u263cNNE \u2192 {time = perceived-hood = subjective construct = Information}Time itself is not even detectable, thusly is not a causal agency. ONLY the human action is not an end effect of causality: The action is or it creates a SECONDARY information SOURCE, an example is a man made clock or a watch. S\u263cNNE \u2192 {clock = man made object}again, time is an end-effect of causality. Via the perception-process \u201c \u2192 \u201c in the brain: clock \u2192 {time = perceived hood = subjective construct = INFORMATION}Do you realize that time as such is on no occasion detected, perceived, observed? no, it is merely made up? \u201cTime\u201d as a subjective construct is an example for a very real illusion. We do elicit time from a natural- or from a man made clock, yet we firmly believe, that \u201ctime\u201d must be somehow in existence on its own, which is not the case. If you are inclined to argue: I know for a fact that is not only all Theists who proclaim \u201cG-D created time, it is a part of the cosmos\u201d - but there is also many, many scientists who proclaim \u201ctime CAME INTO BEING during the Big Bang\u201d which does not change anything about a MISSING (totally undetectable) fact \u201ctime\u201d - all that you CAN detect, on this occasion, is objects that are moving or have parts in it that these are moving. Another example for the illusionary nature of the subjective construct: We know for a fact that a sensation is a subjective construct fabricated inside the brain. When a limb is \u201churting due to a physical trauma\u201d, the subjective construct \u201cpain-sensation\u201d is elicited inside the brain, yet the brain provides us with the illusion that the sensation, the perceived-hood, the information, the subjective construct made up inside itself, be located accurately where the trauma - the objective information source is located, on the limb, outside the brain that is.

            "answer_text": "In a spatially 3-D universe, it certainly appears so, although many things, such as delayed choice experiments and Bell\u2019s inequality and more strongly hint that Time may be, as a property of the universe, far less fundamental than it seems. Moreover, a simple mind game predicated on well-known physics shows that indeed, Time as we perceive it has got to be an illusion. Here goes: Simple relativistic mathematics\u2014the Lorentz transformation\u2014shows that time, speed, and distance do not exist independently of one another but are inextricably entangled. The way this interdependence works out in the real world is counter-intuitive: stay put and look towards some star light years away. You happen to be, as you contemplate deep space towards that star from your fixed position, simultaneous with some event A on it. But now walk towards it: you have now become simultaneous with some other event B on that star, that happened (depending on your walking speed and the distance to the particular star) hours or even days earlier than the event A you were simultaneous with mere seconds ago when you were standing still. Now turn on your heels and walk away from the star: you have now become simultaneous with yet another event C, which took place hours or days later than A, and twice as long later than B. So far so good, it's simple math. But what happens if you start spinning, dervish-like, around your body axis? Then the right half of your brains becomes instantly and continuously simultaneous with events on that distant star that are separate by hours or days from the events your brain's left side is simultaneous with, although both your brain halves are closely, if not perfectly, simultaneous with each other. The whole concept of time has irremediably broken down. My 2015 monograph [The Far Horizons of Time] analyzed the issue and concluded that the only possible way out of the conundrum is that Time is not a fundamental variable of a mathematical universe, but a side effect of something more fundamental. That more essential something turned out to have to be, in some form or other, mindstuff. (Note that this analysis only shows that mindstuff has to be a more fundamental property of the universe than time, not that there may not exist something else, deeper still than mindstuff.) ",

Some of them might have started to become Relativitist.These days we have Relativity and Relativists talk about Atomic Clocks speeding up and slowing down, and because we think of Atomic Clocks as working at a totally fundamental level, we talk about Light Speeding up and slowing down. The problem is that Atomic Clocks are no more fundamental than Light is. The fundamental timekeeper is probably two levels below Sub-Atomic at least, and it is there that beating heart of the Universe decides how fast everything goes. So Relativity is sort of fine, until somebody realises that the Atomic Clocks are not only speeding up and slowing down but they are not keeping pace with the thing that is really governing Time. At that point constant Light Speed will definitely be buried for good. ",

            "answer_text": "In my opinion, time on its own doesn\u2019t exist, but it is possible to artificially define time. What is certain to exist is radiation and matter. These are the substance origin of our universe, they form what we call space-time and which everything else emerges from it. With radiation alone it is clear that it is not possible to define either time or space. Trap radiation between two mirrors or in going round in circles and you have rest energy, and with it comes rest-mass and gravitation. And by counting the number of such rotations/oscillations, a trapped radiation makes, we get time- we have here a local clock. Also consider that if you look at an empty patch of the sky, you can\u2019t find how deep it is- that is unless you find something material there, then you can send light and get it back(at least in principle), count the number of rounds of the local clock and we can tell distance. So we see that both time and space are created with the creation of mass, which we couldn\u2019t tell of their existence before. Nothing in the universe is static, and the smaller you go the higher the speed is- till hitting the limit of c at about the size of the electron. Motion involves changes in space and time together. Thus we see that in fact, it is space-time that was created with matter- which was already there when we had radiation, but we could not tell anything about it. On creating mass however, it is possible then to associate distance with linear motion and time with circular motion. Another way to separate space and time (artificially again) is by infinite averaging. Averaging over space gives us time, and averaging over time gives us space. The reason for saying \u2018artificial\u2019, is that to find distance we needed time as in sending the light beam example above. ",

            "answer_text": "In my view, The Time is determinant for The Universe. It has a big or small role in all interactions and existences as a variant.Because of being untouchable, non controllable, non routable features, we generally thought about it as a sense. Also in equations, we can not describe it more than a scalar quantity used only for measurements of interactions and actions. Because, I think, Our \u201cdimension definitions\u201d are inadequate. We define the Dimension according to features of Spatial dimensions. So, The Time is not a spatial one. My opinion, The dimension is only a vibration field with a vector for energy. When we think the dimension as a vibration field, if the energy can not vibrate then this means there is no dimension or there is a curled up dimension. In my approach, I claim that The Time is a wave sourced from the expansion of the Universe. It is propagated from expansion edges through inside of the Universe with a period 1 Planck Length in 1 Planck Time. This frequency can interfere with every kind of frequency in the Universe. While the Matter was in 2d-plane form, by interaction with the Time, it was bent and turned into 3d form.  Because The Time also carries an amount of energy and because of its direction, it is a vector quantity.We can determine the Duration (as perception), how many of these waves had been passed.We can guess \u201cthe Future\u201d and \u201cthe Past\u201d, according to the position of these waves. In addition, if there is a worm hole, we can catch our part time waves or can go the the future waves as mathematically. (But we can not change the events of future or past because they occur only at the Now, when the event and the waves were together in the same reference frame.)We can determine \u201cthe Now\u201d according to passing waves of our or events reference frame.  Every slit of \u201cthe Time\u201d, a Wavelength has as a Planck Length. Because of this, there is not a shorter distance from this distance. All matter are undulated by these waves according to their spin, included energy, mass, velocity, etc. For example, I think, when the nucleus has excited by these waves according to its features, it oscillates at some constructive interference phases. The Electrons, can place in the amplitude of this vibration field around the nucleus as depending on Planck length or its coefficients. Does time exist? Yes, It does. ",

One may say that time doesn't exist because it is a creation derived from the mind. However, one might say it does because space exists and things happen sequentially. For this reason, time exists. It's a very hard thing to think of because it basically challenges everything you've ever learned. It is possible that time does not exists and we only perceive time as it is because we want to.  Imagine living in a world without time as we know it. Things wouldn't get don't. But because we have clocks, we can do things in a designated... time. Now imagine a world where things happen randomly, there is no time. You would see our self getting married, then eating breakfast when you are 5. It would be absolute chaos. Then again, if that's how we lived, we wouldn't know any difference.  Keep in mind this is an extremely hard topic to think about because it, like I said, challenges our thinking. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that time must exist in some form, because we experience it. Disregarding the various creation myths, I assume that this universe was not intentionally designed by an intelligent being. Rather our universe is just one out of countless others, and by chance only, ours supports intelligent life such as humans. With that said, our universe was never designed with any grand purpose in mind. And it wasn\u2019t designed so that we would have the \u201cgift\u201d of consciousness, or the gift of perceiving the passage of time. Our universe has no plan, because nobody is behind the wheel. There is no reason why our consciousness would be necessary in order for this universe to function. And yet we do perceive the passage of time. Why would that be the case if time wasn\u2019t even a piece of the universe? Also, time seems to flow in one direction only. Because if all events existed simultaneously in the universe (as some people suggest) then we should be able to remember the future as well as we can remember the past, and that doesn\u2019t happen. For these reasons, I believe that Time in some form is real. ",

            "answer_text": "First, I have to tell you, I have no qualifications to answer such questions so what I'm giving is just a perspective of a common man For me , time is a dimension where we move continuously in one direction.  Time surely cannot just be a perception because then, different people would be living at different times. That is, if I set my clock at t=0 and fall asleep (for eight hours of someone who remains awake) and I wake up, I feel like only one second has passed whereas for that guy eight whole hours have passed. So we would be at different time periods. Individual perception of time is hence not allowed.  Time is a standard measurement which we have defined because its obvious . It is a unidirectional dimension with a constant modulus....like a constant velocity vector , one might say Why Time is often ignored as a dimension is because of this reason.  Now coming to your last sentence, \"How do we keep everything from happening at once\" What is \"happening\"? For me , happening is, one body moving from one set of co-ordinates to another  We can prevent \"everything from happening at once\" because the dimension that you have ignored (time) is actually in a state of continuous motion. Let me define a simple universe where there is just one body A body A can move from (1,1,1) to (2,2,2)....and  from (2,2,2) to (3,3,3)......here, the two events are the two displacements They dont happen \"all at once\" because , I've not given the fourth dimension in the bracket (ignoring it since its obvious) Actually the two events are Body can move from (1,1,1, Time dimension T1) to (2,2,2, Time Dimension T2) Hope I made some sort of sense ",

From that, humans refer to those events that are perceived to have already occurred as \u201cpast\u201d events, those that are occurring contemporaneously as \u201cpresent\u201d events, and those that have not happened in the \u201cpast\u201d or the \u201cpresent\u201d as \u201cfuture\u201d events. From this, it is easy for humans to begin measuring, and, in turn, to see all things as existing in a measured sequence we call \u201ctime.\u201d One of the interesting aspects of \u201ctime\u201d is that it is perceived as one-directional, while all other movements can be reversed.

            "answer_text": "Time? Hold my pint... There are actually four distinct KINDS of time: Societal, Scientific, Cerebral and Pure. Let us examine them\u2026 Societal Time is the one everybody is familiar with; it drives our lives. The average working stiff wakes at a time, leaves home at a time, gets a bus and/or train at a time, arrives at work at a time, has lunch from a time to a time \u2013 then leaves work at a time, gets another bus and/or train at a time and returns home at a time, to find his wife waiting with a martini or beer and if he is really lucky, wearing a baby-doll nightie and a come-hither grin \u2013 also at a time. This is the COMMERCIAL world \u2013 everything working to a CLOCK. Then there is Science, where everything works in SECONDS. Like, one Watt is one Joule per Second. You do not NEED minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, centuries or even millennia, because you have kilo-, mega-, giga-, terra-, peta-, exa-, zetta- and yotta-seconds. And one yotta-second \u2013 one times ten to the power twenty-four \u2013 a one with twenty-four zeros after it \u2013 a million-million-million-million \u2013 is over thirty thousand million, million years. And going SMALL, you have milli-, micro-, nano-, pico-, femto-, atto-, zepto- and yocto-seconds. And one yocto-second \u2013 one times ten to the power MINUS twenty-four \u2013 one OVER a one with twenty-four zeros after it \u2013 a million-million-million-millionTH \u2013 is the amount of time between a traffic light in front of you turning green \u2013 and some yahoo behind you yelling, \u201cOi mate, what shade of green are you waiting for?\u201d But thus far, all time is governed by that damned clock. However as a retired person, Cerebral Time governs MY life. It means that I look at my tasks for the day and estimate how long they will take, whether I need daylight to do them, whether I can be arsed and so on \u2013 based on several decades of previous experience. And minutes and seconds are replaced by the abstract \u2013 time becomes SPACE. A high IQ helps here, since it confers on the victim the ability of spacial awareness. As for television, both retirees AND workers have had the convenience of VCRs for over thirty-five years and hard-drives for more than ten. So only a DUMMY watches the medium at the whim of TV schedulers (I have rarely watched television LIVE since 1981). Which brings us \u2013 and not a moment too soon \u2013 to PURE Time. First, a few words about Time TRAVEL. This is perceived to be the ability to travel PHYSICALLY backwards and forwards through the medium and is utter BOLLOCKS. We ALL travel forward in time when we sleep. And if the scientists ever perfect Cryogenic Stasis, those hours could become centuries. However, we are/would be hibernating. The world will grind on remorselessly without us. The real trick is travelling BACK in time \u2013 but there is a PROBLEM. \u201cThe past is another country; they do things differently there\u201d is a misquote (it is actually \u201ca foreign country\u201d) from a book written in 1953, when few travelled abroad \u2013 but in terms of Time Travel it might as well be an ALIEN planet, since we will NEVER get there. Aside from the many tortuous paradoxes involved (don\u2019t even get me started) we KNOW that Time Travel cannot and NEVER WILL be achieved, because if it were, events like Woodstock, the Kennedy Assassination and \u201c9/11\u201d would be inundated with future Time Travellers. And the many photos, films and videos taken at Max Yasgur\u2019s farm, Dealey Plaza and the upwind rooftops of Manhattan on the relevant days clearly show all the people involved were contemporaneous. Period clothing would never disguise the inappropriate expressions the Travellers would inevitably be wearing. The reason Time Travel is impossible is because like the future, the past DOES NOT EXIST. There is only NOW. The concepts of Time we are all familiar with are Man-Made Constructs. What we call The Past is merely a record of previous Nows \u2013 and The Future, just a prediction of Nows to come. Neither can be reached, because RIGHT now \u2013 both are absent. And they always will be. Thus we can say, unequivocally, that PURE Time is merely two words which together \u2013 mean NOTHING. Sorry. ",

This last one gets a bit tricky, as I understand it (could be wrong) mass will accelerate or decelerate depending on the motion of its frame of reference but EM radiation (photons) do not, they have a constant velocity (represented as C in the famous equation E=MC^2) but the curvature of their trajectory can increase and decrease (frequency too) when they enter the deeper curvature around massive bodies. That\u2019s known as general relativity. Then there is the notion of Absolute Time (or universal time) but that appears to be word play, nothing useful for us, because the 1st law of TD: energy cannot be created, so although the forms of energy have a history and a future, energy itself is timeless (perhaps you read the position that time is imaginary, that all existence exists in the one and only moment there really is, which is right NOW, but everything moves and we notice that movement so we feel that time is a real \u201cthing\u201d, etc. etc.) ergo no \u201cabsolute\u201d time. So, to ask does time exist, the word refers to both the feeling we feel when we observe changes and when we measure the rates of change, etc. ",

People, meetings, plains, trains, buses that you have to catch or attend to at a certain time? How can you then put into question if time exists? You probably went to school every morning at a certain time, later to highschool at a certain time and spent a certain amount of time there? Did you not? Did that time you spent there and the hours when you had to attend - not exist? Maybe it is the concept of existence that you want to ask about? Well, all things (even your thoughts and dreams exist) otherwise you would not have them. Time is a concept that describes a certain form of our existence being humans - animals have no time. They live and exist - period. What is time? :) \u2026 well, there are many theories about that. But the way we order memories and events is one way of seeing time, another is that it is - together with space (the different \u201crooms\u201d you are in on a micro and macro level) - a form of our perception. I believe that time is both these things for us humans. Does time exist on an objective level? Outside of the human mind and perception? Yes. It does exist. Time is a sequence that is linked to all that does exist. A sort of length and order of events. A before, during and after things or objects/subject are in existences. So even when there is no human to experience time - time will be linked to all that exists. So - time is a part of all that exists. In the existences of eternity there is no time. There is pure and sole: existence - being. ",

It began when man first recognized the recurring patterns of the motion in the stars, the moon, day and night and so on.  We broke it down into increasingly smaller increments as our need to remember, record and plan increased.  As our skills improved the demand for better planning increased.  So too, the need for improved technology in time keeping. For most of this human era our concept of time has been adequate, primarily because we were pretty well stuck to a small area on Earth.  This is rapidly changing.  We are moving faster, leaving our planet and soon the solar system.  We explore deep space.  Our abilities to plan are challenged more than ever.  Physicists examine our world in more ways looking for better answers to deal with managing our expansion.  Physics, the behavior of matter, has until recently been predictable.  Now we pursue the mysteries of quantum physics where predicability is troubling and probabilities difficult to ascertain.  Our concept of time needs to reevaluated as well.

But then I saw a video where Neil Degrasse Tyson was explaining the space/time continuum, which for some reason I had never really grasped, and didn\u2019t even realize it. I stubbornly persisted in thinking that space and time were separate, but they are not. They are irrevocably intertwined and where one is concerned, so must be the other. So the question might be more complete in this form: Do I think the space/time continuum exists? The way he explained it, so that even my simple mind could understand was this; if I say to you, let\u2019s meet tomorrow at three o\u2019clock, what would be your next utterance? Yes, of course, you would ask me, where? And if I said let\u2019s meet tomorrow at the golf course, your next word would be, when? It is space/time, not space and time. Does it exist? It certainly does, in my humble opinion, because it works. If we agree to meet at a certain place at a certain time, and we are both dependable, then said meeting will occur. If it wasn\u2019t real, I don\u2019t think that would be the case. It\u2019s real enough for me, at least. It\u2019s like when I consider the question about is life really just an illusion? If it is, as long as it is so real that I cannot tell that it is an illusion, it might as well be real, and new evidence to the contrary notwithstanding, I will continue to assume it is real, and act accordingly. It\u2019s worked so far, and that\u2019s all that really matters. If it is all an illusion, none of us can tell, so what difference does it make? We are temporal creatures, we experience the passage of time, and indeed, it is hard to imagine existence without it. So yes, I think it exists. ",

The way that we are made makes us experience things this way and see the world the way we do.  But reality isn\u2019t at all like we think. Modern physics tells us that time isn\u2019t infinite (it started at the Big Bang, and may well end) and can move faster, slower and even in reverse. If this shatters your world-view, get over it. The best objective view of time I\u2019ve encountered was penned by Boethius 1500 years before relativity, quantum mechanics or the Big Bang:  Eternity is the simultaneous and complete possession of infinite life. This will appear more clearly if we compare it with temporal things. All that lives under the conditions of time moves through the present from the past to the future; there is nothing set in time which can at one moment grasp the whole space of its lifetime. It cannot yet comprehend to-morrow; yesterday it has already lost. And in this life of today your life is no more than a changing, passing moment. \u2026 For though [the whole universe] apprehends and grasps a space of infinite lifetime, it does not embrace the whole simultaneously; it has not yet experienced the future. What we should rightly call eternal is that which grasps and possesses wholly and simultaneously the fullness of unending life, which lacks naught of the future, and has lost naught of the fleeting past. (Boethius, Consolation, pp. 68\u201369) Another allegory that I find useful is that of a tapestry.  The horizontal dimension is time and the vertical is space.Every person's life is a thread with a start-point, an end-point and a finite length. We can only see the threads we touch: threads that are in the same horizontal location (time) and close vertically (space).But the tapestry\u2019s weaver, looking at the whole, sees the entire length of our thread, as well as all threads to our left and right, above and below.The best objective view of time is that events depicted in the tapestry don\u2019t happen at all, they simply are.

For physicists, it is primarily a mathematical concept that can take on different values depending on the frame of reference and is in principle (at the level of quanta) reversible, and duration is simply the numerical order of changes in space. For Swiss clock makers it is something that can be measured by constructing more and more refined (and expensive) watches, from a thermodynamic point of view the second law can be seen as the arrow of time (nobody has so far defeated Maxwell\u2019s daemon), for humans time can be experienced differently, where it can pass subjectively more slowly or quickly or-momentarily- stand still. Our bodies have many oscillating systems which could be described as \u2018time keepers\u2019 the most salient being our metabolic rate: when it speeds up time slows down subjectively, if it slows down it passes more quickly. So, sitting on a hot stove which will increase your metabolic rate, a minute might seem like five minutes. Night and day (and the moon too) signals to us, along with all other animals, the temporal rhythms which govern life. Also, emotions can influence our perception of time: http://ttps://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/the-fluidity-of-time The only meaning the concept of time has for us is in relation to our experience and understanding of the world. Here I think nobody has, so far, improved on Kant\u2019s proposal that time and space are the two fundamental cognitive categories into which we order our experiences. They are not to be thought of as having an existence independently of us, but as the basic principles through which we construct the phenomenal appearance of the world. It is they that impose the way we perceive the world. From this it follows that time exists as a concept which we are compelled to use to project onto the flow of experience a temporal order, because the category is a \u2018build-in\u2019 feature of our cognitive (even physiological) apparatus. Here a poetic take on it by Johann Gottfried von Herder, 1744-1803, a contemporary of Kant (those two knew about each other), and my attempt at translating it. Ein Traum, ein Traum ist unser Leben  Auf Erden hier. Wie Schatten auf den Wogen schweben  Und schwinden wir Und messen unsre tr\u00e4gen Tritte  Nach Raum und Zeit; Und sind (und wissen's nicht) in Mitte  Der Ewigkeit. A dream, a dream is our life On earthen here. Like shadows on waves we hover And we disappear And measure our leaden steps In space and time; And are (unknowingly) at the centre Of eternity. ",

In few decades the physics will introduce the speed of time - instead of time dilation or time contraction - which are confusing terms. They are resulted from the fact that we put the carriage in front of the horses. We correct the observation to be according with the theory instead of correcting the theory to be according with the observation. For instance: We consider in theory that we need to have constant, invariant universal speed of light which is the same in all the Universe regardless the reference frame. For that we have to correct our clocks because \u201cthey are wrong.\u201d If we do not correct they will measure different speeds of light. Nice! Isn\u2019t it? But in the future we will consider what the clocks will show: different speed of time. Why speed of time? Because it is a also a confusion to explain that in a space ship which flies with a very high speed ( near the speed of light) everything it moves slower than on Earth. It is easier to say that the speed of time in that racket is slower than on Earth. But the Earth is just another system , not the absolute one. There are other systems in which the speed of time is faster than on Earth. If we look from the Earth to the spaceship we see the crew moving slower than we on Terra. But if we look to another system with faster speed of time than ours we see those habitants moving faster than we do. Why speed of time? Because we will work with that speed in physics and we will represent it like a vector. So, if we will work with a speed of time like any other speed, we might say that the time is as real as the notion of speed it is\u2026.. ",

Time can be measured, quantified, observed, and is a critical parameter in understanding natural phenomenon. Time exists so much as anything else in that it is part of our experience of life. Greater questions may be something like is our existence real? Its life a dream? Are we in the Matrix? These greater questions would include an answer about time as part of larger whole. Other discussions are Einstein's idea that time is an illusion that we experience or that Christian God can see through time. While there are many fantastical discussions like this, on a practical level time is real and defines my experiences. You are waiting for a response on Quora because time exists. In my estimation, we should keep it real. We are talking about if time really exists. Yet the concept is so fundamental to our experience that we all know what it is and how it operates and how it defines our lives. So much as my experience of life is real, so is time. Time may be mysterious, but that in no way makes it less real. Time is as real as gravity. I feel that even if time really is some kind of illusion, it is the consequence of something grander. And thus it is real manifestation of that grander thing. ",

            "answer_text": "What time is remains a mystery. General Relativity ended the notion of time as being separate from space such that rather than discrete time and discrete space, we have spacetime. Hawkins proposed that at the earliest stages of the universe, time was actually a 4th spatial dimension that, over time (whatever that is), became a temporal dimension leaving us with only 3 spatial dinension: length, width and depth. The so-called arrow of time is also a mystery. Paul Davies, in one of his many books, posited that there were three bases for the direction we observe: cosmological, having to do with sequence of the unfolding of the universe; psychological (how are brains perceive the march of time) and entropic, which has to do with the law of entropy that states in a closed system, things inexorably move from a state of high order to lower order. Time is useful for measuring things and as a term of many scientific equations, but I always ask myself: If there were no intelligent life in the universe, would there be such a thing as time? Time is change, but how to account for change has stumped smart people going back to Ancient Greece (I believe Aristotle, at least, struggled to explain it, and believed, I think, there was no such thing as change).

As an irremovable component of spacetime and a variable that appears directly or indirectly in most of the equations of physics, it's as real as anything else that we say exists. The doubtful part of time is our shared experience of a moving present (The Unreality of Time - Wikipedia ). This is likely psychological, but might be impossible to transcend as consciousness has little meaning without it. But even in this worst case, its existence depends on whether the word existence is meant to apply to the world as it seems, or only to a deeper reality that is independent of our observations. It is only to the latter kind of existence that the apparent 'flow' of time might not belong. ",

None-the-less, I'll add my voice to the choir to say, the answer seems (so far) unanimous. No, time does not exist. It is a convenient form of measurement created so that humans can simultaneously gauge the span of history and not be  late for their upcoming dental appointment. Everything that did, could have , or might have occurred in the past along with all that will, may, might, or could happen in the future all happens in the perpetual moment of Now.The reason this question just won't go away is because a century or so ago the good Dr. Einstein conflated space and time in his Theory of Relativity. This theory is still often quoted,  promoted, and revered as though it had come down off the Mount with Moses and the no-nos, achieving almost Biblical devotion. This, despite the fact many of it's most important axioms completely break down at the quantum levels.Time may offer endless advantages but in the Holistic Universe time has no more claim to existence than the inch.

            "answer_text": "Atomic clocks add an interesting wrinkle to the conversation.  Optical lattice clocks (OLCs) using ytterbium atoms set a new published record for stability in August 2013 with a precision of 1.6 \u00d7 10-18.  At this stability, two such clocks would differ less than a tenth of a second over the age of the universe; this was 10 times better than previous experiments. If time is a figment of our imagination, we seem to be able to measure it with some significant level of precision.  If we could measure ghosts at that level of precision, I might begin to believe in ghosts (wink). To be fair, the purpose of atomic clocks is not so much the measurement of time as it is the establishment of a time standard.  Since time is relative, it is helpful to have a stable standard that we can use to calibrate other clocks, synchronize activities, and accurately measure change.  Since we humans invented a standard that defines the passage of time, in one sense you can say we invented time.  However, just as distance still exists regardless of what units we use to measure it (inches, centimeters, Angstrom units, etc), time exists regardless of the fact that it is relative (the relativity can be measured) and regardless of the arbitrary units we establish to measure it. I'm not necessarily a fan of time, but a universe without would be less eventful.  Ha! ",

Please read further. Let us start from Einstein. He proved that \u201cEverything is Relative\u201d, so time is irrelevant\u201d. Among physicists, there is absolute;y no doubt of their contention that time really & truly exists. Even assuming Einstein is correct, in reality, the time elapsed by movements of planets around the Sun can only be assessed by relative positions of planets & Sun. When we say Einstein was born 138 years back represents time elapsed between his birth day & today. When we say yesterday, today & tomorrow, all these represent some unit of time between any two. When we say there are 24 hours/day & earth takes 365 days to make one complete rotation of Sun, implies that time is involved. It is the time which indicates relative positions of planets. Just imagine(Which is unreal) that planets come to standstill. What happens ? Earth does not rotate on its axis & does not orbit round the Sun. When there is \u201cNo event\u201d taking place, what is time which does not exist now. This clearly means that only the relative positions of objects & their movements dictate the need of time to evaluate events. Analysis of time has no real significance, if not related to practical event or incidence. We cannot reinvent lost time. Time at \u201cPresent\u201d is zero or non-existent. But taken with reference to the \u201cPast\u201d or with reference to the \u201cFuture\u201d, time comes into picture. Our \u201cConsciousness\u201d is single but gets divided due to material manifestation & makes all the difference involving concept of time. Time becomes a means to explain events or incidents at different part of the day. Time is absolutely integral part of the Universe., as long as the Universe is in action & motion. As long as material manifestation is there, concept of time is real. If there is no space, we will not be here & no activity & time has any meaning. Time & Space are interlinked. If there is no space or assumed that a situation before the Universe came into existence, was a single point or nothing was existing, the time did not have any significance or time did not exist. With no activity or event, the time does not exist. Absence of time is a hypothetical case & against universal law. Both time & space are subjective & are not things to count upon. They are our perceptions to describe an event. Time is an indication of interval between any two events. It is also the only indication of moment of change in any action or incident. A plane starts flying from Delhi at a certain moment & lands at Bangalore after a certain period, accounted as \u201cTime of Travel\u201d. A pendulum swings between two extremes of left & right. The period taken for number of swings indicates time to represent as number of swings per minute, simply called as oscillations per minute or \u201cPeriod of Oscillation\u201d. Time involved between any two events is \u201cTime Interval\u201d. CONCLUSIONS:- In the material world, time exists to account for every incident meaningfully. \u201cWith the blessings of Saptha Rishies & Almighty\u201d.

Way batter than what Newton and Leibniz did. In brief: Barbour considers the spacetime as a potentially infinite set of \u201cslices\u201d that one can perceive as continuous, like the photograms of a movie. This is not a very new idea, but he starts from geometry to explain how it can be possible. On the other side, Smolin denies the non-existence of time and mentions a number of reasons why Time must have a real existence, not just being a consequence of the thermodynamics laws. Nobody has an answer, but you can make your own opinion after reading both those books. My prefeerence goes to Barbour but it\u2019s just a question of personal tastes. ",

My personal theory is that time is not linear. The past is gone, therefore it no longer exists. The future has not yet happened, therefore it does not yet exist. Within this paradigm, time can only exist in the present. Einstein was inspired when he discovered the relativity of time. ",

The motion of energy causes things to either progress or regress, grow or decompose, generate or degenerate. As we observe change in matter, even our experience as matter, we sense the concept of time elapsing because of the ever motion of energy. If energy were to stop moving, which it never truly does, time would also stop. Despite popular terminology there is no \u201carrow of time\u201d as if time moves in a certain direction. It is energy and matter that can move in certain directions. Time is not the measure of the direction in which energy may be moving but simply its positional motion, that is its vibration. The sense of past, present and future is our sense of the passage of time as it has lapsed, is elapsing and know it will elapse, though time is not actually moving in any direction. Time moving in a direction is a conception of the mind, but time does exist. ",

We do so because it is one of the most generally applicable perception we all vaguely share. If time were to stop completely, would any movement still come to past? No. Conversely, if everything in the universe stood still, would time pass? Well, no human is there to measure them, so perhaps it is not around? Well, perhaps another being capable of movement within such immobilization could perceive time, but then does time apply to such creature. So, to my observation, time only exists as a measurement unit for humans. If we have a more standard movement, or concept of measurement that is more consistent, we might as well call it a frame (a measurement of a scene), or a movement (a measurement by a particular movement), instead of a second (as in measurement of time). Example : When we are standing too long and felt bored, that is a reaction to our body not making much movement, I\u2019m bored not because of time but because my blood circulation is moving slower.

You see, according to my theories and simulations, time as a dimension is nothing than the arbitrary measurements of the flight of celestial stones. (to make it simpler, better explanation in my book Thus Rule I The Energy of Time that you could read for free on Kindle ). Our scientific world hardly knows or have any inkling what the 88% of The Universe is for. My theories, since 1995 and going!, are the first to bring the Time not as a dimension but as supreme energy/power/ movement/life that governs everything in The Universe (some people call it Dark Matter/Energy!). Nothing could exist outside The Energy of Time, which is totally ignored by the best minds of twentieth century and going strong! Time is not the arbitrary movement of celestial stones, but the energy that moves the very stones! Everything from a thought or a smile to a ever faster moving galaxy are powered and exist within the confines, rules and 'behaviour' of The Energy of Time. Our bodies/particles will never travel in time, but the Energy of Time will travel for the incalculable next big bang. Best Regards Mircea Michael Colesnic ",

            "answer_text": "Time is definitely a perception, just like change is. If nothing changed, how would you tell time? Of course, things do change, so time is always perceived, but you have to realize that it's a perception. Just because time doesn't exist on its own, does not mean the everything happens at once. You can choose to use your memory to order events that you perceive and create a timeline, but it is still a choice and artificial. If for some strange reason none of the inputs to your senses changed, and you didn't keep thinking, then events have stopped happening, or rather, it is the same event, so you cannot create a timeline and so you really shouldn't perceive time anymore.

            "answer_text": "Time is the only thing which has not been conquered by science yet, for despite all the progresses made and advancements done, we have still been unable to move against it, i.e., we, till now have not been able to move ahead of time, meaning that not been able to go to future, nor have we been able to live even a second twice or go to the past. Indeed, science also says that travelling to past is impossible (though, in coming 100s or 1000s or even more years, there may be a future travel owing to Einstein\u2019s hypothesis that, if we would move with speed greater than that of light, we can move to future!). So, time is a kind of supreme power (for humans have not yet conquered it, and once they will, even the universe will bow before the mankind!), which is just passing by in a single direction (no reverse movement) and is an entity used in the entire world to govern the events passing by. Therefore, time does not exist ( obviously because, it does not have mass nor it occupies space), it\u2019s just a term denoting the duration of events but even if it does not exist, we are always within it\u2019s hold and also surrounded by it (sort of!). Never disrespect or underestimate the power of time, whatsoever may happen coz you cannot hold it, neither by your money nor by power or anything else! Time is just-Time! ",

            "answer_text": "As far as we can tell, time is essentially entropy. Here is a great youtube series from Minute Physics explaining this idea. The gist of it is that every observed law of nature that we can see doesn't really have a time preference. The math for gravity, electromagnetism, etc work just as well forward and backward in time. The thing that changes with time is entropy, that is, things get more disordered going from past to future. It is entirely possible that time as we perceive it is simply an after effect of the general level of disorder increasing. ",

For any observer space and time can change but the speed of light remains constant.Also photons have an energy which is directly related to frequency and that frequency is actually the number of vibrations per unit time. The lesser the time it takes to complete one full vibration, the more energy it has.So if space and energy are real, time has to exist. ",

So time is a perception of our mind to satisfy the limits of our brain thinking.Our brain has a limited capacity for thinking & imagination otherwise the sense of  time what we feel now will appear to be a foolish thing for us. Maybe in the future our brain further develops and we will realise our thinking about time was odd for all these past years. ",

Beyond this intellectual construct, cycles exist in all living things regulated by biological 'clocks'. Life could not exist without the coordination of the many functions that maintain it.  The predictability of the passage of days and seasons leads to the sense that time is fixed. However, science has proved that the rate that time passes is dependent upon the force of gravity on an object and its motion through space. Time exists in different forms and is relative to the observer and the observed. ",

Time is a rather abstract and anthropomorphize way to make sense of the rate at which change occurs. Rate of change on the other hand is not constant, it is contextual.

In this sense it exists as a very low order frame that is not really very complex or engaging in terms of mechanism or gameplay. How do you travel through time in this world - you can't unless you have stumbled into a thread which is in the midst of the time traveler revolution. Which means some place where they discovered how to travel through time.

Paul Follows, Awakened Meditation TeacherAnswered just now The difference between illusion and real is whether the thing exists as it appears to exist. Time appears to exist without depending on the mind witnessing it, but is that true? How can we tell? If time does not require the mind for it\u2019s existence what time is it at the exact centre of the earth? The concept collapses. Time is therefore just a concept. Concepts only exist as thoughts. We can therefore say that the appearance that time is not dependent upon mind for it\u2019s existence is an illusion. We can therefore also say that \u2018real time\u2019 is simply the mind\u2019s creation of the concept \u2018time\u2019 Check another way. What time is it exactly? No matter how accurate your timepiece it will not be perfect. Against what absolute time? Yet if we answer the question \u2018what time is it?\u2019 with the answer \u2018now\u2019 We are never wrong. That shows that it is truly always now and any other answer cannot be deemed true because there is no absolute time to check against. Self and space can be explored in similar ways. I have only found them to be human constructs too. ",

Causality is what connects phenomena in reality, not a time flow. Nevertheless, the causality is mostly so complex, that we are not able to perceive it, the less understand it. We just perceive the sequence of phenomena and because do not understand the causal links, we believe they happen in a certain sequence. To describe the sequence we need the concept of time.The naturally observed categories \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d (when perceiving relations between individual phenomena) required sooner or later also a kind of ability to express the measure \u201chow much after X?\u201d and later also in the opposite logic \u201chow much before Y?\u201d. It made the mind to perceive a permanently flowing sequence. For practical reasons of thinking and later also of communication, a certain measure was necessary, first, the natural one (day and night periods, year season periods), later human-made ones, such as converting periodical pendulum moves to the clock-hand rotation on a numbered dial etc. ",
