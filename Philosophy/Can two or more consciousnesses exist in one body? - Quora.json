            "answer_text": "Many confusions in the answers. Personalities are not consciousnesses but contents of consciousness. Cerebral areas are involved in specific mental functions but consciousness is not experienced as a mental function. It's an integration, a fusion, a whole. Hence a fully connected nervous system can only constitute one consciousness. The other consequences are: According to our state of awakening / integration of connections our consciousness can include a more or less extended relationship to the world. During sleep it is reduced to fractions, such as the dream. When a mental function is not integrated with the rest it does not become a 'second consciousness', at least not of the same order as the first. It's an isolated mental function, stupid. You can imagine, for example, that a fish consciousness has settled in a corner of your head, but without any means of communicating with it and without the ability to influence behavior. Too coarse. Intermediate between an motor reflex and our habitual consciousness. The example of the octopus is interesting: they have 8 nerve centers, at the root of the tentacles, of almost comparable importance to the central brain (50 million neurons each and 250 million in the brain). Connected to each other at the highest level of integration, the 9 centers form a unique consciousness in the octopus (at least most likely because its interview did not resolve the issue). They are capable of conflicting decisions, one tentacle attempting to catch food and another pulling in the opposite direction because it received an electric shock on the last attempt. Thus the octopus certainly experiences in all its splendor the concept of polyphrenia, that is, the impression of being several people at a time. But all this lies within a single consciousness. ",

            "answer_text": "That reminds me of a conversation with psychiatrist Mark Salter, cited by journalist William Storr, who was interviewing Dr. Salter in the context of people who seemed to change personalities when performing on stage: Quote Dr Salter: Call it Multiple Personality. We can all have them William Storr: I don't have multiple personalities Dr Salter: Well, try a little trick for me: Just imagine a version A and a version B of yourself and have a conversation in your head between them as you drive home from this interview. You know, like, \"What are you doing tonight? Well, I thought I'd write up this interview Well you could, but there's some great TV on I know, but I have a lot of backlog work to deal with ...\" Carry on like that for one hour and I promise you, you'll scare yourself. Before long, the first voice will become, say, more outgoing and develop a liking for art and German techno music; the second one will be introverted and prefer science and South American heavy metal..... Unquote Most often though, and very sadly, split personalities are precipitated by traumatic events as the brain seems to try to protect its owner by decohering - which is how DID conditions begin.

            "answer_text": "We have two consciousnesses, always, because we have two brain halves  It is just that a person with an unaltered brain have the corpus callosum \u2014 i.e. the bridge between the two halves \u2014 intact and as such the two consciousnesses constantly communicate and seem like one. But for a person where the corpus callosum has been severed, the two consciousnesses may actually start disagreeing with each other, as shown in the video above. As for more consciousnesses than that: no, not likely. ",
