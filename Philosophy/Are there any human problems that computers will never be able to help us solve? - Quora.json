            "answer_text": "Hi,I am sure humans can have problems computers can't solve or don't want to solve or should not be able to. For instance, most humans have the problem of too little (cash) money. And when I have an itchy bottom, I am not sure I want a computer or robot to scratch it for me. But if you mean: will computers eventually outsmart us and be able to solve \"all\" (except those like the one above and some related to being human) problems that humans can solve, in my opinion the answer is definitely YES, and within 50 years. It took evolution about 3.7 billion years to produce humans. Conversely, computers exist say since around 1935, if we start with Conrad Zuse. In less than a century they have become a billion times faster, smaller and with a billion times more memory. Imagine if they get a billion times faster in the next century (we did it before). The oponents of AI are losing more and more terrain. First compters managed to win from humans while playing tic tac toe, then checkers, next chess and recently also Go. Of course, much of this is \"narrow AI\". However, it is just a question of time before we have figured out how to make systems that exhibit general intelligence also. Once we have systems equally smart than humans (this event is known as \"the singularity\"), we can make millions of copies of these and they can learn from knowledge on the internet and books and other sources. Imagine if these millions of computers work together on making their successor, while having all the knowledge available known to mankind. In the beginning (starting from the singularity) we could be faced with an exponential growth in machine intelligence. This will slow down because of lack of resources (electricity or energy, materials for the hardware, limits because of physics, like speed of light, which makes it even hard for robots to do interstallar travel).  We haven't understood all of quantum mechanics and there could be (and most likely there are) limits on how fast information can travel, despite quantum entanglement. Personally, I do not believe in \"instantaneous action at a distance\", even though some experiments seem to have confirmed this. Maybe there is some error in the experiments? Nobody ever checked that an entangled particle at the other end of the universe changes state immediately if we change its counterpart here. This is hard for several reasons. One of these is the large distance, the 2nd is there is no absulote time. So how do you tell information transfer was immediate? Intelligence is about predicting the future based on information gathered so far and gettting better and better at making predictions, by learning and generalising knowledge. We do that by first splitting up all information thrown at our sensors in tiny re-usable patterns and keeping track of how often these occur, and how often combinations of these patterns occur (thus we have patterns, patterns of patterns, patterns of patterns of patterns etc, all with likelihoods to occur). Thus intelligence is about patterns and statistics, like frequencies. We try to fit in the reality within those patterns, ignoring \"noise\" and what we regard as not relevant. Intelligence thus also filters out most of its input data. There are limits to how much can be predicted and also limites to the speed with witch intelligent systems can learn. So after an initial exponential explosion of increase in machine intelligence, this will slow down, until the next break through in science. Probably no human science at that time anymore, cause we wont be there anymore.   ",

            "answer_text": "The problem of agreeing with perfectly balanced truths as it relates to a social reality who\u2019s economic reality is based on greed. In my humble opinion because those in control of the most powerful computing reality quantum computers are using them presently to increase profits as with Lockheed Martin they have a Quantum head start on the rest of the civilization, and as a result of being able to in a way see beyond the know physical universe or at least operate in a reality of thought that is would take someone with a pen and pad a million years to achieve the same solutions, they have a thought wormhole that will make it very difficult for people that don\u2019t base their decisions on greed to reach. Therefore while Quantum Computers could create a star trek next generation like social reality where money was a thing of the past those in control of them may never allow their balanced solutions to come to light much like the electric cars that saturn made in the 90\u2019s that worked so well and were scrapped by big oils influence. So the problem of getting greedy people to agree with a balanced truth may be beyond the Quantum Computers ability in my humble opinion\u2026.C\u2026    ",
