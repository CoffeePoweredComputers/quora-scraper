            "answer_text": "well you know, yes, it kind of obvious, isn't it. I mean we have groups upon groups upon groups, more or less, is a satisfactory way of explaining it. I mean you have the atoms, their structure, and it seems to up, and it seems to go down, to those areas less in size, and function than atoms. And how far does it go down, it actually goes down to what appears to be nothing; the whole \u201cjoint\u201d is make of nothing. You know how it\u2019s works with Heisenberg right, which is basically all over the place, in order to locate something, you need some thing to bound (reflect) off of it. And if you can\u2019t do that, that is the definition of seeing, so, you cant see it, in order words it\u2019s invisible, or does not exist. But that\u2019s kind of a play on words, for we know something can be invisible, and non detectable, or both, invisible and non detectable, and still be there, because of the action upon other things. But even if there\u2019s no action, it can still be there. But the point I\u2019m trying to make is, the place, and places, about us, is really made of nothing. You've heard of the particle wave duality right, that kind of a cousin to it. So looking at it that, we could no doubt conclude that the universe is some variety of \u201cmonster\u201d .. for it houses the very small, and invisible, and the gigantic and treacherous; with both having equal weight, and their membership card to be here. So there patterns, and they more or less comply with what we term \u201claws\u201d or relationship. But it may also be true, that some areas are more connected to certain laws than others, and so in that respect we would notice differences, with the differences being due to various matter compositions. For some reason I\u2019m thinking of something known as the mu meson neutrino, a particle so tiny but still there, zipping around like a meteorite would, save this difference, that it can pass right through the earth, and never actually see it. So to give you and idea, this place in composition, is a nut house; with laws set aside for the very large, and \u201cimpossibly\u201d tiny. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s dialectic and it defines the past rather than the future. In the beginning was the atomic realm with an evolving side (\u2018active\u2019) and a supportive side (\u2018passive\u2019). The first was mass (from which atoms evolved) and energy (light, etc.). Then came life. In this biotic realm, animals were active and plants passive. Then came people, the human realm, with themselves the active and our machines the passive principle. But this doesn\u2019t tell us what\u2019s ahead. This probably is because the future depends upon whether or not we can get into Space. If so, new kinds of machine will have enabled us. If not they\u2019ll go on without us\u2026 ",
