            "answer_text": "Yes \u2014 up to a point. One of the answers here notes: I think it is the purpose for education to supply information, and prepare a student for the next level. While that might be superficially true for the youngest students, education should be so much ore than that. Students should learn how to think, how to digest what they are taught, how to read and analyze critically, and how to form their own views, outlooks, and opinions. In other words, if teachers are \u201cinstilling their own political beliefs in their children,\u201d those students should learn how to receive those beliefs, how to analyze them, and how to counter them, if need be. If students are simply being supplied with information, their teachers are only doing a small part of their jobs. And, in general, the students will be bored. My sophomore year in college I took a course called \u201cMedieval and Early Renaissance European History.\u201d On the first day of the first class, the professor announced that he was a Marxist and an atheist, and that he despised organized religion. While I appreciated his being up front about his beliefs, my immediate thought that I should drop this class, since Medieval and Early Renaissance European History is completely dominated, in one way or another, by the Catholic Church. So, not only was I going to be taught a subject from a biassed point of view, as a Catholic, I would have to sit through an entire semester of Catholic bashing. But I decided not to drop the class and to stick with it. And I\u2019m very glad I did. Not only was he a fascinating lecturer, but he helped me achieve exactly what I was in college to achieve: A critical mind, a true sense of inquisitiveness, and a ability to thing and analyze in the bigger picture. I disagreed with his views on many topics, and he did engage in a lot of needless (and sometimes irrelevant) Catholic bashing. But he taught me to form my own views and, perhaps best of all, to challenge my preconceived notions and opinions. He didn\u2019t really change my mind about anything, but he certainly helped me form my mind. And that\u2019s pretty much the whole point. ",

A person, young or old, should learn how to process information according to their age and development. It is very reasonable to ask for an appointment with this teacher to discuss this. If you both are capable of agreeing to educate and not force views on your child then your child is on the road to being a well rounded adult. I am hopeful that neither you or the teacher (both positions of authority who your child likely wants to please) is stating a preference that is believed to be 100% right. You can explain why you believe what you do. The educator can do the same. Your child will work it out according to age and development. Most importantly your child will not be afraid of the risk that you or his/her teacher is angry. ",
