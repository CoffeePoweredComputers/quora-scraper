            "answer_text": "I think those things go together. I don\u2019t think you get time without space and \u201cthings.\u201d I think things have relationships with other things, and we sentient humans have just sussed out that we can attach labels with numeric values to stuff such that we can do calculations with those numbers and make predictions about the future. I think it\u2019s about \u201cthings.\u201d Exactly what those things are, I don\u2019t know for sure - they could be material, or they could be mind stuff, or some of both. But I don\u2019t think that space and time, or spacetime if you prefer, are fundamental. I think we concoct that as we try to make sense out of our perceptions. Time comes easier, I think - there are causes and there are effects - cause precedes effect. With a large enough number of events going on, that defines a near-continuum. Space - that\u2019s a little different. It means that causes can\u2019t produce any old effect they please. They have to \u201cprepare the way.\u201d We\u2019ve quantified that, and it winds up looking to us like \u201cgoing to the right place to take the causal action.\u201d I suspect it\u2019s \u201cmind stuff\u201d that\u2019s actually fundamental, and not \u201cmaterial stuff,\u201d but that\u2019s not really your question. Hope this helps some. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve been wondering about this myself, but I\u2019ll state the question slightly differently; since mass, energy and speed shape the relationship between time and space, would time and space have meaning in the absence of mass and energy? My thoughts go like this; everywhere we look in the universe there is a small amount of cosmic background radiation, so nowhere is there space in an absolutely zero state, and so even at these places time and space exist in a state close to what we know here. Near a black hole though space is almost infinitely compressed and time is dilated till it has nearly stopped. Perhaps at zero mass and energy state time is infinitely compressed while space is infinitely dilated? But beyond that conjecture, time and space will theoretically exist in a base state without matter and energy, but you can\u2019t have time without space or space without time, and space will always have an odd number of dimensions.

            "answer_text": "Yes, for that is the condition for Bliss to exist by itself without equivocation of matter, space or energy to qualify it any further than it already is. On the one hand, this is the insignificance of life in that it is merely a play of vast unimportance. Yet on the other hand, this is the significance of life giving contrast to Bliss which has no contrast and is even tempered. Without matter, space or energy, time knows no change in a state of non-change - which is bliss. Bliss is not something that can easily be defined except in terms of what it is not, namely: not change, not happiness, not sorrow, not Birth, not death, not anything superficial with a quality ascribed to itself. So, to answer your question, such a condition of timelessness has no meaning by itself. It is given meaning, of a sort, in contrast to space, matter and energy which have illusionary meanings being real only to those of us caught up in space, matter and energy which is pretty much everything we know about defined by our perception while living inside a spatial, material, energetic body of flesh and blood.

Yes, time must exist before even God can exist. But time in nonphysical realms is a little bit different than what we can imagine. Instead of time moving forward time is more like a flow or movement within the evolution of consciousness. When the Universe was created time began in a physical way along with the motion of light and electrons. Now we have a time of causality as well as our invention of measuring time with clocks. ",

There is no Light or motion, only primeval darkness and complete stillness with no time, only infinity. The only way to shift this condition is to introduce intelligence. How this happened is beyond me, but it most certainly did happen to fire up primeval darkness. Felling-tones would then manifest into intelligent light energy, and cyclical motion would begin. Time would still be meaningless as there would be no measure of it. Time only has meaning to third density consciousness humans who are experiencing a material existence. ",

Time is the measurement of energy, the motion of particles as they affect change. ",
