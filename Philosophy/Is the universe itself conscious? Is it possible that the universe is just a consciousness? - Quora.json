            "answer_text": "As far as we can tell at the moment, consciousness happens inside a brain. The universe is not a brain, so it\u2019s unconscious. The whole universe is mostly gas distributed across space. Solid matter is only a fraction of it. The complex interactions we see on Earth are quite the exception. Brains need billions of neurons to function, involving complex chemistry that we\u2019re far from understanding. In comparison, most matter in the universe doesn\u2019t interact with itself in such complex ways. Chemistry doesn\u2019t really happen outside of planets. Gravity is the only force worth considering on a large scale (with other phenomenons stemming from the properties of matter itself). Gravity is pretty straight forward. It can accelerate objects, it can clump matter into stars and planets, it can maintain bodies in orbit around each other\u2026 and that\u2019s about it. Gravity alone can\u2019t produce a sensory system, let alone a conscious one. ",

            "answer_text": "Is the universe itself conscious? Can an ant know if you are conscious? Can you know if a plant is conscious? ONLY the conscious entity will know. So, this is a good and ancient question. We are wasting our time guessing and arguing about it. IF the U is conscious, it alone will know that fact. Is it possible that the universe is just a consciousness? This is the thesis/tenet of Vedanta philosophy: That the universe is Pure Consciousness; Parama Purusha. Each one of us is a spark of that Cosmic Consciousness, not unlike a mug of water from the expanse of the ocean. What a magnificent idea/vision! Peace! 30 Sept 2019 ",
