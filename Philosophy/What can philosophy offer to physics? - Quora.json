            "answer_text": "Philosophy is the study of the nature of wisdom and gaining insights about human behaviour by taking inspiration from the natural / external world. For example, when a philosopher looks at a crane fishing, he might gain insights on values such as focus, attention, patience, etc. Philosophy is entirely subjective and to me it is just unbriddled contemplation triggered by external inspiration. Physics , though has the same roots i.e. imspired by nature is write different. Physicist like to collect large amounts of data and figure out the patterns, formulate a theory and then test it. With the passage of time the theories are refined and predict natural phenomena with exceptional accuracy. It is more of a description of the natural world and its workings. So, personally, I don't think philosophy can offer anything worthwhile to physics. ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophers have been pursuing metaphysics for thousands of years. Metaphysics is simply about how we should interpret the phenomena of physics, rather than anything nonsensical like the super-natural. In other words, whenever physics discovers some weird result that does not square with the other findings of the day, philosophy comes into play once the result passes quality assurance. Some of this is ongoing, such as the search for a unifying theory of quantum gravity, and others are pretty much settled such as the correct model of the atom. At least, physics has settled on atoms being divisible. Historically speaking 99% of philosophical metaphysics is not even wrong, but there\u2019s something to be said for ruling out everything that\u2019s wrong to point you in a constructive direction. Indeed, one could point to several historical episodes where a particular, successful theory of physics has been superseded by a better one as the result of physicists considering what a better theory should be. Often a better theory is one that predicts more results, or predicts them more accurately, or whatnot, but in judging what should be better the physicists engage in philosophy. The problem, essentially, is that the aforementioned 99% of philosophical metaphysics has not unreasonably made \u2018philosophy\u2019 and \u2018metaphyiscs\u2019 synonymous with \u2018balderdash\u2019 and \u2018flights of fancy\u2019 in the lexicon of academic physicists and laymen everywhere. That modern academic philosophy seems more concerned with ideas than with wisdom might have something to do with it. The success of many modern theories of physics might also have something to do with it, as one only needs to consider metaphysics when your physics fails you, and without that failure the quality assurance provided by metaphysics is superfluous. Finally, that so much nonsense goes under the banner of philosophy one can be forgiven for considering the subject to be about as useful as bad poetry. ",
