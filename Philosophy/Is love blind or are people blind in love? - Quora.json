            "answer_text": "Love is never blind.. Love is the greatest eye opener ordinarily possible in Life. In deep Love u become aware of even the blindness/unconsciousness of your near and dear ones like your mother, father and your beloved/partner..but Why ? Because Love is a fiery force which cleanse of your Ego, your blind attachment, your unawareness..a certain Clarity comes\u2026 We need to understand the meaning of Clarity.., Clarity comes to those who become aware.. Clarity do not requires Thinking mechanism to understand things, situations and life..In clarity u could see things/situations as they are, without your mind being coloured by thoughts/prejudiced/attachment as normally is the case.. So in Love , after going through a fiery pain which burns your Ego/attachment/impurities , you are attained to certain Clarity..which makes you look to things/situations as they are without any attachment or prejudice..so You are never Blind in Love..Never Ever ! So if apparently people are blind in 'love' \u2026it is simply because it is not essentially Love as u may think..Love has come to aquire a very general and even disgraceful meaning today..even one night stand ,or a mere immediate sexual attraction have been today come to be called as Love . It is Not ! Love is a force and a very fiery phenomenon which helps you become mature, innocent like a child , and helps in your awakening ! Importantly, parents often complain that their son/daughter has been enchanted by their Lover..that he has become blind.., While the attraction/infatuation towards someone may certainly be not True Love and may carry an element of blindness.., But more than often the fact is Parents themselves are so much blindly attached to children,..perhaps their child is really like a moon who had been revolving more or less around the Earth(mother/father)..but now it seems ,the moon(son/daughter) has gone astray because now he is no longer revolving around them..now he/she has become revolting/rebellious\u2026So the Ego/attachment of parents is tremendously hurt.. perhaps this is the story of every home ! So it is not that he has become blind, it is only that now he is revolving around some other planet.. perhaps a more young planet than her mother.. but also it is not Love but it has marked it's beginning.., In Love one niether revolves around one's own parents nor around one\u2019s beloved .. because now an awareness has grown in you. You understand people/situations and you can even see their prejudices /attachments/ blindness ! A Clarity comes to you.. Remember any attachment is always blind .. because it contains an element of Ego/pride in it.. wheather it is of parents or for beloved..So people always confuse attachment/attraction for Love which it is not !
