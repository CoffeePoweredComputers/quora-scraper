            "answer_text": "If you come into your home and the hallway light doesn\u2019t work, you think the bulb has gone. If the light in the next room also doesn\u2019t work, you think the circuit breaker has tripped. That\u2019s because you know two bulbs failing at the same time is far less plausible than a dead circuit. That\u2019s the core of Occam\u2019s Razor - the simplest explanation is usually correct. To underline that, notice that as we increasingly use technology like LEDs that are much more reliable than old incandescent bulbs, your first thought might be the circuit. The service life of an LED might be 25 years, circuits trip much more frequently than that. All this shows that consciously or intuitively you\u2019re estimating the probability of the cause of some event as you go along. Whether you did that calculation knowingly or intuitively you\u2019re normally right. Common things are (well) more common than uncommon things and typically the common things are the simple cases with the fewest coincidences. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s really \u201cthe most probable explanation is usually correct\u201d and that follows immediately from the definition of most probable. Expressed as the most probable thing is the most probable, Occam\u2019s Razor almost reduces to a tautology. Driving Occam\u2019s Razor by \u201cfewest assumptions\u201d adds in the observation that if an explanation requires more things that need to be the case it quickly diminishes in probability. Occam\u2019s razor isn\u2019t a law of nature. It\u2019s pragmatic. More complicated explanations do sometimes turn out to be correct. It may be worth balancing Occam against Sherlock Holmes: When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. That reminds us that while the simplest explanation is normally the case it isn\u2019t always the case. ",

            "answer_text": "If you can explain anything in a simple manner, it supports Occam\u2019s Razor. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily be right or wrong but it\u2019ll make sense most times. Most times because concept of simplicity is sometimes subjective. An example to this will be, a religious guy says God exists because it\u2019s written in a book that if creation is there, there should be a creator; he used to hear the voices of God; and proof exists that, this, whatever the argument is, it goes on but cannot really give a simple explanation to it or give a proof of existence at that moment to put an end to the discussion. So this argument becomes complicated. An atheist will say God doesn\u2019t exist and he\u2019s damn sure about it because he can\u2019t see it, but he cannot prove that God doesn\u2019t exist and cannot really have an end to the discussion in any way, again the things gets complicated and unnecessary arguments takes place, in other words, both have lack of simple discussions and considerations. If you see this with the eye of an Occam\u2019s Razor, the solution for this will be \u201cI do not know if the God exist or not.\u201d The discussion ends there and there\u2019s hardly any more to argue about it. It\u2019s a very useful tool for decision making because it cuts through everything without prejudices or your predefined considerations. Like Da Vinci said and I quote, \u201cSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\u201d ",
