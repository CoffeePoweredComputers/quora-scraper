            "answer_text": "Post-postmodernism is a thing. I think whether or not it is significant is another question, and the more important question. The few people who are aware of it that I\u2019ve talked to about this seemed to be dismissive, saying that it doesn\u2019t exist or that it\u2019s a \u201cpseudo-movement\u201d. I think it definitely exists, but it has yet proven its significance to us (people interested in philosophy). I do think we have to recognise the post-postmodernism movement, but it comes off, at least on my part, as pretentious when a bunch of people name themselves in a distinct movement from the history of philosophy thus far. For instance, the early 40s and 50s didn\u2019t see the emergence of postmodern philosophers naming themselves postmodernist. It\u2019s just odd to pronounce one\u2019s significance before having done anything significant \u2014 do you get what I mean? From what I have gathered, post-postmodernism is sometimes labelled as metamodernism, and I\u2019ll use that label because it truncates my reference. Metamodernism, as the name suggests, attempts to go underneath modernist thought. Some sources suggest a Hegelian synthesis of modernism and postmodernism, but I don\u2019t think we should be happy relying on modernist modes of thinking to understand a radical form of thought. Basically, I see metamodernism as an attempt to overcome the barriers imposed by postmodernism, by taking lessons from modernism. Let me elaborate. As a reaction to postmodernism, which seeks to get rid of the modernist paradigm, metamodernism gets back to modernism and tries to fish out what is lacking in postmodernist thought, that existed in the modernist paradigm. One vital component, I think, is the philosophical relevance of meaning. This shows up in experimental metamodernist art, such as this:  A prevailing tendency of thought in postmodernism is immanence. This is best exhibited by Deleuze\u2019s analogy of rhizomes \u2014 the development of ideas and concepts, on flat planes, by pushing them as far as possible. Postmodernism sees transcendental thought as \u2018evil\u2019 (the reason why Hegel is its punching bag), because postmodernists see transcendence as a lazy way to set up an arbitrary system of judgment to shrug off the need for explanation. Foucault\u2019s readings of power relations within various disciplines are attempts to explain the mechanisms by which power is transfigured and disseminated into patterns of thought. He\u2019s laying out how we think the way we think across these disciplines. The same goes for Deleuze in A Thousand Plateaus, but him and Guattari toss jargon across various disciplines (e.g. \u201cThe Geology of Morals\u201d) in order to stimulate new patterns of thinking (basically what they call deterritorisation). In effect, it\u2019s not very difficult to explain what the postmodernists are doing. But one obvious problem \u2014 a very huge one \u2014 lies in the language they are associated with. I have read various postmodernist works face on, and every read, including re-readings, is a huge pain in the ass. While it aligns with the project that they are intending to lay out (i.e. to stimulate new modes of thought), the way they write is horribly inefficient. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t blame philosophers who dismiss the value of postmodernism \u2014 their style of writing (not just D&G and Foucault, but for Lefebvre, Baudrillard, Lyotard, and the likes) can seem awfully vacuous if you are not used to it and don\u2019t have its intention in mind. The Sokal Hoax just rubs things in a little more, but the misunderstanding still remains and deepens over time. The late postmodernists don\u2019t make things better to. Nick Land\u2019s Fanged Noumena was the one that did it for me. I was convinced that postmodernism was dead \u2014 the unbearable poise worsened, and it became too obsessed with prioritising immanence. That\u2019s the caveat I see in Deleuze; in spite of rejecting transcendence as a way of doing philosophy, he privileges immanence almost to the point of being dogmatic. The result, as you might expect, is plateaus everywhere \u2014 immanence is read into everything and anything, just as how Hegel read transcendence into everything and anything (the technical term is shoehorning). My prediction regarding metamodernism, which I see as a potential movement that surpasses postmodernism, is that a radical form of thinking aside from transcendence and immanence will emerge. I think Ken Wilber was correct to point out that the history of philosophy is a battle between transcendence and immanence, but I think his Integral Philosophy ends up being a form of transcendence that subsumes immanence. For instance, his concept of holons, to me, is almost identical to Hegel\u2019s aufhebung \u2014 to transcend and include. My point is that nothing philosophically radical has being put forth so far. I don\u2019t have a clue of what\u2019s coming next, and I don\u2019t think others do (or it maybe that I\u2019m not that intelligent). One strand of thought that I\u2019d like to mention, even though I don\u2019t think it\u2019s radical and metamodernist in that sense, is object-oriented ontology (I refuse to use the short abbreviation because it sounds stupid). I see object-oriented ontology, at least Graham Harman\u2019s version, as a return to substance metaphysics (in the Aristotelian sense). While it\u2019s not new, I think it\u2019s worth exploring as of now, particularly when substance metaphysics has been abandoned for centuries since Hume. Another strand is process philosophy, which I have always thought was too far ahead of its time. By that mention I meant figures such as Whitehead, Bergson, and (old man) Peirce. There is something very arcane about process philosophy that is serving more than provocative purposes. I\u2019m placing my bets that some form of philosophical innovation will emerge out of a refreshed reading of Whitehead and Peirce. I think they are poorly understood, even in the academia, thus far.

Two people hearing what she had to say. But the big crowd was competing to be the most obscure in their false premise understandings of the human condition. There was nothing post modern about people who want to have a talk to talk and don\u2019t want to do anything to help others. All phrased in the most complex language that didn\u2019t say anything. You know them by their fruits, they say, and you know a post modern by their success in school, not by their good works. There is such a thing as human nature, only ignorant or neurotic people think otherwise. If a post modern wasn\u2019t a neurotic, they would be post modern because they would be like Dr. King and none of that would matter with them, they would just want to do god\u2019s will. A neurosis is an excuse to have a closed heart, and so is post modernism. ",
