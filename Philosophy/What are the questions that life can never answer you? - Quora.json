Self-deceit or deceiving others in the order of frequency. I doubt that very many questions at all can be answered honestly if they are personal. which you imply. Motive 1: Emotional, financial, or social gain. \u201cIf I admitted to myself why I\u2019m doing, acting, ect. this I\u201dd never let myself do it, so I won\u2019t answer myself truthfully. Thousands of things can fall into this intra-psychic category. It\u2019s called \u201cRationalization\u201d. Facework: It is usually the case that you can\u2019t answer honestly, or you\u2019d be lonely pretty quick. We could go on at some length, but I thought you might like a different kind of answer that\u2019s \u201cFood for thought\u201d. ",
