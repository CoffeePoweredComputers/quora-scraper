            "answer_text": "Q: If we just randomly happen to live in a universe that supports life despite how unlikely that is\u2026 Ah, I think I see what the problem is. You see, we don\u2019t actually just randomly happen to live in a universe that supports life despite how unlikely that is. Instead, we happen to live in this universe because we evolved specifically according to the natural laws of this universe. Had this universe had different laws that meant our particular form of life couldn\u2019t be supported, we would have turned out differently. As for the idea that it is somehow unlikely or improbable that the universe is able to support life at all, that only makes sense if you are considering the odds before it happened. Now that life has evolved in the universe, the odds or likelihood or probability of it happening are exactly 100%. Consider the probability of someone dealing out a shuffled deck of cards and just happening to lay down a complete suit (e.g., all clubs, all hearts, etc.). From a purely mathematical standpoint, the odds of doing this from a shuffled deck of cards are 635,013,559,600 to one. Which is, of course, incredibly improbable and you would be right to suspect that the dealer had somehow rigged the deck in his favor. Except\u2026 let\u2019s say I deal out thirteen cards from a shuffled deck and get a totally random mixture of hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades. What are the odds that I laid down the exact combination of cards that I did? Still 635,013,559,600 to one. How can this happen? Well, it's all because 635 billion to 1 against was the chance of getting it right before the cards were dealt. In fact, now they've been dealt, the probability is actually 1:1. Talking about how improbable something was that has actually happened already is not helpful. In terms of the universe, nobody was around before it began to estimate the probability that things would be as they are today. Had there been someone, then they'd have calculated a very, very slim probability indeed. But here's a universe and here we are in it. The probability of this having occurred is exactly 1:1. Again, there are two possibilities \u2014 either the universe was made just to suit life, or else life evolved to fit the way the universe is. One other point to consider... Let's assume that the odds of the universe turning out the way it did by chance are mind-bogglingly, infinitesimally small (further assuming that it did, in fact, happen by chance and not because of some immutable laws of nature). How can you say that the odds are any better of it being created by some timeless, immaterial being whose very nature would contradict all we know about existence? How would you even go about calculating those odds? Regardless of how unlikely a naturally caused universe is, you have to first show that a supernatural cause is even possible before you can argue that it is plausible (let alone more probable than a naturally cased universe).

            "answer_text": "If we just randomly happen to live in a universe that supports life despite how unlikely that is It's very likely. Probability = 1 in fact. Think about it, if we imagine the (maybe large, maybe snall) number of possible universes in which something* could live, how many of them would support life? ALL OF THEM! Otherwise, we couldn't live there. Also, our universe is pretty hostile to life. The majority of it is basically vacuum. The majority of mass in our solar system is the sun. The majority of the rocky bodies are - gas giants. Of the non gas giants isn't it possible that we just randomly happen to live in a universe that behaves as if there is a God? Well sure, except it doesn't seem to to me. It's an hypothesis, but I see no evidence for it, and indeed if you mean the all loving one, I'd argue all the horrible things that happen, and the fact it's basically hostile to life, is (weak?) Evidence against you.  *We\u2019ve evolved for this one, but that's because we are in this one. Sure we couldn't survive in a slightly different universe, but that doesn't mean nothing could. People (with an agendum), often ignore this, I suspect quite deliberately. ",
