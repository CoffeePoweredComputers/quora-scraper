            "answer_text": "Decades of work as a programmer has shaped my thinking about this sort of thing. You see, I\u2019m used to seeing programs get moved from platform to platform. As you may know, it\u2019s possible to still play computer games that were written in the 1980s*. I don\u2019t mean remakes of the games; I mean the exact same games\u2014the exact same code! These are programs that may have originally been stored on magnetic tapes. Over the years, they were copied from medium to medium. They may have once been played on RadioShack TRS-80 computers but now they\u2019re running on cellphones. The same exact code. The lesson here is that the same program can be run on multiple platforms, and it\u2019s the program that\u2019s interesting, not the platform it runs on. Another analogy is books. Shakespeare wrote Hamlet on scraps of paper. It\u2019s since been \u201crun\u201d in hardback books, paperback books, laptop screens, Kindles, and cellphones. (And, of course, on stage and screen.) The reading device changes. The text remains the same. The interesting scenes in Hamlet aren\u2019t interesting because they\u2019re printed on paper or on a screen. They\u2019re interesting because of what\u2019s happening with the plot and characters. Which reminds me of Ray Bradbury\u2019s famous novel Fahrenheit 451. It\u2019s set in a near-future dystopia, in which the government has ordered all books to be destroyed. So a resistance movement forms in which volunteers secretly memorize entire books. So, for a while, Don Quixote only \u201cruns\u201d inside some guy\u2019s head. That\u2019s the only copy of the book. It\u2019s running on on a platform of neurons instead of paper and ink. Still, the story exists. Our Universe \u201cruns\u201d on something. The question of what it runs on is interesting, but it\u2019s the same \u201cgame,\u201d regardless of what it\u2019s running on. It appears to run on a platform made out of atoms. But maybe that\u2019s wrong. Maybe, as some folks have speculated, we\u2019re living in a simulation. Okay, but the interesting stuff about my mom is interesting whether she\u2019s made out of atoms or ones and zeros in some alien computer. The Laws of Physics may apply to matter, or maybe they\u2019re the rules of a SimUniverse game. Either way, they affect me. As Shylock says, \u201cIf you prick me, do I not bleed?\u201d Well, maybe I\u2019m a sim, and I\u2019m just sim-bleeding, but, either way, from my point-of-view, I\u2019m bleeding. All of this is just as true if the entire Universe is \u201call in my head.\u201d Maybe my head is the platform the Universe is running on. Still, it\u2019s running. (If this is true. If my head is powerful enough to simulate an entire universe, that\u2019s astounding! It\u2019s astounding even if my brain cuts corners and only \u201crenders\u201d the bits I can see. I\u2019m able to stand outside, look in one direction, then whip my head around and look in another. And my head is, apparently, able to keep up! It instantaneously renders all the stuff that was out of view a fraction of a second ago!) Even if it\u2019s all in my head, the amazing thing is, I have no idea what my wife (or \u201cwife\u201d if she\u2019s imaginary) is going to get me for my birthday. The Universe being in my head gives me no special advantages of foresight. Its as if the Universe is not in my head! It\u2019s exactly like that from my point of view. If I just made up my wife and all of my friends\u2014and all the the books I\u2019ve ever read and all of the movies I\u2019ve ever seen\u2014then I\u2019m creative genius! I invented giraffes and quasars and and the Grand Canyon and cayenne pepper! Or, if some aliens invented all of this, and I\u2019m the only real person, trapped in their matrix, then they\u2019re amazing programmers and I\u2019m lucky to have the privilege of being able to live in their simulation! And I still don\u2019t know what my wife (or \u201cwife\u201d) is getting me for my birthday!  * Colossal Cave Adventure ",

            "answer_text": "Basically, either the idea breaks you, or you just kinda accept it. My thoughts on it are: \u201cwhat a fascinating idea, and yet so obvious that I should have thought of it myself. Sure, it\u2019s depressing, but have the fundamentals of my life changed? Not really.\u201d It\u2019s essentially the same as questioning whether we live in a simulation. Is it a cool idea? Absolutely. Is it scary ? Like hell. Could it help you become more thoughtful and introspective? Possibly. Is free will a lie? Most likely. Is there a god? Is there a better end to all this? Very possibly not. But should that keep me from living life? And loving and caring for those around me? Does it change the fact that we are talking monkeys living on a pebble flying through space and time, who fuck around with literal fucking magic on a daily basis like it\u2019s nothing spectacular, because we are the most intelligent species in our half of the universe, living in the best and most prosperous age ever experienced on earth? No. Not really. so keep your hands, arms and legs inside the cart at all times, and just have the time of your life! Seriously. You are so much more free than you realize! So what if solipsism is real or not? It just means that you have the opportunity to decide what makes Life worth living for YOU. ",
