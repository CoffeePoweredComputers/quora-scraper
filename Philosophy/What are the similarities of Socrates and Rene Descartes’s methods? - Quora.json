            "answer_text": "Well, they\u2019re both about the search for the truth, as much is humanly possible. Socrates preference was to do so in relationships, while Descartes believed endless self-examination was also acceptable. It\u2019s rather simple really. The premise is all human beings are, unless self-aware and able to think critically, hopelessly enamored by their own self-centered and self-absorbed belief about human life, therefore, accepting this, all preconceived ideas about everything must be whittled down to the death in order for useful and authentic knowledge and wisdom to ensue. Here is an example: last week, two Mormon young men came knocking at my door. They had memorized and were ready for much discourse. However, upon entering into the socratic dialogue (a here and now, present moment, process of insight discovery), I asked them about their own religion with the following question: \u201cwhen did you first start believing that,\u201d followed by, \u201chow does that change the interaction we are having right here and right now?\u201d They were dumbfounded and I felt sorry for them. They were only about 18 and I knew they were brainwashed by their parents or just going through the motions in order to satisfy social/cultural conventionality. I just didn\u2019t want to humiliate or cause them suffering without recourse, so I stopped the discourse and just said no thanks. When you\u2019re young and just trying to figure things out, I get chill pretty quickly. I suppose, colloquially this makes me \u201cnot an asshole.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Very little. Socrates was a quintessential agnostic about most subjects. His only point was bringing everyone else to doubt. Socrates never strongly states any position he holds, as though he knew it were true, and when someone said he could be wrong - Socrates always agreed. Descartes was a staunch dogmatist, and his philosophy is extremely so. He made assertions he couldn\u2019t back up even to the philosophers of his own day. ",
