            "answer_text": "It depends on which Media you are watching/reading/listening to. If you trust - say - FOX News to lie - it will probably meet your expectations. But if you trust FOX News to report the truth - you will be doomed to disappointment. Choose media sources who owe nothing to anyone but the public. No advertisers or government ties. The BBC in Great Britain - Reuters in Great Britain and Canada - the CBC in Canada - the Associated Press in the US - any NPR or PBS News channel in either Canada or the US. These media networks - for the most part - can be trusted to report the actual facts of occurring events. They hire real Journalists - rather than entertainment commentators - who know how to spell and use grammar and punctuation correctly - and pretty much nail the \u201cFive W\u2019s\u201d of reporting - \u201cWho, What, Why, When and Where?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Media is an integral part of the society today. It is referred also as the fourth pillar of democracy. It is purported as the true essence of the system which functions based on the basic tenet of democracy which is the freedom of speech and expression. But in the real world the truth is far from it. While in the utopian world media houses would be seen as torch bearers of democracy and the true voice of the people, in reality media has become a well paved pathway to constrict the ideas of people and spread propagandas that may as well be against the goodwill of the people therein. Independant journalism is a myth. Every media channel is funded by organizations who generally back a certain ideology. And people's mind are ingrained in such a fashion that they can be tuned and twisted by news that comes their way. Today's social media world is exposing the biased side of the various media houses that have existed in the country since independence and how these media houses have been funded sourced controlled through means that are anti Indian. How these media houses have had far reaching influence even until the cabinet. There are a lot of things in this country that do not recieve the kind of coverage that other matters recieve just because it is not in the interest of these media houses to have this news reported. A nice good look into media houses like the Hindu, quint, wire, TOi and most of the well established western media houses like the WSJ, BBC etc would give you a proper Outlook about how they tacitly attempt to fine wire the minds of the readers towards their perspectives and point of views. As a counter, today many hard-bent media channels such as the republic, opindia and many domestic channels have emerged which give coverage to the party whose voice have been unheard for so many decades. Most of them are not even tacit regarding where their ideological favours lie! In this manner media houses tend to not at all give coverage or if given coverage ensure not much attention is given to issues that is against their interests. So basically independent journalism is one of the biggest lies we've been told in schools. Media houses tend to control the larger populations by imposing their point of views and opinions which cloud the minds of the readers. This is seen as a general trend in almost all media houses of today that they are tools to pan out propagandas. So it is wise to always take more information regarding news that one reads and to never trust any one source of news. Do not fall prey to propagandas. Be wise and be smart. Always crunch more data and have better insights before pushing stupid opinions from random media houses to your Instagram stories like you are the messaih to the world. ",
