            "answer_text": "How important is perfection?   Well, it may depend upon what you do for your livliehood \u2014 where perfection is not only admirable but necessary to save or preserve lives. If you\u2019re piloting an aircraft, perfection is 99% important, as is the performance of the air traffic controller in the tower bringing you in safely to land, and ground control getting you to the gate safely. If you\u2019re an emergency medical responder \u2014 again, perfection is 99% important. Judge, professor, lawyer, paralegal, social worker, medical doctor, nurse, psychiatrist, psychologist, veterinarian, animal health technician, IT specialist, computer programmer, actor, movie producer, plumber, electrician, carpenter, engineer, scientist, astronaut, astronomer, bank teller, financial advisor, et el \u2014 well \u2026 I suggest all require 99% perfection. I apologize to those I\u2019ve missed. Perhaps, if you\u2019re a public schoolteacher, you might get away with 80% -90% perfection. However, a bartender or a waitress \u2014 wow \u2026that really might matter to be perhaps 95%perfect \u2014 otherwise you might not get excellent tips if you far below perfect. A janitor, shelf restocker, non-cashier worker in a random store, salesperson for cell phones,Life Insurance or pharmaceuticals \u2026 probably the bar is set lower. Salespeople sell \u2026 perfection is perhaps then like horseshoes and hand grenades \u2026 close to perfection IS good enough. ",

            "answer_text": "How important is perfection? Not at all. Perfection is just a step-back and-appreciate-value judgment that lets you know: Not one single flaw here. Wouldn\u2019t change a thing. This is perfect. Now, it might be a nice thing to be attuned to that. To be able to notice: where things come together, and you and me are just perfect for this moment, and for each other, and it\u2019s all just perfect for us. That kind of stuff is nice to notice. But it doesn\u2019t change a single actual thing about the thing, the person, the moment. It doesn\u2019t change a thing about what IS, what actually IS, just to notice what\u2019s missing: A flaw. Or flaws. So it\u2019s not really important at all. It\u2019s a judgment that adds zilch to the actual good of what\u2019s there. But some people, you know, they\u2019ve got a perfectionism fetish so it means a lot to them. They wanna notice some, then they notice so hard they start to import fake flaws to make the chase more exciting next time. Yeah, it\u2019s really not important.  Remember: perfection pertains to purpose. There is no perfect, except perfect for. If you\u2019re looking for perfection, make sure you know what - whatever it is - is supposed to be perfect for. ",
