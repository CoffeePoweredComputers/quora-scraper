            "answer_text": "HELL F**K NO! I was with my ex husband for 4 years before we got married, he was so sweet, treated me like a princess, anything I wanted, I got, no questions asked, material and all else. He used to take me on a different date night, every Friday and Saturday nights, surprising me with fancy dinners, weekends away, beautiful harbour cruises, bars and clubs, gifts, even just going to the movies or having a quiet one at home, playing cards or watching a movie with popcorn. He used to wake up early to go grab me a latte from my favourite cafe and bring it to my house before he went to work. Sounds perfect right? When something sounds like it\u2019s too good to be true, it\u2019s because it is! 4 years no red flags. The day we got married everything changed, he claims he \u201clost his job\u201d because he went on his honeymoon (thinks he was talking to a 3 year old) started drug dealing. He didn\u2019t put a gun to my head and I was the curious type but I can honest to god, say he is the reason I\u2019ve been an addict for 16 years, he made it readily available at all times. He assault me physically (choking me once to an inch of my life or punching me like I was a man) verbally, mentally and worst of all sexually. He withheld money, I wasn\u2019t allowed to buy anything, I remember I needed a new phone, he wouldn\u2019t get it for me, so My dad got it for me. I wasn\u2019t working at the time so obviously I didn\u2019t have my own money. I gave him plenty of chances to change, told him maybe the apartment we were living in was cursed, let\u2019s move to my parents house , we can save money and buy our own home, he also promised to stop dealing. I find out a month later while living at my parents, he was still renting the other apartment and had someone running \u201cthe business\u201d for him. I kicked him out of my family house and never looked back \u2026 My loss? HELL NO. ",
