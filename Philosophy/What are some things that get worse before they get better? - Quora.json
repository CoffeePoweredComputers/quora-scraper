Sorry, misread the question. The common cold is one. It's a little complicated but the immune system shuts down during some forms of stress. It's so that we have the energy we need to deal with the threat. But the fight or flight mechanism doesn't really serve us with some of our modern day stresses leaving us for long periods with an inactive immune system. This leaves us exposed to a range of diseases from colds to cancer. Eventually the disease or the treatment, in some cases, gets us so down that we forget the original thing that stressed us out and we get better. So put this on a T-shirt, DON'T STRESS. ",
