            "answer_text": "//Solipsism (/\u02c8s\u0252l\u026aps\u026az\u0259m/ ( listen); from Latin solus, meaning 'alone', and ipse, meaning 'self') is the philosophical idea that only one's own mind is sure to exist. As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure; the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind. As a metaphysical position, solipsism goes further to the conclusion that the world and other minds do not exist.// The concept was blocked from dissipating the actual self with the infamous and conclusive circular logic that \u201cI think therefor I am.\u201d //Descartes asserted that the very act of doubting one's own existence served\u2014at minimum\u2014as proof of the reality of one's own mind; there must be a thinking entity\u2014in this case the self\u2014for there to be a thought.// The idea that we are in reality a vatted lab rat on Neptune being hard-wired the ERTH-2050 program, mistaking it for reality exactly like our Neptunian Scientist masters intend\u2026or that The Matrix was their way to introduce us to the idea that life is but their dream meant to consume the weak minds being duped and used\u2026or The Universe is a hologram or computer program\u2026or any number of other interesting scenarios that elaborate on solipsism, are fascinating and fun to mind game around with when first encountered, and for awhile\u2026 But entertained too long or given an excess of importance, and it begins to infect, swell and stupefy us like a tar-pit or drug habit or deification\u2026 Its a trap. Hank provided an excellent, necessarily and self-evident answer based on obvious evidence that we all do not revolve around you nor disappear just because you no longer see or are thinking of us. Anything you learn or discover is proof that you did not think it up or you\u2019d\u2019ve been already aware of it\u2026 The fact that you seek external opinions is evidence enough that you aren\u2019t really buying into your own premise\u2026 The closest thing we can come to mind over matter actually creating the universe and everyone it\u2026is in my experience, a prolonged and well controlled Lucid Dream\u2026and real life is nothing even close.

Experience fear. If it scares you, makes you feel endangered, it's an outside threat, don't you think? And now you're trying to work out some mechanism by which these things could STILL be just you, right? Stop it. You're not the only thing that exists. ",
