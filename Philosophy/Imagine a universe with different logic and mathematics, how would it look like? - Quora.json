            "answer_text": "There\u2019s only one fairly concrete possibility one can think of: a \u2018quantum mechanical\u2019 world. If Planck\u2019s constant were much bigger than it is, our world would follow \u2018QM logic\u2019, which is rather peculiar. When you add one \u2018apple\u2019 to another, you might get two apples. Or, due to interference, you might get zero! Or there could be one apple, phasing in and out of existence. And other possibilities. It\u2019s hard to describe briefly, study QM for the whole picture. In such a world our \u2018normal\u2019 mathematics would be discovered sooner or later, but it would be exotic. Much like Reimannian geometry (in this world). Considered the underlying \u2018truth\u2019 of reality but known only to a few specialists. If you don\u2019t like that \u2018alternative universe\u2019 I can imagine many more but it\u2019s not worth going into, the possibilities are too open-ended. ",

You make no statement about the logic and mathematics that are in this universe. Are they logical and consistent? Do you want me to make them up for the purposes of this question? My imagination is far beyond the space that it would take to answer your question given the little info that I have. ",
