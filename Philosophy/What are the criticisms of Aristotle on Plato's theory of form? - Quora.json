            "answer_text": "Asking, What is the perfect version of something? What is the ideal version of something? What is perfect marriage? or school? or career? Plato argues that focusing on ideal version of something is one of the useful kind of thought exercises we can generate by knowing how something should be like. Accounting the Plato theory of forms, it focus on \u201c what is the form of everything to make it more perfect?\u201d e.g., form of friendship to know how to make a good friendship. For Plato, Forms are abstract objects, existing completely outside space and time. Thus they are knowable only through the mind, not through sense or experience. Forms are changeless thus forms possess a higher degree of reality than do things in the world, which are changeable and always coming into or going out of existence. Aristotle rejected Plato theory of forms but not the notion of forms itself. For Aristotle, forms doesn\u2019t exist independently of things. Every form is the form of something. ",

            "answer_text": "Aristotle's criticisms of Plato's forms are pretty much the same as those that Plato leveled against a certain version of his own theory. Nevertheless, Aristotle did draw a different conclusion from those difficulties. What they did agree on was the absolutely essential necessity for generality/general concepts for us to be able to understamd the world and our place in it. ",
