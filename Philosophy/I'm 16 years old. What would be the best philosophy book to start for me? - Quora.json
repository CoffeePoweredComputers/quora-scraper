            "answer_text": "Amazon.com: Meditations (Penguin Classics) (9780140449334): Marcus Aurelius, Martin Hammond, Diskin Clay: Books I'm not going to pretend to be an expert on all matters of philosophy, and thus my suggestion is based on personal preference (as opposed to a detailed comparison between various philosophers, in the context of your situation), but I think Marcus Aurelius' \"Meditations\" would be an excellent start. Here are my reasons: 1) I believe the Stoic philosophy is not only interesting to read about, but can (and hopefully, will) be helpful to your own personal development. 2) \"Meditations\" is a series of personal writings (private notes), so it can be read fairly easily, in successive\\separate attempts (as opposed to a one long, detailed thesis\\essay). I have no idea what type of individual you are, but when I was sixteen years old, I had a hard time concentrating for more than 15 minutes on anything that didn't involve me (or contain pictures of breasts). 3) It's very simple to get started, and doesn't usually require a detailed comprehension (or multiple re-readings) to understand the concepts\\ideas (as opposed to some works that are fascinating, but are sometimes difficult to grasp initially without proper analysis and contextualization, etc.). 4) Don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure I remember reading that many great leaders have cited \"Meditations\" as one of their personal favourite works. 5) The cover to the book looks great, at least the version I own - Penguin Classics (great way to initiate conversation with any cute intellectuals). Entirely superficial argument, but nonetheless...  Here are a few select quotes, just to give you an idea if this might be of interest to you: \u201cYou have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.\u201d  \u201cThe happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.\u201d  \u201cIf you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgement of them. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgement now.\u201d \u201cIf someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.\u201d  \u201cNever let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present.\u201d  \u201cBegin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness \u2013 all of them due to the offenders\u2019 ignorance of what is good or evil.\u201d \u201cDo not indulge in dreams of having what you have not, but reckon up the chief of the blessings you do possess, and then thankfully remember how you would crave for them if they were not yours.\u201d  \u201cHow ridiculous and how strange to be surprised at anything which happens in life.\u201d \u201cDo not waste what remains of your life in speculating about your neighbors, unless with a view to some mutual benefit. To wonder what so-and-so is doing and why, or what he is saying, or thinking, or scheming\u2014in a word, anything that distracts you from fidelity to the ruler within you\u2014means a loss of opportunity for some other task.\u201d  \u201cLive a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.\u201d  \u201cIt never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.\u201d  \"Why do people hate on WHAM! so much? They had a couple of lesser-known good songs...\" (Ok, I made that one up.) \u201cWhen people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you'll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of good and evil may be the same as theirs, or near it, in which case you have to excuse them. Or your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which case they're misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?\u201d  And this is one of my personal favourites: \"When you run up against someone else\u2019s ignorance, ask yourself this: Is a world without ignorance possible? No. Then don\u2019t ask the impossible. There have to be ignorant people in the world. This is one of them. The same for someone vicious or untrustworthy, or with any other defect. Remembering that the whole world class has to exist will make you more tolerant of its members.\" Anyhow, as I said, I'm slightly biased, as I believe the Stoic philosophy is one of the most interesting and practical. Hopefully this was helpful. Regardless of your eventual choice, good luck in your readings. Adrien ",

            "answer_text": "The first philosopher I read as a teenager was Aristotle, specifically his Nicomacheon Ethics. I read it when I was 17 and it changed my life. I am a much happier person because of that book, more honest with myself, and I 100% recommend it to anyone and everyone. Before Aristotle I mostly read religious texts (except when I read fiction), and also for a time afterword (albeit not Christian ones). However, before I went to college I was reading Diderot, Plato, Machiavelli, Marx, Locke, Spinoza, Berkeley, among others. What brought me to philosophy was religion, and philosophy made me realize I was not religious for a good reason, so I left religion. What cemented that decision some time later was Kierkegaard when I was 19 and in college. His Fear and Trembling and The Sickness unto Death helped me realize that faith in a deity was irrational and is not based on evidence nor experience, and faith in a religious context is effectively just wishful thinking. It is a bit ironic that a philosopher who is religious like Kirekegaard is what led me away from religion. What are your interests? If you are religious or enjoy reading religious texts, then I would recommend Kierkegaard, Spinoza, Descartes, and perhaps some medieval philosophers like Bacon, Boethius, Scotus, Ockham, Anselm, Pascal, Pseudo-Dionyses, Lombard, Abelard, Bonaventure, Magnus, Maimonides, Averroes, Alfarabi, Al-Kindi and Al-Gazali. Those are good places to start depending on your interest. My personal favorite is Paul Tillich. If you are interested in ancient Greece, there are the Presocratics, Plato, Aristotle, Xenophanes, Epicurus, Zeno, and literally hundreds of others. There is a lot of free stuff available online if you are interested in ancient Greek philosophy, and a lot of people start with Plato's Republic. If you are interested in Roman philosophy, then there is Seneca, Cicero, Marcus Aurelius, Lucretius, Plotinus, and Augustine of Hippo. There are lots of others, but they are the ones I have read (I have not been able to get to Roman philosophers much yet) and I have enjoyed them all so far. Romans focus quite a bit on ethics and political philosophy, and Cicero in particular is still very applicable today in my opinion. If you are into existentialism I would recommend Zarathustra (it may sound odd, but I think Zarathustra is an interesting read for existentialists), Mazdak (yes, I am very into Iranian philosophy), and Afdal al-Din Kashani. Then there is, of course, Hegel, Kiekegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre, Camus, Husserl, Beauvoire, Barth, Merleau-Ponty, and Tillich. Existentialism is one of the most popular philosophical schools around, so there are many philosophers to choose from. If you are interested in more wholistic philosophies, there are many, many schools of philosophy from the Indian subcontinent. I haven't had the opportunity to read more than the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Sutras and some early Buddhist stuff. There are TONS from there. Then over to the east in China you will find Confucianism, Taoism, Mohism, and Legalism. My favorite philosopher from Chinese philosophy so far is Zhuanzi. In Korea, along with Buddhism and Chinese philosophy being influential, there was the Silhak movement of neo-Confucianism. Japan, along with Buddhist influences, also has been influenced philosophically by Shinto and Mitogaku movements. There is also a lot of philosophy in their approaches to martial arts, and of course there is the ever-popular Zen school of Buddhism. I am not very educated on pre- or post- western philosophy of the American Indian nations, but I do know they exist. I am also aware of different philosophies from African cultures and nations, but I have not had opportunity to read them. Right now there is a lot of important philosophy happening in Brazil, Iran and Oceania. They are having what one may describe as a golden age in that regard. So, if you want to get into contemporary philosophy is may behoove you to learn Portuguese, Arabic or Farsi, along with knowing English It all depends on what your interests are. I believe teenagers are perfectly ready to delve into philosophy just as much as fully grown adults are. I recommend figuring out what your interests are at this time and then picking up a text on that. My recommendations come from what I have read myself, and they may be good starting points for you.
