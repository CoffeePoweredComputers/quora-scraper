            "answer_text": "Just want to add something to Nabeel Qureshi's pretty spot on answer. As Nabeel says, according to Philosophical Investigations:   philosophy is an activity where philosophers try to solve fake 'problems' caused by misusing language. Which is self-evidently pointless.  I think it's worth adding that many philosophers before Wittgenstein also understood the idea that most philosophical problems are actually misuses of language - Nietzsche and Kierkegaard to some extent, and the classical American philosophers in particular (Wittgenstein was a big fan of James). But I take something different away, which is not to stop doing philosophy, it's to stop trying to solve 'philosophical' problems, rather than 'real world' problems. Since many of those problems ALSO suffer from identical misuses of language, they are not immune from the same confusion that results when language inadvertently contains faulty assumptions. Philosophy can (though not in many cases) shed light on how to cut through and try to get past this confusion (which, as Nabeel points out in his other excellent Wittgenstein answers, can arise in discussions regarding topics like abortion or consciousness).   Philosophy recovers itself when it ceases to be a device for dealing with the problems of philosophers and becomes a method, cultivated by philosophers, for dealing with the problems of men.
