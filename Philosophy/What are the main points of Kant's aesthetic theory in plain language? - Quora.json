            "answer_text": "The judgement of taste is the act of deciding whether something is beautiful or not.Kant believes that for something to be beautiful, it must be the product of a \"disinterested satisfaction.\" Merely contemplating it gives us pleasure, and this pleasure does not depend on the a) physical sensations it provides us, b) its practical usefulness or c) its moral qualities.He then says that taking pleasure in the beautiful is not entirely subjective. There is something in the object that makes us believe that others should find it beautiful as well, even though we might know that others don't often agree. This is the \"subjective universality\" of taste. He argues for this from the earlier point - if your pleasure in beauty is disinterested (i.e., nothing unique to you), it is logical to think that whatever thing 'inside' you is giving you pleasure is also present in all other people. Finally, he adds that this universality cannot be objective because there is no rule that can prove matters of taste. Nonetheless we still feel a \"necessary satisfaction\" from the object. The world \"necessary\" indicates that we think that everyone should find it beautiful. The feeling is a kind of \"common sense\" that we experience.Next, through some arguments that I don't quite understand, he concludes that the pleasure in beauty has to be based on \"cognition in general\". Kant wants to ground beauty in cognition but it cannot be any type of exact cognitive judgement since that would contradict point 2 and the three factors mentioned that beauty is not based on. \"Cognition in general\" is a bit of a hand-wavy thing that talks about the harmony we feel when our brain-bits go whirring in just the right ways, as if we are making a conceptual judgement, but we don't really. It's a bit like how we say \"the car is red\" and \"the car is beautiful\" in exactly the same way, but Kant wants to tell us that though the second sentence has the form of the first it isn't a conceptual judgement in the same way.He next explains what we are conveying by calling something beautiful. He advances a formalist aesthetics - that it all comes down to particular spatial and temporal relationships in the object. Further, beauty comes from \"purposiveness\" - which is a term for feeling a purpose that an object has based on its form, even when we can't really think of anything definite. Something that is beautiful might not have any clear purpose but through its form, we feel a \"purposiveness.\" (keep in mind that something that has a very clear \"purpose\", like a car, might readily not be beautiful). This feeling is connected to the previous point because it originates from our \"cognition in general\" achieving harmony and the \"purposiveness\" is a reflection of that harmony.The sublime is of two kinds - mathematical and dynamic, characterized by objects and experiences in nature that are vast in size or instill fear, respectively. Both categories of the sublime are not properties of the object but of our mind. Both categories help us get in touch with our \"real self\" and hence give us pleasure that is similar to the \"beautiful\", except the source is not on the object's form but on the state of mind it creates inside us.Finally, on the morality of it all, Kant says that judging the beauty of things prepares us to or helps us enjoy the feeling of exercising control over what we sense. This, supposedly, might transfer over to morality where we must make judgements on what to is the right thing to do.",
