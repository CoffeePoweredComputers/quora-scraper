            "answer_text": "That would depend on what you mean by redundant. Redundant is defined as \u201cno longer needed\u201d, as long as humans exist and are here to ask questions like yours, we are not redundant. Technology and machines were created by us and are in the end, only tools for our use. Despite warnings from some other-wise intelligent people, technology can never achieve consciousness no matter the advancements in speed, storage, or processing power. Technology without humanity has no reason to exist, it has no purpose. Without us telling technology what to do, it would sit and wait in idle/stand-by mode until it\u2019s power source was used up, then simply rot back into the dirt where it ultimately came from. The machine worlds of The Matrix or Terminator movies make for some fun entertainment, but these fantasy worlds don\u2019t survive the simplest of logic tests. ",
