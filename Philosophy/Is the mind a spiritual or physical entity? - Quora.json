            "answer_text": "The mind is neither a physical entity, nor a spiritual entity. It is the subtle part of our existence; the body is gross and physical. We know we have the five sense organs; we have limbs, hands, legs, a heart, lungs, critical organs, but the mind - have you seen the mind? It is not a physical entity you can touch. Not even a picture can be captured of the mind because it is not physical. Is it spiritual? No, the spiritual entity is the Soul, the Spirit, the Atman - the power that gives life. The mind is just a thought factory - it has a subtle existence. It is the Mind and the Ego, ME, that is the cause of our taking birth again and again because of its Karma. Thus, the mind is neither spiritual, nor physical. ",

            "answer_text": "Its not spiritual but a subtle material element. There are 5 gross material elements.. earth, water, air, fire and ether. There are also 3 subtle material elements which are mind, intelligence and false ego. At the time of death, your subtle body takes you to another womb where the gross body is formed according to your work in the previous birth. In elavated spiritual consciousness, the mind, intelligence and ego is surrendered to the Supreme Lord and hence purified. This means the consciousness becomes one with the will of the Lord. ",
