            "answer_text": "Dear Anthony Thomas, hi!! I know only that Slavoj Zizek is my favorite \u201crock\u201d philosopher, whom I have followed ever since I first came across a book written by him over twenty years ago! For as long, I have read several of his books, I have listened to his lectures and interviews on global matters and I do appreciate the way of his conflicting against \u201cpreoccupations\u201d or even well-established and fixed ideas of other \u201cnon-rock\u201d thinkers. Nevertheless, I have sometimes questioned the way he expresses his worldviews but not the worldviews themselves. I am well aware of the fact that he has often been underestimated or misinterpreted by either scientists or current philosophers but he has managed to overcome his critics\u2019 disapproval and move forward. This, however, is my personal opinion and I believe that he is worth your effort to find more about him by yourself so that you will be able to better get to know him and become familiar with his work. As for the superlative degree \u201cthe smartest\u201d in your question, I have no authority to pronounce on this issue since I have long accepted Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences. According to this theory, humans may be exceptionally intelligent or absolutely stupid depending on the kind of intelligence they have had the chance of developing and mastering! \u201cBeing more or less intelligent\u201d, I argue, does not actually count. What does count is how you consciously make use of any degree of intelligence you have developed so far, which is your responsibility to keep active and further evolve. With love, Calomoira Estianidi ",

            "answer_text": "I have never met him; he was my Ph.D.\u2019s advisor\u2019s, Ph.D. advisor\u2026but that offers no insights. My adviser also edited one of his books (The Monstrosity of Christ) which he coauthored with John Milbank\u2026one of my dissertations readers\u2026which also offers no insights. So let\u2019s just say I know people who know him well, and I\u2019m certain they would all agree he\u2019s very intelligent. But the smartest? I\u2019m not certain how one would come to that conclusion and to say that he is not is hardly a discredit. Indeed he is good at marketing himself and has become a \u2018brand\u2019. Personally that\u2019s not my style, though ego and intelligence are neither contraries nor intrinsically linked. He is a deep thinker, and though ideologically bent, I think it\u2019s safe to assume he is a good part of the current philosophical discussion. Thanks for the A2A ",
