            "answer_text": "If you were ordered to kill somebody on pain of death, knowing that if you didn't they would be killed anyway, would you do so to save your own life? If, for example, you lived under a totalitarian government which persecuted innocent people such as the Third Reich, and you were ordered by a commanding officer to kill a civilian, and if you refused you would be executed, would you do it, given that the civilian would be killed anyway? Not enough information. What\u2019s lacking is any sense of the life I could expect to have after I save my own skin by killing the civilian who would be killed anyway. Since it\u2019s hypothetical, I want to know the life I am guaranteed to have, as well as the death I am guaranteed to have, then I could make a full assessment of what my likely conduct would be. If all I have to look forward to is more being forced to kill people in service of a totalitarian regime that might soon make me the target someone else is to kill on pain of execution, I might as well stand on principle and say \u201cI refuse,\u201d in the hope that perhaps someone would so admire my courage that the episode sparks an insurrection that makes trouble for the regime if not overthrows it entirely (provided of course that my death is not contrived to be as slow and torturous as possible). If on the other hand the regime is about to crumble and by killing the civilian who would be killed anyway I buy time to survive the fall of the regime and enjoy a long and happy life, I would be foolish not to kill the doomed civilian, even though I would always have to live with the memory of that killing. If I don\u2019t know one way or the other, I would probably kill the civilian, since doing so would secure my survival for at least a little longer, and in that interval I might escape or the regime might crumble or I might have the opportunity to take out a persecutor or two, perhaps even the kingpin. Were I the doomed civilian in the scenario, I wouldn\u2019t expect the person charged with killing me to do other than that, since I\u2019m going to die either way. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally, I wouldn\u2019t because I don\u2019t believe I could live with myself after. For me, there is a difference in moral responsibility between killing and letting die. Whether or not someone is going to kill me or someone else is their moral choice, not mine. And if I choose to kill someone else, that\u2019s my moral choice and responsibility. If I were a consequentialist, saving one life by killing one would be a net gain over the option of letting two die. A consequentialist could theoretically justify killing the other to save themselves. Could they really? And could they really live with it? I think that would be up to each person to decide for themselves. If someone did make the consequentialist choice, I would understand and wouldn\u2019t morally judge them for it, even though that\u2019s not the choice I would make. I believe that our moral choices either increase or decrease our moral character and sensitivity, so much so that sufficient vice can lead a normal healthy person to mental health issues, including sociopathy and psychopathy. I fear the person I would become if I killed another, especially in order to save myself. The only case I can imagine where I would is if I had already entered into a previous agreement with the other that, should this case come up, we would kill the other to save ourselves or someone else. But I don\u2019t think I would enter into such a contract in any rational state of mind. Probably the most clever moral thing for me to do would be to lie to the officer, take the gun, then shoot myself. In that case, since I shot someone, depending on how they react and interpret the situation, they may let the other live. But if they don\u2019t, the result would be no different and we would both die. ",
