That is the  standard view of Descartes as the hinge of modernity - which also has the kernel of later atheistic thinking.  The earlier scholastic  view was something like knowledge is all  divine revelation and human intelligence is more or less in tune with that. This book goes over it pretty well:A Short History of Atheism ",

            "answer_text": "Not only does it reverse God's status, but it reverses the world's status. Previously, in scholastic, Aristotelian realism, one could say that I am because the world is, but with Descartes it became the world is because I am.  The world became an idea in my mind which I projected outward. Descartes was the beginning of Idealism. ",
