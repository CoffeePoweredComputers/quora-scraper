            "answer_text": "You can be happy. You can be sad. This is not about nihilism. This is about you finding philosophical reasons for your current mood. Nihilism is finding out that life has no intrinsic divine meaning,that Life is meaning attributed by us animals. Happiness on the other hand, is being content here and now. Meaning and happiness are usually correlated, but not necessarily so. X and Y. Or M and H. One does not have to cause the other. If you break up with your girlfriend, you suddenly blame God and life and curse lack of meaning. But when you are enjoying your newfound relationship, you dont give a damn about the world having a defined purpose or meaning. If you are capable and strong, you can continue pursuing your goals no matter whether your life has any meaning in the short term or long.  ",
