            "answer_text": "The absolute God is unimaginable as per several statements of the Vedas and the Gita, which are the Holy Scriptures of Hinduism. Scientists should not reject the existence of any unimaginable item claiming that everything is explicable or imaginable. They should not refuse to accept unimaginable miracles, treating them to be explicable magic. The same scientists say that space is infinite and its boundary is unimaginable. If you reach the boundary where the imaginable universe ends, you have touched the boundary where some different (unimaginable) item begins. It is just like reaching the boundary where water ends, which is also the boundary where land, which is different from water, begins. Similarly, if you follow the trail of smoke (to its origin), you find that at the boundary where the smoke ends, you will touch fire, which is different from smoke. Just as the fire is the generator of the smoke, the unimaginable God is the generator of this imaginable universe or space. Before the generation of the product, the generator alone exists. Similarly, before the generation of space, God alone exists. This means that space or spatial dimensions cannot exist in God since space cannot exist before it is generated. This means that God has no spatial dimensions. Your intelligence cannot imagine anything having no spatial dimensions even if you try to imagine for millions of years. The conclusion of this analysis is that the unimaginable and invisible God exists as the boundary of this imaginable universe. Buddha kept silent about God. This should not be misunderstood as the negation of God. It should be understood that God being unimaginable is indicated by silence i.e., He is beyond words. Unity of Religions in the Universe Every religion says that their God created this earth and humanity. But, unfortunately, there is only one earth! This means that there must be only one God, who is the internal unimaginable-invisible God in different human forms. The conservatives of every religion are rigid about the worship of their God alone saying that their scripture alone is right. Let Me take the example of conservative people in Christianity, who say that for those who do not believe in Jesus, hell is inevitable. India was discovered by the West some 1700 years after the delivery of the Bible by Jesus in Jerusalem. So 17 generations in India have gone to hell for no fault of theirs. Had the Bible been delivered in all the countries simultaneously, at least some people of these 17 generations might have been saved. This unnecessarily makes God appear partial. But God being the Father of all humanity on this single earth cannot be partial! This defect attacks the side of conservative people of every religion. There is no answer from the side of these conservatives to this argument. But there is an excellent answer from the side of Universal Spirituality. God came in different human forms to all countries simultaneously and delivered the same contents in different languages as different scriptures. Therefore, God is not partial to anybody. Those who followed those contents went to God irrespective of their religion and country. Human Incarnation of God Every human being is a single phase system formed by the homogenous mixing of the two components, matter and energy. Matter is visible and imaginable and it forms the human body. Energy is invisible and imaginable. This energy has two subdivisions: 1)\tThe inert energy that binds the matter. It also exists in different forms of work like respiration, digestion, etc. as seen in functioning systems like lungs, intestines etc. 2)\tThe living energy or awareness, which is the specific work form of the above inert energy functioning in the nervous system. It is called as soul. The unimaginable-invisible God expresses Himself by entering a selected human being called as the human incarnation. This human incarnation is thus the homogenous mixture of the three components: God, matter and energy (including both the subdivisions of energy). This is called as Aatreya, which means \u2018three-treated-as-one\u2019. This incarnation is called as Datta, which means \u2018given\u2019 i.e., the unimaginable-invisible God is given to the world as the imaginable-visible relative God and He is called as Datta-Aatreya or Dattatreya. Just as the invisible electric current is experienced through a visible metallic wire, God is experienced through the selected human being. Apart from the physical appearance of the materialized body, the main purpose of this human incarnation is preaching spiritual knowledge and the clarification of all doubts. This is possible only with the help of awareness or the soul. This is the reason why God does not exist in inert matter. However, inert statues and images can be worshipped as representative models of God to increase one\u2019s personal devotion even though direct service to God is not possible through these images. In Hinduism, Hanuman and the Gopikas stand as the topmost liberated souls. They worshipped and served their contemporary human incarnations alone. God comes in human form in every generation and in every culture simultaneously to avoid the partiality of blessing only one specific generation and one specific religion without any reason. Thus, the human incarnations like Krishna, Buddha, Jesus, Mohammad, Mahavir, etc., can be recognized. The internal unimaginable God in all these different human forms is one and the same since there can be many imaginables but the Unimaginable can be only One. The soul departing from this world enters an inert energetic body (non-material) and can be treated as a single component of energy alone. Alternatively, it can be treated as a two-component system by treating the two subdivisions of energy as two different components. The unimaginable God enters a selected energetic human being and is called as Father of Heaven or Narayana etc. Thus, the energetic incarnation is also a homogenous mixture of three components. Repulsion Due to the Common Medium The whole tragedy is that the human being in this world rejects the human incarnation (God in human form) and the same human being in an energetic body in the upper world, rejects the energetic incarnation of God due to the principle of \u2018repulsion between common media\u2019. Human beings are unable to recognize the unimaginable-invisible God, the third component, and instead, treat the incarnation to be identical to themselves. They think that even the incarnation is only a system of two components (matter and energy). By this, the soul loses God forever, here (this world) and there (upper world). The main reason for this is the ego and jealousy towards a fellow human form. The removal of ego and jealousy can be eradicated by a special training, which is the development of love and respect for fellow human beings through service. The hatred for fellow living beings is the source of sin. This should be controlled by the fear of hell. Mohammad, who was Himself a human incarnation of God, deleted this very concept of human incarnation, since His preceding human incarnation, Jesus, was crucified by fellow human beings due to their excessive ego and jealousy. Existence of Heaven and Hell The scientist may say that hell does not exist since I am unable to show him hell in space. But in this infinite space, the scientist too is unable to show Me the absence of hell. This results in a situation of 50:50 probability. One person tells a blind man that there is a fire ahead and another person tells him that there is no fire ahead. In this context of a 50:50 probability, the wise blind man goes back avoiding the risk. You do not lose anything even if hell is absent and you have not commited any sin in your life. On the other hand, thinking that there is no hell, if you commit sins in your life and at the end you discover that hell actually exists, the consequences are horrible! This shall open the eyes of the scientist and the atheist regarding the value of spirituality. ",

Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me. 46 Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father. 47 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life. 48 I am that bread of life. 49 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. 50 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. 51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world. 52 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? 53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. 54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day. 55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. 56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. 57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. 58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever. Matt 7:15\u201320 KJV 15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. 16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? 17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. 19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

            "answer_text": "By reading His Literatures like Bhagavad-Gita and Srimad Bhagavatam, We can understand God. Krishna says in Bhagavad-Gita 9 chapter 18 verse I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge and the most dear friend. I am the creation and the annihilation, the basis of everything, the resting place and the eternal seed. Srila Prabhupada explains in the PURPORT. Everything is resting on K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's energy; therefore without K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a's shelter nothing can exist. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme ruler because everything belongs to Him and everything exists on His energy. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, being situated in everyone's heart, is the supreme witness. The residences, countries or planets on which we live are also K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the ultimate goal of shelter, and as such one should take shelter of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a either for protection or for annihilation of his distressed condition. And whenever we have to take protection, we should know that our protection must be a living force. Thus K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the supreme living entity. Since K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the source of our generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better friend than K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, nor can anyone be a better well-wisher. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is the original source of creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation. K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a is therefore the eternal cause of all causes.  ",
