            "answer_text": "The most fundamental moral principle is justice, in a way. It's specifically \"reciprocity\" or the \"golden rule\". We aspire to treat others as we would be treated in order to avoid being treated badly. This doesn't always work out, however. Very frequently there are those who feel entitled above others for whatever reason and you get things like Jim Crow laws and sexual harassment. The bottom line I suppose is respect. People want to be respected and loved -- respected by co-workers and respected and loved by friends and family. Reciprocity means that if you show respect and love, you will be shown respect and love in return. That's the most basic thing. When sexual politics gets involved it gets a little more complicated, like just because you love someone doesn't mean they have to love you back. A situation like this should be taken as an opportunity to show respect by just moving on with your life, and not the vengeance of a spurned potential suitor. ",

            "answer_text": "No. To be a fundamental principle, it has to be a primary requirement of reality: a primary \u201cought\u201d defined by what \u201cis\u201d. Justice is a derived virtue. The most fundamental moral principle is rationality. That is because our lives are conditional, and what they are most conditional on is the use of our minds, which means the proper application of reason. The virtue of rationality. That is true even on a desert island, where there are no other people, hence no opportunity for justice. But when we deal with other people, rationality requires that we treat them as they deserve: so justice is most definitely one of the primary virtues. In fact I would say that justice is the touchstone of virtue when it comes to how you treat other people. Honesty is a virtue: but not if being honest causes injustice. Integrity is a virtue: but not if the character and beliefs you are being consistent to are based on injustice. (There is no actual conflict between such virtues, but that argument gets a bit abstract, so the \u201cprimacy of justice\u201d is a useful simplification). But it is rationality, not justice, which is the most fundamental moral principle. Justice is merely one of its aspects. ",
