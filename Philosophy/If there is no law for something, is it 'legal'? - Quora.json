            "answer_text": "Yes. It is a guarantee of the Constitution, specially the 9th Amendment. It has an unfamiliar wording but it means, all rights are reserved to the citizens, unless and until, those citizens modify the right by law. This is self rule. We can do what we want until the majority in office has to put in rules. It is we the people that make the rule and it is the bad side of us that require the rules. For example, there is a recent flood of electric scooters and bikes for rent. The system allows the rental to be abandoned anywhere because the software knows where it is. There were no laws about any of this, last year. Now, some cities have banned them, some cities confiscate the abandoned equipment. Speed and helmet, number of riders, where to ride, etc, all have to be put in place, only if necessary. The 9th Amendment clearly prevents the city from hearing about the scooter idea, and rushing to make laws to \u201cget ahead of it.\u201d Nope. Not legal, to make laws in advance based on assumed outcomes. \u201cThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.\u201d Just because we listed rights in the Constitution, doesn\u2019t mean we listed them all.

            "answer_text": "I believe this is the (simple version of the) difference between roman and common law: Roman law allows, common law forbids (Someone please correct me if I\u2019m wrong.) I think common law is the most logical law. It\u2019s in a way like the 10 commandments; thou shall not so and so\u2026. Roman, or civil law is based upon participation: if you want to join us (by becoming a citizen(city dweller) or \u2018burger\u2019 if your language is Germanic) we do things so and so\u2026. Just wanted to point out here, there also appears to be a difference between \u2018lawful\u2019 and \u2018legal\u2019. I think the question would almost answer itself if it ended in \u2018 would it be lawful\u2019 The terms lawful and legal differ in that the former contemplates the substance of law, whereas the latter alludes to the form of law. A lawful act is authorized, sanctioned, or not forbidden by law. A legal act is performed in accordance with the forms and usages of law, or in a technical manner. In this sense, illegal approaches the meaning of invalid. For example, a contract or will, executed without the required formalities, might be regarded as invalid or illegal, but could not be described as unlawful.\" \"The term lawful more clearly suggests an ethical content than does the word legal. The latter merely denotes compliance with technical or formal rules, whereas the former usually signifies a moral substance or ethical permissibility. An additional distinction is that the word legal is used as the synonym of constructive, while lawfulis not. Legal fraud is Fraud implied by law, or made out by construction, but lawful fraud would be a contradiction in terms. Legal is also used as the antithesis of equitable, just. As a result, legal estate is the correct usage, instead of lawful estate. Under certain circumstances, however, the two words are used as exact equivalents. A lawful writ, warrant, or process is the same as a legal writ, warrant, or process.\" West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2. Copyright 2008 The Gale Group, Inc. Roman (civil law) is in that respect closer to \u2018legal\u2019 than \u2018lawful\u2019, as the subjects first would have to be \u2018defined\u2019 as citizens. This can be done by \u2018applying\u2019, patriotism (waving of flags or wearing uniforms) pledges. Just check. As far as I know all \u2018changes of citizenships\u2019 are not simple bureaucratic procedures, but have to include some form of pledge. ",

            "answer_text": "It is possible for there to be no written law, but the action is still looked at as illegal. Common law is used to fill in where there are no specific law on the books. Because of issues with this, the majority of laws have been codified, or written down, into a body of law for the country or state. Pretty much everyone understands that killing a person is against the law. But many jurisdictions have never bothered to define murder in their code, as it is \u2018known\u2019 that it is against social morals. They simply define the different types of murder and the penalties for each type. ",

            "answer_text": "How can something be defined as legal or illegal if there is no law addressing it. By the same token, just because something might be legal, or at least not illegal . . . that doesn\u2019t make it right or even smart to do. For example there is no law against being uneducated, ignorant, or even stupid. If there was, religions would stop preying on people for money . . . but is it morally right? One of my favorite movies was Oh God Part II with George Burns (God) interacting with Paul Sorvino who was playing a televangelist. There is one reason I wish there really was a God, just to see what happens to the majority of these super church televangelists when they get to meet him/her/it. Other than that, I will retain my apathy about religion. Is what they do \u2018legal\u2019, apparently so . . . but is it right? ",
