You will tell me \u201cWell it works this way, because of X\u201d. I will ask you you \u201cWhy X? How does X work?\u201d And you will tell me \u201cWell X works because of Y\u201d. And I will ask you \u201cWhy Y? How does Y work?\u201d \u2026and so on. Like a petulant child I will keep asking \u201cWhy?\u201d, and you will keep answering \u201cBecause\u2026\u201d \u2026until you cannot do it any more, because you simply do not know. For example\u2026 Why do children looks like their parents?Because they inherit traits.Why do they inherit traits?Because genes and DNA.Why genes and DNA?Because all life has that.How did life come to have have DNA?We do not know. Every chain of \u201cWhy - Because - Why\u201d ends in \u201cI do not know\u201d. Knowledge is bounded in all directions such that when you reach that boundary, you have to answer \u201cI do not know\u201d. The job of science is to move that boundary so deep, that when someone asks \u201cWhy\u201d, they will \u2014 eventually \u2014 get an answer that makes them say \u201cOk, that is good enough for me, thank you\u201d.
