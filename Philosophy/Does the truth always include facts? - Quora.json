            "answer_text": "As asked, I would say definitely not. As \u201cfacts\" are many times based on societal expectation, most \u201cfacts\" are actually arbitrary and culturally based. I think most truths include interpretations, and what defines an absolute truth is the absence of interpretation; something that does not depend on constructs such as words or numbers that describe it. The sky is blue\u2026. That's interpretation. Is light diffracted as it passes through our atmosphere resulting in specific frequencies reaching out eyes? That's truth. Both could be considered \u201cfacts\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "A fact is just a snippet of information, usually but not always objective, that a certain amount of people agree on. Facts can and do change over time. The truth is a concept of an absolute thing that doesn\u2019t change over time though interpretations of specific \u201ctruths\u201d can change over time. Also, many things that are purported to be truth and/or facts are actually complete fiction. It\u2019s possible to have a truth without any facts. For example a person could be in denial of the truth and hold onto all the facts that seem to contradict said truth. These things are all loose concepts anyway. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re mathematically defined extrapolations from the fundamental forces of the universe. ",
