            "answer_text": "No; knowledge is knowledge howsoever it is gained. Knowledge gained from experience however is the most vivid hence people tend to place more importance on it. Experience is important obviously - but learning by experiencing is the worst form of learning. We are all allowed a limited number of experiences in our life so if we rely on experience to learn something we would learn very little. Knowledge gained through reason and reflection is the best because it allows us to comprehend our experience and thus to learn better and faster. Books should be used as a way to stimulate one\u2019s own thoughts. They are a means to an end not an end in itself. They allow you to expand your base of knowledge by bringing into purview other\u2019s experiences. Comparing their experiences with yours allows you to understand your own experiences better. If you consider another\u2019s experiences and perspectives it helps to prevent being too rigid with your own point of view. So experience by itself is no help in gaining knowledge; for reflection and comprehension of experience is important for knowledge. The boundary of experience is the present but knowledge pertains to the future - what has not yet happened; what is hidden. You have true knowledge only when you have the ability to grasp something before it takes shape. The primary use of experience is in acquisition of skills - for experience makes muscle memory - allowing you to become familiar and confident with your territory and finally it allows you to test your knowledge; for feedback gained by experience is useful in self-appraisal but that too only when we have the ability to assess the feedback correctly - by grasping its implications. But even here its boundary is circumscribed for skills do not allow you to deal with situations you are unfamiliar with. So knowledge and experience are and should be mutually complimentary but learning process must seek to understand experience and and use that understanding as a base to transcend experience. ",

            "answer_text": "They say knowledge gained from experience make you street-smart, while knowledge gained from books make you book-smart. These notions may have some truth in them, however, if you tend to focus more on one over the other, you might find yourself inadequately equipped to adapt to the many facets and challenges in life. A person whose lifestyle and core means of living is derived from interacting with different people from all walks of life that requires a great amount of \u201creading\u201d and estimation of people\u2019s motives and inclinations, and some degree of applying instinct, then knowledge gained from experience would play a major part of that person\u2019s life. A person who leads a life of organization, routine, and occupies a relatively strict procedural work in an office environment may need more \u201cbrains\u201d gained from books and formal education in performing his/her job. My take is to balance the knowledge gained from experience and knowledge acquired from books because one is as important as the other. ",
