            "answer_text": "By becoming more rational and objective and learning to accept your reality. The Five-Step Practice of Acceptance,  Which consists of three main skills, objective distance, acceptance, and reason. 1) Abiding in a more objective distance 2) Accepting and embracing the reality of the situation 3) Working to limit instinctual reactivity from arising 4) Apply reason to gain understanding 5) If moved, act to improve the situation Step one, begin by learning to abide in a more objective distance by slowing down, focusing on the breath, and becoming present in the current moment. Take a step back from your perception of the world to create a slight distance between yourself and reality. Now, shift your awareness from the doing mind to the observing mind, abiding less as the doer of actions and more as the observing witness. Experientially, you may feel a shift in perception as your inner-world and outer-world come into harmony and balance. Compulsive thinking may begin to fall away, along with the intense immediacy that normally plagues us, which is replaced by a spacious, clear, and open objectivity. Our aim is that through practice, this state of objective distance can become a nearly continuous state of mind, our default-mindset where the mind consistently abides. From within this state, when difficulties arise, we\u2019re prepared, and have the space to operate effectively. The next step, step two, is to accept whatever may arise and openly embrace the reality of the situation. In step three you remain watchful, working to limit any impulsive, involuntary reactivity that may arise. Step four is to apply reason to gain insight into your problems within their larger context. And lastly, in step five, with the understanding gained from this method you can maturely decide whether to ignore the situation or to take actions to resolve it. ",

            "answer_text": "I am assuming that you are getting your feelings hurt on a regular basis. Feedback from others on our behavior is essential. Often we don\u2019t like it. Often others are rude about what they say. Some may even be cruel. So you have to develop a hard shell for those who just want to hurt you. But you still must listen to them. There are reasons why they said what they did, and you may need to know them. They may be irrational, wrong in every way, and so on, and they may be right on. There is a saying that the people around you often know you better than you know yourself. You might not realize that when your Mama starts in or criticizing you, you frown and pout, but your Mama notices it and does not like that attitude. Every single person who was ever alive needs/needed correction and feedback. I cannot tell you how to shield your feelings. (Look into the philosophy of Stoicism). Grin and bear it and most of all, learn from it and correct those things about your behavior that that feedback tells you is a problem. No matter what the motivation underlying the criticism you hate, you need it and you need to thank those who give it to you, though that may be painful. Many of us when we get more mature thank our parents and teachers for putting up with our childish behavior (and what else can a child do, anyway?) and love us anyway. I am afraid that this is all too uncommon. Honor those who helped you along the way - sometimes that is your enemies most of all. ",

It\u2019s not worth it to fight the whole world just because they have a negative perception of you. Their perception might be wrong, so. Some will like you and some won\u2019t like you, and there\u2019s no amount of convincing that will change that. People are allowed to have opinions, but they aren\u2019t allowed to force them. If someone is disrespectful then you can confront them diplomatically, rather than just taking what they said and going home. But if you hate yourself or have low self-esteem then you won\u2019t question people and you\u2019ll take everything personally. ",

My Grammie always said \u2018What people think is not your business. If they want you to know, they'll tell you. My father says \u2018Stop renting out the space in your head so other people can live there. Sweetie, you don't have that much space'.
