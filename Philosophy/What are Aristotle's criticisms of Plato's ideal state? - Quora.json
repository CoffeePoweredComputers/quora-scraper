His chief concern is the infeasibility, impracticality and undesirability of having wives, children and property in common; under this general heading several specific criticisms are made. Rather than list these here, please let me refer you to pp. 102\u2013104 in Susemihl & Hicks (cited below). Hope this helps! References Mayhew, R. Aristotle\u2019s Criticism of Plato\u2019s Republic.

            "answer_text": "Aristotle\u2019s opinion of much of Plato would have been negative. He thought property for instance should be private and each should mind his own business to save quarrels. Also Aristotle believed that if Plato\u2019s plans were good then someone would have thought of them sooner. Surely not the most sophisticated of arguments. I have little time for Plato believing both he and Aristotle were moving in the wrong direction in moving away from the pre-Socratics, but comparing Aristotle with Plato is like comparing a pygmy with a giant.
