            "answer_text": "Is it possible to find an email psychic? Lots of the established reputable readers offer this service, many of the websites offer them. But you need to be able to work out which are the accurate and helpful readings. Avoid the call centres and agencies that have people sit there waiting for hours for a short phone call at so much a minute, some of these also offer a so called email reading. If you want to be sure that the consultation is accurate and helpful and done by a reputable person with real experience you must go to a website run by one individual, someone who is established and works alone and is busy with clients. Email consultations offer a lot of advantages over face to face and telephone sittings.. but only if done by someone who really knows what they are doing! You can see from my own website that I am well established and reputable, with a lot of experience. Thank you for reading this. Have a nice day. Is it possible to find an email psychic? ",

            "answer_text": "Well, of course. You just found one. I answer questions through email just as accurately and thoroughly as I do in person, on video or on the phone. Many psychics work this way because it is cheaper for you and quick for us so we can help more people. However, most psychics, healers and mediums are scams. Find a reliable one that has a lot of experience and lot of clients. ",
