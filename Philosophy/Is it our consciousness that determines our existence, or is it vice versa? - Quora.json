            "answer_text": "To determine or discover the ultimate reality in being is to regain or recover that consciousness in being which hitherto is just an objective knowledge . Its literally quid pro quid . The fact of some one or something existing led the human intellect to discover or determine what it is or what is the nature of its being. Fire , water, earth , sun \u2026\u2026. any thing but any thing that has been determined till now has been done so , because there is a form of something or some object in being . All existence that has been determined or discovered by human intellect is an objective fact , its the state of being present or being a condition , our existence or human existence determined this and the state of being recognized in or by the existence of the human form therefore if is said to be cause of existence than will it be wrong? Its human form of intellect that has or is or will keep on determining existence , which is there just being , its a continuum in being , a flux , that has no beginning and there fore no end that can be determined . This was, is and will be the way of life , that which is existence for us as it has been for our ancestors as it will be for future generations , i.e human existence determining the fact of something existing i.e being as conveyed above therefore if is taken in scientific terms than the observer and observed relationship is there naked to be felt by intellect . In science observer therefore is determining the cause of existence , or is active in it as way of life in human form co -existing time after time , how ever consciousness that which is the ultimate reality found in all objective existence , therefore cause of all existence as there is in fact is not being found as to what is its reality. In religions in essence or in spiritual science observer determining the cause of existence realized that its due to its own form of existence time after time the whole existence in being i.e time space continuum was dependent on , it all was subject to human existence and endeavored to seek as to what determines its own existence? Like the observer observing an object or an object being observed , the existence of the form of self was observed literally i.e to watch carefully the way something happens or the way someone does something, especially to learn more about it, this MEDITATION recovered or resurrected the consciousness which determines the cause of all existence. The same consciousness that science finds is the determinant i.e something that controls or affects what happens in a particular form or situation in being , that omnipresent and omniscient being .

            "answer_text": "It is simply interplay of words. Call it consciousness or power of knowing it is one and same. The power of knowing is the biggest gift to man and mankind. Man can discern with almost clarity what is right or wrong or what is real or unreal in existence and he can reach the root of nature or creation, both are one and same just known by different name. THIS power of knowing is most powerful invention in existence and without it even nature becomes irrelevant. But unfortunately it is used in reverse and we are drowned in the ocean of untruth .We forget to know and understand the true and core identity of our ownself. We get dragged into day today affair and leave this existence without knowing the purpose of birth and cause behind it. If we examine in life with the right logic and rational understanding we can know what is known and unknown in the existence with mathematical precision. This power of knowing rightly is nothing but pure awakening which cannot be bound by any illusive power which is also called MAYA. This pure awakening is the birth right of each individual and he cannot be denied by anyone and not even CREATOR. The awakened individual is the biggest force which is feared most by nature. It is impossible to put him to sleep by any force. I hope this makes clear as to what is existence, what is reality, what is illusion and where we as an individual stand in the midst of all complexities, confusions and imaginations of all kinds ",
