            "answer_text": "Good grief. It\u2019s 2017, not 1917, not 1817. Evolution was empircally demonstrated to the complete satisfaction of the scientific community before your grandparents were born. I don\u2019t know what cultural backwater bubble you were raised in, but you need to deal with reality if you want to have a meaningful existence. Evolution is settled science, not to mean that research isn\u2019t refining our understanding of it every day, but the backbone is there, proven by consilience. Consilience is the way in which a multitude of avenues of research, using a variety of tools and datasets and reasoning, all converging on a common conclusion. Thus, for example, plate tectonics, from geology, \u201cproves\u201d evolution. DNA sequencing and analyses \u201cproves\u201d evolution. The fossil record \u201cproves\u201d evolution. The fact of many organisms evolving since science started studying living organisms \u201cproves\u201d evolution. Darwin\u2019s observations in the Galapagos Islands \u201cproved\u201d evolution. There are literally thousands more examples. Evolution is as proven as internal combustion. You really need to devote your time to learning about evolution instead of pretending it\u2019s 150 years ago when this was an actual topic.  Sorry about the typos. The first image is also incorrect in that it has been discovered that our ancestors walked fully upright going back over 6 million years. They were just smaller, with monkey heads on top of their human-ish bodies, roughly speaking. The bigger picture:  The \u201corigin of life\u201d part was one simple organism 1.6 billion years ago. Probably originating from a millions of years long process around a hydrothermal event, perhaps one found (now inactive) in a western Australian desert north of Perth. ",

            "answer_text": "Endogenous retroviruses or ERVs Common ancestry was proved when it was discovered that both humans and chimps have identical sets of damaged DNA in identical locations caused by extremely rare chance encounters with viruses who accidentally integrated themselves into a sperm or egg cell of an ancestral primate and became a hereditary marker across all evolutionary species. These endogenized retroviruses (ERV) not only proved our ancestry with chimps, but are revealing our connection to other more distant cousins like the gorillas, gibbons and lemurs. ERV #HERV-K10 is one such example. HERV-K10 is present in all primates and humans except for the New World Monkeys (the really small mouse-like monkeys like the tamarin and marmoset). This means that HERV-K10 virus was embedded after we all split from the New World Monkey lineage but before we split from the main primate tree. ERV #SINE-R and ZNF80 are two other embedded virus that are only found in humans, chimps and gorillas. This means that SINE-R and ZNF80 was embedded after we all split from the orangutans, gibbons and lemurs but before we split from the chimps and gorillas. ERV #SINE-RC2 is only found in humans. This means that SINE-RC2 was embedded after we split from the chimps and gorillas. There have been more than 40 of these identical ERVs identified in the human/chimp species alone and further mapping studies indicates that there may be in excess of 100,000 ERVs across all vertebrates making a detailed history of all evolutionary relationships possible. Work is underway to identify all of the ERVs in the entire primate family. Proof of the endogenization process caan be currently seen in real time through the koala lineage who have recently become infected with a gammaretrovirus called KoRV. ERVs are as smoking as the gun that puts criminals in jail for murder. Where a court of law only needs one match to convict a person, ERV's provide more than 40 matches for common ancestry. It would be deniable if you could show identical chimp/human ERVs in a rabbit, whale or a cat ..... but you can't. ERVs are viruses that infected a common ancestor - not junk DNA that just so happened to look like each other in 43 different places on our genomes. Some creationists have buckled under the evidence and now claim that the viruses attack hotspots - of course these hotspots just happen to be where human / chimp insertion sites match. But the study of HIV shows this is false and that the insertions are highly random - attacking anywhere along 240 million different sites - perhaps even more. But that's not all there is to this story. Genetic drifting - the slow mutilation of DNA segments over time - also affects ERVs and identically mutilated ERVs have been found in humans and chimps. Lastly, the identically mutilated ERVs have also identically deteriorated over time indicating the same date of integration in humans and chimps. The seven paragraphs above have been adapted from a Yahoo! Answer by \u201cRandy the Atheist\u201d, 2 years ago. Do atheists realize that since there are scientists on both sides of the evolution-creation debate, it is not a matter of science but of?

Do you believe that a bunny rabbit that can\u2019t run very fast has the same chance of surviving to produce offspring as his faster siblings? No; obviously not. Congratulations! you believe in Natural Selection. That\u2019s all there is to it. Nothing to prove: it\u2019s nothing beyond these 2 facts: 1. Inheritable variation exists within populations (even nominal clones). 2. Variations better adapted to their environment will on average live longer to produce more offspring than those less well adapted. The second point is more a tautology than an assertion of fact. It might be argued that we have been interfering with that process for the last few thousand years to create domesticated animals like chickens, cattle, and innumerable breeds of dogs; and new foods like corn and grapefruit, etc., so it\u2019s not Natural any more: Artificial Selection! But aren\u2019t we part of Nature? We have indeed sped the selection process up drastically, and it\u2019s not clear whether Nature\u2019s latest experiment with brains that tinker with Selection itself will turn out well for us (Nature, of course, remains indifferent). I think the still widespread feeling that there\u2019s something here that needs proving stems from widespread adoption of the entirely misleading and contentious term Evolution over the straightforward and self-explanatory Natural Selection. I read that Darwin regretted his single use of the E word; using everywhere else the benign Natural Selection. Contention might fade away if we stop using that E word! ",

            "answer_text": "The definition of evolution is both observable and demonstrable, and has been demonstrated in numerous studies over hundreds of years. The science is empirical. One of the most often referred to in schools is the long running, (since 1988), Lenski E.coli study, but you can look up many others. There are studies on speciation, you can look at the classics like Darwin\u2019s finches, for example. If you read the definition, it is simply a description of natural processes of mutation and natural selection. It is not a theory, and certainly not The Theory of Evolution, (TOE). The TOE is quite different as it makes claims about evolution that contradict science and the definition. Note that I said the definition is observable and demonstrable. The TOE is neither and never has been. It consists of sweeping unfounded statements of pure speculation and assumption presented as fact - thus\u2026 evolution | Theory, Examples, & Facts Contrast this with the definition\u2026 Evolution - Wikipedia the first paragraph is the definition, the third onwards, the TOE. Note this - \u201cAll life on Earth shares a last universal common ancestor (LUCA) that lived approximately 3.5\u20133.8 billion years ago.\u201d This is the foundation of the TOE and requires that the Phylogenetic Tree on which it is based, is true. It isn\u2019t. It is pure speculation and unsupported assumption. Here it is\u2026 Google Image Result for https://globalchange.umich.edu/fossil1.jpg Just one example of how evolutionists express their \u201cproof\u201d or \u201cevidence\u201d of their claims. Often referred to by evolutionists, but never actually read by them, it appears. Right at the start, is how they analyse things. Bold mine. Phylogenetic tree - Wikipedia \u201cA speculatively rooted tree for rRNA genes, showing the three life domains: bacteria, archaea, and eukaryota. The black branch at the bottom of the phylogenetic tree connects the three branches of living organisms to the last universal common ancestor. A rooted phylogenetic tree, each node with descendants represents the inferred most recent common ancestor of those descendants, and the edge lengths in some trees may be interpreted as time estimates. Each node is called a taxonomic unit. Internal nodes are generally called hypothetical taxonomic units, as they cannot be directly observed. Trees are useful in fields of biology such as bioinformatics, systematics, and phylogenetics. Unrooted trees illustrate only the relatedness of the leaf nodes and do not require the ancestral root to be known or inferred. Although phylogenetic trees produced on the basis of sequenced genes or genomic data in different species can provide evolutionary insight, these analyses have important limitations. Most importantly, the trees that they generate are not necessarily correct \u2013 they do not necessarily accurately represent the evolutionary history of the included taxa. As with any scientific result, they are subject to falsification by further study (e.g., gathering of additional data, analyzing the existing data with improved methods). The data on which they are based may be noisy; the analysis can be confounded by genetic recombination, horizontal gene transfer, hybridisation between species that were not nearest neighbors on the tree before hybridisation takes place, convergent evolution, and conserved sequences. Phylogenetic trees can also be inferred from a range of other data types, including morphology, the presence or absence of particular types of genes, insertion and deletion events \u2013 and any other observation thought to contain an evolutionary signal.\u201d So the tree, is pure speculation. LUCA? Pure speculation. Unidentified, unidentifiable, indescribable, it is a myth, a figment of the imagination. So with every single one of all so-called \u201ccommon ancestors\u201d, all missing from every branch of this mythical tree. ",

It\u2019s a really weird thing to say. It\u2019s a different thing to propose an explanation for how it works, and that\u2019s the theory of evolution. Still, you cannot \u201cprove\u201d it, you can test and confirm its predictions, and fail to disprove it. If it has predictive power, then it is useful, so we use it. And that\u2019s why we use the theory of evolution to explain how evolution works. If you\u2019re asking how to confirm the theory of evolution, the then answer is that you test its predictions, as with any other theory. The theory of evolution explains that evolution is driven by natural selection, that the change in alleles frequencies in a population over time will tend towards better adaptation to the population\u2019s environment, due to natural selection. Those individuals who are more fit to their environemnt will tend to statistically survive and reproduce more successfully than those who are not, which means that the alleles that produce better fitness will become more common in the population over time, and therefore the population as a whole will become more fit to its environment. So that\u2019s what you test. It\u2019s been demonstrates so, so many times. And this simpe fact is used in many different fields, and is behind a lot of modern technology, not just in biology, but also in fields related to computer science, as not only living things can evolve things way. We also evovle designs, and use evolution by natural seleciton in machine learning and advanced robots, for example. But honestly, you shouldn\u2019t even have to demonstrate this empirically, since it\u2019s so obvious through logic that natural selection will produce evolution towards better fitness. ",
