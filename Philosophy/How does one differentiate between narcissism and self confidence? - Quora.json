            "answer_text": "Narcissistic Personality Disorder and many of the traits associated with it are actually defenses against underlying low or unstable self-esteem. This is the opposite of true self-confidence. One of the reasons for the confusion is that people with Exhibitionist Narcissistic Personality Disorder appear very self-confident and want other people to see them as perfect. Here are some ways that can you distinguish true self-confidence from Narcissistic defensive grandiosity. People with the Exhibitionist version of NPD: Make extreme and unrealistic claims about themselves, such as, \u201cI am perfect\u201d or \u201cI am never wrong.\u201dTry to impress other people by name-dropping or bragging about their successes.Will not apologize when they are wrong.Feel entitled to special treatment or act as if the rules do not apply to them.Need to be the center of admiring attention.Cannot take negative feedback gracefully.Lack emotional empathy.Devalue other people.Have no real interest in other people and either tune out when other people are speaking or jump in and dominate the conversation.Shift the blame for their failures to other people.People who are truly self-confident: Do not claim to be perfect.Can apologize.Can let other people enjoy the spotlight occasionally.Are interested in what other people have to say.Have emotional empathy.Can take a reasonable amount of criticism.Do not usually devalue other people.Do not expect special treatment.Punchline: Being \u201cNarcissistic\u201d is a defense against feeling ashamed and inadequate. It was developed during childhood and now is habitual. True self-confidence is robust because it is developed by overcoming obstacles. It continues developing in adulthood as the person faces new challenges.

            "answer_text": "\u201cNarcissistic\u201d could apply to traits almost anywhere on the continuum of behaviors associated with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Some narcissism is normal, as an evolutionary survival trait, and an excess is a mental disorder. What differentiates self-confidence and NPD is that an underlying element of NPD is a feeling of inferiority. https://www.quora.com/I-am-not-confident-enough-to-take-on-a-leadership-role-and-this-hinders-my-career-growth-What-can-I-do-to-overcome-this-fear-and-get-ready/answer/Dan-Robb-2 tl;dr: Self-esteem/self-confidence is based on competence (as opposed to ignorance and/or narcissistic bravado; with competence being based on proper preparation [i.e., education, training, and practice], with such preparation leading to productivity [i.e., accomplishment]); which, in conjunction with a positive attitude, will allow one to succeed even if faced with temporary failure. Such nurtured competence will in all probability lead to a life worth living. Confidence includes being able to question one\u2019s perspectives based on continued research and newly acquired information. This is known as the concept of defensive pessimism, which should be employed to anticipate problems, and facilitate the use self-doubt to motivate effective action. https://www.quora.com/Why-do-you-think-some-people-need-to-make-themselves-feel-better-by-making-you-seem-inferior/answer/Dan-Robb-2 tl;dr: Self-confidence not based on competence, or based on an exaggerated sense of self-worth (i.e., arrogance), can indicate some level of narcissism; which can incorporate insecurity. Narcissistic Personality Disorder is diagnosed in those having a majority of these traits: Self-importance (e.g., exaggerated achievements); preoccupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, etc.; belief they are special; requiring admiration; a sense of entitlement; exploitative of others; lacking in empathy; envy; and arrogance. And they are often paranoid, and invariably have an inferiority complex. References: Kulbarsh, P. (2008, April 21). The malignant narcissist.

            "answer_text": "Narcissists (someone with npd) view things in an inflexible black and white way. They have a disorder wherein they lack an integrated sense of self, instead viewing themselves and others as \u201call good\u201d or \u201call bad.\u201d Since a person viewing themselves as \u201call bad\u201d is not a viable alternative, narcissists project their faults onto others, which accounts for their behaviors such as Criticizing and blaming others (projection)Gaslighting (\u201cThat\u2019s your perception)Other behaviors to offload shame (deny, distort, etc.)Since they must view themselves in an unnatural and unrealistic \u201call good\u201d way, they are constrained to manipulate others to share their view of themselves. Theirs is a lifestyle which involves ubiquitous manipulation and abuse, as the techniques narcissists use to control others constitute abuse; they\u2019re psychologically very damaging. It is in this context that narcissists are self confident. They are striving to make a favorable impression, and manipulate the other person to enter into their view of themselves, which is their core value in life. Clearly a person can be self confident without being a narcissist. Nothing more needs to be said on this side of the question. To summarize, being self confident is a symptom a narcissist is likely to have, where the personality has been sketched to some extent above, showing such narcissism involves much more than merely being self confident.

            "answer_text": "What is the difference between being narcissistic and being self confident? On the surface the two may resemble each other but in reality there a BIG DIFFERENCE. To the point of being direct opposites. A self confident person: 1- Knows their self worth 2- Respects the healthy boundaries of others.. 3- Asks for what they want directly 4- Can be told \u201cno\u201d without sulking or taking it personally. 5- Lives by the rule: Do unto others what you would have them do unto you. 6- Is emotionally a mature adult. 7- Is unafraid of having imperfections. Knows they have strengths and weaknesses. A narcissist, on the other hand; 1- Derives their sense of self worth from the look of admiration they see in the eyes of others. 2- Does not understand the concept of other people\u2019s boundaries. Is motivated by their needs when it comes to others. 3- Manipulates to reach their goals. 4- doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. Will always try to turn a \u201cno\u201d into a \u201cyes\u201d 5- Uses extreme double standards (they can cheat, lie, deceive and are justified) while their partner is held to gold standards of sainthood. 6- Is emotionally a 5 year old in the body of a mature adult.. 7- Projects a fake image of perfection they try to protect at all cost.

            "answer_text": "There is self confidence in narcissism, but if it is of a pronounced, pathological sort, we ordinarily ascribe it to being a part of the False Self, which is a protective cover for a more comprehensive understanding of the individual. What is referred to as \u201chealthy narcissism,\u201d may relate to self confidence, because there an individuated Self from other to begin with. In pathological narcissism, the other is experienced as an extension of the person, not a separate other, as Big O Other. Self confidence can come from an individuated Self, or one that has little differentiation, and is counterfeit, in that is contingent upon having other selfobjects as mirrors to maintain the narcissistic person\u2019s fragile Self structure. We see this with people that need others to be, \u201c Yes People, \u201c who don\u2019t challenge them with \u201creal\u201d accurate feedback, but are always supporting the narcissistic person\u2019s Ideal Self, which is synonymous with the development of the False Self. These are usually is constituted by strivings for mirroring and acknowledging of grandiose and/or omnipotent needs, and fantasies of wealth, power, beauty, abilities, talents, etc. But what it lacks, is a tolerance for recognizing the ordinary, of having clay feet, being sometimes wrong, not being paid attention to, not having others think you are so special. That leads to a fracturing of the False Self, and the rotten, stinking guts are seen by the world, which results in intolerable shame and a real loss of self esteem and confidence which was illusory to begin with.

In order to maintain their inflated ego, they need constant narcissistic supply in the form of adulation, admiration, praise and external validation. Self-confident people don\u2019t need the approval of others. They know who they are and they get their sens of self-worth from within. ",

The fact that he is haughty does not equal to self-confidence. A narcisstic person does not love himself even if he seems to demonstrate that. ",

To engage in the process that builds confidence one has to be grounded in a positive self-image. Someone who isn't walking around with a good self-image of themselves and builds tools to help themselves interact with the world will build tools to ease their lack of self-worthiness. These are narcissistic tools to shield their fragile self-image. The difference is simply how each sees himself (or herself). ",

As time went on (now I am able to see this in 20/20 hindsight after being married for 23 years) he was gradually morphing into the full blown Narcissist that he is today. He turned from \u2018confident\u2019 to \u2018annoyingly arrogant\u2019 and he also got more and more immature as time went on. If I had to guess this is probably how it starts out for people with NPD and then at some point as they age, they turn into an \u2018over the top arrogant Narcissist\u2019 . ",

To be clear, people with NPD are not confident \u2014 quite the opposite. They are haunted by insecurities. Furthermore, NPD is predicated on having a very traumatic childhood coupled with a particular temperament that an individual is born with. In addition, someone with NPD has very specific, verifiable symptoms \u2014 including grandiosity (read: not self-confidence) \u2014 that can be diagnosed by a certified mental health professional. I\u2019ll repeat: there is no thin line between narcissism and self-confidence. However, there is a very wide chasm between the two. ",

They are empty souls, they are emotional vampires. A confident person is going to be confident with or without an audience, constant approval or adulation.
