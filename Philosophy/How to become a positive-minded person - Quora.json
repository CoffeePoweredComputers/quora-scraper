            "answer_text": "I would begin by noticing that a judgemental entity is present and may be telling you off for not \u2018being a positive minded person\u2019 and telling you that you should be able to stop it. This judge is very keen for you to keep it alive by engaging with it. By having you believe the thought \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a non-positive minded person\u2019 it keeps you on a roller-coaster where you oscillate from being a positive-minded person (as a behaviour to win approval from the judge) to being a non-positive-minded person (as an act of rebellion to the judge). The whole thing is a like a game in which the judge keeps itself hidden and under-the-radar. It has moved in and disguised itself as you. You may believe you are having a dialogue with yourself but in actual fact you are having a dialogue with the judge. The judge will first have you believe that you need to control your mind and \u2018be a positive minded person\u2019. When you agree with that then it can first praise you for taking a first step; then later it can tell you off for not doing it very well; then you can rebel against it; then it can tell you off again; then you forget about it; then it reminds you; then you try harder - and so it goes on. This can go on for a lifetime. The judge is quite happy being engaged this way as it is kept alive. The way out is to recognise the judge and disengage. There are many ways of disengaging and it helps to know how you engage with it first. For example, do you engage by debating with the judge? or surrendering to it and saying it\u2019s hopeless and becoming depressed? or do you attack it and go to war with the judge? When you come to realise it is not in your interest to engage (this may require some self-inquiry) you may be honestly able to say: \u201cIt\u2019s OK - I am willing to be a non-positive minded person - if that is what is happening - I even look forward to being a non-positive minded person.\u201d Why would you say this? Not as some kind of trick (which wouldn\u2019t work anyway) but rather because it is true for you - you have recognised it is in your interest to be willing to do what your judge says you should not be willing to do. It is in your interest because you have finally disengaged and stepped off the roller-coaster. You have begun to realise who you are \u2013 you are not the judge you have been talking to all your life and thinking was you. ",

            "answer_text": "Think of what makes you negative (if it\u2019s the case)! We make choices, of what to focus on, and what to ignore! The problem with the \u201cNegative zone\u201d , that it drags you\u2026 it keeps you inside\u2026 it creates a comfort zone! Fear has a big role to play in negativity\u2026 Start with being fully aware that you have a choice\u2026 either to think of things that are totally out of control / things that makes you feel down / things that sucks your inner energy\u2026. or to think of what gives you power / the bright side of your life! There is always two sides \u2026 dark vs light! it\u2019s your choice to pick one \u201cFilter\u201d and see the world through it\u2026 First you have to re-evaluate all the existing thoughts \u2026 your current reservoir of info\u2026 your mind\u2019s interpretation of what you\u2019ve experienced \u2026 once you manage to clear your head from 80% of the virtual obstacles that your mind has created.. then you can start to think positive\u2026 but your choice will remain ! so you have to be careful of what enters your mind \u2026 inspect the givens that might have bad influence on your decisions / vision / goals ! It\u2019s a long journey, but everything starts with a single small step.. First step needs a positive thought\u2026 that \u201cYou Can\u201d! ",
