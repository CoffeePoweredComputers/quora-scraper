            "answer_text": "Infidelity is not good, but sometimes it can be a better choice than ending a primary relationship or going without a satisfactory sex life. We live in an imperfect world. We can only do what is possible, using what is available, while we can do so. Most persons want need some kind of a sex life than is more than just masturbating. A few persons do not need or really want any sex life at all. Sometimes they are not capable of performing sexually for various reasons. They may not have always been so, but are so, today; either unable or not wanting to be or do otherwise. They often have a life partner who both wants and needs a healthy sex life. The \u2018wanting and needing\u2019 partner has 3 choices. (1) leave the relationship. (2) Not have a satisfactory sex life. (3) Find sexual satisfaction by cheating. In many cases option #1 is not viable for one or many reasons. Exercising it would often harm innocent persons like minor children and other family members as well as the partner abandoned. Option #2 is the correct one in the minds of many persons (often hypocrites) who often preach to others as to how they should behave and live. However, being miserable \u201ccrying with the Saints\u201d is not acceptable to many persons who would prefer option #3 which has worked for many persons going back over 4000 years. ",
