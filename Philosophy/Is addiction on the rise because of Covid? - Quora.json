            "answer_text": "It\u2019s complicated. The thing is, if there is any rise in addictions \u2014 and we\u2019re not just talking about drug addictions a.k.a. substance abuse, but all sorts of addictions (and there\u2019s simply not a big enough study that tackles all forms of addiction in one go) \u2014 it\u2019ll most likely be because of the indirect effects of COVID on society, rather than the illness itself. And I\u2019d see trauma and overall poor mental health (from the fear of COVID from the quarantining and social distancing, from the general disruption of society), as the most likely reasons people would resort to things that could alleviate such stresses.

            "answer_text": "Certainly, well I can only speak for myself and after 4 month\u2019s of lockdown with no car to get anywhere I almost relapsed! I been clean for 13 months from meth and I live in the Desert with nothing to do. I guess when boredom is the driving force to use and your options get smaller relapse is inevitable. But luckily for me I couldn\u2019t score in the two months I tried which is odd; I\u2019m almost sure I have an angle looking over me that always makes it hard to use. ",
