            "answer_text": "Probably not. Humanity has been around for at least ten thousand years, and we\u2019ve had various societies create various religions asserting different gods: many polytheistic, a smaller handful monotheistic. The interesting thing is that none of them agree entirely on who or what \u2018god\u2019 is: Jupiter and Zeus are similar, but not entirely the same. There are similarities between Jesus and Horus, but again, not the same. All gods have differing qualities. Now, bearing that in mind, and noting that we simply can\u2019t agree on what \u2018god\u2019 is, you have to ask: if a god does exist, wouldn\u2019t it want to clarify? If you had a bunch of kids standing outside your house, and each one had a different story that they thought accurately reflected you (one says you\u2019re a nice guy, one says you like to eat children, another says you shoot them with paintballs if they say \u201cHello\u201d as they walk by), wouldn\u2019t you want to stop by and clear up any confusion? Or maybe fire off a few paintballs, just so they\u2019d stop loitering? The religions of the world assert that this has happened, but any god capable of any of the things they suggest would not be so powerless as to leave everyone in doubt. The gods are more than capable of making us irrevocably sure of their existence, and leaving no question as to what their nature is - and yet, they do not. We\u2019re all left to question, argue, debate, discuss and sometimes even violently disagree over the basic fundamentals. God(s) could do something about this, but evidently refrain from it. Or they don\u2019t exist, and can\u2019t do anything about it. Either way, no, I don\u2019t imagine it\u2019s something we can learn while we\u2019re alive. I sincerely doubt we\u2019ll learn as much through death, either: not like you need to Pass Go and Collect 200 before you get the answer. The god(s) could clarify if they wished to: evidently, they don\u2019t. And if a god can\u2019t be bothered to remove all doubt, why would we want to waste any more time thinking, following, worshiping or acting like they\u2019re a big deal? They\u2019re an invariable irrelevancy: and, if nothing else, they\u2019ve made themselves that way, by virtue of being incommunicado. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course we can know that God exists. It is not kept away from us except by our own free will and consciousness. Many people have had the inner experience of God for centuries. All humans are extensions of God and some have had the inner experience of God as all humans are created to have. Those who have yet to have it call it a belief and that\u2019s understandable because it can\u2019t be explained with words. Of course those who insist that there is no God are not likely to have a consciousness to have the inner experience. They think that the material realm is the only reality and thus their consciousness will be restricted to the limited, material realm awareness until they understand that reality is beyond the material realm and is therefore, a limited part of reality. Everything is a vibration of energy but the material realm is the lowest where time and space exists, and linear thinking is involved. We are all spiritual beings with a material body, having experience in the material realm. We have free will to identify ourselves as only limited, material beings and our consciousness will reflect how we identify ourselves. It can be no other way because of the Law of Free Will. God knows itself to be God and it is for us to discover that we are an extension of God, and therefore are gods (small \u201cg\u201d). The unseen life the human experiences within and of itself is God. Without this unseen life within and of the human, there is no heartbeat, no breath, no thoughts, no emotions, and no imagination. The human sees only the expressions of life in other humans, animals, and plants. The human can practice turning within and know what it is ready to know about God and itself as a god (small \u201cg\u201d). No words can explain it. Here is what an ascended master says about the truth of God: If you will think about this, you might realize a profound truth. The truth of God is above and beyond the relativity of the material realm consciousness. Therefore, it is simply not possible to come up with a relative or outer argument, an argument that the human ego can fathom and accept, for the truth of God. This explains why so many people have failed to fathom the truth of God. This is especially true of many modern scientists who have allowed themselves to believe that unless you can come up with a factual, rational, logical or intellectual line of reasoning then an idea simply cannot be valid. To know the truth of God, you must realize that this truth cannot be explained in the relative terms that the material realm consciousness can understand. The truth of God can be known only by reaching beyond the relativity of the material realm consciousness. When you do reach beyond that relativity and grasp an idea that comes directly from God then you will often be unable to provide an outer line of reasoning to support your idea. You simply know what you know, and that knowledge is beyond the relativity of the ego and outer mind. Going Within ",

One of the most astonishing of such persons was Simone Weil, a brilliant, courageous, rare human being. I don\u2019t believe she was published during her short life but left letters and notebooks which, by the sheer force or her brilliance and originality, made her famous soon after her death in England in 1943. I just mention her as someone whose asseverations you may consult; there have of course been many others and in many religions and ages. But you, lacking such an experience yourself, or I, myself, cannot know God exists because it is the nature of mind that one cannot enter another and share a remembered experience. Thus we must rely on a report which we may or may not credit but which cannot be substantiated or disproved. ",

Including Christians, Muslims, Jewishs,\u2026 All of them were created by humans mainly to take your money and control you. All of them are egotistical dangerous psychopaths. So will we ever know the truth? Yes, it will happen. As education gets better, as people learn and grow up, they will finally free themselves from these dark ages myths. It will definitely happen but it's a long painful process. Today, less than 20% (worldwide - it's a guess) of the people succeeded freeing themselves from this tyranny. This percentage will grow over time until only very few nut-cases will be left. Think about it: if you say Julius Cesar or Elvis Presley spoke to you, you will be considered delusional. But if you say god spoke to you, it is acceptable!!!\u2019 What is the difference? ",

Some claimed gods cannot be known - usually by definition. So the bottom line is: it depends on the god. ",
