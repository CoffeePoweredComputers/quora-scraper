            "answer_text": "Ethics, like anything else, is relative. That\u2019s the biggest limitation. Our moral and social values that go on to constitute our own ethical structure, are actually shaped by a number of circumstances. For instance, in the midst of a communal riot, you lie to a blood-thirsty mob about your religious affiliations, you\u2019re doing the right thing, because you\u2019re preserving God\u2019s order of things in trying to save your own life, or that of others. But you lie just for the sake of it, you\u2019re a compulsive liar, and try to benefit yourself through people\u2019s misconceptions. That\u2019s deception, and utterly unethical! Now, for instance, you kill people on a battlefield, you\u2019re awarded for your valour and you\u2019re a decorated hero! But you murder someone otherwise, and you\u2019re a criminal! That\u2019s what is the limitation of our ethics. That they are guided by other factors, and you always have hundreds of theories to support your choice. ",

            "answer_text": "Limitations of ethics in any field can be answered as :- (No offenses) You have to be honest and you cannot exhibit any sort of cunning behaviours at your working area.You have to be loyal towards your job and your colleagues as well as towards your clients.If you are working at a area or at is at a influential post and you follow your professional ethics than Thier are very rare chances that you are rich.You will be blamed sometimes for going so much according to laws governed by your institute by your colleagues .You will be considered as a guy whose growth will be affected because of your stupid ideas of following ethics.A lot more can be said but I guess this is enough to depict the drawbacks of being ethical in your job or at any area of life.(No Offenses) ",
