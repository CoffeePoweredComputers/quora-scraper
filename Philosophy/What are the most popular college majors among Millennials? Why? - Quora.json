            "answer_text": "Depends on the university.. In addition to CS, biology, psychology, policy studies, and economics are popular majors at many places. Students at elite colleges do not generally pick majors based on earning power, and many of them will end up getting advanced degrees anyway. At less competitive universities and colleges projected future income may play a larger role, and business degrees are more popular. At universities with competitive admissions there may also be biases in the admissions process. Given that probably a larger percentage of potential STEM majors switch their majors while in college to something less demanding and, arguably for many students, more interesting the admissions people may over-admit students in those areas to keep enrollments in those areas healthy. I\u2019ve not seen data on popularity of majors, but I\u2019m sure that many universities list relevant data. I might add that popularity tends to wax and wane. Biology was once popular because of medical school (although you do not need a biology major to attend), decreased for a while and then went back up because of excitement in genetics and other biological areas. Similarly psychology has gone up in recent years in part because of excitement in brain research. Popularity of majors also varies from place to place in part due to reputation of teaching and undergraduate research opportunities. Popularity of majors is an interesting statistics but ought to have no impact on individual choice of a major. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat are the most popular college majors among Millennials? Why?\u201d Everyone says Computer Science and various forms of Engineering. And that is probably true, if you ask entering freshmen what they plan to major in. The degrees they actually end up with are rather different. The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major At the bottom, there is a table of Bachelors degrees granted in recent years (and what they pay). You can sort by number of degrees. Here is a screenshot of the top of their table - the most numerous degrees actually granted. Note that Computer Science is in the third screenshot. Comp Sci plus all forms of Engineering barely outnumber Psychology alone. Most degrees are in fields that are not classically considered high-paying. Why? I suspect that many students enroll with high expectations, but can\u2019t actually pass Comp Sci / Engineering courses, so they cast around for something they can succeed at. Or they decide to cut their losses and drop out (40%). But most of them soldier on until they get an \u201cAnything\u201d degree. Which explains the high number of young people with jobs which do not require their degrees.  And the next most numerous:  And the next:  ",
