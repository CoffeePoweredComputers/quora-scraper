            "answer_text": "Friend If,your reference point is absolute,than only,good is good and bad is bad. Till,your reference point is relative,your good is not good for ever,neither your bad is bad for ever or in other words,your good & bad are relative. Let's share: Any good on extreme becomes bad and vice versa.it is middle,where,good remains optimum good and bad remains optimum bad OR good remains good and bad remains bad,as middle is vertically high in comparison to both extremes.it means,as you move towards any of extreme,you move towards more relativity and you remain on same horizontal plane.When your good/bad is on one extreme,simply it is preparing for opposite pole,getting accumulated momentum to shift to opposite extreme.This results into cyclical repeatation,which creates http://relativity.As your reference point is more and more relative or in other words,as your reference point goes on changing,your good and bad go on changing,to conclude that,both good and bad are not two separate things/aspects,but are two facets of one coin.If you opt good,bad is bound to be their and vice versa. If it is so,than,what does it mean by absolute reference point or middle which lies vertically high than both extremes or where there is no relativity or what is beyond relative world ? Our relative world-all life events-our own all stuff of existence lie on extremes,where,eventually,we ourselves are as well as we live under relativity of space and time,which,in turn,don't allow our good good and bad bad for ever,for all irrespective of this fabric/matrix of spaciotime. what is that stuff of our own existence,which is supposed to be beyond this fabric or which is absolute/UN changing,making middle between two extremes,placed vertically high than both extremes/both constantly repeating extremes making cyclical circulating circle placed on horizontal plane. This stuff is your own consciousness,consciousness in you as an individual/microsome as well as omnipresent consciousness,consciousness creating macrosome i.e.all possible cosmos/universes of past-present & future. If,this is absolute reference point,than,thing which increase your consciousness is good and thing which reduces your consciousness is bad.Middle is this absolute point,vertically high than relative points-time & space-on horizontal plane. Good is good and bad is bad,if your referral is consciousness and good/bad are not always good/bad-their proportion goes on changing to sum 100-,if your referral is time & space-first yield born out of consciousness. thanks Q guru ",

This process of labelling is largely an analyzation of the sequence of actions that are triggered by the Decision and their impact on the physical world. Good is good because the people impacted by the Decision and thereby, the action are benefitted either tangibly or intangibly, no matter the degree of it's significance. Bad is bad because the sequence of Actions harm one or more person(s) and/or thing(s). Good luck understanding what I just said. Caio ",

A feel of goodness or satisfaction comes when you do a good deed. This is good and that is final. Similarly, when you do a negative activity, something in you tells you that it is wrong. Then that is wrong. When you feel good or bad is again depends on your upbringing, your ethical standards of Good, Bad and Ugly. A thought for you, what is good today may be bad tomorrow or vice versa. It depends on your consciousness. Take care. ",

There is no absolute good and no absolute bad, just as there is no absolute right and no absolute wrong. Right and wrong is only meaningful in connection with the goals you have in mind. For example, according to the morals of the bible, Abrahams agreement to sacrifice his son was \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cright\u201d, because the only moral goal the bible has in mind ist the satisfaction of a despotic, selfish and cruel invisible \u201cfriend\u201d.
