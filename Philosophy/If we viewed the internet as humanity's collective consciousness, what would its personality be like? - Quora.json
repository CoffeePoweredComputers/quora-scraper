            "answer_text": "The way I see it there are at least three ways you could take this: 1.) We take the internet as a whole, without \u201caveraging\u201d it. In this case the personality would be extremely bipolar and prone to violent swings in emotion. One second it's \u201ccute cats,\u201d \u201cfancy drawings\u201d, the next second it\u2019s \u201cfuck Hillary/Trump,\u201d \u201cPC master race,\u201d etc. 2.)We average out the collective whole of the internet to get a \u201cbaseline personality.\u201d In this case, from what tiny portion of the internet I see, the personality is likely to even out to be a pretty neutral one, with some added complaining, entitlement, and general pessimism sprinkled in. I would also argue that this would be an extremely smart and generally kind \u201cperson,\u201d just not a very positive one. 3.) We ignore the \u201cinternet\u201d part and just ask what the personality of a collective human consciousness would be like. (We skip over the negativity that the Internet so often pulls out from us) In this case I think we would see a personality that generally tries to be helpful and kind, makes mistakes, but tries to learn from them, and does it's best to learn new things. Most people are \u201cgenerally\u201d good and try to be kind in reality, so I think that this would transfer into the personality. I also think it would be a very understanding \u201cperson\u201d from all the experiences it would have access to. ",
