            "answer_text": "Let't say it this way. I don't have an issue with tellers of \"white lies\". But lies have a habit of eventually being exposed in the most unexpected of ways. Material lies will probably be found out because...they're material and someone cares. White lies, OTOH, while well-intentioned, will expose you as someone who thought something other than what he said he did if found out. That could end up hurting someone more than just laying it on the line would have. So I try to watch it even with the little lies told for someone else's comfort or benefit. I'd almost always try to take the time to figure out a friendly way to tell someone something they would rather not hear than to lie to them. I'll tell you an example....lol...you knew it was coming. I was fat as a kid. I can let myself go now and then but not like back then. As a result, I have what former sweety Roger referred to as \"some skin\". It didn't stop Roger. And, over the years, what I thought would be an absolute gay deal breaker has been a non-issue. Commentary I saw on reddit about the matter shows that, by and large, this does not bother anyone. And that has been my astonishing experience. But it still drives me crazy regardless. Enter Ben, my former FWB from a couple years back. We're still friends. I will do a lot for Ben if he asks, and he has proven he will for me. We greatly reduced the B but not the F, a very hard thing to accomplish. Now, Ben had been fat too much earlier in life. He said he had a pic on line and I could search it, but it was fatter then he is now. IMHO he's a great looking very small guy. If I could convince him to leave FWB world I would snag him in a heartbeat. But it aint to be. He's got \"some skin\" too. But, as much as I abhor it on myself, I totally don't see it on him...until he gets in front of the mirror and pulls it up to see what he looks like without it. That's how I figured he's sensitive about it. To show you what my deal is with him, as reluctant as I am to, I accept his want to stay FWB. He thinks, I' sure, that I'm pressuring him every second. But. He got tired of his old pics on the apps. I told him I'd take some new ones. The ones you don't put up front. He looked skeptical. I used to do a little photography and I also ran up against a situation at a bar once that told me what to do. I'll get to that later. I told Ben let me take a pic and you decide if you want to do more. I opened the window for full sunlight. I told him to turn some..I sort of partly hid the very slightly flabby part. I bluetoothed him the pic. He looked at me like I was magic. Let's do some more. I got about 10. In every damn one of them only what I see when I look at him is what was there. Cute small body but with just the right musculature (for my taste at least) and....no extra skin. Now, it would not have been a lie to tell Ben that mostly nobody would give a shit about the skin. But I didn't get that at the time. I could have said that to him. It would have been a white lie. but instead I did the pic thing, having a pretty good idea how it would all come out. I got the same message to him, and did it with a camera. And we all know they don't lie. Needless to say, the next hookup we did (every week for days), he got pinged to death from grindr and scruff. Which made me jealous as hell, but hey. That was a well over two years ago. After I threw the Josh unit into the shit heap he belongs in, Ben and I got together a couple times. He said, just before I went on the trip to Vegas that I'm on, we should take pics when I get back. LOL. The hobag. The bar incident that made me tell Ben to do pics was this. I frequented a placed called Boom when I lived in Fort Lauderdale. They had a relatively new bartender, foget his name, but he was cute as hell. But a little pudgy He wore it very very well but he apparently was unhappy with it. At one point, the bar owner decided to do a promotion video for the bar. All bartenders had to be in it. This guy was beside himself. He did NOT want to do a video. A week later I went to his bar. He was all excited, and it was about the video that had been made. He told me that when the cameraman got started he assured him that he would love the results. That's because the cameraman knew what I knew and was reminded of by this incident. The camera, while everyone's standard for not lying, can fudge a little bit. In truth, the guy had nothing to worry about, even if a monkey ran the camera. I tried to tell him but he wouldn't listen. I would not have either. And I know this stuff. But anyway, deception is a very tricky thing. It can blow up or make you smile in ways you can't predict. While that can be good, it's not usually. Like any event (say, a murder), lying leaves physical tracks. They can't be undone. They lay there waiting to see if anyone cares to look at them. Sometimes nobody does. Sometimes someone does but can't find them. Other ties they do care and they do show up. But what they do not do is go away. you lie at your own risk. ",

            "answer_text": " Yes. Eventually, with enough time and persistance, the truth will come out. Having people who believe the truth is another thing entirely. Some of us have gotten so used to hearing lies that we believe, for some odd reason, we tend to keep believing the lies until we forget that the person who has told them is, in fact, a known liar. Here is an example of a time that the truth finally came out and it was shocking to those who believed in the lies all of their lives. My spouse\u2019s mother lied continuously for various reasons, but mostly to get her way and to make herself appear to be blamesless in whatever situation came up. She got so good at lying that most people never knew the difference. Even I didn\u2019t know the difference until I had children and began to notice different things she\u2019d to do get what she wanted, especially where the children were concerned. My son came down with type I diabetes when he was 10. He was on a strict regimen of limiting the amount of carbs he ingested each day by using a set formula for figuring out how much of each kind of food we were having each meal that he could have. We then had to weigh each kind of food on a gram scale to make sure that he was covered for the amount insulin he was taking before that meal. This compared exactly to the grams of protein, fat and carbs he was allowed to have for each meal or snack. It wasn\u2019t just eating food, it was a science. He did fine with that most of the time, except when he would go over to his grandmother\u2019s house alone. He\u2019d come home before supper and his blood glucose levels would be sky high. So I\u2019d call grandma and ask her what he\u2019d had to eat at her house that afternoon. Every single time I asked, knowing she\u2019d been letting him have candy, cake, cookies, ice cream - whatever he wanted that she had on hand - she\u2019d lie to me. I knew it, she knew I knew it, and so did my son. But it continued for all of his childhood until he finally figured out for himself what the result of eating all that sugar was doing to him and to his body. But grandma, as per her usual, would tell me something like - he had only a little bit of coffee with her and had some milk in it and that had to be what made his blood sugar so high. No, grandma, I know what you did - and she\u2019d lie some more - which made my blood boil. Here was her first grandchild, the one she supposedly loved best of all out of the 4 of them, and she was feeding him so much of the one thing that could and would likely kill him if it continued, as it did at her house. She tried to cover it up as if it wasn\u2019t going on, as if it wasn\u2019t going to hurt him. You have no idea how many times I wanted to go to her house and slap the hell out of her. But I kept my composure as much as possible. I did begin to limit the number and the length of his visits with grandma - right down the street. When my daughter came along, she continued her charade as usual. I knew she was always up to something, but I said nothing until the day finally arrived that I\u2019d had enough. She had asked if my daughter could spend the night at her house with her two male cousins, sleeping in the same bedroom with them. That was a big NO in my mind so I told her my daughter would not be spending the night. I also told her not to mention it to my daughter because I knew if she did, my daughter would have a hissy fit and beg and plead until I said yes. They all went off on a shopping trip and ate dinner out. It was summer and still light outside when the returned. When I saw them coming into the driveway, I walked outside. I KNEW there would be a problem and that my daughter was going to beg me to spend the night anyway. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. But I was ready for it and asked my daughter very pointedly, \u201cWho asked you to spend the night?\u201d Her reply - \u201cGrandma did.\u201d The child did not have enough time to make up her own lie, I had asked her in such a way that it would not have occurred to her - and I knew I had to do that or she\u2019d be spinning her own tales to protect her grandmother. Right away, grandma steps out of the car where she\u2019d been waiting and before she could start her lies up again, I asked her WHY she had invited my daughter to spend the night when I\u2019d already told her the answer was no. She stuttered and stammered and finally told me that she had not invited her, that the boys - her cousins - had invited her. I knew that was a lie and told her so, and then all hell broke loose right there in my driveway before God and everyone. And I did not care. I was sick to death of this woman using and abusing me and everyone else so that she could get her way as she had done all of her life. She didn\u2019t speak to me for a very long time thereafter. I did not care. Five years later, when she was preparing to have surgery for stomach cancer, she called me late one night when I was already in bed to tell me that she was sorry IF she had hurt me. And me, not being at all like her, told her not to worry about it. What I really wanted to tell here was that there was no IF about it at all, that she had hurt me and had been hurting me with her lies and attempts to control and manipulate as long as I had known her. But I let it go, knowing that sooner or later she\u2019d be back at it. And she was. Fast forward about 20 years. Grandma is finally diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease after several years of us all wondering what was wrong with her. As it began to take it\u2019s toll on her and the rest of us, she went through various stages. One of those stages involved telling my son and his wife that I was being mean to her. I wasn\u2019t. My son and daughter-in-law were now in charge of taking care of her since she had always told us that she was leaving everything she owned to the person who took care of her when she was old and sick - and she chose him and his wife. That was fine with me since I knew I had zero patience left for that woman. none whatsoever. I\u2019d go to visit my son and his family at her house, since they all lived there together by this time so that they could take care of her. She\u2019d tell my son things I supposedly said or did to her while I was there, which were not even close to being true. I said as little as possible to her by that time because it only caused more problems if and when I did. She still had enough presence of mind to attempt to make my son and his family believe that I was being mean and hateful to her whenever I went there to visit them. They let me know in no uncertain terms that I was not to be \u201cmean to grandma\u201d as she told them I was. So I pretty much stayed away and only saw my son and his family when they came over to my house. Sometimes they even brought her, which was no fun at all. Even my dogs disliked her, and I always trust my dogs\u2019 judgements before I trust people\u2019s opinions about someone else. Dogs just know. A few years after her mean stage, she began getting all of her lies confused and could no longer keep them all straight. And by that I mean, that she actually started reverting to the truth of whatever it was she was talking about. It truly did my heart good to know that finally, at long last, the truth about her and THE TRUTH about whatever had happened was finally out. Her two sons were just now becoming aware of the fact that their mother was and had been a liar for years. Her oldest son declared one day on they phone with his brother, \u201cI cannot believe my mother would lie to me like that!\u201d And so it continued - more truths came out to replace so many lies that her sons could barely take it. Every single time they found out that XYZ never happened and Mr. So and So never said this or that to or about her, and that she never did do whatever she told them she\u2019d done - or not done - they continued to be astonished. To them, their mother was an angel - a fine Christian woman who never missed a time when the church doors were open to go inside and do what she was supposed to do. A fine woman who always did for others, and kept a notebook with all of it written down with dollar amounts included - her estimate of how much it might have cost her to do whatever it was she had done, and what the other person had done for her or given to her, with their dollar amounts estimated and included as well. I KID YOU NOT. I saw it. I read it. I was aghast myself. OH yes, that was how she operated, that woman who was such a \u201cgood, honest, Christian person\u201d, the woman who thought nothing of lying about what she had given my type I diabetic son to eat when he went to her house instead of being proud of having made sure he would not eat what he shouldn\u2019t. The woman who pretended to be my new best friend when I married her youngest son until I discovered there was a very rusty knife being twisted in my back. Here she was in all of her glory, having her many lies uncovered at long last - by Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. Unfortunate for her, a big relief for me - at long last. Not that I ever wanted her to have that horrid disease, but for the sake of her lies finally being exposed, it was truly a huge relief that my own family, and her son, my spouse, finally understood all of the hell she had put me through while trying her best to make me look like a sludge while she continued to appear to be an angel. Yes. She did. But thankfully, the truth set me free and all of the lies, or most of them, came out and I was redeemed at long last. And finally, I got my son back from the woman who had tried on numerous occasions to talk me into letting him go to live with her after her first husband died so she would not be alone. Thank God I had more than enough sense to deny her that thievery. One day, toward the end of her illness, she had a stroke at home in the kitchen while standing by the sink. She didn\u2019t cry out in pain, she merely slipped down onto the floor, her \u201clights went out\u201d, and my son could not get her to wake up. So they called us and they called the EMS people to come. By the time the ambulance got there, she had awakened somewhat, but could not speak anymore and could not move one side of her body. They asked her questions, but her blank stare told them volumes that her immovable lips could no longer say. When they got her to the ER, the staff was told that she had late stage Alzheimer\u2019s and that she was 86 years old. After consultations with the medical staff and her family, it was decided that attempts to save her from the stroke would not be successful and that it would only delay the inevitable. They kept her in the ER ICU for a while, and when she began writhing in pain from the stroke in her head and the bleeding it caused, they began giving her morphine. At first my son, her oldest and most favored grandchild, did not want them to let her go that way. But once he realized that saving her from the stroke would only make things worse since she\u2019d no longer be able to walk or talk, he understood and allowed the medical staff to continue the morphine. I knew the morphine would be the first thing to kill her, not the stroke itself, and not the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. I think my son forgets this part since he now doesn\u2019t believe that she was being given any morphine in the ER, or later at home with the Hospice nurse. But she was, and it did what it was supposed to do - stop her head pain. It did kill her in due course as the stroke or the Alzheimer\u2019s disease would have done, only later. They had her brought back home by ambulance when they realized there was no getting well for her this time so she could die peacefully at home. And so she did in just a day or so after she was brought home. The morphine and the stroke too their toll on her and then she was gone. I can\u2019t say that I was glad to see her gone, and I can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t. But I was finally, at long last, relieved of the burden of fighting for my son\u2019s love and respect against a woman who was supposed to love him the most, and love the rest of us as well. What she had really done was drive a wedge between all of us; with her lies, with her attempts to control us, with her manipulation tactics, with her impromptu tears, with her \u2018poor me\u2019 tricks and her \u2018why do you treat me that way after all I\u2019ve done for you\u2019 bullshit. It was, for lack of a better word, exhausting. All of it was - for 44 years - it was incredibly exhausting, exasperating, enraging and unnecessary. I had loved her before I married her son and could not wait to be able to call her Mom, just like he did. I should have known better. When I did finally get to ask her what she wanted me to call her, her answer was this: \u201cWell, I think no person who is not my child should ever call me Mother or Mom or Mama since I am certainly not your mother. So you can just call me by my first name or you can call me Mrs. Kxxxx.\u201d And it was just like that - I should have known. But I gave her a chance and bet on her being the mother I never had but always wanted. Well, she just wasn\u2019t that person at all. I am glad I finally found out the truth about all of it before she left us here scratching our heads and wondering what the hell it was all about. Now we know. Does it still matter? You\u2019re damned right it does, to me anyway. It probably matters not at all to her two sons, but oh yes, it sure does matter to me. I lived long enough to see the truth finally come out without having to be the one to continue to try to convince the rest of them that she was, indeed, a liar of the worst kind. She told the truth herself in all of her forgetfulness. I thank God for that, at least. He always knew the truth. And He always will. Don\u2019t ever forget that fact. ",
