            "answer_text": "Wisdom makes happiness in our older years because we learn to understand how to manage our problems with ease, and we learn how quickly things come and go, when you are young it seems like the problems in life last forever but when you get older you learn that it was the stress of the problem that lasted so long, because even though the problem was over with we can't seem to let go of it, so we constantly think of what could have been done differently and how we should have addressed it, so it stresses our minds longer and longer, but then when you get older you start to understand that it doesn't matter how the problem was ended, it's the fact that it was ended that keeps us happy, so it's not a few days of anguish, it's just a problem solved and over so we can be happy now, and we move forward in life to having fun, and the other things is the should have, could have, would have but didn't saying when you are young, I should have done it this way instead, or I could have done it this way, or would have done it this way, does it really matter? It's done and moving forward is the way to go because that makes you happy, it's something we can't seem to understand when we are young and we keep replaying the scenario in our heads over and over again, that is a cause of stress which makes us tired and sometimes angry, but when we get older we learn to let go and say it doesn't matter how it all happened, it matters that it's done and we can move on, that in itself creates happiness and peace, then everything is going good with us so we can now enjoy life, it just life's lessons that shape us into a happy person, so learn to let go of stressful things and don't allow them to dwell in your mind just say it's done now so I can be happy, and that is the key to a happy life and you will understand in time that it's easy to let it go, so I hope this helps you.

They\u2019ve seen some partially succeed (yes, like the Civil Rights Movement), some struggling, like the environment and its endangered inhabitants, to just stay alive while consciences and consciousness fight tooth and nail to maintain the status quo. \u2026 They\u2019ve seen fashions change in various dispositions towards politics and social issues the way fashion dictates women chuck those clunky, clownish platform shoes and replace them with pointy-toed slingbacks, then \u201ctennies\u201d, then 6-inch stilettos, right back to platforms once again, only this time for the men. Listen, my dear, you can only be dangled on a string and played for a fool for so long before wisdom sets in\u2014IF \u201cthey\u201d don\u2019t kill you and you live long enough. Wisdom knows that things like Nature and the Universe are what to watch for signs of \u201cwhat\u2019s next\u201d in terms of reality\u2014not merchandising, Disney, commercials/ads, popular tastes, the next big thing in music, iphones, career paths, and the next new rubber-cheese filling for pizza crust. Having little realistic choice but to live in this man-made world, it\u2019s the best part of wisdom that does as little as possible to help advance these self-serving interests, nonetheless. Of course, developing the vision to see where all this seems to be inexorably heading doesn\u2019t make people necessarily wiser and certainly not \u201chappier\u201d, but it\u2019s the only known thing that will give someone\u2014 maybe you, maybe me, maybe your dorky brother-in-law or his pencil-neck kids, at least a chance at a chance to figure out what we really want it All to Be About. If Wisdom is what you truly thirst for more than anything in life\u2014don\u2019t invest in folly. ",
