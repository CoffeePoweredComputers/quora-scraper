            "answer_text": "David Hume is famous for his philosophy of Skepticism. Briefly put, it goes like this: According to the ancient Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, human behavior has three motives: Appetites, Passions and Reason, where the Appetites are the lowest form, the Passions are a higher form, and Reason is the highest form of motivation. The ancient Greeks were entirely mistaken in their ranking.Actually, the Appetites are the basis of all motivation, because they are life itself. The Passions involve the violence and power needed to fight to ensure that the Appetites get what they need. Reason, actually, is only a servant to the Passions. If Reason can think of a better route to take to get the Appetites what they need, then Reason has done its job. Otherwise, it should just be quiet and pay attention.In fact, Reason is pitifully poor at everything else it tries. For example, Reason attempts to define Morals. Actually, people everywhere define morality by local traditions. Pity the person who challenges tradition.For example, Reason attempts to define Truth with Logic. Actually, Truth is beyond Reason, and no amount of Logic will ever attain Truth.Truth can only be known by the five senses, but even the five senses cannot always be right, since the Universe is so enormous, and our five senses only perceive a subset of energy wavelength.Reason can only know what the five senses discover, and since the five senses cannot discover all the facts, then Reason will never be able to figure out the rest.The main categories of Logic are mistaken. For example, we presume that we know Cause and Effect, when we really only know what we have seen; but our senses are limited, and our lives are short. A given Cause might result in a completely unexpected Effect in the future.That is why all our ideas about the Universe are mistaken. Our ideas about Creation are mistaken. Our ideas of Religion are all mistaken, or at the very least, seriously subject to doubts.People can never know the Truth. The best use of Reason is to obey the Passions, and assist in satisfying the Appetites.Those, very briefly, are the main ideas of David Hume. (One might notice that Nietzsche borrowed many of Hume\u2019s ideas, 130 years later.) ",

            "answer_text": "David Hume is often described as the most important or best philosopher who worked in English. I\u2019m not sure what the relevance of \u201cEnglish\u201d is here; I am of the opinion that we should acknowledge truths where we are fortunate enough to find them. Quite a bit has been written about the empiricist epistemological tradition, more often found in English-language writers such as Bacon, Hobbs, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. This is often contrasted with the supposedly more rationalist continental tradition represented by Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza, and others. So, pointing out Hume\u2019s native language may simply be a kind of shorthand for his empiricist epistemology. It may also be a way of accounting for Hume\u2019s great influence on the enquiries of epistemology, psychology, and cognitive science, as it has been estimated that 80 % of all of the text on all of the computers in the world is English. I feel that these somewhat haphazard claims are confuted by the situation that epistemology\u2019s, and in fact philosophy\u2019s, most influential writer, Plato, wrote in a language that is no longer native to anyone on Earth. With all of this as preamble, I will claim that Hume\u2019s main ideas, and by \u201cmain\u201d I mean most provocative of further productive inquiry, are these two: 1) That no known type of reason or line of reasoning can take us from from knowledge gained by our immediate experience to knowledge of something not immediately or not yet experienced; 2) deductive reasoning cannot provide knowledge of the existence of any real being (physical object) or of any quality or state of such a being that is not merely hypothetical. The first of these two claims seems to preclude any rational basis for our belief in the cause-and-effect relation, which in turn seems to put all of our knowledge of the empirical world in jeopardy. The second claim seems to render our precious reason impotent as an aid in navigating the empirical world. Both of these seemingly skeptical conclusions are parts of what we now refer to as the problem of induction, which has inspired philosophical works of great fame and importance by Kant, Russell, and Popper, and now challenges theoreticians and researchers in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
