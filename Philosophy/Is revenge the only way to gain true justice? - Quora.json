            "answer_text": "True justice doesn't exist. Justice is always subjective, meaning it's always influenced by who is doling it out, whether that is a judge, a jury or a private person pursuing revenge. So \"true justice\" really doesn't get considered when you're building a justice system. In most cases, the objectives of the world's justice systems are: 1. Get criminals off the streets, so they can't commit anymore crime2. Punish criminals to make an example of them and prevent future crimes3. Re-socialize convicted criminals to ensure that they don't repeat their past actions You can't do that by yourself and since everyone has their own definition of what is just, avenging someone or something will simply be that: revenge. It won't be just, no matter how convinced you are that someone \"deserved it\". And the justice system will most likely consider your revenge a crimes equal to that, which you consider to have been committed against you. They will most likely also try to make an example of you, because authorities in general tend to hate vigilantes. And I understand why they do. In our modern world, we need rule of law to prevent us from falling into chaos. We need order and order isn't what we get when everyone is running around avenging themselves. You get Viking Age Iceland or maybe 19th century Sicily. Because revenge almost always turns into a vicious cycle of hate. And as Mahatma Gandhi said \"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind\" ",

            "answer_text": "No. Forgiveness is. Or at least the offer of it. It's the only sure fire way to stop the spread of violence, anger, rage that accompany an offense. Imagine that very early on in the Hatfield and McCoy saga of stupid vengeance, one side or the other just said (as Christians are supposed to!) \"No. No more. We don't care who did what first. This stops. Here. Now. We beg your forgiveness and we forgive you, for whatever crimes we or you have committed. We are not going to continue to subject our children and our children's children to this mindless tit-for-tat travesty. Enough.\" Even those who excoriate the God of the Bible don't seem to understand that after all we have done, all the unforgivable violence and torture and genocide humans are responsible for, he continues to offer us forgiveness instead of annihilation. No. Revenge isn't justice because no mere human can see all sides of a wrong. And it is an attempt to place the \"avenger\" above the victim, which is just not possible. Because at its core, revenge is murder, and if the avenger becomes a murderer, how is he \"better\"? The murdered simply have the same excuse to come after him, and so on and so on. This way lies the Balkans, Northern Ireland, the Middle East...it is a recipe for death, not life. ",
