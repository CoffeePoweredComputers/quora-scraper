            "answer_text": "No, mental telepathy is not really a form of mind control, but mental telepathy can be used as a form of planting a suggestion or suggestions into a person's mind to do certain things and tricking the person into thinking that such thoughts to perform a certain action or actions are the person's own thoughts. On the 1960's science fiction tv show \u201cStar Trek\", the Vulcan character Mister Spock would use his strong power of deep mental telepathy, at even a far enough distance away, to clandestinely strongly influence someone in doing certain actions without the person knowing he or she is being telepathically strongly tempted to do, and the person would follow the urge.
