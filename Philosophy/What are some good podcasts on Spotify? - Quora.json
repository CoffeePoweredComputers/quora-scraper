            "answer_text": "As is often the case, it depends what you mean by \u201cbest\u201d. Spotify hosts many of the podcasts that are popular or acclaimed on other platforms. For example, \u201cWelcome to Night Vale\u201d, \u201cWaking Up with Sam Harris\u201d, and \u201cMy Brother, My Brother, and Me\u201d are all available on Spotify. If you want to listen to good podcasts and Spotify is your preferred platform, use a general list of quality podcasts; they are probably on Spotify. You might also browse the Spotify podcasts section by genre to narrow your search. Alternatively we might be interested in podcasts that are unique to Spotify (produced by Spotify, perhaps). In that case our options are limited, but only because Spotify got into this game relatively recently. They are collaborating with at least a couple big-time podcasting networks (Gimlet and Panoply) to produce \u201cMogul\u201d and \u201cShow Stoppers\u201d, so I would imagine they will expand their stable quickly if these shows are successful.
