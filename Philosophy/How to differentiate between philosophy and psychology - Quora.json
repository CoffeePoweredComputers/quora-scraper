            "answer_text": "TL;DR: philosophy and psychology have developed their own methods towards seeking the \u2018truth\u2019 but essentially they are trying to achieve the same objective A lot of answers here seem to be from either philosophers or psychologists keen on playing turf wars. As a generalist I\u2019m coming from a different viewpoint. I would beg to disagree with @Robert Sacerich that the disciplines share very little overlap. This is a viewpoint that stems from modern academia, which tends to stratify and divide; hence our higher education system today promotes depth rather than breadth as a virtue. But these are artificial institutional constructs, not epistemological ones. Ancient and modern practices The founders of Western philosophy saw things in a different light. Philosophy back then was regarded in its broadest definition - a love \u2018philos\u2019 of wisdom \u2018sophia\u2019. Hence Aristotle would today be equally considered a botanist, biologist, physicist, political scientist, economist, as well as a psychologist and philosopher. In a more explicit, modern setting, CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy), a leading evidence-based therapy, is derived from behavioural and cognitive therapy. But CBT\u2019s founders, Ellis and Beck based their practice on principles derived from the ancient philosophical school of Stoicism. (see Stoic Philosophy and Scientific Research ) The century of the brain Moving into the 21st century, the gap between psychology and philosophy is narrowing even further as we make more advances into scientific understanding of the brain and cognition. Neuroscience, behavioural economics, and evolutionary psychology are providing fascinating insights into the mechanics of how we view and experience the world, learn, interact and make decisions. One striking example of these interdisciplinary overlaps are philosophy\u2019s presentation of logical fallacies, psychology\u2019s presentation of cognitive biases, and economics\u2019 take on (Kahneman\u2019s) fast and slow thinking. In my mind, psychology and philosophy are just different in-roads to a very basic underlying motivation - understanding the human condition. As Buckminster Fuller once said, academics are very good at drilling a very deep and narrow whole into their chosen discipline. But when they burrow down further than anyone else in their field and look upwards, all they can see is a tiny speck of the sky above. ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy cares about sound reasoning. In philosophy before you make any claims you must learn how to reason, and how the \"shape\" of an argument makes it worth considering, or not, etc. You mostly argue about things you cannot test experimentally, but the training is supposed to keep you from going too far off track into absurdity. Philosophers pretty much argue with each other, and build off each others' ideas. However, they all tend to know how to do it right. In academic philosophy personal attacks are not going to be taken seriously. It's all about the worth of the idea. Going a little bit off topic because people have said that the study of the mind falls under psychology: there's actually something called philosophy of mind that argues about how we could possibly think, whether or not our minds and our brains are one and the same, etc. It's pretty cool because a lot of philosophers have offered up colorful thought experiments to illustrate their theories. Look up the \"Chinese Nation\" experiment as an example. Psychology developed from a mass of different social attitudes and trends (e.g., poststructuralism), and has a lot of conjecture and badly designed (sometimes unethical) studies in its past. By its nature it cannot be rigorous, especially in clinical settings, because you often have a single professional making judgment calls. While he or she may be very educated and sharp, there will be bias and other limitations. I hope that soon we will be able to rely more and more on neuroscience and brain imaging to study what we refer to as the human mind. Disclaimer: My answer is biased. ",

            "answer_text": "First, psychology begins as animal psychology. This was true in the days of Aristotle, but it is equally true today. When we study psychology in college, we often begin with rats, cats and dogs. The physiology of the psyche is crucial to a further grasp of the topic. Philosophy has no such beginning. Philosophy is based entirely on Free Thought. While many \u201cpsychologists\u201d have doubted that Free Thought exists, this was never proposed when Philosophy began. Human psychology moves beyond physiology only slowly. It might begin with individual development, first of the infant in response to the mother and the family, and then to the stages of psycho-sexual development \u2014 the oral stage, the stage of toilet training, then puberty, adolescence, and then adulthood, for example. Again \u2014 Philosophy does not proceed in that way. Philosophy began with the postulate of Free Thought, of Freedom, of Free Will, of Reason as the starting point, and with Reason\u2019s exploration of the outer and inner worlds. We might say, then, that Philosophy is about adults only \u2014 but it is more than that. It is promoted by adults only, but it also reaches beyond the Physical Realm. To clarify \u2014 Philosophy does not deny or reject the Physical Realm, or even minimize it \u2014 but Philosophy does not limit itself to the Physical Realm. From the very beginning of Philosophy \u2014 from the days of Socrates (400 BC), the emphasis was on intangible, invisible realities \u2014 not of Religion \u2014 but of Logic, Ethics and Aesthetics. The basic concepts of Philosophy (per Socrates and Plato) included the following \u201cinvisible\u201d yet Eternal Ideals: Virtue, Duty, Morality, the Right, the Good, the Beautiful, Wisdom, Courage and Justice. This was the starting point of Philosophy. Defending these concepts \u2014 in the face of tyrants who denied them all with violence \u2014 even to the point of killing Socrates \u2014 this was the original project of Philosophy. ",

            "answer_text": "The spirit of inquiry is common to both, the methodologies may differ but they often overlap to a certain extent (e.g., contemplation with introspection, ethics and moral development). The very words are telling. Philosophy, \u2018love of wisdom,\u2019 was supposedly coined by the Greek mathematician and mystic Pythagoras who lived during the 4th and 5th centuries BCE. The first to use the word psychology, \u2018study of the psyche,\u2019 was Rudolph G\u00f6ckel, a German Scholastic philosopher who lived in the 16th and 17th centuries AD. There are similarities and differences in these fields but psychology has endeavored to become a science and separate itself from the fields of philosophy and theology in which the psyche was regarded strictly as a metaphysical datum. Psychology attempts to regard the psyche to an empirical phenomenon. Unfortunately for the promulgators of reductionistic and materialistic psychology, the psyche, soul, or mind is a non-physical phenomena. All that can be quantified as empirical science is the closely associated phenomena of behavior and brain functions that correspond to states of consciousness. The brain however is not the mind. Perhaps the largest divide in psychology is made by the philosophical categories of materialism versus idealism where in the former school consciousness is a product of matter and in the latter school matter is a product of [Universal] mind. In this sense the modern notion of psychology is permeated by a divide that harkens back to the philosophers Aristotle and his teacher Plato, respectively. While there is a PsyD (Doctor of Psychology) degree, the majority of doctorates in psychology is the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree IN psychology. Most psychologists I\u2019ve met do not take this degree literally or identify themselves as Doctors of Philosophy. While experimental psychology and Behaviorism (in which some proponents actually deny the existence of mind) are skewed to the materialistic side of the psychology continuum, Transpersonal Psychology includes philosophical (including metaphysics), and spiritual idioms in its fold. Philosophy is not as well known as psychology is in this century. Most people have some idea that psychologists are clinicians of a sort helping with mental and emotional issues. But ask the person on the street what philosophy is or what a philosopher does and one is likely to elicit an embarrassed shrug. ",

            "answer_text": "I've a very thin idea about conceptual difference. You can say almost an outline idea (without going deep down). I'm sharing the details here. Let's check. Philosophy Philosophy, derived from the Greek word \u2018philosophia,\u2019 translates literally to \u2018love of wisdom'. Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems that concern concrete matters such as values, existence, knowledge, reason, and language. Methods of philosophical examination include questioning, critical analysis, and rational debates. Philosophical questions that have been posed in the past include: is it possible to know anything and prove it? What is most real, and what is the meaning of life?However, philosophy is also concerned with more concrete questions such as: do humans have free will, and what is the best way to live a life? Psychology Psychology, derived from the Greek word \u2018psychologia\u2019 translates literally to \u2018the study of human spirit.\u2019 Psychology is the study of the human mind and human behaviour. It incorporates the examination of both conscious and unconscious experiences, as well as the interactions between thoughts, feelings, and behaviours. Psychology is an academic discipline and applied science, which seeks to understand the role of mental processes in human behaviour, whilst also exploring the physiological and biological functions that underpin cognitive processing and behaviour. Concepts explored by psychologists include perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, phenomenology, motivation, brain functioning, personality, behaviour, relationships, and resilience. Methods of empirical psychological investigation include experimental studies to infer causal and correlational relationships between distinct variables. Differences Between the Two Practices Philosophy arguably underpins all sciences, including psychology, and thus both disciplines overlap to some extent. However, although both bodies of knowledge examine people and life, the aspects each discipline focuses on, is considerably different. That is, while philosophy attempts to understand the existence of human life, psychology attempts to understand human behaviour. Apart from the topics that each area covers, philosophy and psychology also differ in terms of the methods they use to answer questions. Philosophy looks into areas such as life after death through questions and answers, and will never produce a single, correct answer. Contrastingly, psychology uses scientific method to understand human behaviour. This involves hypothesis testing that result in logical conclusions, supported by both observations and physical data. Furthermore, philosophy and psychology differ in employment opportunities. Philosophy majors can be employed as teachers, researchers, authors, and academic speakers. Contrastingly, psychologists are able to work across a wide array of fields. They can become clinical psychologists who diagnose and treat mental health conditions, or they can become counselling psychologists who provide people with advice on different issues. Psychologists can also become academic speakers, tertiary education lecturers, authors, and researchers. ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy for centuries was based on reason, logic and rationality; a set of reasons or a logical basis for a course of action or a particular belief. During much of this time it dealt with metaphysics, which in turn studied ontology; the nature of Being, and Epistemology; how we know what we know, or the nature knowledge. It was devoid of empirical observation of any kind leading to factual confirmable results. However, many of it assumptions became established truth for millenia. Aristotle\u2019s studies formed a basis for a move to studying by observation, that were actually reasoned guesswork rather than factual accounts, Plato put forward a theory of rational universals without any foundation in empirical factuality. Contemporary realism and idealism still assumes many of the original concepts of earlier metaphysics, but in the main philosophy has moved on, approaching the subject in various other ways; Such as Descartes rationalism, Kant\u2019s ethical idealism, existentialism, phenomenology, pragmatism, analytic philosophy, continental philosophy, political philosophy and more recently psychological philosophy. Up until the late twentieth century seeking understanding philosophically in psychology was an anathema. However, with the advent of neurological and other breakthrough psychological studies some, but not all philosophers now combine philosophy with aspects of psychology. Libet* in the twentieth century and other psychologist discovered that up to either 300 microseconds, by one account and ten seconds by another, our decisions, those we maintain we made by free cwill, have been proven to be unfounded and are nothing of the sort. this has put the cat among the pigeons and lead to a marriage of sorts between philosophy and psychology. It lead many philosophers having to take these new accounts in their thinking,. An anathema for rationalists and idealists going against everything they hold to be true.. *See Libet, studies on free will on the internet for further information of these studies ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy-science, the subject of research which is almost limitless area of knowledge and ideas about man and humanity in General, and about the world around them in the broadest sense; worldview, striving for knowledge of all things. Psychology-the science that studies the mechanisms and patterns of mental activity. for content\u2191 Comparison Philosophy, which emerged several millennia ago, is a phenomenon much more ancient than psychology. The philosophy is even hard to call it science (against this objection some philosophers), so it is a comprehensive way of understanding reality. Psychology, as well as many other Sciences, was closely connected with philosophy and only in the middle of the XIX century separated into an independent teaching. One of the main tasks of philosophy can be called the comprehension of consciousness as the largest worldview category. The psychology divides the mind into many separate elements: memory, thinking, will, perception, imagination, etc. Consciousness is just one of the types of mental activities, along with the unconscious. Philosophy discovers how consciousness (the sphere of spirit) interacts with the physical, the material. Psychology is unable to solve this problem, as well as to answer the question of where the spiritual came from in General. Here psychology is inferior to philosophy in matters of spirituality based on this worldview as its basis. Psychology can only describe the successive stages of consciousness formation in an individual, substantiates mental actions, helps to form mental skills, analyzes the state of a person. Therefore, we can say that psychology cannot exist without philosophy, while philosophy does not rely on psychology in its calculations. A psychologist should be a philosopher, but a philosopher does not need to know psychology. There is a kind of paradox: born as a science of the soul (psyche \u2013 \"soul\" in Greek), psychology then began to study the inner world of man, especially character, behavior and thinking. In fact, psychology is the science of the soul, which does not study the soul, because this substance is elusive. The original subject of comprehension of philosophy was the nature, then in the center of attention there was a ratio \"the person \u2013 the world\". His philosophy considers from different sides, answering the questions: \"What is it?\"\"Why so?\"Psychology faces other tasks: it finds out how to change the current state of things, what are the ways to solve the problem.

Philosophy is an effort to delve deeper into the nature, structure and functions of every entity and psychology is only a branch of it. Aristotle divided philosophy into 6 branches: Metaphysics (concerning existence, ontology, and knowing, epistemology), Physics (concerning properties and relations among material objects including plants and animals, called physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, etc today), Logic (concerning methods of inference including mathematics, statistics etc today), Politics (of ideal social systems and their organization, economics, political science, sociology, etc), Ethics (concerning ideal conduct of human beings at individual and social level) and Aesthetics (concerning ideal forms (that may include all arts such as painting, sculpture, architecture, singing, dancing, music and so on). Kautilya (in his Arthshastra) talks of Aanwikshiki (relating to the 6 orthodox philosophical systems like Nyaya, Vaisheshik, Sankhya, etc and the seventh one that is heterodox or lokayata), Trayi (including the Vedas and the Vedangas and the Puranas, etc including all shruties and smrities), Vaartaa (economic matters such as agriculture, animal husbandry, manufacturing, trade, etc) and Dandaniti (politics, administration, law, governance etc.). In this system, psychology will fall into Aanwikshiki. Vaisheshika of Kanada, Yoga of Patanjali and Mana, atma, etc of Sankhya will take care of psychology. Patanjali began with: Yogaschittavritti nirodhah. Kanada considers Mana and Aatma as Dravya with various properties (guna). There has been a good interaction among standard philosophers (such as Arthur Schopenhauer) and psychologists (such as Carl F Jung) on the nature of the psyche. It is worth reading. They are not all wrong that they give the same degree PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) in all branches of learning. ",

When it is not done well, it is a hotbed of claptrap ideas masquerading as science. A complicating factor is that there is a difference between those whose primary interest is doing psychotherapy, and those whose interest is doing basic research. I have known psychotherapists who were good at the science, and others who were more interested in their own opinions. I think those with more taste for the science are more prone to head to the research track. I think some of the early work, Freud, Jung, et. al., mixed a great deal more personal philosophy into the observations, and leaned on that instead of proper research design. As a result, their work is much more of a mixed bag. Another complicating factor is that all (as of this date) known  researchers are also psychological beings. There is an element of testing rulers by using a ruler  - this does not invalidate all psychology research, but it is a factor that must be properly included in the design, lest observer bias take hold. Philosophy is inherently a different discipline, using different methods to explore a wider range of subjects. ",

            "answer_text": "Modern Psychology and Philosophy are two different subjects of study and research, but the origin of psychology is found in Philosophy. Among the earliest arguments relating Psychology was one between Aristotle and Plato around the 3rd and 4th centuries BC, about the role of nature and the role of nurture in psychological development.[1] The first laboratory of Psychology established in India was in the Department of Philosophy, University of Calcutta in 1916. The following year, 1917, the first Department of Psychology was established in the University. Now, the modern Psychology has taken a far different route and is a complete discipline in itself, while Philosophy remains a prominent discipline in itself, as always. Psychology is the scientific study of human behaviour, mental processes and experiences in different contexts; while Philosophy is defined as the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence. Psychology attempts to study the structure[2], function[3] and the behavioural origin of the human mind[4], while Philosophy is a critical analysis of fundamental beliefs and values. Both originate from the same roots, but Psychology, as per the needs, has taken a scientific background while Philosophy remains a humanist field of study.[5] Footnotes[1] 1.2 The Evolution of Psychology: History, Approaches, and Questions[2] Structuralism (psychology) - Wikipedia[3] Functional psychology - Wikipedia[4] Behaviorism - Wikipedia[5] The Difference Between Philosophy and Psychology",

            "answer_text": "Thanks, Vishwas Londhe for the A2A. A simple way to put it might be that philosophy is about establishing what's right about human thought and psychology is about what goes wrong with human thought. Philosophy covers the organized study of life, and potentially a life beyond. Psychology covers the organized study of the mind. Philosophy looks at how we relate to knowledge. It looks at what it's possible to know, at whether it is even possible to know anything fully. It considers the tools that seem to work in logic, and the traps that can derail logical thought. Philosophy leads to an ontology and that leads to epistemology. Psychology is the study of why we think as we do and behave as we do, and what goes wrong with our minds, leading us to abnormal and sometimes self-destructive behavior. ",

            "answer_text": "Psychology is a science. Science is a method of studying the natural world. Any method of study requires some philosophical assumptions. Science is no exception. Philosophy outlines how we come to knowledge and answers a lot of questions about existence and the metaphysical. It also leads us to more questions. Now philosophy is fairly bad at giving us singular, straight answers. But that's what I was saying: assumptions. You can't, for example, say you know why a person did something... if you don't believe anyone outside you exists (solipsism). Psychology, as a science, is more concerned with getting to the bottom of human behavior and mental capacity, usually under the philosophical assumption that we can figure out those things naturalistically, that it is as at least in part deterministic, and that we can trust logic and evidence to guide us to those answers (as all science should.) Hopefully that clears up the relationship of philosophy and science. At one point, philosophy was science. It was superceded in terms of achieving the goals required from science. ",

Although there is no reason why it has to be strictly via reason--except that it provides common ground and a way to evaluate arguments. Wikipedia highlights: Philosophy is the study of the general and fundamental nature of reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Source: Philosophy Psychology looks at human thinking, feeling, and behavior (individual and in groups) via systematic study. Wikipedia highlights: Psychologists explore concepts such as perception, cognition, attention, emotion, intelligence, phenomenology, motivation, brain functioning, personality, behavior, and interpersonal relationships, including psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas. Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind.[5] Psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. In addition, or in opposition, to employing empirical and deductive methods, some\u2014especially clinical and counseling psychologists\u2014at times rely upon symbolic interpretation and other inductive techniques. Psychology has been described as a \"hub science\",[6] with psychological findings linking to research and perspectives from the social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, humanities, and philosophy. While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. By many accounts psychology ultimately aims to benefit society. Source: Psychology ",

Not to be confused with Neuroscience, which is the study of how the brain works, psychology is concerned with how the mind works and how that informs and affects behavior. (Although, nowadays, psychologists would stress that they don't use behaviorist models of mind). In practical terms, philosophy is more interested in exploring ideas critically and systematically looking for errors in reasoning or logic, whereas psychology is more about collecting data and making predictions about, or explaining behavior.

Philosophy has no subject matter in particular; it has a broad scope and by scrutinizing every aspect of human life whether that be in physical sciences or social sciences; it brings a synoptic vision of life or a world view in place.

They are totally two different streams with no scope for confusion. Philosophy is musings of different people on outlook towards life and the other is a scientific process of understanding human behavior. ",

The root word \u201cphilosophy\u201d (phila sophia) is \u201clove of wisdom,\u201d to include \u201ca search for truth.\u201d Arguably, each individual has a perspective regarding truth and wisdom, thus meaning that each of us have at least an informal philosophy as part of our own psychology. The classical and formal philosophy has branches and is a \u201cwhole\u201d with \u201cparts\u201d like everything else. Psychology, usually refers to a local psyche\u2019. However, the exploration into a non local psyche\u2019 is part of this field of discipline, even becoming as if a murky mixture with philosophy, and even quantum metaphysics. \u201c\u2026 as scientific investigators of the situation in which we find ourselves, we cannot, of course, neglect to study a mass of phenomena so large and so obtrusive as to constitute, to first appearance, the whole of the world we know. Consequently, a separate science has gradually arisen which endeavors to deal with these and other of the rather bulky leaving of physics. This science is called \u2018Psychology\u2019, and the facts with which it deals are dubbed \u2018mental\u2019, or, more commonly, \u2018Psychical\u2019 (J.W. Dunne, An Experiment With Time p 18); So, \u2018psychology\u2019 inspects \u201cinward\u201d processes as if studying the collisions in a bubble chamber on a subjective illusionary stage within the few cubic centimeters of the skull. These can provide clues, glimpses, revelations, insights, into the philosophical view of the nature of everything in existence/non existence.

            "answer_text": "Western philosophy is a literary genre which originated in ancient Greece about 2,500 years ago. Over all this time, philosophers have explored hundreds of topics including the nature of the human mind. Psychology is a social science which arose in Europe in the 19th century (its roots were in the discipline of medicine). Psychology as we know it today is actually two disciplines. There is research psychology, a practice that is fairly close to a natural science and involves experiments and expensive technology to determine how the brain functions (and misfunctions in some people). Then there is clinical psychology, which involves training therapists to work with groups or individuals who are suffering from emotional pain or destructive behaviors. Naturally, philosophy and psychology still address the nature of the human mind. Ancient questions such as \u201cWhat is the best life for a human being to live?\u201d can be explored and answered by professionals in either field. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Gyselle: Many years ago before the 19th century development of psychology as a science, it was always taught as a discipline of philosophy. Psyche in Greek means mind or personality and therefore it was philosophers writing about what makes up the human mind and why do humans behave as we do. It also had to do with character development and moral behavior , why people do good or bad things to each other. After and during the Enlightenment, Wilhelm Wundt and others began to use experimentation to research why humans act the way they do by setting up experiments in a lab or studying human behavior by personality types etc. No longer was it using pure logic and empirical observation by philosophers to establish our \u201cpsyches\u201d but controlled research to see what condition actually affect behavior and positing hypotheses to be proven. It became less conjecture and more scientifically verified by the methods of research. The same is true today. Psychology is taught based on empirical research and its application versus philosophy which is both a rational and observational discipline but no experiments. Much of psychology still requires some understanding of systems of philosophy but less so that in previous years. ",

            "answer_text": "Western philosophy in nature is Plato defined metaphysics like geometry and logic. It\u2019s about axioms, ideals and beliefs. It\u2019s abstract and supernatural. Psychology is relationism, a study of human relationship and behavior in the social reality. There we have social psychology not social philosophy in the western tradition. In comparison, the Chinese philosophy, e.g., yin-yang relationship and Confucianism, is all relationism. Hence the Chinese philosophy is really social and political psychology in the western definition. I call it the real philosophy. Similarly, religion of Buddhism is more psychology than philosophy to me as well. I was gonna recommend a new field but checked and found it, Political psychology. It\u2019s certainly not as famous as political philosophy and political science, but is really needed in the western free world to my opinion. Western philosophy is supernatural and science doesn\u2019t provide guidance in moral values. Neither gives realistic insight in social politics. Of course the young American pragmatism is an exception. ",

It's a discipline more about people than anything else, where the philosopher is mostly concerned with the rest of the universe. For the most part, philosophers look out, and psychologists look in.

            "answer_text": "'Psychology' is an academic discipline and an \"applied science\" which seeks to understand individuals and groups by studying mind and behavior.  'Philosophy'  is the study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with reality, existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.  The word 'Philosophy' literally means 'love of wisdom'.  To my knowledge, Philosophy is the mother discipline of all studies. Till about 19th century, there was no such term as science. What was studied in universities was called 'natural philosophy', the branch of philosophy that pertains to  the work of analysis and synthesis of common experience and argumentation to explain or describe nature.   The term science, as in natural science, gained its modern meaning when acquiring knowledge through experiments (special experiences) under the scientific method became its own specialized branch of study apart from natural philosophy.  So to sum it all up, Science is that branch of philosophy (or at least science has it's root in natural philosophy) which deals with acquiring knowledge through experiments. Psychology is that branch of Science that studies mind and behavior.  Hope this helps :) ",

Teasing out the similarities and difference can be quite confusing and frustrating. The best I could say is that Psychology as a branch of science is grounded in hypothesis, experimentation, and evidence, the scientific method. While philosophies are more speculative but where they come closer together in the theoretical domain. All of that being said, it might be best to think of philosophers as preoccupied with asking and answering the ultimate \u2018why\u2019 questions and the scientist interested in solving the problems of how things are not why they are.
