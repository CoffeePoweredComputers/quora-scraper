            "answer_text": "Both of these terms I learned in 1st year anthropology, and they are quite important for that discipline. Ethnocentrism begins with the idea that you grow up in a particular social and cultural environment, surrounded by people of a similar cultural background, similar religious beliefs, a similar language, and all this imprints on you a particular way of understanding the world. Your way of understanding the world will be largely similar to the way the people you grew up with understand the world, and this is kinda inevitable because it is from them that you learn language, morals, what things mean, how to behave, etc. However, when you meet someone from a different cultural background, they will probably have a different view of the world which is a result of their own social upbringing. They may behave differently, have different taste in clothes or food, and have different beliefs. This will also mean they see reality slightly differently to the way you do. You may therefore think they are strange, exotic or primitive because of this. You may dislike them or fear them because of it, or you may think they are really interesting and mysterious, you may even romanticize them and say they are \u201cin touch with nature\u201d or \u201cauthentic\u201d. Ethnocentrism just refers to these problems. Whenever we try to understand people from other cultures, our understanding will happen through our cultural frameworks which have been put in place by our socialization and language acquisition. Hence, what we think is right or wrong, valid or invalid, will partly be a product of own framework which they do not share. So when we look at other cultures, we will tend to view them on our own terms, and not theirs. Cultural relativism attempts to escape (or at least account for) this dilemma by asserting that all cultures have their own legitimate view of the world, that will see things differently to the ways other cultures view the world. There\u2019s no one way to say which culture\u2019s view is \u201cright\u201d because even the idea of being \u201cright\u201d is subject to a particular cultural framework. So we need to be very careful about how we describe and judge what other cultures do. We need to suspend our judgement because this would be imposing the terms of our culture onto the evaluation of others, and therefore blocking our understanding of other cultures. ",
