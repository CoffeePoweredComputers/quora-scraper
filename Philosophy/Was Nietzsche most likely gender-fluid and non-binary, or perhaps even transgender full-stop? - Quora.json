But that again has nothing to do with gender or biology or anything body but rather only mind, a mental orientation or fluidity if you will, in other words nothing surface or appearance but only energy within or the spirit as he would refer to it at times, or the life at other times ",

            "answer_text": "Nietzche was one of the most brilliant minds that has ever lived, his unique intellect and uncanny intuition topped with an astounding intelligence allowed him to analyse things from different perspectives in order to get the big picture of the whole spectrum. However that doesn't mean he was of a particular sexual orientation. There's nothing that can corroborate that whatsoever. ",
