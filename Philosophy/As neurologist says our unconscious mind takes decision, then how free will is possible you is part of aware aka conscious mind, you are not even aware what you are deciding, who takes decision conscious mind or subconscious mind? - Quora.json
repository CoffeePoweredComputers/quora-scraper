            "answer_text": "It is true that \u201cwe\u201d do not have free will. It is also true that there is truly no \u201cwe\u201d in the first place! There is no such thing called as the mind, much less unconscious mind or sub conscious mind. All that we know are thoughts. Thoughts are beyond our five senses and they do not produce any effects on totality that are within the domain of our five senses. Yet thoughts are self-luminous and self-evident and blatantly obvious and unmistakable. Thoughts must logically arise from memory and so thoughts are merely the recall function of memory. Thoughts and memory are one and the same in essence. Memory is a huge information bank and the building blocks of memory are habit patterns. Long standing habits become character or personality. Thoughts are like the memory bank blinking and this blinking is on auto pilot. \u201cYou\u201d are not thinking \u201cyour\u201d thoughts but it is the other way round. Thoughts create \u201cyou\u201d on the fly, sustain \u201cyou\u201d and kill \u201cyou\u201d along with itself.\u2019 This memory bank is conceptually called as the mind. The blinking that goes on on auto pilot is conceptually called as the sub conscious mind at work. X rays, light waves, gravity, electricity, magnetism etc. etc. are all realities that are beyond our five senses but they are all inferred and intuited by their effects on totality that are within the domain of our five senses. If there is a reality that is beyond our five senses and it does not produce any effect on totality that is within the domain of our five senses then Neuro science has no way of detecting such a reality. We will never know as to what we do not know! Thought/memory is such a unique reality that is entirely beyond out five senses directly as well as indirectly through their effects and yet they are perceived! This shows that thought/memory is subtler than the sub atomic particles which have been detected by their effects but not thoughts. THAT which infers and intuits thoughts/memory must be even more subtle than thought/memory and THIS REALITY is the subtlest REALITY known or rather intuited and THIS REALITY is what goes by the label of CONSCIOUSNESS. Neuro science will never be able to touch thought,memory or CONSCIOUSNESS but they are right there is no such thing called as \u201cme\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d and the entire cosmos is on auto pilot.

            "answer_text": "Mind itself is merely thoughts and associated emotions. If your thoughts are not resolved in the conscious state then it goes to the subconscious state which is like a storage to be resolved later. But you act immediately on the conscious state then the importance of subconscious goes of. As far as free will for a normal person it is like a long rope. We are conditioned and controlled by our education, bringing up, religion and society. So you are not free. May be you are free to choose what you eat, what car you buy, what dress you wear etc., But even there I don't think you have complete freedom. ",

You can change these default configurations (sanskars and vrittis) and also override them at runtime. The forces can be different as per conditionings. So these forces may impel you but they don't compel you. ",
