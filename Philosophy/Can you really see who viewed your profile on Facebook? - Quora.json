            "answer_text": "There is NO way you could tell who visited your profile. Most of the people would tell you to follow these steps 1)Go to your browser 2)Open View Page Source . 3)Hold CTRL+F on your keyboard, a text box appears at the right corner, in that box, type- \u201cInitialChatFriendsList\u201d. 4)Go to Facebook and type http://www.facebook.com/Id And now the people who show are the one who visited you're profile.  PEOPLE CONFUSE {InitialChatFriendsList } WITH THE PEOPLE WHO VISITED YOUR PROFILE. But what it actually means is that these are people Who likes, comments share [Your pages ,posts, pictures ,views your timeline, chats with you ] These all along with other factors determine the collective score for Facebook's algorithm(which displays these InitialChatFriendsList ) and then the rest is done by JavaScript which puts them in the order which is visible to the client side. Moreover visiting someones profile is server side interaction which cannot be viewed on client side(Page Source) until the Facebook\u2019s team is ready to show you them. And that is not what they wanted from beginning Isn't it? Remember Orkut!(The famous social network site before Facebook) Where you could see the people who visited your profile.  These along with many other factors helped Facebook make edge over other social network sites.  FACEBOOK IS NOT All ABOUT YOU BUT RATHER MORE ABOUT THEM. ",

            "answer_text": "Such this kind of question with the meaning of can you see who views your Facebook or things like that is more common among social media topics. Totally, people are curious about their social media accounts and also keen to find more details about their Facebook stalkers to figure out what is happening around their social media platforms.[1] But the bad news is that knowing a lot brings more anxiety and state, and it is also true if you know how to see who views your Facebook profile and, as a result, get you nowhere. Now here I am going to reveal the facts weather really can you see who looks at your Facebook or not? Why all of us want to get every small information from our different social media accounts? Sometimes it seems helpful for some specific activities such as like, follow, stories. In fact it is our right, but something like checking who views our Facebook profile seems interrupting and strange. Is it really help us to gain self confidence or ruin our peace?  Facebook announced that no one could track who viewed your Facebook profile. But what you think? Is it right or\u2026 Well, According to Facebook policies, no one can access such privacy data about Facebook users. Also added: \u201d if If you come across an app that claims to offer this ability, please report the app.\u201d Is there a real way to see who views your profile on Facebook? I mentioned the word \u201capp\u201d some third parties app claim that they can fetch the data about who exactly viewed your Facebook profile, but it is not the real way to see. These apps are known as unreliable apps. However, you are able to see the number of users who viewed your Facebook Page from insight option. Insight is right at the top of the page, and Page view shows all the activities of your Facebook account, such as city and country, gender and age, as well as section. Ulanoff and Filho warn that there are some third parties apps shouldn\u2019t be downloaded because not only thread your security and privacy but also provides you with wrong data about who views your Facebook profile. The possibility of abusing your personal information like password goes up with trusting to these apps; in that case, they can sell this information to other third parties apps. Why does Facebook not like letting see who views your profile? Facebook is worrying about its users\u2019 mentality situations \u201cWe all look up friends, former friends, exes, and coworkers on Facebook, and we don\u2019t want users to know when we look up their pages.\u201d If this was possible, there is a chance people would spend less time on the site and thus hurt Facebook\u2019s revenue, Dr. Selepak says. Based on this statement, we can conclude that more details about each social media can separate the people on social networks, and it won\u2019t be necessary to make it known for all types of users. We come to the conclusion that Facebook can track all your moves on its app from finding Facebook profile your location till reads your text messages and so it is a piece of cake for Facebook to recognize who views your Facebook profile. For the option I said you could deny permissions, but for who viewed my Facebook you can do nothing. Footnotes[1] https://il.ink/blog/social-media/can-you-see-who-viewed-your-profile-on-facebook/",

In case of any legal disputes or hacking or something like that they can provide data if required by the authorities. But here I have found several methods claiming to show users who visit your profile and its totally bullshit. The common method I have seen is that they told you to check page source and search for \u2018InitialChatFriendsList\u2019. Honestly it will show the friends who you contacted recently and are online and based on the Facebook chat relativity algorithms. They have no connection with the fact that they visited your profile. Some websites and blogs are misleading the users into thinking that they can find the people who visited their profiles. And there is another scam that tells you to put some java script code in your console. This will simply harm your Facebook account. Some are scripts that automatically like some pages, add you and your friends to group, or allow illegal access to your account. So I will highly recommend all the users to please not fall into these type of misleading information. Let me know whether you agree with me or not. If not provide the reasons with proof. ",

However, people who knew other social platforms like Hi5 got used to knowing who visited our profile. But in this social network we have not been able to know who stalkea us, at least until now. Several programming sites present the following methodology that ensures to provide you with the information and necessary steps to find out who has visited your wall. Step 1. Enter your 'Time line', that is, your Facebook news page and then you will right click. A menu with several options will be displayed. Step 2. Click on Inspect, the last option on the menu. You can also enter by pressing Ctrl + Shift + I while on your Facebook page. A window with a series of codes will appear; press Ctrl + F. Step 3. Later the cursor will be positioned in a search engine where you must write down the word \"friendslist\", in lowercase letters without leaving spaces and without a period at the end. Step 4. Next you will see a series of codes in blue and red. Choose those that are in quotes (\"\"), write it down on a piece of paper or a notepad, since you will not be able to copy and paste. Step 5. Open a new window in your search engine and type: Log In or Sign Up followed by the code you have chosen. Now you just have to press Enter and know the profile of the person who supposedly visited your wall. ",

MySpace was the only similar social media platform that I can remember that allowed that feature. As for Facebook, the only thing you can do is make what\u2019s called an \u201ceducated guess\u201d of who you may think has been stalking/looking at your profile. You can do this by evaluating who comes up in the \u201cpeople you may know\u201d list. If they are people you actually know but aren\u2019t mutual friends with on Facebook, chances are they searched for you at some point. If they are people you have never seen before chances are they typed your name by accident to search for someone they know who may have the same name or a similar name as you. Again, this would go about making an educated guess and is in no way an accurate for sure way of 100% knowing who looked at your profile. I worked at Facebook for 3 1/2 years as a front end web developer. ",

            "answer_text": "When anyone see your profile, the data is asked from the fb server, so that server knows who is asking your data, but that has to be saved in a record somewhere and fb team doesn't do that. Why? There can be many reasons, out of these two might be the best estimations: It will require a lot of data to be maintained and stored.Will you stalk anyone, if you know that the other guy will know it? Obviously not, right? Else this will decrease the surfing time on fb and will directly affect the business and the profit of fb. Also to note that, fb is used for many hrs in a day, mainly by lonely guys, who are actually stalkers!!!So the point is fb doesn't have the code to save that data from the server. Hence the link is detached there itself. Therefore no option via which that data can reach you. This feature works only in few items like, who had seen your story or who is viewing you live, where fb has a code to save that data from the server. Another ways to know who viewed your profile are: Hack the website and add that code. OrHack the fb app of all the users and add the respective code.Do not trust those guys who instructs to, \u201cRight click and check via page source\u201d, they do not know even the meaning of page source, just copying and pasting here some cheap tricks, written by intelligent bloggers on their webpages to get views and earn money.

            "answer_text": "Within Facebook itself, nope.  The cheat about the List is for the instant chat that shows up on the right.  It is who interacts with you the most, so you will see them there.  And its from your Friends list.  So if you posted anything recently and they clicked on it, they will show up there.  But to actually answer this.  Hmmm, you would need a photo that had extra data in it that contacted a site once opened or displayed.  But Facebook also checks photos and removes all other metadata except for a few things.  Like the GPS if taken with a cellphone and location data was left on.  Camera type, resolution and lot of other things.  But if you try to add extra code to make it traceable, Facebook will auto remove it. So no, there is no way to know who actually visits your profile.  It has to be an interaction, like clicking on your posted things, liking a post and so forth.  But just viewing their page or a photo from your timeline, even if they are a friend or not.  You will never know.  Besides the initial friends chat list will only show who you are a friend with.  Not others who have like your post, photos and such there of. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, here are the stpes:1. you can display your facebook profile you on a big screen and put cameras all across the places. 2. Now, you invite people to that place and keep a watch on who all have viewed your profile. 3. If you can\u2019t precisely count the number of people viewing your profile, then you can also check those camera footage you have placed.4. This will help you know, who and how many people have viewed your profile. On a serious note: FB is an ever evolving social network platform with a more than 1 billion active users. The algorithm they have used, just collects such logs of profile views for each users however at this point of time Facebook Inc. is not willing to let such features revealed to the general users. They use it for internal analysis in better placement of feeds, ads and other such contents. maybe in future they consider giving users access to such features but that may just kill the beauty of connecting the world without being bothered of who\u2019s viewing me.moreover why you should be bothered who has viewed your profile. Rather you should focus on more meaningful things in life.Note: Please don\u2019t get offended. :) ",

There are numerous Firefox and Chrome extensions that supposedly add that tweak in your browser allowing you see who viewed you and adds other features to your experience on Facebook, whether they really work or not is another matter, I've never used any of them, I don't install any extensions on my browsers, there's no need for anything except an ad blocker, but if you wanna waste some system resources and possibly add vulnerable extensions to your browser go right ahead\u2026. Or just live with the mystery of never knowing, if in doubt make it friends only, turn your privacy way up so nothing is available except the basics, or deactivate your account ",

As many people are saying you can actually see who\u2019s viewing your profile with the below steps : Go to your timeline \u2192\u201cRIGHTclick\u201d on it\u2192Select \u201cView page source (Ctrl+U)\u201d \u2192A new window with source code will open then press \u201cCtrl+F\u201d\u2192a text box appears then type InitialChatFriendsList now you will see a list of numbers which are ID\u2019s of your profile viewersCtrl+c and Ctrl+v one among ID beside your fb url. i..e, http://www.facebook.com/xxxxxxxxxx (inplace of xxxxxxxxxxxx)now you\u2019ll see the profile of that ID. I have tested this technique, This includes people only from my friend list, not general. I mean it doesn't show the person if he /she is not your friend and those are my recent chats. So, I guess there is no such way to findout !! ",

There can be a lot of reasons for that but the reason that actually seems logical to me is that lot of guys(girls and boys) both check the persons profile which they might like and did not have the guts to say in front. If the user have above feature the actually would not check it because the user would come to know who is actually stalking you online. ",

It's obvious that you have someone specific in mind whom you suspect to have seen your profile on facebook. It's always better to go and talk to that person. Just go for it :) ",

These numbers are the Ids of the people who viewed your profile on Facebook.
