            "answer_text": "Causation is a constant study within applied statistics. In point of fact, the major reason for applying statistics within approaches like Six Sigma is to identify likely causes. Cause is then defined roughly as \u201cevents that create other events\u201d. Many events are random, with no identifiable special causes. These are known as \u201csystemic\u201d or \u201ccommon\u201d causes, inherent in any system. Then there the few identifiable special causes that we can identify and pursue. The ability to tell these apart is a major part of applied statistics. The problem is that many events simply coexist and might be causative - or they might not. This is where statistics in research is often applied, to disentangle the skein of indirect causes and spurious correlations. For example, statistics has been brought to bear for many decades now to determine whether smoking causes cancer. The careful, reasoned answer is \u201cnot directly in everyone\u201d, but smoking does greatly enhance the probability of developing lung cancer in those who otherwise would not have the disease. We now understand \u201ccause\u201d to be on a scale, not absolute. Many causes contribute to events without being the only, or even the major, engines behind those events. So in sum, the modern understanding of \u201ccause\u201d is nuanced. There can be many causes to particular events, and even interacting causes. Statistical practice allows us to better understand how those causative events act. ",

            "answer_text": "The concept of cause depends on context. What caused a car crash? An icy road? The car\u2019s speed? The tires? The driver? The people who made the car? The people who designed the highway? A missing caution sign? All of these things were necessary for the particular crash, none of them alone could have caused it. A court might find the driver responsible, the NHSA might blame the design and the missing sign, the driver might blame the ice. All are correct. A statistician will analyze lots of crashes and perhaps find that an icy road increases the likelihood of crashes by 20%, and that if there had been no ice there would have been 500,000 fewer crashes last year. That\u2019s a statistical finding, but it also involves some assumptions that may not be true. This is a different sense of \u201ccause\u201d than nonstatisticians typically use. She is not saying the ice caused any particular accident, she cannot identify the 500,000 accidents she says were caused by ice. She\u2019s just saying that adjusting for all other factors she can think of, there seem to be 500,000 more crashes due to ice than there would be without ice. To further investigate causation, the statistician will study lots of different data. Does ice increase crashes everywhere, or only when and where it is unexpected? Does it increase for all drivers, or do some types of drivers actually have fewer accidents because they drive more carefully when there is ice? Is it the ice or the cold that makes the difference? Questions like these can refine the sense in which road ice causes accidents. The best evidence for causation comes from controlled experiments. However these would be difficult to do in the case of the contribution of road ice to automobile accidents. The second best alternatives is to find situations that are as close to identical as possible, one with road ice and one without. Careful work of this kind can establish a reasonable presumption of causation. But there is no underlying fundamental truth to discover. There are multiple causes to everything, and how ice affects automobile accident rates has a complex interaction with all of them. Without ice tires and roads might be designed differently, drivers might act differently or lots of other stuff. You can never assign a pure cause with certainty. ",
