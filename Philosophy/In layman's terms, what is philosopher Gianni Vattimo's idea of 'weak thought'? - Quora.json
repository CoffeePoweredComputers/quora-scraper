            "answer_text": "A2A. LOL. Reducing complex philosophical concepts to \u201clayman\u2019s terms\u201d is perhaps itself a byproduct of weak thought - as we can only frame such discourse in the concepts we have learned via the culture through which we swim. Be that as it may\u2026. My understanding is that Vattimo is passionately invested in the idea that nothing a priori - and most certainly not our \u201cbeing/essence/ousia\u201d - is self-evident, extant, or a reliable basis for philosophical disclosure. Thus to engage in a priori speculation is to demonstrate \u201cweak thought.\u201d We can only know (in the sense of strong thought, i.e. a posteriori \u201cdeductive cogency\u201d) from our experience and, more reliably, what Vattimo calls \u201cscientific calculation and technological organization.\u201d Thus \u201cBeing\u201d per se is fluid - it has no definite or stable structure. From Vattimo\u2019s Weak Thought (2012): \u201cOne has access to Being not through presence but only through recollection, for Being cannot be defined as that which is but only that which is passed on [si tramanda].\u201d First I would say that this idea isn\u2019t particular new - Proust makes clear reference to the same observations about transience and recollection in his writing. Of course I wouldn\u2019t dream of implying that Vattimo is reappropriating here. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s not particularly original. Secondly I would say that Vattimo\u2019s argument narrowly holds true for a very thin slice of concrete sequential reasoning, and not for the many other cognitive input streams humans have available to us (see Sector Theory 1.0 \u2013 Todd's Take on Epistemology). This is what I would call classic exclusionary bias. When Vattimo asserts that \u201cwe do not have pre-categorical or trans-categorical access to Being,\u201d he is simply mistaken. Lastly, where Vattimo seems to claim that the metaphysical tradition has no \u201dcoherent unity,\u201d IMHO he is evidencing his own incomplete understanding of that tradition - and his oversimplifying (or reducing) of its nuances - rather than any demonstrated continuity in his own logic. My 2 cents. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s okay to just accept what you were taught as a child, in Sunday School, in confirmation class, at grade school; just don\u2019t take it too seriously. [\u2026] one tacitly realizes nihilism as the sole opportunity to find liberation. Such liberation occurs through weakening the traces of the tradition into which one is thrown. Nostalgic resignation, according to Vattimo, is not mere acceptance. The Being of Dasein is interpretative, and therefore the reception of traces of tradition is active, rather than passive. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Hopefully that is not too far from the philosopher\u2019s intent. Beware of glib summaries of possibly profound thought. Without understanding the nuances of the jargon in which a philosopher expresses a position, it is rarely clear what he means. ",
