            "answer_text": "I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not a nihilist then, my friend. What is there to be depressed about? Where existence has no purpose or necessary significance then even \u2018depression\u2019 is a non-event. There is no sense in which \u2018depression\u2019 is any worse or any better than \u2018happiness\u2019 - because all the minuscule mechanisms of quarks and bosons chaotically coinciding to meaninglessly manifest as the illusion of intelligence you call your \u2018self\u2019 are absolutely devoid of any implications and thoroughly inconsequential in every sense. They are senseless - there is no importance to any one of their properties or processes - including everything that amounts to the operations of your brain. So, in reality, a depressed nihilist is a contradiction. Depression only exists in contrast to a sense of satisfaction that one considers correct. That means something matters, and that things ought to be a certain way. If a nihilist is actually truthful then they will not be affected by the belief that there is any genuine reason to ascribe value to anything - especially not themselves. In existential nihilism everything is meaninglessly arbitrary, which is exactly why there\u2019s no such thing as a true existential nihilist. \u2018Truth\u2019 is not a thing. At least, it is not a thing in any way that applies in any sense. An existential nihilist has no reason to be depressed. An existential nihilist has no reason to be content. An existential nihilist has no reason to be an existential nihilist. An existential nihilist has no reason.  Well, clearly because things matter. ",
