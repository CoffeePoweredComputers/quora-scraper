            "answer_text": "None. All physicists use mathematics. Einstein didn\u2019t invent any new mathematical methods or prove any theorems. He used mathematics. A degree in physics is sufficient qualification for the application of mathematics. That said, he did use some math that was not normally required for physics. For that he had to study independently. He also enlisted the help of mathematicians. ",

Once when he asked his maths teacher to give some proofs if his maths qualification at school, his teacher wrote that Albest can teach him. ",
