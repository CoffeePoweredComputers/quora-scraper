Relax, it will come.When you keep repeating the same thing and not getting anywhere. You need to stop it and do just this one thing for a short while: Quieten you mind, turn inwards and seek your inner wisdom. It will guide you to the best course of action wherever you maybe.When there is nothing to do. Sometimes there is irreparabile damage, accept that. Never do for the sake of doing, or to impress others. When you need to do something you will know.When you are faced with constant opposition that is robbing you from your peace of mind. Try your best to let it all go and trust everything will sooner or later work out for your best.",
