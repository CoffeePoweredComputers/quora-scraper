            "answer_text": "Think about what the word is supposed to mean: love of wisdom. If you go by that alone, to love wisdom and to gain wisdom, you gotta live. Can't think when you are dead, by definition. Sure, the way philosophy is practiced today, and, really for hundreds of years, the wisdom is no more than sophistry. But even to argue and sound smart, you must be alive. So even if the philosophers do not offer much to live for to practice being a philosopher requires living. But that is, you have probably seen, the major flaw with philosophy, that with all its pretended wisdom, it really is a rare philosophy that gives anybody a reason to live or even practical guidelines for life. The stoics emphasize some fair tenets, but I have yet to see any philosophy that compares to the wisdom found in the Bible. Some brush up beside it and say, let me have a little of what you got, so they can sound better, a little more practical and sensible, and more logical. They just can't come close to the Bible when it comes to the truth, true wisdom, and knowledge of God, because that is what they try to avoid, because they csn neither match it nor better it. And the Bible truly gives reason and motivation to live. Love, joy, and peace to you all. Read your Bible daily. Get to know our wondrous God, Jehovah. Delight in wisdom. ",

I\u2019m 66 and the first musings I had about suicide was around 6\u20137. A mind inclined to worry about suicide will always think about suicide. Sometimes the idea feels so comfortable then after a few days it\u2019s seriousness evaporates. Up and down. ",
