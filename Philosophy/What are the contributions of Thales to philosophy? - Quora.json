            "answer_text": "Thales, as far as ancient Greek philosophy is concerned, was the first known \u2014 or believed to be the first \u2014 thinker who tried to explain the constitution of the cosmos, its origin, and its behavior by means of natural elements, causes or mechanisms. Aristotle [for example] is confident that Thales belongs, even if honorifically, to that group of thinkers that he calls \u201cinquirers into nature\u201d and distinguishes him from earlier poetical \u201cmyth-makers.\u201d Thales postulated that everything came from water. \u201c[W]hen Thales says that the first principle is water, he should be understood as claiming both that the original state of things was water and that even now (despite appearances), everything is really water in some state or another.\u201d (italics mine) Elementary Stuff For us, modern-day people, the idea that water (or H[math]^2[/math]O) is the \u2018elementary stuff\u2019 of things may sound ridiculous. Clearly, water itself is a compound of elements, which are themselves composed of sub-atomic particles. But, the ancients did not have the benefit of modern technology and science (which actually benefited from them). What\u2019s ingenious about Thales\u2019 inquiry, however, goes beyond just finding out what things are made of. Whether one chooses water, air, earth or fire to be this elementary stuff, the point is that there must be some unity in all things that allow them to interact or behave us they do. \u201cAccording to Aristotle's general account, the Presocratics [including Thales] claimed that there was a single enduring material stuff that is both the origin of all things and their continuing nature.\u201d Fundamental Principle The problem with \u2018myth-making\u2019 is that causes and effects are explained by the arbitrary decisions of supernatural beings or super-humans. We can\u2019t know whether Zeus will be angry today or not; whether he will find our actions pleasing or disgusting. Thales resisted myth-making. This may also be the reason behind Thales\u2019 choice for his \u2018elementary stuff\u2019. Water flows. It changes into different phases of solid, liquid and gas. It sustains life; it destroys life. All we need to decipher is how water changes into other different things. In this sense, the diversity that we perceive in the cosmos are but different transformations of water, of its soul. ...[W]ater endures through whatever changes have occurred since the original state, and now just has some new or additional properties. Thales may well have thought that certain characteristics of the original water persisted: in particular its capacity for motion\u2026 water, or soul, being a divine natural principle.\u201d (italics mine) Water for Thales is not simply a building block. It is also perfect metaphor for him to describe how variety and change happens. In other words, Thales sought to find out not only the material substrate, but also the fundamental principle, law, or order in the midst of infinitely diverse and seemingly random events in the cosmos. Naturalism This two basic insights: (1) that the cosmos is fundamentally the same, and (2) that the cosmos has discernible order is actually what \u201cinquiry into nature\u201d is really about. \u201cThales sees nature as a complete and self-ordering system, and sees no reason to call on divine intervention from outside the natural world to supplement his account\u2014water itself may be divine, but it is not something that intervenes in the natural world from outside (Gregory, 2013).\u201d (italics mine) To view the cosmos as a complete and self-ordering system is to believe that nature is knowable on the basis of its own organization and behavior. This is the origin not only of Western philosophy, and even Western science. Today, scientists are still finding out whether there are more particles besides the known fermions and bosons. Some of them postulates that these sub-atomic particles are made up of 2D strings, making \u2018strings\u2019 as the candidate for the next \u2018elementary stuff\u2019. Scientists are also searching for a \u2018grand unification theory\u2019, a simple and elegant formula, a fundamental principle, that would resolve the contradictions between quantum physics and general relativity. With Thales and the Miletians, Western philosophy began; and Western science also derives its origin from them. Many today would not consider themselves naturalists, but it was their naturalism that started it all. Source: Presocratic Philosophy ",
