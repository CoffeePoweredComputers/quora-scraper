            "answer_text": "The Grandfather Paradox is described as follows: a time machine is invented enabling a time traveller to go back in time to before his grandfather had fathered offspring. At that time, the time traveller kills his grandfather, and therefore, one of the time traveller\u2019s parents would never exist and thus the time traveller himself would never exist either. If he is never born, then he is unable to travel back through time and kill his grandfather, which means he would be born, and so on. ",
