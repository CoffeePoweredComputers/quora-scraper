            "answer_text": "Not always. I did not choose to be sexually abused by an older girl when I was 7 and then by an older boy when I was 9. I did not choose to be raised by a single mother who literally screamed at me so much I had no idea what I had actually done wrong. I did not choose to be in a Junior School with a nut job teacher holding me back in her swimming class even though I was obviously the best damn swimmer there. I did not choose to be born with one ear and called a freak and an ugly weirdo my whole life. I did not choose to have not one, but several sexual partners in my life who froze on me mid-activity and changed their mind pushing me off (one of those was a single mother whose 3yr old started crying in the other room which is fair enough, the others - not so reasonable). I didn't choose to be the kind of person who holds it all inside rather than being a psychopathic murderer expressing all my rage by being violent to others. But if you want me to start, I can try.

            "answer_text": "Q: Does depression make you make bad decisions? It certainly can, suicide being one of the worst. Seeing a good therapist can help a lot. If possible, find a therapist trained in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, since that has been proven to work. (See, for example, Effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Public Mental Health: Comparison to Treatment as Usual for Treatment -Resistant Depression and The effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy in depression.) If a therapist is unavailable and/or unaffordable, try reading and working through these two books, which are based on CBT principles: Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy The Feeling Good Handbook Also, see this list: 81 Awesome Mental Health Resources When You Can\u2019t Afford a Therapist Research demonstrates Burns\u2019s book is quite effective on its own, though better with a good therapist. Inexpensive secondhand copies are available at AbeBooks.com. The first book\u2019s preface cites studies showing that the book by itself is more effective than medication by itself. The book\u2019s forms can be found online, so they can be downloaded and printed. Example: Burns Depression Checklist is at https://www.jaxhealth.com/app/files/public/10161/burns-depression.pdf. That checklist indicates the degree of depression. Another book that has proved helpful to many: The Upward Spiral: Using Neuroscience to Reverse the Course of Depression, One Small Change at a Time. Consider also seeing a physician for a prescription for an antidepressant and note this: FDA Approves Esketamine Nasal Spray For Hard-To-Treat Depression For depression that has proved resistant to standard treatment, investigate Transcranial magnetic stimulation. I know someone who used that and it proved very effective. It also seems to enhance memory: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation found to boost memory In addition, there are some simple tactics to fight depression: 4 Ways to Keep Your Depression Symptoms in Check (FWIW, my favorite exercise is Nordic walking.)
