            "answer_text": " It's important to keep in mind that Peter Joseph (creator of the Zeitgeist movement and film trilogy) made the movie by himself, with random pictures and photographs he took from the internet, at the age of twenty seven. He actually was faced with a difficult legal situation after the movie unexpectedly exploded with internet fame; the movie and trilogy is considered the most popular movie and documentary in the history of the internet. After the film aired, even though Peter planned on it being a one time viewing in a small venue, he placed the film on the internet. When the film exploded with popularity, he had to contact hundreds of individuals, who's property he used, in order to avoid being sued and running into legal claims. It must be said that the first movie of the trilogy was made by a kid who had basically no budget and no professional equipment, intended for a one time viewing to a small audience. It's not by any means a well planned production, and should not be viewed as such; it's not a movie made by professionals with an extensive budget. In the end, Peter is just someone who was trying to speak his mind and discuss ideas he read about and believed at the time. I have no idea if he still believes all of these ideas, maybe he does. The bottom line is that he was an amateur who has now had over a decade to research and adjust his ideas and we shouldn't judge him or the movement based on a 'rough draft' made in 2007. His ideas have since evolved from government and authoritative conspiracies to defining a new civil rights movement. Hence his new book titled The New Civil Rights Movement. I\u2019m not suggesting that the arguments made in these films are incorrect or that Peter doesn\u2019t believe anything in the films. I\u2019m merely suggesting that it seems obvious to say that government corruption exists and that we should stop destroying the habitability of earth. Peter Joseph is no longer interested in proving these ideas that have been beaten to death within the last decade, and has decided to move on to other things, since most people don\u2019t need these ideas to be proven anymore. These ideas are factually evident and are no longer only believed by some minority. More importantly, religion has nothing to do with The Zeitgeist Movement (TZM). You could believe everything else about TZM, removing religion, and not very much would change. You can still believe that we ought to or will live in a shared access society, devoid of money and social and ecological corruption, and believe in Jesus or Muhammad or any other widespread religion. There's nothing about TZM that says you can't believe in religion. So we could just eliminate the religious part of the documentary altogether. The reason Peter originally said anything about religion was due to the fact that he believed religious people tend to trust authority and question authority less than nonreligious people. I believe this claim to be true, but, like anything else, it could definitely be argued. I will finish this post by saying I consider myself part of TZM. I am not religious and think it is somewhat childish and that people should choose to abandon it. However, the takeaway here is that the religious part of the first Zeitgeist film trilogy is not necessary to the movement nor the main ideas Peter Joseph was trying to communicate. He was merely trying to eliminate any preconceived notions of blindly trusting authority.  UPDATE: Someone commented and correctly suggested that i didn\u2019t directly answer the question. However, there are multiple ways to answer a question: 1) answer the question; 2) prove the question doesn\u2019t need to be answered or is invalid. I went with number two. But, to be fair, this person argued that maybe people just want to know the answer to this question and aren\u2019t concerned about TZM or the fact that TZM believes this topic irrelevant to changing social problems. Yes, the religious discussion was at the beginning of the first movie, I\u2019m well aware of this. I\u2019ve watched almost every interview Peter Joseph has ever done; I feel comfortable talking about what Peter intended for his first film. You may want to reread my answer if you\u2019re confused about the first film being something like a rough draft. Today, Peter Joseph doesn\u2019t talk about 9/11 being an inside job or religion in interviews. He says he\u2019s bored of these topics and essentially they aren\u2019t the root of our global problems. This makes them pointless to discuss when it comes to fixing social issues. My goal in writing this answer is to let people know that TZM is not an anti religion movement. And yes, it\u2019s true that I don\u2019t think this Quora question needs a direct answer; it draws attention away from the purpose of TZM, which is to change the global, social and political structure in order remove systemic problems and class divides. In fact, the question should be changed to something along the lines of why do people throughout history believe Christianity is a sun worshiping religion? I\u2019m not saying that this debate shouldn\u2019t happen, it should just be separated from TZM movement and what Peter Joseph is, today, trying to do with the movement. But if you insist on having this religious debate, you may want to know that Peter Joseph is not the first person to come up with these ideas. I\u2019m not an expert in the topic of religion, but let me give you guys a good starting point. According to Thomas Paine, \u201cthe Christian religion is a parody on the worship of the sun, in which they put a man called Christ in the place of the sun, and pay him the adoration originally payed to the sun.\u201d \u201cThomas Paine was a Founding Father, the philosopher of the American War for Independence, and a true revolutionary. His essays and pamphlets, especially Common Sense, noted for its plain language, resonated with the common people of America and roused them to rally behind the movement for independence\u201d (Welcome to American History Central). The debate Peter Joseph was discussing at the beginning of the first Zeitgeist film is not new. Thomas Paine believed that Christianity was a false, sun-worshiping religion. Peter Joseph may have added a new spin to these ideas, but it\u2019s not a new concept. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The arguments used are vastly misleading. His main comparison is Horus from Egyptian mythology but he actually gets a lot of Egyptian mythology wrong. He also claims that all these different deities were known to resurrect after 3 days, born on December 25th, called Son of God, etc but they are mostly not true. I remember there's one moment where he refers to Horus as god\u2019s sun (or something like that) and he is clearly trying to tie it in with the fact that we (Christians) refer to Jesus as the Son of God. However, this is actually rather laughable since \u201cson\u201d and \u201csun\u201d only sounds similar in English. Not Hebrew. Not Greek. English. So that little tidbit right there is misleading an audience that 1) hasn't read up on ancient mythologies and 2) probably isn't focusing on these short phrases used to discredit Christianity. Also he refers to Horus as the sun God which really isn't true, and his whole argument is based upon Horus being the sun god so\u2026 That's just my two cents. ",
