            "answer_text": "Dear reader, Telling lies, is basically giving them wrong information about something and not telling them is hiding this information from them. Even though in a way both are hiding. Both are practically the same as in both cases the person is restrained from the truth. But they differ on the basis of the reasons behind them. I personally feel that, we lie, when we don't trust them with the secret where as we hide the truth mainly because we can't see them broken with the truth. These reasons are interconnected and are exchangeable. Lying is associated with major share of trust issues and a minor share of love( can't see them broken) where as hiding is associated with major part of love and a minor part of trust issues. In the end both have the same results. I would say both are twisted ways of the same thing.. It's my personal view. We all are different and have different perspectives. So I apologise if it wasnt what you were expecting.. Good day! ",

In both situations, person is speaking lie but in first he is just telling lie without thinking much and in second person knowingly after a prolonged thinking about every consequence speaks lie. ",
