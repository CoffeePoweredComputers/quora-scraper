Good golly. No, we haven\u2019t passed that point. Some people sure seem to have lost perspective, though. Questioner. We are all free to find and value our own goods (\u201cvalues\u201d), and to rank and order them by importance (\u201cpriorities\u201d). No one can possibly make us devalue (in us) the known good we\u2019ve found again and again in proven experience. How could they? We know the good of it. No one can make us value what they value. All they can do is present it to us, best the case they can. All they can do is make an appeal to human reason for something they believe we, too can see. But they lay it before our judgment. Our judgment shall decide what it\u2019s worth to us. We don\u2019t have to agree. That covers subjectivity: what-is-good and what-should-be. Almost everything of human worth and importance comes under subjectivity. Objectivity deals solely in what-is. It\u2019s trivial, but important to be able to discern and assess, and work with. It\u2019s pretty easy. Whatever truth claim someone offers, if it intersects with your life at all you are readily able to assess its truth value by comparison with observable reality. As some call it, \u201cobjective reality.\u201d \u201cObjective\u201d here just means existence independent of any given person\u2019s perception or perspective. Objectivity isn\u2019t remotely lost. We\u2019re fully-immersed and swimming in it, constantly. It\u2019s right there for the touching, for direct sample and observation, the scrutiny, the repeatable test. For comparison with truth claims. True, some people avert their eyes, deny and ignore - but they\u2019re free to! That\u2019s powerfully maladaptive behavior, though. The kind of person you\u2019re talking about, who feels they must succumb to ideologies - it sounds to me like they never learned to separate their own worth from what other people think. They feel they have to subscribe to some mass deal just to fit in, regardless of what they can see for themselves, or what they know the good of. Well, they\u2019re free to! That\u2019s powerfully maladaptive behavior, though. That kind of attitude is opt-in. You do it because you\u2019ve passed some point, not because we have. ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all \u2014 this election is super close, and we\u2019re all waiting for the centrists to show up. People who take reality seriously, who read newspapers and don\u2019t just get their news from social media [cough.] How many centrists are working on \u201cGet Out The Vote\u201d campaigns? How many centrists are digging in deep and actually reading, idk, let\u2019s say the Mueller Report, actually reading it rather than listening to soundbites. Or any of the other controversies, digging in deep to see who actually is lying? In the US, the center is not defeated, it is missing. Find ways to focus, pick an issue or two, get other friends who wish for objectivity and normalcy, and dig deep. Centrists have to reward honesty and objectivity, or the system is just left-vs-right with no referee. False-equivalence where you pretend both sides are at fault no matter what they do just encourages bad behavior by the partisans. As soon as the centrists can get 5% or 10% of the vote \u2014 like volunteer on Get Out The Vote, volunteer as hard as the partisans, or even just volunteer 10% as hard as the partisans \u2014 then centrists will decide national elections. Pick an issue or maybe two, and dig really deep \u2014 read newspapers, even books, figure out who is lying to you. Then move your friends to vote with ethics, put time into getting them all to vote.

            "answer_text": "It seems to me that there is a difference between a bovine willed end justifies the means for worldly gains vs standing upon certain principles that are \u201ceternal.\u201d For example, a political ideology where a chosen supported charismatic leader claims nationalist supremacy over the rights of the individual (voting, protest, ideals, etc) is the definition of fascism. In turn, fascism requires NIHILISTIC followers that believe their acts are not accountable, no apologies for their agenda. This leads to futilism and fatalism in that the \u201cno historic accountability\u201d and \u201cWe are all going to die anyway,\u201d ends up resonating into the smart and dumb masses that follow the fanatical ideology. For example, critical logic vs emotive rhetoric. When we examine political ideology we can find how often leaders may expect their followers to accept political rather than sound science for practicing safety, such as a pandemic \u201cwar.\u201d Emotive rhetoric, is like pouring syrup on bs with the expectation that their followers will swallow it. Critical thinking is realizing that it is still bs, even if syrup is poured on it. I would like to have an optimistic belief that enough people can get past those that act as crude savage soulless automated zombie like fanatics. Voting may demonstrate our position when judging this world as if we were Monday Morning quarterbacks in a celestial audience watching the stages thru a 2020 vision. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends I think major chaos is around the corner. Once that settles assume the trump won i think well be heading towards normalcy. However if biden wins i think were gonna have leftists causing chaos since we really havent seen him calling out the agitators and many mayors and governors encourage it. Id hope theyd give up the left vote but i dont think that will quell the lefts anger and either biden will need to eventually get serious or the people will get tired of it and revolt themselves. So i see normalcy ahead just its beyond the chaos coming. Just my personal views. ",

One of the hallmarks of post-modernism is the rejection of objectivity or objective truth which can be reasoned out and replicated through experimentation. Notice how we are constantly told things as fact which contradict evidence but by perception they are \u201csubjectively\u201d true (think how often you hear \u201cmy truth\u201d as opposed to \u201cTHE truth\u201d). Until we can agree that certain things are true based on observability and replication and reject post-modernism we will never return to \u201cnormalcy\u201d where rationalism and logic rule. ",
