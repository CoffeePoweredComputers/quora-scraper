            "answer_text": "Badminton is a game like tennis but using a shuttlecock; not a ball Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are \"singles\" (with one player per side) and \"doubles\" (with two players per side). It is often played in nudist camps because the shuttlecock is as light as a feather and harmless when making contact as a result of a mis-hit. If you are insistent it is badmiton and not badminton you will find out by right clicking over badmiton when the red line appears under the word indicating a right click is needed you will find it is definitely badminton. Another way is to google bad and miton separately. Miton is not a word but mitten is a word. If you add bad to mitten you will have a bad glove. If you can get hold of Michael Jackson\u2019s mitten you will have a good glove.  ",
