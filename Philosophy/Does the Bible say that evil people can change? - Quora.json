            "answer_text": "Evil people are people who do evil things. As far as being evil apart from doing things, i.e. having an evil nature, the Bible teaches that all human beings have a sinful nature, prone to do evil things, susceptible to temptations etc. I remember reading the memoirs of a guy who was in the military and just happened to get assigned to the war crimes trials guarding high-level Nazi officials and military types at Nuremberg after World War II. He said what really struck him was that he expected them to seem extremely evil to him but they seemed like very ordinary men. We all have a fallen nature and are capable of doing evil under the right circumstances, with powerful enough temptations, under the wrong influences. The good news is the Bible says that our nature can be changed from the inside out, what Jesus called being \u201cborn again\u201d when he discussed the problem of sin with a religious leader in John chapter 3. So maybe you have heard the term a born again Christian? That's just an ordinary sinner who realizes he needs a savior and invites Jesus Christ to come into his and life and change him from the inside out. I've been a Christian for 50 years and I've seen some extraordinary changes take place in the lives of people who have sincerely given their hearts to Christ, amazing changes. There are many I could want you to oh, but maybe you would like to read about the life of Karla Faye Tucker. ",

            "answer_text": "Isn't that's what the concept of free will Is all about? If evil people can't change how could they be punished? That would be completely unfair, wouldn't it? If they can't repent and become righteous, why would god bother to wait for them till they repent (as he often does) as stated in ezekiel chapter 18 verse 21 ad loc: But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, live he shall live, he shall not die. None of his transgressions that he has committed shall be remembered against him; in his righteousness that he has done he shall live. Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? says the Lord God; and not that he should return from his ways, and live? But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? All his righteousness that he has done shall not be remembered; in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them shall he die. (end of quote) Of course we also see here that free will works the other way around too: that even if you were a saint your entire life, at the end you can turn sour and spoiled and become wicked. ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible teaches that all people are sinners. They are fallen beings. As such, everyone has a basic selfish and evil nature at odds with God. For the vast majority of people, because we are still in the image of God, there is a basic element of goodness that works to keep us from fully indulging in evil as a serial killer might. In historic Christian theology, individuals can decide to believe in Christ by repenting or turning against their sinful tendencies and trusting God to forgive them. This event is called various things including conversion, redemption, or being born again. When this happens, there is a change in the basic character. They still can do things that are wrong, but they have been changed and they no longer have as great desire to wrong. The Bible shows Jesus reaching out to thieves, prostitutes, robbers, cowards, hotheads, and murderers. Many of the Biblical heroes in the Old Testament had deficiencies in their character. Personally, I have known men from overseeing religious programs in a maximum security state prison who were murderers, rapists, and other drug dealers who came to Christ and were changed. ",

Apostle Paul\u2019s life before could be called evil as he was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent, but he was changed and he even became an apostle. Read his short testimony below about his life before as he was doing evil things. 1 Timothy 1:13 though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief, Mary Magdalene was known to have seven demons with her but she became worthy for the kingdom of God and changed.
