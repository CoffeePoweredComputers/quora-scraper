Researchers used the K computer in Japan, currently the fourth most powerful in the world, to simulate human brain activity. The computer has 705,024 processor cores and 1.4 million GB of RAM, but still took 40 minutes to crunch the data for just one second of brain activity. The project, a joint enterprise between Japanese research group RIKEN, the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University and Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich, an interdisciplinary research center based in Germany, was the largest neuronal network simulation to date. It used the open-source Neural Simulation Technology (NEST) tool to replicate a network consisting of 1.73 billion nerve cells connected by 10.4 trillion synapses. While significant in size, the simulated network represented just one per cent of the neuronal network in the human brain. Rather than providing new insight into the organ the project\u2019s main goal was to test the limits of simulation technology and the capabilities of the K computer.\u201d ",

AI might become a threat, when misused by some group of people (like a government) with selfish interests. Self-replicating nano-technology could get out of control if we can\u2019t control the growth. ",
