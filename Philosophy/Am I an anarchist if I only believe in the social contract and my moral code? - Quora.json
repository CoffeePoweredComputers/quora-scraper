            "answer_text": "No. Anarchists are highly critical of social contract theories and anarchism is agnostic about meta-ethical theories. What makes a person an anarchist is if one believes in the abolition of all external government (including in the firm, in the family, in public life, etc), a transition from legal order to anarchic order -- a society in which all collective matters are self-managed through mutual agreement by those involved in the institutions, and where all hierarchy and authority have been abolished in way of horizontal social relations. Anarchism doesn't describe the position in your question. ",
