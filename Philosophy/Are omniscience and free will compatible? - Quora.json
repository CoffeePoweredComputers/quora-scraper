            "answer_text": " Absolutely. You have free will. For our purposes here, let\u2019s assume I am omniscient. I know what you are going to do tomorrow, the next day, and the next, and so on. You may not know what you will be doing two days from now, but I know you are going to choose to answer a call you receive from a strange number. I know you are going to be pleased that it turns out to be an old friend. And I know that when you make arrangements to meet for lunch, you are going to choose this restaurant over that restaurant. You still have free will. My knowing it does nothing to affect your decision. Let\u2019s suppose that you chose not to answer that call. I would have simply known that instead. Now, some believe that if it is God\u2019s omniscience we\u2019re talking about that can throw a wrinkle into the whole business, but I disagree. Theologians and philosophers have been debating this for thousands of years. God cannot know anything that is not true. So if God knows that a certain thing is going to happen, then it cannot happen any other way. So in one sense, it is predestined by God to occur in exactly that way. Once He knows it, it cannot be otherwise. However, we can also be sure that free will exists. I believe we would all agree that love exists, and free will is absolutely necessary for love to exist. God\u2019s desire is that we love Him as He loves us. That has to be a free choice. As paradoxical as it sounds, no one can come to truly love God without the absolute freedom to reject Him. I talk about that briefly here. So how do we reconcile the two? Easy. I am in the camp of people that believe it makes no difference that God knows what you will do. He simply knows it will occur this way or that. You cannot change your mind and surprise God. He already knew you\u2019d change your mind. Remember, it is foreknowledge; He knows it ahead of time. His knowing doesn\u2019t determine what you are going to do. He only knows that you are going to do this thing or that thing. I may know my son is going to choose this dessert over that dessert. But do I really know it? No, I don\u2019t. I know my son as in I am familiar with him, his tastes, his preferences, and his habits. But do I really know which he is going to choose, or do I just have a statistically good chance that I am going to be right? It is the latter. I actually could be wrong. That is not the sense in which God knows some future event. He knows with the certainty of Someone who has actually already witnessed the event take place because that is exactly what has happened. God knows everything you and I are going to do. From His perspective we have already done them. There is zero chance that anything will occur differently than He has already seen it take place. But God\u2019s knowing that I will choose door #3 over door #1 or door #2 doesn\u2019t make me choose door #3; He just knows that\u2019s what I am going to freely choose to do because He has already seen me do it before I even did it.

            "answer_text": "Are omniscience and free will compatible? Depending on how you define omniscience\u2026 knowing all even things that will happen\u2026 no. There is no free will. There may be the illusion of free will.. But if an entity knows what you are going to do, before you do it\u2026 there is no option of changing your mind the end is already determined. Re watch a movie\u2026 the characters in the movie will do certain things, they cannot change their mind - but within the movie - they have \u2018free will\u2019 but to the outside observer\u2026 they don\u2019t. they are on rails. Each time you watch the movie, everything is the same. ",

No. If there\u2019s an all knowing god who knows what we will do in the future it\u2019s impossible we can do anything other than what God foresees. But it\u2019s even worse than that: if God made everything (did he?) everything is as the creator decreed including your will so how can it possibly be free considering God made it as it is? The only way we can have free will is if there is no god. ",

            "answer_text": "Exhaustive definite foreknowledge is not logically possible with libertarian free will. Compatibilism/middle knowledge end up being deterministic in the end. It is a wrong assumption/conclusion to say that if free will exists, then God cannot be omniscient or cannot exist Himself. We can reject a wrong view of God's omniscience without denying omniscience or God's existence (hence Open Theism/dynamic vs static omniscience; future consisting of possibilities and known as such).

The original use of the free will was still free will. You\u2019re also still seeing free will. It\u2019s just recorded free will.  The analogy to Biff in Back to the Future II still holds as well. The sports stars were still making choices out of free will. ",
