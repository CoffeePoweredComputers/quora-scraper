            "answer_text": "A school of thinking as not necessarily rules, and the stoicism is surely the first of these no-rule school. Of course, you can find a principle, which rather consists in a semi-question - semi-affirmation: Vanity of the vanities, which is the pursuit of the wind.That means that, since we do not know ultimately why we are doing what we do, knowing that our trace will disappear soon or late on the Earth, what we commonly consider as objective or goals, are, with some distance not really that. That may lead to consider other kinds of objectives, as the earthly life being a test for beyond purpose. This way, many stoicists let a place for God, which should obviously - if He exists - constitute a criterium (or the other), as a judgement of what is good or bad, or clever or silly, or wise or crazy, and hence, their purpose is to come the nearest possible to such a discovery. While Socrate with his maieutics was mainly an interrogation to people, from general to particular, to let them discover by themselves - so with the least possible constraints or human norms - who they were or what was their (current/main) purpose (in life), the stoics on their side mainly apply such questioning to themselves, as far as individuals can help themselves better than the others. And as a matter of illustration, when, in the Bible book Ecclesiastes, the wise man begins to wonder why he is doing what he does, to let nothing on the Earth or to his descendance, is the typical questioning of a stoic. In a similar way, the stoicism in the common language began to describe a person who is courageous in the adversity (of such questions). ",
