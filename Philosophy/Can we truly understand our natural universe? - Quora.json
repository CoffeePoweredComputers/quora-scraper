            "answer_text": "There are many ways to answer the question. On the most basic level yes we can understand the universe, it's just a matter of how deep you want to go. We understand everyday physics, as well as a great deal of relativistic and quantum physics, plus chemistry, biology, etc. This allows us to make meaningful predictions. That is probably what Hawking means.  Probably the best evidence that we understand the universe is our ability to create technology. If we didn't understand on some level, either we wouldn't be able to create it at all, or our technology wouldn't work. Even making a stone tool requires rudimentary understanding of the universe. What is also clear is that we can refine our understanding of the universe through science. Further observation and experimentation allows us to understand the universe better all the time.  On the other hand, we don't yet (and possibly can't ever) completely understand the universe. At that point this becomes a philosophical debate. One interesting bit from that debate is Immanuel Kant's concept of the \"thing in itself\" contrasted with the \"thing as we observe it\". Kant said that the \"thing in itself\" can never be known, only the \"thing as we observe it\". We may be able to observe things better and better (through electron microscopes, spectroscopy, telescopes, and other scientific instruments) but none of those things allows us to access the \"thing in itself\". This lines up well with science, in that we always seem able to create better theories with further experimentation, in other words, science is never \"finished\". As for the second question, I think all we can say is we are unique among earth's species in our level of technology. Whether that makes us special is open to debate. Side note: I just read Tom Drauschak's answer - it seems to me the statement that \"recent evidence suggests we create our natural universe instead of the reverse\" is a result of a (very common) misunderstanding of quantum physics. It is true that every quantum system exists as a probability distribution (wavefunction) which collapses into a well-defined state when \"observed\". This only implies another quantum system interacting with it, not a conscious observer. After all we can't actually observe quantum phenomena directly - we need some kind of instrument to do so. This does not mean that the world doesn't exist apart from us, or that we create it! It's just that the world as we know it is very dependent on our senses and intuitions which can be deceptive when thinking about the quantum realm. ",

I don\u2019t know how high or low your \u201cbar\u201d is for \u201ctruly understanding\u201d anything, but if humans have truly understood anything, there\u2019s a good chance we can truly understand the natural universe. Not sure what you mean here by \u201cnatural\u201d, as opposed to what, supernatural, or unnatural? In any case, yes, we know that everything in existence is the result of the action of one or more of the four fundamental forces of nature. An atom expresses all four forces, interacting. So we do understand at a very deep level, about the universe, what it is made of. Four fundamental forces which interact to generate fields which in turn interact to generate all phenomena. I think we\u2019re well on our way to that understanding you seem to be asking about. ",

That makes us special! We have the ability to think. The ability to question. \"Why?\" - that is what making us do what we are doing! Q: Can we truly understand universe?  A: Can't we? This is what driving us to explore more and more. It is more difficult to document what one has understood, than understanding itself! So, we have not mastered \"communication\" that we found for helping ourselves! My question is, why do we need to understand it? Are we going to change anything? Why are we not able to live like every other living being (just do the duty)? ",

With that in mind, may I present to you the following illustration:   Now, with that said you can see how staggeringly complex existence itself can really get! It is an entirely reasonable idea that the answers to everything are beyond our mind's ability to comprehend, given the fact that understanding all of existence has not benefited our survival. This, of course, means that natural selection wouldn't have been pushed to evolve us with the mental prowess that may be needed for this understanding. ",
