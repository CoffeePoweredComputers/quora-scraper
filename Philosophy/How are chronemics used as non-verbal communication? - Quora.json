            "answer_text": "Chronemics is the study of how time is used in communication. Time can be used as a communication tool in many ways, from punctuality to expectations around waiting and response time, to general principles around time management. Chronemics has become an area of study primarily for anthropologists, who look at cultural norms around the use of time, and the way cultures can vary and converge around different norms. More recently, chronemics appears to be branching out into other disciplines, such as the more business oriented study of organizational behavior. Chronemics in Communication Time is an important non-verbal cue that factors heavily into communication, particularly in the world of business. A number of studies have been conducted on the chronemics of technology communication within business. For example, studies have taken large amounts of aggregated email data from big companies and analyzed both the level of response and response times and of individual entities. These studies have shown that the organizational structure can be very accurately predicted by creating a hierarchy of responsiveness, placing most responsive entities at the bottom of the organization, and least responsive entities at the top. The predictive power of these chronemic models could be used in designing future communication technology to account for the expected responsiveness of people that are communicating, based on their position in an organization.
