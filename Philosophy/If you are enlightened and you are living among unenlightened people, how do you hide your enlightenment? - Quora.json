            "answer_text": "Being enlightened doesn't mean that a golden light appears above your head. People don't magically feel peace and love in the casual presence of most enlightened beings. The greeter at your local Walmart could be enlightened and you wouldn't know it. Only when it is the role you play in this life do others feel peace in your presence spontaneously. A guru plays that role, some great teachers play that role, but the average enlightened being lives amongst us, unheralded and unknown. So the real problem isn't hiding something from someone else, but coming to an understanding that you don't have to tell everyone of your supreme knowledge. After you have studied calculus and have gain a true understanding of it, is there any point to telling the world that you are a calculus master? Calculus explains the physical world, so you may feel it important to let everyone know that you can now explain why things move the way they do. You may believe that your knowledge will now help those around you to live a better life, and give them all hope that one day they too can come to know calculus as you do. But is this understanding you have gained really useful for others, even as they live and play in a world of motion which you now know how to explain? In most cases it is not. The realization you have of the power of calculus in life is useful when building a bridge or a rocket, and it should be displayed and used in those situations. The same can be said of the knowledge of your true nature. When you reach the true understanding of the subject, which has been given the fancy label of enlightenment, you may believe others will benefit from your knowledge. You may believe that just the fact that you have succeeded is worth sharing to give others hope, but the truth is the understanding you now have can be used by others only when they feel the need. Shoving any type of knowledge down anyone's throat is never helpful. Telling everyone that you know calculus only makes the ego feel better. Telling everyone you are enlightened is also only an ego booster, and if the ego needs a boost, the understanding you believe you have reached is still unattained. Before enlightenment we are all people misunderstanding reality. After enlightenment there is an understanding that there are no people, and the only difference between any of us is that simple understanding. Seen like this, there really is nothing to hide. ",

            "answer_text": "The one who hides his so called enlightenment or boasts about it is actually not enlightened. There is no need of hiding own enlightenment. No harm occurs through it. Others will take advantage of it for own enlightenment only if God so desires i.e. if their time for it has arrived. This is God\u2019s design and we should not interfere in it. Since they are very very few, actually nothing substantial happens if others know that someone is enlightened. However, God has a clear design for the personality improvement and spiritual improvement of all those who live near an enlightened person. There is a mention about it in the explanation (H) for Revelation 1 of the new path to God whose Revelations are available in link-3 in my profile. Explanations (A) & (H) for Rev. 1 are quoted below :: \u2014QUOTE\u2014 Revelation 1\u2014\"We come and go in big teams\" \u2014A)\u2014God has created this universe and us and all other living and non living things here to run His great drama for His entertainment, as per His script. Each one of us is a different soul with a different body, none duplicate of another. Further explanation will be found in Rev. 20 but it is informed that the soul, in its total max. journey of 100,000 years, gets human body for the last 35,000 yers. After these 35,000 years or earlier, the body/soul meets God in the end and then the soul, which was produced by God from His persona, goes back and merges in God and thus finally losing its separate identity. A person becomes very spiritual 3 births before this merger in God. This great drama has several plays. Each play has a team of 15\u201320,000 persons and we meet each other birth after birth to play His drama. Roles may change from birth to birth. Very few, less than 5 go away and same numbers join in the next birth. Therefore, do not break relations unless the same is very painful because God has created the relation for some purpose. \u2014-H)\u2014Among 15\u201320,000 persons of our team, God keeps few who rise high spiritually. It is for the good of all team members. We should always be on the look out of these persons and try to take out some time to spend with them with whatever fast frequency we can do, like once monthly. If it is not possible, this may be done at least once every year. In case this is also not possible then try it through telephone or video chatting. It is not necessary that spiritual matters only should be discussed. Any matter will do. What matters is nearness. \u2014UNQUOTE\u2014 My Best Wishes. ",
