            "answer_text": "The human problem is brain dualism not a new concept but now clear as the left logical/positive brain and the faulty right anxious/negative brain, the mind is our consciousness/awareness interacting with the brain generating cognition dependant on which brain area is stimulated. EGMi maximises left brain use we become non-dual with maximised goodness, my mind, body and soul the source energy are in balance and harmony my right brain is like a faulty appendage I do not use. Religion was close on a few things dualism was one, and it is increased left brain IQ and right brain emotion that causes sin not knowledge itself, its up to us now choose a side left brain or right brain, utopia or hell on earth.

They are not, in that sense, the same. Although it is the same \u2018us\u2019, we are an embodied soul \u2013 a body-mind complex energized by a soul. But what really affects our life is realizing that we are the Divine Soul \u2013 that is what truly affects our life, transforms it and makes us liberated with bliss and joy, eliminating misery and sorrow.
