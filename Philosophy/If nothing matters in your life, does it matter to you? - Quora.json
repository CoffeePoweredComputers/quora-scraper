I am tired of being baited and lied to. I trust 1 person now that is= ? Anywho\u2026. If if nothing mattered to me, i wouldnt be depressed as the chaos that was caused and the noisy environment i am in when im an introvert. The theives who stole all my cash, but never replaced what they took. The lie told to me to go home and wait for 1 of my children was \u2026\u2026.? Nevermind, anyway \u201cNothing else matters\u201d, by Metallica. Idgaf RT now, when my other name in India means a GOD for good deeds and injustice. And a great many injustices have been committed, and i wont stand for it. Y do people think they can f*** with ure life, and i have the gifts i have and they think the ish is funny n they will get away with lying, turning my extreme kindness into cruelty reveresed back at me. All they are doing is making a________ person what to etc and yada and uh huh. IDGAF ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I'd say that even if nothing matters to you, it might still matter to someone else. So if you are asking if your life has any meaning if nothing matters to you, then no, it does not. Because if your life were to end, you would not care. Because you don't care about what other people think, or at least it doesn't matter to you. But if how other people feel about you matters, then life does matter, even if it's just to make those other people happy. If you have hit the \u201cf*** it\u201d point, and you literally care about nothing in this world, then no, you life does not matter. That's my view. Also, don't judge too harshly, this is my first answer I've ever given to any question on here. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s paradox! If nothing really matters to someone in life, then the assertion of *whether does it matter to him/her* must not matter too. If not, then his/her entrenched belief of nothing significant to him/her, is faulty and full of delusion. It can be categorized as a typical case of escapism, in that case. For example, someone isn't bothered what different flavours of chocolates taste like, but deep down in his mind, he is concerned why he doesn\u2019t own a box of chocolates!  ",

There is a saying in Hindi,\" Manzil tak pahuchna to aasan hai, Manzil tak pahuchne ka raasta zaruri tha\" Which means, \" Destination is not that important, what matters most is the way you choose to reach it\". So, when nothing matters, what does matters is why it mattered. ",
