            "answer_text": "Since no one is nothing, I think this answers your question. I considered suicide at 18 (I\u2019m 71 now), I know what losing hope is about. But I never thought I was nothing. I was just sure that no one cared about me and was tired of trying to get that to change. Maybe some people get convinced (by others) that they are worthless (though i never did). But parents can do that to their child, I know. But most often they have a friend or other adult that thinks they are worthwhile. So it becomes a mental/spiritual battle inside them as to which view wins out. Sometimes they can be helped, other times not. Overly critical parents and lck of encouragement can be the cause. My dad was that way but my mom was not so I got through that process, thankfully. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not nothing, and this question seems rather hurtful and should be reviewed as I don\u2019t think it follows the policy here. How I live with myself, is that I know who I am and what I have been through, and how badly it hurt. My life has been such shit, that I know there must either be some really really good times coming soon, or death or something. I live with myself because I have found both self-love and God even though I was brought to the floor crying to be forced to turn inwards. I have put in such amazing work to change myself, and I am putting in more and more each day. ",

And if you really are a terrible person (ugly and mean) WORK TO CHANGE it. Volunteer somewhere (soup kitchen, hospital, old age home). There are always other people who feel they are nothing, and a kindness given to them (by you) will make you realise you are something. Sometimes you have to GIVE in order to GET/ ",
