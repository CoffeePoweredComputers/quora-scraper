Once you finally need the tool, you can\u2019t find it.If a tiny screw or part falls on the carpet floor, it\u2019s gone forever.LAW OF BINGO (This happened to me in school): If you are playing a game of bingo in a group and lose every time, then trade bingo cards with another person in the group, the person who has the card you had last is the one that wins.Only once you get home from grocery shopping, you find that you need that one other grocery you couldn\u2019t think of beforehand.One allen wrench is too small while the next size up is too big.Looking for a schematic online for a specific product? You\u2019ll find everything else but the one you\u2019re looking for, or the one you\u2019re looking for will cost money to download.When you need to get ahold of someone the most, they will not answer the phone.A bed is always more comfortable in the morning when you have to get up than it is the night before.Here is one that really makes me mad, as it has happened to me for real more than once recently: The earlier you need to get up in the morning (we\u2019re talking about really early times, like 12:00 AM, 2:45 AM, etc), the more likely your body will refuse to fall asleep in the first place. You\u2019ll just lay there in bed waiting to fall asleep, knowing that there is little time with sleep being so important.Useful, perfectly good stuff always gets thrown away.",
