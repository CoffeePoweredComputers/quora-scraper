Ma Karma Phala Hetur Bhurmatey Sangostva Akarmani(Do not let the fruit be the purpose of your actions, and therefore you won\u2019t be attached to not doing your duty.) So, Make honest efforts with all your will and soul and plan that out beforehand.Leave the results on the fate. ",

            "answer_text": "When we have opportunity to create a better tomorrow, why shouldn't  we plan? its true many successful people have found their career interest accidentally but i believe their was always a thirst in them to explore things beyond the limit that one creates. When you know what you want , you have to go get it. so i would say planning makes it efficient and easy accessibility. ",
