            "answer_text": "Keep in mind this notion of the collective unconscious is a Jungian theoretical idea that seems to relate to certain common human experiences. The collective conscious as far as I can ascertain relates to a language communities\u2019 traditions, values and mores, their legal systems and social ethical/moral norms, most of which, though shared in a language community/culture is implicit, that is simply taken for granted. These are known but function at a level that influences attitudes, biases and prejudices and actions. And shared by whole or parts of a given society (it may split into socio-economic strata or have variances among migrants and isolated social groups; ethnic nationals, cults, religious groups). These norms are assumed to be the way the world is everywhere. Needless to say this is not the case as can be witnessed by travel to a foreign country where the collective conscious can be markedly different. It is the stuff everyone knows and hardly anyone questions. It is \u2018just the way we are\u2019. New migrants are usually expected to adhere to a cultures norms and values, usually within about three generations. The collective unconscious relates to universal symbols that arise in all cultures, and that manifest in a variety of ways. Such things as religious practices, burial of the dead, marriage ceremonies, ritual acts of transmission of boys and girls to adulthood. In all societies these are celebrated in various ways. Jung asserted all these rituals and ceremonial variants derive from common symbolic archaic psychic forces unique to the human race. The collective consciousness is an aspect of all societies and cultures, members are indoctrinated into its norms from childhood via traditions. The collective unconscious expresses itself in ritual and ceremonial behaviours, that are expressed differently in each society .They are not learned but aspects of the human psyche requiring expression, and these are expressed and manifest in various ritualised forms.

            "answer_text": "The collective unconscious unites all of humanity and unconsciously transforms our civilization into a single body. The development of human society has gradually reached a blind alley, and a process of withdrawal and degeneration has begun. In general, a new stage in the development of society happens on a more instinctive and unconscious level during revolutions and crises. This is because the higher force that drives humanity toward development is beyond our reach\u2014it is nature\u2019s force of love and bestowal above our individual perceptions and sensations, and from us to that force\u2014there has been the power of the collective unconscious. The world is tired of despicable and alienated attitudes. In a time of turmoil, a dead end, or crisis, a powerful force always arrives and, which through suffering, forces humanity to take a step forward into the unknown. In our era, after the transition to the new situation, the collective unconscious will be replaced by a collective consciousness that strives and aims toward resembling nature\u2019s force of love and bestowal, which is the higher level.
