            "answer_text": "Until the late twentieth century \u2018introspection\u2019 was a psychological notion. Philosophers rejected psychology as an infringement on their \u2018pure\u2019 attempts to rationalistically determine the nature of reality (ontology), and knowledge (epistemology), metaphysics, both idealistic and realistic philosophy predominated as well as European phenomenology all were practised independently of empirical scientific findings (empirical \u2018facts\u2019). However science, especially neuroscience and psychology in the late twentieth century established findings that found many philosophers willing to recognise that certain findings are consequential on their practice of philosophical reflection. Benjamin Libet\u2019s work on consciousness and decision making established that determinations as to how to act are made prior to any conscious decision, and hence all explanations as to why one \u2018chose\u2019 to act are justifications after the fact. He established that decisions occurred microseconds prior to any conscious determination to act prior to any conscious intervention. Peer reviews of Libet\u2019s research have found even longer time spans between decision making and our general belief in free will. The notion of free will is that we consciously decide how to intentionally decide to act. We are, on one reading of the findings Dispositionally determined as to how we act. Dispositions are genetically and composed of heritable characteristics and are essentially subconscious or even unconscious evaluative psychic determinates that makes us the person we each are and will essentially remain throughout our lives. Introspection was studied in early attempts to try to understand how the mind functions. It was essentially a conviction that by reflecting on one\u2019s thoughts and psychic processes one could learn about how the mind works. Because of its subjective nature it soon lost relevance in psychological studies due to the difficulty of confirming subjective interpretations as scientifically factual empirical material, but it did influence the European philosophical school known as phenomenology. To my understanding philosophers had little interest in introspection per se, although they used it in their reflections and considerations as they held that reality could only be known via the mind, and as such it was the only valid approach to understanding. Now in the 21st century many philosophers take into consideration such factors as Libet\u2019s findings as relevant and not to be rejected out of hand. And such findings undermine the notion of free will and the notion that all we know is available by conscious reflection, it also undermines the notion that consciousness is the basis of decision making rather than dispositional subconscious or even unconscious factors.
