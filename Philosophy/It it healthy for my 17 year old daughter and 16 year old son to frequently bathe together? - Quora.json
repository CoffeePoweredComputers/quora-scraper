            "answer_text": "Depends on your culture. In the U.S., cultures differ on sex, the body and nudity. Some cultures will have no tolerance for siblings being nude together in any situation. Other cultures are cool with it. Psychologically, the Westermarck Effect will numb all sexual urges between siblings that have lived together for the first few years of their lives. Your kids are not sensitive to any sexual attraction between them, and will be adverse to any encouragement to have anything to do with each other sexually. That is independent of culture; there is no liberal community that is able to overcome that effect. Your son and daughter have a close relationship, and considering their ages, it is now inappropriate for you to have an opinion about them bathing together. If you are worried they are having a sexual relationship, sit down with them, share your concerns, and ask them to swear to you, their behavior is not sexual. Ask them to convince you, on their terms, not yours, they are not having sex. And what ever they do to convince you, accept it stoically, and show them the respect they deserve by not calling them incest perverts, implying it, or forcing them to change their behavior because of your own fears.

            "answer_text": "Healthy? I would say that as long as they are both okay with it and respectful of each other then it\u2019s okay. Being so close in age means they probably have a very strong bond and have done everything together since they were very young. They are probably best friends and maybe do very many things together, so bathing together just comes naturally to them. If you have suspicions of them doing anything sexual you should inquire very discreetly. And if your suspicions are confirmed you should put a stop to it immediately and make them bathe separately, even if they don\u2019t want to. I hope this helps. ",
