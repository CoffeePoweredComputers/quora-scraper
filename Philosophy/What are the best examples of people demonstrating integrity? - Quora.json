            "answer_text": "A pilot told me this incident. We were just having a chit chat on general topics. That day I was staying with my friend in an Air force colony. And this pilot was the roommate of my friend who was also in Air force. I was asking about his experiences about flying when he told me about a recent incident that happened to a senior pilot in the base.  http://pafsqk.blogspot.ae/2010/01/current-aircraft-t37-trainer-sherdils.html He told that senior pilot was on a routine training flight with his student who was new to this kind of training. They were flying an old T-37 trainer jet. This trainer jet doesn\u2019t have a modern rocket propelled ejection system. And its ejection is highly complicated. When a pilot ejects he has to bear G-forces and has to withstand wind-blasts. Sometimes ejection system could fail and sometimes short time do not allow to carry out successful ejection. Senior pilot shouted eject. This was highly unexpected for the student pilot so he was shocked. A technical fault had occurred in the aircraft and student pilot was not aware of it being a beginner. Anxiety ensnared student pilot and he got faint. In Air force it is a code of practice that senior pilot cannot eject unless he successfully ejects his junior pilot. In seconds decision had to be made. Senior pilot decided to first eject the student pilot. That T-37 had hand grips on the both sides of the seat in which triggers were installed. In his struggle to pull those triggers of his student\u2019s seat, the seat ejected with a huge force which cut his arm. But his duty was to save the life of his student first. He successfully did! Senior pilot was cognizant of the consequences but he didn\u2019t fear. Unfortunately, he consumed all the time he had and couldn\u2019t eject his own seat. So he lost his own life. In aircraft you have only seconds to decide. Here only your strong character and training helps you because you are in a grip of harsh conditions and fear of death. Overcoming this fear and so taking actions is the work of men of integrity. ",

            "answer_text": " Pavlosk Agricultural Station: the future of humanity is secured in places like this. Imagine that you are really hungry and surrounded by food but you can't eat it because you are determined to save it- not for yourself but for the future of human race. Sounds cheesy? But please bear with me. Now imagine that you are starving to death locked up with all that food. What would you do? Would you eat it or would you rather die? During the siege of Stalingrad in World War II scientists of Pavlosk Agricultural Station had somehow managed to transport the seed varieties stored in their vaults to another location in the city to save them from falling into German hands. Unfortunately though, the Russian supply lines to that part of the city had been cut and the city along with those scientists were starving. But the thing is that they were starving surrounded all around by food. Seed banks are vital in securing the genetic diversity of crops. Without them it would be nearly impossible to maintain food security in this world. The scientists knew this and they knew that 90% of the seeds stored there were not found in any other gene-bank. Those scientists starved for over a month and 12 of them eventually died but they did not eat from the large collection of edible seeds that they were supposed to protect. I think this is one of the greatest stories of human integrity I have ever heard. ",
