            "answer_text": "That depends on what interests you. Here's a list of some of the ones (I have included some information about some applications as well) which I frequent: 1. Generic knowledge: Quora, StumbleUpon (as enumerated already by Kashyap Bhansali),  Listverse et al. 2. News: Google News, The Hindu, Times of India, The Indian Express (the latter three only in case if you happen to be an Indian and/ or are simply interested in what goes on in this amazing country of mine) et al. 3. Science and Technology: Discovery News, Phys.org, Livescience et al. 4. Related to Gadgets, latest technologies, and/ or Computer Sciences in general: GeekWire, InfoQ, DZone, PCWorld, Hacker News et al. Two amazing applications, which do not seem to have their web  application analogues come to mind: Converge, which I am afraid is only  on the Windows Phone store the last time I checked, and GeekByte. 5. Literature reading and writing: Longform, The Browser, The Daily WTF, StraightDope, Medium et al. You  might also consider searching for the corresponding applications for  the above mentioned resources. I spend as less time as possible on my  smartphone, so it makes sense for me to browse these websites on my  laptop. One afternote: Try using Flipboard if you don't already. This application fetches the news related to your interest(s) from around the internet and presents them in a very beautifully readable format. One more afternote. I recently came across (well, my good friend Ms. Nandita Shastry was gracious enough to bring it to my notice) QuizUp, which is, at least according to me, one of the most exhilarating and knowledge imparting games out there. Try it out if you haven't. I assure you, you won't be disappointed. And as of now, the web application has also been rolled out to the public. Hope I could help. ",
