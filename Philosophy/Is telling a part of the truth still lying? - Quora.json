            "answer_text": "One is always telling only part of the truth: we don\u2019t describe the wave equation for everything that goes on. What is critical is to make the explanaton as simple as possible but no simpler. Alternatively perhaps to tell all the truth so that the other person can establish an adequate understanding of the issue at hand. One way I do this is with the verbal artifice \u201cI am actually lying, but the parts I am lying about are not germane to this conversation\u201d. Let\u2019s make it concret. You hit another stopped vehicle. You can say: I hit the other stopped vehicle. You can say: I got. Up this morning , forgot to have my cup of coffee, locked myself out of the car, used my smartphone app to open it, had to adjust the seat, and as I was driving I hit s stopped vehicle. The first is only telling part of the truth. The second may be the full truth, but most of it is immaterial. Now if you say you didn\u2019t hit the stopped vehicle \u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on a situation but yes, it is. For example if you tell that you drank 2 glasses of alcohol, when you actually drank 5 it is a lie. A lot of people might think that telling a part of the truth, (while everything else is a lie) they think it softens what they did. But lie is still a lie if you don't tell what actually happened. ",
