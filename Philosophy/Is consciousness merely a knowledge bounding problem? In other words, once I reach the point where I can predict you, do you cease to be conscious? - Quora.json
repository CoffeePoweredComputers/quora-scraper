            "answer_text": "Fascinating question. Let's assume consciousness is an externally defined phenomenon. In this case being able to model a phenomenon such that i can predict it's behavior would mean that that i have fully reduced the phenomenon to it's constituant factors. And as such the the phenomenon itself would just be an artefact of a lack of understanding. Let's assume consciousness is an internally defined phenomenon. In this case I have no access to any kind of external validation of consciousness existing except inside the phenomenon in which i am encountering these questions. If i can appreciate the complexity of processes that would need to be experienced in order to predict the actions of one of these apperently conscious apparitions Inside my phenomenon of consciousness, i have evidently duplicated the subjective experience. And at least inside my own conscious experience you can be said to exist. Let's assume consciousness is an inherent fundamental property of reality. (Read David Pearce) This means that any model must include the full quantum chromodynamical dynamic of you and your relationship to the rest of the universe. Given the necessity of a non-dual Experience of this reality as governed by godel's incompleteness theorem, a perfect model Of someone's experience and actions cannot be reduced to it's contributing components. This model must be therefore an maximally entangled version of the original copy. This isomorphic relationship Opens the door to a fundamental identity crisis. Quantum mechanically speaking copy and original are no longer unambiguously identifyable. Either that means that there are now two identical (yet opposite?) experiemces of reality or both physical models are manifestation of the same Singular underlying conscious experience expressed through an apparent symmetry breaking. I don't know. What do you think? Let us know. ",

            "answer_text": "Aaaarrrgggg. In the world, people think that snuffing out others (and this is even done on a mass scale - it\u2019s called genocide) will remove their being\u2019ness and troublesome\u2019ness. Note, I\u2019m not referring to supra-whatever in terms of being. Rather, it has to do with energy, residuals, etc. Or, an epi-natural situational affair that has been, to date, ignored due to western unenlightenment. So, what is the other side of \u2018snuff\u2019 that we see? Trying to understand, cope, and allow some semblance of society/system to fruit. Why say this? AI (and science of consciousness) ought to have an ethical core (yes, even academia can do this). As ought science, too. Okay, people ought to think of themselves in this context. We have a core which we can know, somewhat (never entirely, that\u2019s the fantasy of materialism). I call it the \u2018I am that I am\u2019 (somewhat tongue in cheek). Now, as we have seen, some people get so hung in themselves and their little psychether interactions that they become one (within themselves) and are all-controlling (hence, one might say, the beliefs in omnipotency). To me, it\u2019s getting hung in being the reverse of idempotent, however that a whole other matter to discuss. Now, at its extreme, taking this attitude to the public would, no doubt, get types of reactions (to many to describe), such as the padded cell if taken too far. So, yes, people can get to where they think that they predict. After all, priorly, it was an internal phantasm. Now, with computer-aided mathematical flimflam, we have AI running after what data scientists would like to do but cannot. Yet, there are limits. We can describe these. But the future is not a replay of the past, even though we see the sun moving around the world\u2019s view (\u2026 caught ya!). Views go along with energy\u2019s manifestation. Knowingness is not overbearing (super-positioned\u2019ness). Rather, it is embracing (some like to use comprehensive). Oh yes, the cease to exist. Some have thought that they (in altered states) could merge themselves with something that was passing by (say, a car moving along a road). Oh yes, think how that experiment/experience ended. We will get to where we are sensitive to the nuances of being even in matter. As in, what might we discern where we are versus across the iron maiden\u2019s interior as different. Silly? No more than what we see with silly valley. Think of it. World dominance, supposedly. ",
