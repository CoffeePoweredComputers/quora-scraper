            "answer_text": "depend on where your interests lay , if you are logical and can convey it using the right choice of words effectively , you should study law . On the contrary if you are a dreamer and would love to cook up a story or you enjoy a story when its told , Are you the one who get that wow feeling when you read a romantic poem , ??? Try literature , . Knowing your interests helps in making that choice . Literature is as important as law and A good poet gets to be more famous than a amazing lawyer. and a successfull novelist makes great money too . So dont listen to what others tell you . MAKE that choice based on what you like the most. ",
