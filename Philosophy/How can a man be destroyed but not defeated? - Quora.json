            "answer_text": "Okay, so Frieza was destroyed right? But not defeated because he was able to come back. Say you used the Dragon balls to wish someone out of existence so that way they never existed. Note:You just wished someone out of existence so that they never existed, but you did not specify the wish so that way no body would remember of that persons existence. So technically you will remember they exist and can come back any time from say for example from somebody's memory. Because someone remembers that person that was wished out of existence that person technically still exists and therefore you should have specified that not only would that person not exist anymore, but nobody would remember of that persons existence either. But if you mean time travel related man being destroyed, then that is a complete whole nother story all together. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, destroyed and defeated, those words may come with different interpretation. But the thing is, destroyed\u2014how I perceive it is that it is a physical state in which an object is damaged and wrecked completely; or a body, if we\u2019re talking about human. But defeat, it means so much more. It can be psychological. So, unless a man is destroyed mentally, with his spirit and idea and thought and everything\u2014if he\u2019s only physically destroyed, but he stood firm for everything he believed in, then he\u2019s not defeated. Heck, you can kill a man. But if you can\u2019t kill his spirit, he\u2019s not defeated, he\u2019s won even. Though you also won, technically\u2014but, if you\u2019re in the wrong, then you\u2019re the one who lost, albeit being the one who kills. ",

            "answer_text": "In the phrase: \u201cA man can be destroyed but never defeated\" Man = determined man The Man is not a person but a state of being, something that can not be misunderstood. And destroyed means not literally destroyed, but being a poor state, either physically, mentally, financially\u2026 Never defeated means that He will always thrive to move forward. The phrase translates to: \u201cA man that stays determined can be destroyed but will move forward\u201d Which logically speaking makes 100% sense. ",
