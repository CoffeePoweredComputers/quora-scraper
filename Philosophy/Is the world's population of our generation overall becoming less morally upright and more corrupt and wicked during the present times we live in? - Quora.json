            "answer_text": "Is the world's population of our generation overall becoming less morally upright and more corrupt and wicked during the present times we live in? Humanity has been held hostage by a group that upholds a globalist ideology. When I say globalist ideology, literally there is a group of people who descended from the Roman empire and by race, they still are Romans but chose to hide their true identities for whatever reason. Today we seldom or no longer hear the name Roman spoken and many might not even recognize their existence except people who read their Bibles. But, these people are very much alive and they still continue to hold power and authority over all of mankind. These people have so much influence around the world that they can make you the person they wanted you to be in a manner it pleases and advances their own will. Worse, they can make you believe a kind of reality that never is, never was, and never will be true, but the way they impose their influence creates delusional human beings and collectively, a delusional world. And yes, although it started way before the age of exploration when they went out into the world and started manipulating the brains of people and how they view the world, like when they held control over the Arabian peninsula and from there they started to rename the territories in a manner that causes people to think IRAQ was really IRAQ in the ancient and that Egypt is what it is today and that the STATE OF ISRAEL is biblical Israel although it is not. Thus, making everyone to believe that the community or the CHRISTIANITY which is a cult that was created by the Romans has now the moral upper hand over those who are not. And while it is a fact that it was the Romans through Constantine who made an effort to cause the creation of this cult, but by whatever skill these Romans have, they can easily make people believe that a human being born in 4 BC was the force that led to the creation of this cult. And using the Bible as their reference, unfortunately, the word \u201cBIBLE\u201d is upheld to support their claim, but that is all that there is because, until this very day, all that they speak about are not found in the Bible. In fact, the knowledge revealed in the Bible disagrees with whatever they say is the Words of God because it's not the Words of God that they speak, but rather, their own views and interpretation on whichever verse they find pleasing to their ears. But with the essence of the thoughts of God that He Himself wishes to impart is totally ignored. Thus, many might find my statement offensive, but what I said is a fact and supported by actual events and not a result of my own religious views which I don\u2019t have. I renounced my religious faith long ago, but I am not an Atheist. I value faith according to the truth revealed for in the Bible, but I don\u2019t align myself with the morals and righteousness that beholden the ideology of CHRISTIANITY considering its very foundation is founded based on a perverted version of the Bible which the Romans themselves authored. The same perverted version which they enforced into people to believe and live with and to say whether this generation is \u201cLESS MORALLY UPRIGHT and MORE CORRUPT and WICKED\u201d is not a surprise because this is the result of what these Romans did to humanity.  The humanity that says they are saved by whom? By the mascot marketed by religion? They say they believe the Bible is the Words of God, but ask them whether or not the Bible should be taken literally and many says they don't actually know-how. If so, what words they say they believe when they don't know how to find the right understanding? Those who say they literally interpret the Bible, does the Bible say it should be literally interpreted and taken as historical fact? Unfortunately, they don't know the answer. What does this mean then? Matthew 7 15\u201cWatch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. 16By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? 17Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 18A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. 19Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 20Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them. By their fruit have you not recognize them? ",
