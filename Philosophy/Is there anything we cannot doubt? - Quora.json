            "answer_text": "No, anything and everything can be doubted. You've very existence can be doubted as well as your death. Some scientist believe that all of existence is a simulation being run by a much more highly advanced society. The fact that everything in our universe including time is broken up into very small pieces called plank length leads some to believe our existence maybe artifically rendered, meaning you are not really alive, and cannot really die, because you are in fact part of an advanced computer simulation. Everything can be doubted. Whether or not there is any benefit to that doubt is another question entirely. Edit* There are people who doubt the earth is round. There are people who doubt we landed on the moon. There are people who doubt the great Barrier reef is in danger. There are people who doubt carbon emissions from modern industry are harmful to the environment. These are all scientifically verifiable facts with lots of supporting data and evidence, and people still doubt them. As I stated in my main answer some people, fully trained and educated scientist, even doubt the very existence of our universe. EVERYTHING can be doubted. ",

            "answer_text": "You can doubt anything you like. Some doubts can not be logically supported. Descartes is famous for saying that he cannot doubt that he exists. He argues that if he did not exist he could not doubt that he exists therefore he must exist. Note that he realizes that does not prove he is who and what he thinks he is, just that he is doubting and that requires existing. Stated more logically looking: It is the case that for every x if x is doubting then x is existing. ",
