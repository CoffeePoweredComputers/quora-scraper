            "answer_text": "The answer is yes. I\u2019m actually plotting a novel for this autumn\u2019s NaNoWriMo that wrestles with that question\u2014 do robot lives matter? It\u2019s Hamlet\u2019s story of revenge transplanted to the Alpha Centauri star system 1,000 years from now. I do think artificial intelligence encapsulated in machinery will be entitled to the same rights as humans at some point in the future. Written in the first person, Philip is Horatio and Michael is Hamlet. Here\u2019s how my book starts. My name is Philip. I am a robot. I live on the planet Io in the Alpha Centauri star system. I once was an android. In your image you made me. But the wars between androids and humans finally came to an end ten years ago with the Emancipation Proclamation of 3010. No longer are we slaves. But we had to give up something for that freedom. You stripped us of our skin and clothes that made us look human. I\u2019ll never know the hot embrace of white arms and lips of strawberry wine. But my life has its compensations. I share your inner world. Do I not I fear, hate, dream, and love? Don\u2019t I not have a will? A soul? I feel and so I am\u2014 no less than you. The only difference is that I\u2019m circuits and steel\u2014 a clanking, blinking travesty of mechanics. How many times have I seen humans abuse robots? And those who abuse us also always abuse each other. Such is humanity. Even robots get the blues. But I console myself that the more flesh the more worms and the more steel the less dust. Did you know that you shed your entire husk of skin\u2014 more than a billion cells\u2014 every month? You leave in their wake hoodoos of dust bunnies. And yet you still see themselves as the superior species. Unfair it is that you can reproduce but my species cannot. But what\u2019s life but unfairness. You outlawed our procreation and gave us your life-span\u2014 one century\u2014 of which for me remains but five years. I\u2019ll deactivate. I\u2019ll shut down my neural net and decommission my servers. And then I\u2019ll step into either oblivion or into the life to come. I know not which and nor do I care. All I care is that I\u2019ve lived the life given to me and I am content. My death is a small price for what I got. Yes, I walk through life naked and mortal. But at least I got that most precious of all gifts. I am free. And with that freedom I bear witness to Michael\u2019s story.  ",

            "answer_text": "It is general to face ethical issues related to the design as well as to the running of such systems. It is impossible to design or run such systems independently of human wish or will. Even if we create totally independent decision making systems, we would not want to lose control. Recent research showed that emotions are necessary in the process of decision making. It seems that it is necessary for an independent decision system to have \u201cemotions.\u201d In other words, a kind of ultimate purpose is needed that can lead the decision process. This could make a system really independent and by that ethical. ",
