            "answer_text": "Yes, an analogy is an argument and an important component in an argument. By placing two essentially unlike things together, a good analogy causes its hearers to place themselves side by side with its key component.. They can then form a conclusion as to whether or not the comparison is both valid and applicable to them. Take one of Jesus\u2019s parables, for example. Frequently he introduced a parable with the word like. \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like . . .\u201d, he would say. Here is one of his parables: The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field, which a man found and hid again; and from joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field (Matthew 13:44 NASB). With this parable, Jesus wants to get his listeners to become the man who finds the treasure in a field which is not his. In other words, by comparing their lives to the man in the parable, his audience might ask themselves a question: \u201cDo I want this kingdom Jesus is talking about badly enough to give my entire life to it?\u201d Such is the level of commitment Jesus expected of those who heard his teaching. He wanted his listeners to ask themselves, \u201cAm I willing to give up my life in the short run to gain something of far greater worth in both the short run and the long run?\u201d Put differently \u201cAm I willing to forsake my own little autonomous kingdom to come under the authority of the King of the kingdom of heaven, which is of inestimable worth?\u201d In conclusion, the analogy (or parable) is inextricably tied to the argument which is being made. In a sense, the analogy is simply a conglomeration of words and symbols. What the hearer or reader makes of those words determines whether the argument contained by them is effective or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting one. No but\u2026 An analogy is a useful technique to use in an argument but it can't really be considered to be an argument in and of itself. In maths we talk about Isomorphisms, which are rather \u201canalogy\u201d - like. An isomorphism is way of applying things you already know in a new and different situation. Literal translation: iso = the same morphism = form An example would be arithmetic in simple real number algebra. The rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying & dividing ordinary numbers work perfectly in real number algebra. Now, you may be thinking, \u201cYes but surely that will always be the case?\u201d and you'd be wrong. Matrices and vectors don't follow the same rules at all. So we can say that because real number algebra follows the same rules as for real numbers, they are isomorphic or analogous, if you prefer. But numbers and matrices don't work the same way. An example being that multiplication of numbers is commutative & matrix multiplication is not. (Commutativity is where you get the same result both ways round, like 2 \u00d7 3 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6. Multiplication & addition of numbers are commutative where subtraction & division are not.) And finally we get to the point. The connection between real numbers & algebraic expressions means that we can use the one to prove results about the other. For example, if I want to prove something like \u201cThe sum of any 2 odd numbers is even.\u201d I can use my \u2018analogy\u2019 to prove the case, very simply. Where things go pear shaped is if I tried to apply real number logic to matrices, by pretending that the \u2018analogy\u2019 is sound, when it just isn't. Many bad arguments are based on such an assumption. But even when the isomorphism is sound, you can run into problems. Here is a simple proof that one is precisely equal to 2 (bet you didn't know that!) A = B A\u00b2 = AB [mult by A] A\u00b2 - B\u00b2 = AB - B\u00b2 [subtract B\u00b2] (A - B)(A + B) = B(A - B) [factorise] A + B = B [div by (A - B)] 2B = B [subst A for B, from line 1] 1 = 2 [div by B] QED (Quite Easily Done) * There you go. I hope we are agreed that this is WRONG! It is wrong because we have divided by 0 which is mathematical semtex (it blows up in your face) but I've used algebra to hide my error. See if you can see the point in the proof where the crime was committed. So, despite my declaring earlier that we have an isomorphism, which we do, this doesn't stop me using my correct analogy in a sneaky and vile way to try to deceive you all into thinking that 1 is actually equal to 2. We could go on from there to propose a whole new form of economics centred around the \u201cargument\u201d that 1 = 2, which fans of such thoughts will have fun playing with & everyone else in possession of a sound mind, will find to be mildly concerning. Analogies are often used in arguments, but you need to be clued in to both the argument & the analogy being used, if you're going to spot the ways they can be used to deceive & distort reality. That's why the population on Dunning-Kruger's Mt Stupid, is so freaking enormous. * QED actually stands for Quod Erat Demonstrandum, (that which was to be demonstrated) which is also an example of a Latin gerundive.
