            "answer_text": "Likely not much to add, here.  We have the pious answers, and the skeptical answers. What do you mean by \"enlightened\"?    That's a specific term in the Buddhist tradition, and means much more than the generalized use of the word in western culture. We know essentially nothing of Jesus, and many of the more dispassionate scholars doubt he even existed.  If he did exist, it was as the \"Jesus of History\" rather than the \"Jesus of Faith\". The Jesus of history was likely an Apocalyptic preacher who riled up enough of population around the fishing villages locally to be of concern to the Romans.  When he showed up with a gang of followers to Jerusalem during the high holy days, they arrested him for sedition and executed him.Should have been \"end of story\" but his followers split into various groups (over 30 of 'em) that over a period of hundreds of years created a new religion.Essentially nothing in the Gospels can be attributed to Jesus with any accuracy.   These same scholars I spoke of consider perhaps a couple of sentences as having a good possibility of being the actual words of Jesus.  No more than that.The entire theology of Christianity was created over some hundreds of years by people who did not know Jesus, who had nothing but highly conflicting \"Gospels\" which had been floating around in oral tradition for years before being committed to writing. If Jesus actually existed as a discrete person, he was very likely a charismatic fellow with an \"end is near\" message about the imminent arrival of the Son Of Man.....Something the Romans saw as sedition.Enlightened?  There is simply no evidence. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Mateusz. I will consider three sources of knowledge of the life/words of Jesus:- The four gospels- The various letters attributed to Paul- Documents outside Christian tradition (like the ones found at Nag Hammadi) What we see in the four gospels is closest as we get to direct words of Jesus, one exception might be the gospel according to Thomas which falls outside the tradition. While there is no clear reference the words and the way his followers speak of him and act does give the impression that they consider him to have 'gnosis' which would come close to what is called enlightenment. In the letters from Paul we see a similar case and also a shift to personal 'gnosis'. The emphasis is however more on 'Jesus as son of God', 'God in the flesh'. The writings found at Nag Hammadi paint a very different world view, with many gnostic (as in the movement) influences. Little doubt they consider Jesus as having a special place, as a source of 'gnosis'. Based on this I would say that there is little doubt that the followers of Jesus in the century (maybe two) after his life would have answered this question with 'yes' if we would have explained the concept of enlightenment as having 'gnosis' and sophia (wisdom).If we present the four gospels (and the one attributed to Thomas) to people who have never heard of them they would most likely agree. It's mainly the letters from Paul that present a world view and a view on Jesus that people cannot reconcile. The book of Revelation has been disputed in the years before the creation of the Biblical Canon (what we now know as the New Testament) so I'll leave that one out. As for us? Read the gospels (preferably also Thomas) and see for yourself. ",
