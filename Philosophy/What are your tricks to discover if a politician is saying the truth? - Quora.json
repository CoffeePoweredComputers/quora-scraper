            "answer_text": "There are no tricks. It\u2019s simply a matter of listening to what they say then seeing if they back it up. This sometimes takes time. A politician will say something in a hearing or on the campaign trail, only to not do what he/she said he/she would do (or not do) later on when the person thinks everyone has forgotten (or wasn\u2019t paying attention in the first place). That along with research, fact-checking, using some common sense, and looking at statements they\u2019ve made vs. their voting record and what they\u2019ve done, and it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out who\u2019s lying. It takes time and it takes work, but you can determine who\u2019s lying, on your own and with no \u201cspin\u201d doctor telling you. ",
