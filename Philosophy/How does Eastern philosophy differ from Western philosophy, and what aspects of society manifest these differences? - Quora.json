            "answer_text": "Eastern and Western Philosophy are not different from each other in a very substantial way. The difference is in the historical process of development and the manner of approaching philosophical questions is different. For example one of the major differences between Western and Eastern philosophy is that within the latter you do not find the theory of pure reason or Reason is not conceived to be a distinct source of knowledge. Inference is considered to be a source of knowledge but pure reason or pure thought is a distinct source of knowledge as far as it has a distinct object altogether and is not dependent on sense-perception; as a matter of fact all schools of thought concur in taking inference to depend on perception. So within Eastern philosophy you will not find any 'intellectual intuition' or logic as science of 'pure thought'. This implies that our access to metaphysical truths would depend on scriptural testimony or else mystic perception acquired through yoga practice, the details of which differ according to the difference of the schools of thought. To some extent this has facilitated the impression that Indian Philosophy is irrational but that is not correct. As even a glance of the primary literature is sufficient to prove philosophy in India displays logical and analytical rigor in no small measure. The links below give further details and highlight the logical aspect of Indian Philosophy which is often neglected. Vaibhav Narula's answer to What are the main peculiarities of Indian philosophy?

            "answer_text": "Eastern philosophy is for the most part a misnomer. By and large it amounts to escapist philosophy; How to escape suffering, to be exact. Western philosophy is actual philosophy in that it loves wisdom. That is an open ended love of all sorts of wise things, whereas Eastern \u201cphil\u201d is wisdom of how not to suffer. ",
