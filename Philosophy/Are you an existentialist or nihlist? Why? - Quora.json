            "answer_text": "I am somewhere in between absurdism and nihilism. I started out a Christian (I am not one anymore), but I started to drift away. There were many things I had found in Christianity, but out of all those things, I could not find a purpose for life. Was it to be a better person? Was it to follow Jesus? I could not find a clear answer that didn\u2019t conflict with another plausible answer, so I started looking at other sources. I slowly drifted away from Christianity and adopted ideas and beliefs that would have been considered heresy in earlier, simpler times. Ultimately, one of these was nihilism. This is pretty obvious since I had to find a meaning to life to fully find my beliefs, and therefore find myself, and since I couldn\u2019t find one even when I was still a Christian, part of a religion that says it has a loving God who will most likely provide at least some answers and comforts, I assumed I was looking for something that wasn\u2019t there. But then I started to wonder about bigger things than humanity and the nature of its existence: namely, the universe and the nature of reality. Ultimately, my nihilism snowballed into assuming that the universe was purposeless as well as human existence. I believe they exist not because they have a purpose, but because there is no purpose.

            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cAre you an existentialist or a nihilist? Why?\u201d I am neither. And I don\u2019t know how an existentialist, of the pure Sartrean variety anyway, can be anything other than an nihilist. An existentialist can \u201ccare\u201d as Mr. Rivera-Dominguez says here. But he may come to realize that his caring has simply been enculturated in him, primarily the result of many centuries of the part played in every culture by religious belief. His caring is now only an ingrained habit of temperament\u2014without deeper meaning. He may propose that he can \u201ccreate his own meaning\u201d. But he will suspect that he is seeking to act out an impossibility, that man can no more create his own meaning than he can pull himself off the ground by his bootstraps. In this way, nihilism may creep into the existentialist\u2019s most private thoughts. To what effect in the long run we do not know. I believe Sartre\u2019s idea was that the only dignity left to one was to conduct himself \u201cauthentically\u201d in the face of this abysmal knowledge. But some asked, What dignity? ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely not a nihlist because I believe in morals in general just not in the language that what I do is either right or wrong. But I am not existentialist either because Society is natural. Religious and secular rules are not always arbitrary but are necessary. I am a more of a Consequentialist. Meaning moral judgements must be made based on what is good intrinsically or on the consequences or outcome of our actions. Morality would be arbitrary and immaterial without it. For example alcohol may be a cure for one person's ailment and not another's. Good judgement or reason is the truth or right action. Note the word good is used similarly with loving or Godly the intrinsic meanings are basically the same. ",
