            "answer_text": "Either reality is all in your mind -- ( I mean... you personally, as there would be no other beings without objective reality), or there is objective reality.  If it's all in your mind, you have no means to detect this.   If there's objective reality, and you behave as if there is not, you have an excellent chance of dying soon.    So... to steal a page from Pascal's wager, you're much better off operating as if objective reality exists. Actual proof is impossible.  But a practical answer beats an Ivory Tower answer to the finish line 99 times out of 100. ",

            "answer_text": "If the question is whether reality is independent across all the selves, then answer is YES. Because, if the ultimate reality is dependent on some other tattva/essence, then there will be infinite regress. Hence, there has to be two tattvas, independent and dependent. Independent reality is in all means independent. Where as\u201dmind\u201d and \u201cindividual\u201d as you termed are dependent. Mind is Jada: gross form Individual: cetana-subtle formSelf is this subtle and this self has to perform sadhana to experience the independent reality either with or without mind. ",
