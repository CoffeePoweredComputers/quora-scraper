            "answer_text": "Pretty significant question, actually. No, you can\u2019t escape. It would make the Universe VIOLENTLY unstable if you could escape the consequences of your actions. In order to make the Universe stable, it has to be completely impossible for all sentients to escape the Universe, to escape reality. And this means you are an eternal being. The weird thing is, you already know this. I will prove this in a bit, with a thing called The Murder On A Beach Thought Experiment. Practically, this means you have a soul. A soul which can actually be detected with a properly constructed machine, a soul-detector. This is an inevitable thing, really, the construction of a soul-detector. The historical time for it has arrived. And oh, by the way, the ultimate result of the scientific confirmation of the existence of the soul will the total and permanent destruction of all evil on Earth. The end of war. The end of injustice. The end of dictators. The end of repression. The end of mass murder. Pick out what you think is the world\u2019s worst evil you personally would like to destroy. I can show you how to destroy it. I can prove this too. See my story at the end. The Awakening is coming. Let me list the proof: Life after death is real, the cold-sober scientific truth, the way the Universe works. Life after death is not a fiction or a fantasy. It is real, something vitally necessary in order for the Universe to be stable, mainly to keep the Universe\u2019s sentients from blowing the Universe the Hell up. On this one thing, the existence of the soul, those silly religious woo-woos are ABSOLUTELY right. Those moonbeam-dancing, ley-line-loving, crystal-worshiping, long-haired-hippie-freak woo-woos are totally dead-bang right. I can prove ALL of this---if you are smart enough to understand it. (Although intelligence really isn\u2019t the main problem, but rather the ability to think clearly and objectively. THAT is rare, even among scientists. THIS IS AN EASY PROBLEM TO SOLVE. Considered simply as an exercise in logic, the problem of the existence of the soul is entirely trivial.) I can prove it all by the best, most rigorous method the human race has ever found for finding the truth. The scientific method. Observation, hypothesis, and finally confirmation by testing in the lab. By building a soul-detector and detecting souls in the lab. The detecting principle, I suspect, will be rapid changes in Planck\u2019s Constant. You don\u2019t even have to use people. You can use cats. Why cats? Cat-soul dived through my chest once. Also, soul theory indicates the source of emotion is the soul, not the brain, and therefore any animal that shows emotion, in particular love, is an eternal being and has a soul. The observation and hypothesis parts I have solved. I\u2019d get the third one too, if I had the money. Alas, I don\u2019t. It would take a million bucks just to start. I continue to hope some bad-boy millionaire scientist or engineer will trip over my Quora answers one day.(You hearing this, Elon? Would you like to smash the whole damn world? I can show you how.) Let me give you the short version, then the long version. Rigorously objective analysis of human behavior reveals human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence, on quite a number of levels. Since human bodies are certainly not eternal, human beings MUST contain an eternally existing component, i.e. they must have souls. You might object something as weird as souls could only exist if the Universe had some EXTREMELY powerful need for them. You would be correct. There actually is an extremely powerful need for a Universe\u2019s sentients to ALL be eternal beings who have souls. It inhibits the sentients from destroying their Universe. If a Universe\u2019s sentients are NOT eternal beings, then the Universe logically becomes Hell. Because most sentients\u2019 lives are composed mostly of pain, and unless their existence was without limit, their pain, and their lives, would be completely meaningless. Live in Hell, and then die. Sentients would destroy any such Universe in a cosmic heartbeat. It would be the MORAL thing to do. And oh my, yes, all sentients possess the theoretical capacity to destroy the entire Universe, as one aspect of sentients is knowledge of how the Universe works, as in the ability to write down the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws and then use those laws to change the Universe around them as they see fit. Stephen Hawking embodies the entire situation perfectly. If anybody understands the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws, it is Stephen Hawking. If anybody has suffered at the hands of the Universe, it is Stephen Hawking. And waddya know, Stephen Hawking has found a way to destroy the whole damn Universe. With a flick of his little finger. He has pointed out the Higgs field exists in an excited state, and that the existence of all the Universe\u2019s particles depend on the Higgs field remaining in that excited state. So, because the Higgs field exists in an excited state, the Universe contains a fundamental instability which can be used to destroy it. If the Higgs field ever drops to its ground state in any particular area, all the Universe\u2019s particles in that area will promptly disintegrate. And from that area the drop in energy (and therefore disintegration) will spread, exactly like dropping a spark into gunpowder. And the entire Universe dissolves back into the Chaos it came from. So all we have to do is build a machine that will catalyze the drop of the Higgs field to its ground state. We will only have to use it once. We punch the button\u2014-and poof, no more Universe, at the speed of light. Remember, if we all are not eternal beings, we all live in Hell, and this is the moral thing to do. The odds are pretty good the human race is NOT the first sentient species to evolve in the Universe, but no sentient species has ever actually done this. The Universe is still there. I hereby conclude this Universe\u2019s sentients are eternal beings, and there is a way to detect souls in the laboratory. That\u2019s the short version. Now the long version. Here is an essay which explores this Universe-destruction thing further. This is the rock-bottom of it all. It\u2019s ALL about keeping the Universe in one piece, man. ON THE SENTIENT CONSTRAINTS OF A SENTIENT-CONTAINING UNIVERSE http://www.theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/02/on-sentient-constraints-of-sentient.html Now an exploration of the various ways human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence. (This is by no means all the ways.) If human beings possess immortal souls, it should be possibly to logically deduce this by objective analysis of their actions. It should be possible to show in your own personal actions. It should be possible to show you ACT like you have a soul, even when you think you don\u2019t. THE MURDER ON A BEACH THOUGHT EXPERIMENT http://theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/12/murder-on-beach-thought-experiment-on.html It should be possible to demonstrate the rule exists in collective action. It should be possible to demonstrate the assumption of eternal existence exists in the foundation rules of the world\u2019s stable societies, although they may not be aware of it. ON EMOTION DRUGS http://www.theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/02/on-emotion-drugs.html The physical purpose of souls is stability. So it should be possible to demonstrate denying or removing the assumption of eternal existence results in extreme personal pain and extremely violent instability. AND NOTHING HEARD MY SCREAM http://theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/05/and-nothing-heard-my-scream.html And now one last stinger. This is for the REALLY smart people out there. The existence of souls is currently perceived as mostly an academic debate. Something that won\u2019t make much difference one way or the other. It is not. The confirmation of the existence of souls will cause the most profound change in human behavior there has ever been. This will be a scientific discovery that will cause a change in humanity\u2019s MORAL behavior, as people will finally understand it is impossible to escape the consequences of your actions. Let me illustrate this with a story. A scientist builds a soul-detector, IMMEDIATELY detects souls\u2014-and smashes the entire world. The total and permanent destruction of all evil on Earth begins as the good guys are finally cut loose. Because science has now proven the MORAL thing to do is also the SMART thing to do. AFTER THE AWAKENING https://futurism.media/after-the-awakening This story is the future, what\u2019s about to happen, right around the corner. The Awakening is coming.

            "answer_text": "Read or play video games. Maybe write or try drawing or painting. That\u2019s what I do. Maybe watch movies. Or maybe think about this\u2026. \u201cAs I now take my last breaths and bleed out my last few drops of blood I gradually think back to fondly reminisce. I think back to the many and the singular things which caused me to get to this point I am now at. I think about what it could and would have been like if I had lived a completely different life. I now also question what it would have been like if I had to live my entire life all over again. Would I have done anything any different?\u201d \u201cAmong the living I have known many people who would say that men much like myself were immortals. Yet I now know for a fact that I have been nonexistent for a far longer span than I have existed. Immortality was supposed to work the other way around. One could say that I have both lived and died so many times that I\u2019ve come to lose count.\u201d \u201cMaybe in death I was simply just random thoughts existing somehow trying to connect with other random thoughts to obtain a more permanent due form. Now instead of existing as mere random thoughts I became a human mind, body, space, matter, memory, time and energy formed by negative, positive or neutrally charged particles.\u201d \u201cWith each death comes a new life. With each new birth of a conscience comes an acknowledgement that there was always something that preexisted.\u201d \u201cI always seem to regain the chance to start life all over again. My new start almost always seems to appear with a newer body and a newer refined mind and memory. Every life ever I ever lived was a story to tell. Some people never get the chance to tell their own life\u2019s story. Many people have immortalized others by retelling their life. Sometime a storyteller makes others\u2019 lives and their own life appear either far greater or far lesser than reality.\u201d \u201cAs far as I know my newest life began when Asani Addo the famed Kenyan African Scientist found ways to transfer a fully intact human conscience into a human or animal body or form. The bodies he created were grafted from stem cells and variants of Bio organic parts. That scientist, my father had then worked for the largest pharmaceutical corporation on Earth known as Sinopec Tek. Professor Asani Addo used me and my mother as his very first human test subjects. What we all ended up finding out was that the Bio organic synthetic parts he used to reform our bodies had given us extra sensory intelligence, sight, touch, taste, smell, sound, speed and strength.\u201d \u201cAfter we were used as loyal test subjects my mother and I would often listen to music only to later play various musical instruments with the intent of duplicating the variants of sounds we had heard. We could then teach ourselves how to play any musical instrument within a mere few hours. We could sound like professional musicians. Gradually my mother and I gained a superb photogenic memory. We often spent time reading the entire American English dictionary. We found ourselves going through thousands of books remembering everything we read and saw in a very short span of time. We pressed our luck trying to glance through German, Spanish, and Portuguese dictionaries.\u201d \u201cSomehow both of us found ourselves speaking, writing and reading these languages rather fluently within 24 hours. We had also come to notice that the Bio organic made bodies we now had somehow made us age at a far more reduced rate that everyone else. This was just the beginning of things that seemed to aid us cross the bridge of normality into the realm of the supernatural.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately for my father he died only two years after we were initially used as his loyal human test subjects. He was 20 years older than my white French/American mother. Both of my parents were scientist and licensed physicians for three continents. We traveled a great deal. I still considered myself an American because I was born in New Rochelle, New York. My father died June 9,1964 when I his eldest of four children had just been 23 years old. He died at the age of 70.\u201d It was in 1948 when the very first TV network in America was birthed by a 60 year old Texas billionaire also a white Supremacist oil tycoon named Clark Lindh. In 1956 the second American TV network was birthed by another white supremacist male from Texas named 58 year old Aaron Chrisler. It wasn\u2019t until 1963 that a 23 year old African American woman named Orissa Lows from Merced, California created the first literal and figurative colored TV network in America. She had convinced a British billionaire, a billionaire from India, An Arabian billionaire Sultan and 12 African American millionaires to loan her the money with interest kickstarting a TV network. Orissa had also become the co-founder of what became the modern computer, video games, cellphones, and artificial intelligence. She had been married in 1960 when she was just 19 years old. She and her husband Alamance AlBody birthed their first child Aton in 1961. The TV networks owned by Clark Lindh only showed white male dominated TV programs which usually started off a day with Westerns. Watching his network, a person would assume there were no people in America darker than a tan who had preexisted the settlers here. In reality most of the so-called Indians were very dark in complexion. Most had the look of very dark skinned oriental people. The Network owned by Aaron Chrisler showed TV programs often reflecting a white male and a white female working as dual lead roles. But it wasn\u2019t until Orissa\u2019s TV network had begun that any actual nonwhites were played or viewed on TV. At the time there were no sports viewed on TV until Orissa introduced them. This aided her network to fast become the most watched, most diverse leading network. Each TV network had a radio version of it. Orissa\u2019s network remained the only integrated TV and Radio network until 1982. In the American calendar year 1985 a Deist religious organization known as the Illuminati created a rather unique weapon used to decimate Mecca, Jerusalem and the Vatican. What made this weapon so unique was in how it exploded only to somehow implode two minutes after it was detonated. It left no radiation fallout. Known members of the Illuminati were quickly round up and executed. This was not the same Illuminati Adam Weishaupt had begun in May 1, 1776. It had then been revealed that both Clark Lindh and Aaron Chrisler were leaders and co-founders of the new version of the Illuminati. Both men had proclaimed themselves devout and true Christians much of their entire lives. Christian religious leader often told their followers that members of the Illuminati were devil worshipers. It was found that many of the Christian religious leaders were members of Freemasonry, Skull and Bones, The Rosicrucian Order and the Illuminati. Many such religious leaders were voluntarily and purposely misleading their own followers. Both Aaron Chrisler and Clark Lindh admitted to overseeing the manufacture of a nuclear weapon aimed to rid the world of its theist versions of the major Abrahamic religions. The United Nations had every admitted member of the Illuminati round up and executed. Many of the world's remaining Jews, Muslims, and Catholics began the belief that an Abrahamic God had taken his flock to Heaven via a rapture. More religious followers questioned this and gradually in disbelief of such a notion steered more toward Atheism. In 1980 Orissa created a supercomputer referred to as The Grand Operational Device. This supercomputer or G.O.D. was a form of artificial intelligence holding all the world\u2019s information. Artificially intelligent robots of various types were manufactured for public usage. Computers, automobiles, trains, buses, trolleys, motorcycles, airplanes, helicopters, Homes, household appliances and many places of business were made to become forms of an artificial intelligence enabled to levitate or fly and react and communicate with animals and humans. These AI\u2019s could think rationally for themselves. \u201cIn 1997 during the American President Donald J Trumps second presidential term in the oval office he kick-started an internationally funded program known as Project 14. In this system there was a building built in Utah known as a teleportation machine. This machine was a building as large as the Pentagon where US currency was made. The teleportation device was built by the Earth\u2019s leading scientist and astronomers who alleged that this device could take 14 people to another galaxy to another planet faster than the speed of light. Seven men and seven women from various nations were chosen to teleport. Fourteen people, seven men and seven women were teleported to a planet astronomers and scientist had affirmed had held animal and plant life. They were supposed to be teleported back 365 Earth days after our initial launch date. There had been no real way of knowing exactly where and how we were going to end up. This was where things got really strange.\u201d ",
