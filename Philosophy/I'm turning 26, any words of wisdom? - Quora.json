            "answer_text": "I read the other responses first to avoid repetition. I am 66. Had a good life and hopefully more to come. Just lucky, nothing more. Of course I suffered trials and tribulations and regrets. Biggest single regret: smoking cigarettes. Did damage to myself and can\u2019t keep up with my five year old and it will only get worse. There\u2019s probably no way for a 26 year old person to predict what will be important to them at 40, 50, 60 and 70. All I can say is that it changes. I assume most people experience something similar. But in your case, the fact that at 26 you are even asking that question indicates you are already aware of how difficult it is to know for sure what you will want down the road. You must have heard it said, How can an 18 year old expect to make the right choices that the 48 year old will have to live with. Now that you are 26, you know that you already feel differently than how you felt when you were 18, for example, and based on that difference and your awareness of it you already seem to have some of the wisdom you are soliciting from us. I don\u2019t have any advice for you to follow, everyone\u2019s \u201ccase\u201d is unique, but the guidelines suggested in another response is probably as good a place to start as any. ",

            "answer_text": "Don't freak out, you sound 25 going on 50. Relax, you have options and choices. WORK If this is your primary driving force and your passion priority, then accept that. You should have career goals that are attainable and measurable.Your passion should involve some YOU time. Time away from the pressure of work and the daily grind. This will benefit you mentally and, in turn, professionally by allowing you to clear your thought process and reexamine things fresh.Be reasonable with yourself. If you are in too deep, ask for help. If you feel overwhelmed, step back from additional opportunities at times. Nothing will destroy you more than getting a reputation of a mediocre performer. It is better to excel at a few things than participate in many.PERSONAL Using Step 2 above, find something you love. Hiking, biking, reading, church, live music shows, shopping, whatever...and do it. As much as you can. Don't worry about making friends at this point.This is when you will make friends. You'll start to see the same core group of people. Say \"Hi\". Talk to them. Listen to them. They may share other interests.Take a chance. Say \"Yes\" sometimes to the offer of a movie or dinner. That work can wait. You will never get these years back. Live for the moment sometimes. Walk in the rain.FINANCES Only you can answer this. People that are frugal and enjoy the simple things in life can usually get by quite nicely with minimal finances. Others prefer a more extravagant, flamboyant lifestyle and will burn through cash at a much higher rate. Neither is right, or wrong, but ultimately only one is who you are and feel most comfortable with.Be honest with yourself. Will you be happier working 18 hours a day to get a few extra bucks in the bank, or fewer hours and extra memories and friendships.Finally, don't fret about what you don't have. You have the power, and control, to change this. Appreciate what you do have. You are twenty-five years young. You have so many mistakes yet to make. So many hours to work. So much life to live. What are you waiting for? Start living it, the rest will come. Good luck :o) ",
