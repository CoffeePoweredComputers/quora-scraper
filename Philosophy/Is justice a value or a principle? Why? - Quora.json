            "answer_text": "Justice is a set of values closely associated with a set of principles. It is a composite concept not a simple one. The components of justice are desert (as in \u201cjust deserts\u201d not icecream for dessert), fairness and truth. People should get what they deserve, be it reward for useful effort or punishment. People should get like for like treatment and have equality before the law based on equal rights. People should be judged on the basis of true facts not false lies, unjustified assumptions and prejudices. Punishment is usually justified in terms of tit for tat (retribution) and/or reform (correction). If you intentionally or negligently cause suffering you deserve it. Being punished should encourage you to behave better and mend your ways. Conversely, if you work hard doing good work you deserve reward. If you are a female, you should have the same opportunities and the same pay as a male (and vice versa) unless there is a good reason to have different treatment. (E.g. There\u2019s no point putting urinals in female toilets.) If you do wrong, there should be evidence that justifies your conviction and punishment. Those who lie (commit perjury) deserve punishment. Justice/fairness is an emotion that has evolved to promote cooperation in social mammals. Cooperation is adaptive in species. Moral emotions such as guilt, shame, pride and contempt ultimately serve the goal of cooperation. Species that cooperate (and that empathize with each other\u2019s pain) are adaptive (more likely to survive). De Waal has a wonderful experiment, Monkeys reject unequal pay, that shows precursors of morality exist in other social mammals besides humans.  ",

            "answer_text": "Justice is a virtue. To quote Ayn Rand: Justice is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men as you cannot fake the character of nature, that you must judge all men as conscientiously as you judge inanimate objects, with the same respect for truth, with the same incorruptible vision, by as pure and as rational a process of identification\u2014that every man must be judged for what he is and treated accordingly, that just as you do not pay a higher price for a rusty chunk of scrap than for a piece of shining metal, so you do not value a rotter above a hero\u2014that your moral appraisal is the coin paying men for their virtues or vices, and this payment demands of you as scrupulous an honor as you bring to financial transactions\u2014that to withhold your contempt from men\u2019s vices is an act of moral counterfeiting, and to withhold your admiration from their virtues is an act of moral embezzlement\u2014that to place any other concern higher than justice is to devaluate your moral currency and defraud the good in favor of the evil, since only the good can lose by a default of justice and only the evil can profit\u2014and that the bottom of the pit at the end of that road, the act of moral bankruptcy, is to punish men for their virtues and reward them for their vices, that that is the collapse to full depravity, the Black Mass of the worship of death, the dedication of your consciousness to the destruction of existence.
