            "answer_text": "At what point do lies become truth and truth become lies? Lies become truth when it's repeated enough times that people begin to believe it. For instance the whole \u2018Hillary is crooked\u2019 theme from the recent US election. It's widely believed she's guilty ( of something ). Yet she holds the distinction of being one of the most investigated people in the USA. Multiple FBI investigation, multiple senate committee investigations and yet she's never been charged with anything. The ironic part is that Trump, who used this theme through out the campaign with great success, is in fact a fraudster. Trump Univeristy, non payment of contractors. He's the one who is crooked. ",
