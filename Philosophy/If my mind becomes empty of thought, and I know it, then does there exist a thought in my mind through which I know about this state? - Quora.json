            "answer_text": "Nobody can understand your question & at least I cannot understand. It looks as if I am reading a \"fictional story\". When you say \"Your mind becomes empty of thought, about which you know it\", is an absurd statement. Your mind can be empty only when you go into \"Coma\", when \"Mind\" is dead & you are not \"Conscious\" of the external world & \u201cyou cannot know about it\u201d. Please read further. You say, that \"your mind is empty & you know it\". When your mind is empty how can you know that your mind is empty, when you are not \"Conscious\"? You are contradicting your own earlier statement asking \"Does there exist a thought in my mind through which I know about this state?\" I will go by practical & materialistic life to bring out the principles of thoughts that bind man to survive. You are born out of \"Subconscious\" thoughts propelling your life through the functions of internal organs, which are mysterious gifts of \"Nature\". It is not humanly possible to dictate or modify the functions of internal organs. It is a mysterious & well protected area of \"Nature\". The next comes the \"Conscious\" mind activated by 5 senses & intelligence. If the senses are active, your \"Conscious\" mind will go into action. All external impulses experienced through senses get processed in the brain to be reflected through \"Conscious\" mind. Hence unless you totally subdue sense perceptions completely or your mind is dead, your thought processes will not come to a halt. In the case of \"Coma\" stage, mind is totally dead & no thought processes will take place. All external impulses will have no impact on your mind & you cannot even know about it. This is the stage you are talking about in your question, where no thought is held in your mind, since consciousness is gone. It is only the \"Subconscious\" mind which is keeping you alive without your conscious knowledge & nothing will be known about anything happening in the external world. CONCLUSIONS:- Your mind cannot be empty, unless you are in coma, in which case, \"consciousness\" is dead until coma comes to an end. \"With the blessings of Saptha Rishies & Almighty\". ",

            "answer_text": "Friends, Emptying the mind literary sounds not something about KNOWING/to know about something but these words sound something about SEEING/one's potential to be conscious-to be aware-at one own self i.e.one's own physical body as well as one's own psychic body(specially thoughts). Waking consciousness commonly noticed in humans is not adequate/sufficient to see and gets captured by impression inputs to be transformed into contineously ongoing thoughts/train of thoughts which in general form platform to know and to acknowledge in context to one's quality of waking consciousness. If, someone grows in his present waking consciousness to next level, called higher consciousness, than only, he -consciousness -becomes able to see/able to be conscious -able to be aware-to subtler things called thoughts. This seeing/to be conscious to psychic body i.e.thoughts, in itself is only possible if consciousness gets separated from thoughts and just exists as observer -a phenomenon which checks transformation of consciousness -conscious energy -into thoughts-psychic energy. It leads to no further ongoing thinking available and state -psychic state-is called emptying the mind/thoughtlessness /NO MIND state. But it doesn't mean that one looses his capacity to think/to know and to acknowledge. In presence of higher consciousness, his freewill gets more empowered and gets operated on conscious scale as against will born out of one's ego operating on subconscious scale. Such a man, on conscious scale is able to will to think and is able to will to stop thinking and he at deliberate will, doesn't allow associated thinking being stimulated by impression inputs -a mechanism which contineously robs/absorbs one's consciousness to get to transform into some psychic construct called thoughts. State is to be existed as being conscious /aware at one's physical body and psychic body which by default is accompanied by emptying mind and if needed, such a man can consciously will to create thoughts giving way out to psychic process called KNOWING. Thanks Q guru. This answer is based on Shri Raman Mahrsi spiritual practice called \u201cwho i am\". ",

            "answer_text": "What is the point of hypothetical questions and speculations? In your aliveness, call it by any other name like consciousness, sentience etc etc, thoughts arise continuously. There are infinitesimal breaks in between thoughts. Aliveness is the choiceless witness of both the thoughts and the silence in between. This aliveness is not a thing. It can never be known as an object. This aliveness is intuited by INTELLIGENCE. This intuition is a flash of revelation. It is a eureka moment. It can happen when there is a deep yearning for the TRUTH. It is instantaneous. This aliveness is most obvious, self luminous, self evident, near and dear, very intimate, nameless, formless, dimension-less, non local and the very core of your BEING. Is this BEING \u201cseen\u201d by the eye of wisdom HERE and NOW? Do you feel this aliveness in your bones in a manner of speaking figuratively? It is very simple. it is sitting right one your nose. Do not try to capture this aliveness as an object. There is no way to sneak behind this aliveness and observe it secretly. You are this aliveness! Just intuit it! NOW and HERE. Do not postpone for later. Postponing is the best way to remain in the dark. If you can see that there is truly no \u201cyou\u201d as a separate autonomous entity but there is just this impersonal aliveness or what Ramana maharishi calls the SELF then there is total freedom. Once this intuition dawns then you must put this into practice diligently to make Self realization well established. ",

Mind can never be made empty and if \u2018I\u2019 know that means there is far more thought existing even if we are overseeing. Thus till \u2018I\u2019 our identification exist mind is not empty. Saints practice Samadhi and there are categories of Samadhis too which indicates the level of emptiness in their relative measure which simultaneously has relation with our ability of control of breathing or no breathing for substantial period of time without causing any decay of cells or being absent of consciousness. Their consciousness is merged with universal conscious disconnecting with mortal senses. Such state is result of their tapasya devotion steadfast concentrated towards the God or super conscious state and we call it enlighten state as the body is charged with high voltage generated by yogic process. It would be difficult to understand by any way of communicating unless we evolve our mind and probably God selects few such soul for a specific duty larger than the size and for creating the balance or bringing back the disturbed nature in control. Thus the question remains hypothetical in our own awareness. ",

            "answer_text": "No, when a mind becomes empty of thought, and knows it, it is the same mind again. It is just a projection of the same mind and not a state of thoughtlessness. No mind is quite a different proposition. No mind is akin to deep, dreamless sleep, known as Sushupati, the third state after Jagruti and Swapna avastha. For example, when we wake up after a good night's sleep, especially after a deep dreamless sleep, we usually exclaim that I had a very refreshing sleep in the night. It means in a state of Sushupati, something or someone is there, who is awake to the phenomenon of a deep, refreshing sleep. This phenomenon is the witness or Sakshi, the state of no mind. Similarly in a thoughtless state of mind, there will be no mind but this witness shall be the experiencer of this state. As Krishna has said in the Gita \u201c the yogi is awake when the whole world is asleep\u201d, it means that a yogi is asleep in the body but his witness or Sakshi is awake. ",

For example Kaam, Sex; I use this particular example because almost all grown ups have experienced it intimately so we'll understand clearly. So now you are doing something like working, I was studying the other day and suddenly I became horny. Now it depends on the intensity of the horniness and my will power that I don't allow Thoughts related to that to form in my Mind. If I did that and those thoughts invariably are about things and people. So a Bhav emerged IN ME, I ALLOWED IT TO HAVE A SHAPE, FORM A SHAPE THROUGH (MY)THOUGHTS, OF A FEMALE FROM, I AM MORE OR LESS GONE AT THAT POINT OF TIME.

But dont worry, continue your practice. Over a period of time you will realise the difference. For many people they dont even know that once upon a time they were trapped in a thought that they are aware.Its good that you got this doubt. The property of a thought is that it involves a stress. and when you relax your face, soldier, stomach etc. then your awareness is absolute. If \u2018I am aware is first thought then \u2018really am I aware?\u2019 is definitely a second thought. So never investigate ? accept everything. the natural tendency of thought is impermanent. they will leave you naturally. let them go. ",
