            "answer_text": "Anarchism is the most misunderstood ideology in the world; It does not mean lawlessness or chaos but on the contrary, organic order. On the individual level, it means self-rule, without external force or pressure; autonomy is the anarchism of the individual. On the social level, it means self-government, whether the community is a workplace (where workers would own and run the enterprise) or a city, which would be self-governing if managers were democratically chosen and accountable. As much as possible, direct democracy is used. Where it is not possible (Mondragon is an anarchist coop in Spain with 80,000 members so not every issue can be settled with direct democracy), proportional representation enables a form of self-government which is democratic and accountable. Anarchists prefer as much decentralized rule as possible\u2026\u2026tho communities run democratically qualify as being self-governed. Anarchist place great value on individualism, the ability of the individual to make his own decisions and create his own reality, within limits imposed by the rights of others. But anarchists, historically, have put great weight on community, thus the related concepts of communitarianism, at one level, communism at another, where the value of the community is promoted in order that it can produce strong individuals. Sick societies produce sick individuals. Self-reliant communities, composed of equals, produce strong individuals. And so the core value of anarchism, as the foundation of self-government, is equality, where each individual has infinite value and there is no hierarchy of inferiors and superiors, no chains of command. When a leader is needed for a specific chore, the people involved choose the leader and the conditions under which she will rule, which is conditional and temporary. For in anarchism, there is no ruling class, no masters and slaves, no permanent rulers\u2026\u2026\u2026the collective of individuals is sovereign, and no one has any more inherent power than anyone else, from the infant to the elderly. Anarchism is also a strategy which comes into being when the state fails, when society is unable to meet the needs of its members, when power is so corrupt or incompetent it cannot govern. When that happens, people fall back on themselves and wittingly or unwittingly adopt anarchist principles to form an informal compact, an unofficial economy, and a way of doing things under the radar that permits basic needs to be met. In this sense, anarchism is the default operating system for society when the motherboard breaks down. People organize themselves, barter, trade, help out, and we see this in neighbors pitching in voluntarily to help another neighbor whose house has burnt down, or who has suffered a serious accident. Voluntary mutual aid is another term for anarchism, and this is what we see when the community serves those in need. The essence of anarchism, therefore is resistance to imposed or external rule, rejection of hierarchy, and on the positive side, voluntary mutual aid based on equality and respect for each other, with democratic rules and a final goal of both community co-operation and personal autonomy, which from an anarchists eyes, are not contradictions but complementary. And so, for anarchists, there can be no freedom without equality, no strong community bonds without personal autonomy. This is the synthesis that classical liberalism and neo-liberalism (ie capitalism) denies but which is at the heart of anarchist philosophy and thus makes it the most feared element (and therefore demonized as chaotic and evil) that the capitalist ruling class deals with. For unlike a foreign enemy, who can be defeated, the concept of equality and autonomy and a non-hierarchical system of rule cannot be defeated, for it dwells in the heart of every soul who yearns to be free., and tho you can kill or persecute the anarchist, you cannot kill the idea\u2026or the longing for freedom from external control.

            "answer_text": "The only thing shared by all anarchists is a rejection of political government. There are a variety of bases for this rejection, which defines different kinds of anarchist. Anarcho-capitalists, for example, believe that Adam Smith\u2019s invisible hand can not only direct private interests to what is needed to keep a market economy to the satisfaction of buyers and sellers but also believe that it can direct private interest to provide corrective justice, that is, justice for breaches of expected conduct and to provide expectations that others will respect their liberties and will resolve conflicts of interest fairly. It is probably best not to ask too closely how Adam Smith\u2019s invisible hand will produce what the invisible hand itself presupposes. Left wing anarchists claim that people will cooperate fairly with others and nearly always avoid breaching socially accepted rules, without assurance of any kind from a state and assurance only from knowing that others will invariably ostracise those who breach socially accepted rules against wrongdoing. The anarchism common among some Americans, which relies on militias to provide \u201cself-help\u201d justice, often seems to those not involved to be an extension of injustice. ",
