            "answer_text": "This is a very normal fear. I used to have it too. My way of coping with scary stuff is to study it. I\u2019ve got a lot of experiance with death. I\u2019ve had to say goodbye to many loved ones over the years. I\u2019ve sat with the dying, watched people and animals dying, helped the dying finish dying, and been close to death myself. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time wandering through cemeteries in contemplation. I\u2019ve sifted through countless sources on the subject of dying\u2026religious texts, cultural thoughts, scientific data, personal experiences, professional experiences, and near-death experiences. I\u2019ve honestly lost my fear of death from this. I really don\u2019t think what it\u2019s actually like is what our fears expect it to be like. From what I\u2019ve seen and from what I\u2019ve read from other people, it doesn\u2019t seem like a necessarily bad thing at all. It can be of course, but it looks more to me like the active dying bit can be bad, not so much actual death. Birth is much the same way. The vast majority of accounts from people who have been clinically dead and brought back have most of them describing an overwhelming sense of peace and contentment like they\u2019ve never felt before. Whatever pain or fear they had felt previously goes away totally or stops being relevant. They might feel a bit of confusion at first, but they usually become quickly aware that they are dead, and they know that everything is okay. It\u2019s okay to be dead. It\u2019s normal and we all go through it. After that it seems to be individual in experiance. Some meet religious figures, some meet loving family who passed on before them, and they just feel connected to all things. Often they say they felt more overwhelmingly alive than they did before their near-death experiance. There are still many questions. Is it real? Do we really go somewhere? Is there an afterlife? Is it simply the final imaginings of a dying brain protecting itself before oblivion? We don\u2019t know, but either way, we\u2019re going to be OK. Here\u2019s a couple resources for you. Near Death Experience Research Foundation \u2014 Look through hundreds of thousands of stories of near death experiences. NDERF Home Page Some advice from a mortician about meditating on death.  ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone is scared of death and anyone who says they aren't is either lying or insane. Most are blissfully unaware of that fear because we live comfortable lives, trying our best to press on and live well while thoughts of our inevitable demise seem counterproductive. Even the most downtrodden among us, those living in truly reprehensible conditions are perpetually looking towards a brighter future, pushing death back into the farthest reaches of their minds. Personally, I don't believe it possible to truly understand how profound and terrifying death is until faced with it; Like there's a subconscious block in our brains that prevents us from considering the subject until we are forced to, possibly in order to protect us from being consumed by the thought since there are a ridiculous amount potential ways we could die every day and always considering them is no way to live. I would think most will easily admit that \u201ceveryone is going to die eventually\u201d but I also think they haven't the slightest clue just how badly they don't want to die today. Your deeper awareness of death can either be a major advantage or disadvantage for you depending on what you do with that feeling. If you have thought about death enough to make you ask this question, this isn't something you will be able to just brush off. You have to confront the fear and make a choice. You could start living in constant dread and paranoia of your inevitable end which will cause stagnation, decay, and misery. Or you can accept death and face it with courage which will give you fulfillment and strength. Don't shy away from the thought of death and let it encourage you to live a life full of appreciation for every second. The clock is running but it's up to you how to view that. It can be depressing thinking about how time is running out, but it can also be liberating thinking about how we have any time at all and that we are able to choose what to do with it. Let death teach you not to take any day for granted and go to sleep at night fulfilled knowing you gave it all you got that day. I have personally known people who were ready to die on their death bed because of what they achieved during their lifetime. I would suggest trying to become one of these people. As for the soul, science has never disproven its existence and never will. Science has never disproven God either and also never will. Whether you are a theist or atheist is none of my business, but don't be fooled. Both are choices, both are beliefs that take faith. If a belief in a soul or of a god comforts you then by all means have faith. If the atheists are correct than there is no consequence to being wrong and we will cease to exist all the same, regardless of our beliefs. All I can say is be strong. We will all die and some of us will be ready and some will not be. Find what drives you and live in a way that will leave you without regrets. Best of luck to you on your journey. Who knows, we may see each other on the other side some day. ",
