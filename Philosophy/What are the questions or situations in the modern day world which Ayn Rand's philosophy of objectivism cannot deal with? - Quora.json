            "answer_text": "Ayn Rand\u2019s philosophy could deal with quite a lot if it is properly applied. Problem is that Rand died and some people wanted to solidify the philosophy. Rand was continuously expanding and tweaking her philosophy but after her death it became rigid and stopped evolving for a long time. I think that was huge mistake, if things don\u2019t evolve and continue to refine they will die. Objectivists fell for mysticism thinking Rand was always infallible and got everything right, that was a stupid mistake considering what the philosophy preaches. Rand was product of her time and she failed to apply objectivism correctly e.g. when she dismissed the sexual minorities. But that is her mistake not mistake in the philosophy. She was very confrontational and outspoken, these aspects were great help when she thought out her philosophy but made her fallible in other ways. She failed to investigate and understand quite often. But the whole society was like that and it was an easy error. In my own thinking I have toyed with the idea of investment. Investing in people is often a very good idea. I don\u2019t think objectivism investigated enough this aspect. Investing in other people is often in your best interest. After understanding this objectivism becomes much more warm and humane philosophy. One aspect I would like to look more into is to apply objectivism to information age, copyright and patents. Internet changed things drastically from those times. I think objectivism overestimated the humans capacity for determining best course of action to best serve their interest. While I think humans have free will I think it is very limited compared to our \u201clizard brain\u201d. People can understand objectivism but they almost always fail to apply it properly. To me it is unclear if objectivism is much use for us with our current biological deficiencies, or does it just need lots of practice before you can apply it consistently. Lastly, art. I get what Rand was going after when she was condemning most forms of art. But as an artist I cannot but to think she had too simplistic view of art. Sure, what she described was one of the most important functions of art but it was not the whole story. Different art has different meanings and she couldn\u2019t comprehend that for some reason and moved away from freedom towards some form of dictatorship in this question. I suspect she was bitter about her treatment, and that bitterness manifested in condemning other art forms. ",

            "answer_text": "I think environmentalism is something that Objectivsism has no real answer to (at least from what I can garner). Which is pretty understandable given the ramifications of human impact on the environment were not understood in the 1940s and 50s. But now we do know it and we know that unchecked pollution will absolutely destroy the planet. I suppose an Objectivists response would be \u201cObjectivists value the individual and would self regulate and limit pollution for their own sake.\u201d This reasoning doesn\u2019t really work because A) You could use it to justify basically anything, even communism. B) For a lot of, particularly older people, there is no personal loss from polluting the planet as they\u2019ll be long dead or too rich to even get affected by severe global warming, it needs a sense of community and geniune concern for the human race as a whole (and other animals) to care about climate change. C) The large coorperations intent on making profit clearly aren\u2019t limiting their pollution because the situation is only getting progressively worse as time goes on. In fact they\u2019re going to great lengths to \u201cdeny reality\u201d to obfuscate the ramifications of global warming for their own profits. People need some kind of government or international regulations to limit how much carbon omissions are allowed to be produced. Without forcing people to care and change they just\u2026won\u2019t. Tell everyone they can fish as much as they like and everyone will know they need to limit the amount of fish caught and allow to supply to repopulate, yet they\u2019ll still overfish anyway. This has been proven throughout history time and time again. People care more about immediate profits than long term sustainability. Only solution Objectivism really has is to chalk envriomental policies up to an exception, like how government authority is bad, but they still want the military. ",
