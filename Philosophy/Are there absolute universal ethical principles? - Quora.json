            "answer_text": "Hi, For us as humanity the honest answer will be: WE DON\u2019T KNOW. So why do I say that? Because we don\u2019t even know why we exist nor do we understand our nature or the nature of existence. So, many people will disagree with me on this, being arrogant and ignorant with their \u201cBELIEFS\u201d. I respect all of you regardless of your beliefs or mental constructs. They are all part of the road that we wander in life. Life is so complex, yet so simple. There\u2019s nothing absolute because Creation comes out of consciousness. Creation is done by ALL humans everyday whether by physical, emotional or mental creation. Most of us have NO CLUE what we create because we\u2019re not conscious enough to see the effects of what we do. Everything we create has effect whether you believe or not. Some people have a more developed consciousness and they have some ability to see this. We act on our individual understanding or in a group understanding but to see the \u201cBig Picture\u201d is where we fail. Humans reflect the Universe very much in this sense. There are millions and millions of beliefs and understandings on our planet. Well, that\u2019s true in the Universe as well. There\u2019s life out there well beyond our type of consciousness. They perceive life totally different and they equally try to learn more about the universal existence. You could call these beings our elderly brothers and sisters. Man and other beings are multidimensional creations. They emanate from consciousness. Even some of our \u201cknown\u201d teachers taught this to mankind. WE ARE WHAT WE THINK. The Universe is constantly in motion, expanding (for the moment), creating, ever changing so you tell me how something is going to be absolute. Change is natural for all beings nothing is ever static. The only thing that remains true is: THE SOURCE ENERGY. All things, in all infinite dimensions from the smallest particle to the greatest dimensions are created out of Source. Source is inherited in all. Nothing can exist outside of Source. Unlike many beliefs on Earth where most believe that there\u2019s a \u201cGod\u201d that externally rules the Universe, I just wish to present you with the fact that: WE EXPRESS THIS SOURCE. WE GET WHAT WE CREATE. You want to see God? Go look yourself in the mirror. TRUTH IS\u2026.. So, ethics are based on evolution and understanding experience. This changes constantly as we grow in consciousness. Some people block their own evolution by being intellectual. There are plenty of intellectuals out there who wish to teach people \u201ctheir\u201d truth. Well, folks I\u2019m NOT one of them because most important for me is that you should understand things within yourselves because you are free beings with ability to create and by sharing your creation you may inspire and help others in doing the same. This is because we are ONE. A united mankind on planet Earth is one of the greatest challenges we face because it may decide our faith to continue to live or for this civilization to cease. There are old stories, legends that describe these kind of events in past times on Earth. So, shall we learn from our mistakes or just repeat them with the same ignorance? From yourselves, Ralph A voice in the Ocean ",

            "answer_text": "In my view, such principles are exactly what morality is all about. At least that is what morality strives to be, a consistent set of universal principles, applicable to everyone everywhere everywhen. That doesn\u2019t mean that the principles we think are ethical are truly such, but that this is the norm that we strive to reach. So on my view, if there are no such principles then there is no such thing as morality, only relative principles\u2014relative to time, place, person, like mores or manners. \u201cEthical relativism\u201d is a contradiction in terms. The more difficult question, of course, is whether there are indeed such principles. It\u2019s easy to criticize many such versions, but I believe something like Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative [actually he gives at least five \u201cformulations\u201d that don\u2019t readily appear equivalent] comes very close to being what we seek. Of course, \u201cthe\u201d CI is very abstract and unspecific, but what did we expect? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there are absolute universal principles, but they will vary from person to person depending on how she defines \u201cethical.\u201d My way is to define \u201cacting ethically\u201d is as promoting human dignity. Others define it as promoting wellbeing or happiness, relationships, love, communal amity, and as probably a few others I can\u2019t think of. Once we settle on the meaning of those terms, which we should be able to do, then absolute a universal ethical principles emerge. This isn\u2019t to say that those choices make morality relative. Most everyone in the world would agree, to a degree, to all those definitions, a limited number, but most would highlight one definition over the others. ",
