            "answer_text": "The tree is symbolic of life, growth, harmony and of giving. Trees allow us to absorb its many goodness, its energy which it gets from the sun, its essence, all that it stands for. In many cultures trees are like healers allowing to heal people, having medicinal properties many great men like the Buddha have attained enlightenment meditating under a tree (Bodhi). Trees have life, but don\u2019t possess a self, because if it did it would then have an ego, like we do, and if possesses a ego, it would be selfish and not giving. It teaches us about life itself about birth, death, growth, protection, nourishment etc. Trees in which ever form always give whether fresh air, cooling breeze, fruits, wood, there is no part of the tree which is of no use. Whether it is divine offering or for the funeral ritual or a marriage ceremony the wood of the tree is the most important element. Hence the tree is symbolic of selflessness. ",

            "answer_text": "With the huge caveat that I am not botanist, it is my impression that trees are not typically taken to have any kind of mental life. To be selfish or selfless is to act with particular intentions (i.e. I am selfish if my motivation is to benefit myself). Since trees do not have intentions or motivations, they are not selfish. There might be accounts of the mental whereby trees might come out as having a mental life (maybe some very crude forms of behaviourism). But in my view, that would be a point against those accounts of the mental, rather than a point in favour of trees, in fact, having a mental life (and so being able to be selfish etc). Additionally we sometimes talk metaphorically of entities being selfish. A famous example would be Dawkins\u2019 talk of the \u201cselfish gene\u201d. Dawkins doesn't really think that genes are selfish. It's just that they behave in such a way as if they are selfish. It's just a metaphor. ",
