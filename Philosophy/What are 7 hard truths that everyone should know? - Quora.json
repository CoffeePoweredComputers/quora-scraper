            "answer_text": "Not everyone gets their fifteen minutes of fame. I\u2019m not sure if anyone\u2019s fifteen minutes was an actual fifteen minutes. I only know that some people live their entire lives doing good things for many people. They added to the lives of their fellow earthlings. They made a difference in other people\u2019s lives and then they died. There was some kind words said by a kind few and then they were laid into the ground, and forgotten.By the time we are old enough to know better and enjoy life and be comfortable in our own skin, for many of us, it\u2019s already passed our physical prime. In fact, we may be quite unable to enjoy the fruits of our labor.You can be the best basketball player in your high school. You can be MVP of your conference. You can shatter all the current scoring records and be the local hero on the court. You can lead your team to a state championship. You can do all this and be the best basketball player many of your teammates will ever see play the game, and still not be good enough to make it in the NBA.You could play the guitar like Jimmy Page, and be able to go note for note with Hendrix. You could be so good that you regularly make people cry just from listening to how beautiful you make the guitar sound and still have to drive around and collect scrap metal for barely enough money to feed yourself. There are so many great musicians that will never get that lucky break.You could do everything right raising your kid, and instilling in him the values of nobility and giving him the best education money can buy, and in an instant a drunk driver could run a red light, or a young kid tired from work fall asleep at the wheel.Chicken is chickens.On average, your parents made more money than you, and your kids will, on average, also make more money than you. You were born in the worst possible time for the dollar. You know that $600/week Covid money added on top of your unemployment insurance? Guess what? That was a little taste of what it\u2019s like to have equality. Did you like being able to pay all your bills? Did you even have any idea of what that felt like? Or, what you might buy with money left over after the bills were paid? Did you feel like there was a mistake and you should just keep quiet about it and hope they didn\u2019t notice? Well, it kept happening. The checks kept coming week after week and now they are done. You know that little taste of equality you got to feel for once in your life? It\u2019s over now. You never made that much in your life and won\u2019t ever again. You bust your ass just as hard as anybody. You have the same bills to pay. You need the same things. Now, you know how it feels to be compensated for the hours of your life. Remember that feeling.! You\u2019ll never again meet your financial needs to live a normal life. You will go back to not quite making it in a not so fun existence. Now, if your break time is over, how about getting back to work, huh? I\u2019m not paying you to sit on your ass.",

            "answer_text": " Truth hurts, but someone has to say it. Your life is what you make of it and the only person who can help you is yourself. If you\u2019re ready to take personal responsibility and improve your life, I invite you to apply these seven harsh truths today. 1. No One Is Going to Fix You If you are waiting for a knight in shining armor to gallop into your life and heal your broken heart, you will be waiting forever. The only person who can help you is yourself. Be happy for the other people in your life, but do not become dependent on them for happiness unlike you like to be on a never-ending emotional roller-coaster that is far beyond the realm of your control. Are you alone? No, far from it. But no one is going to fix you, so it is in your best interest to take personal responsibility for your own life. When you do that, you\u2019ll discover you are more powerful than you ever thought possible. 2. Life Will Never Be Perfect If you are waiting for the \u201cright\u201d time to do something \u2014 pursue self-employment, begin a fitness plan, dive into the dating pool, or move to a new town \u2014 you\u2019re going to be waiting forever. There is no such thing as a \u201cright\u201d time to do anything. This reaction is based on your fear-of-change, plain and simple. If you keep waiting for that mysterious \u201cperfect time to act\u201d (please tell me, when have you ever experienced such a thing?), this means you will never actually have to take action and confront your fear. Do the scary thing. You will be so glad you did. 3. You Might Fail (a Lot) If you attempt to achieve an ambitious new goal, then it is possible that you will fall on your face while pursuing a said goal. Welcome to reality. It\u2019s time to change your thinking about failure. It is not a big, bad thing that you should be frightened of. Failure is a learning opportunity and nothing more. If successful people quit pursuing their goal after failing the first time they tried something new, then there would be approximately zero successful people ever. There is no such thing as a \u201chole-in-one\u201d in life. Do you want to know how many times I\u2019ve failed? Over a hundred. The only reason I\u2019ve managed to accomplish anything is that I am a firm believer in continuous improvement. If you fail in something, distance from the event for a day or two, because agonizing over the problem will not make it go away (and will make it a lot worse). Read a good book, catch up with some friends you haven\u2019t seen in a long time, or go on a nature hike. You will be able to look at the issue with a fresh perspective. After you have done that, ask yourself: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t this work out and how can I do better next time?\u201d This process very well could repeat itself several times depending on the nature of your goal, but if you keep making a firm commitment to continuously improve yourself, you will develop so much that the only option left is a success. Consistent hustle always wins. 4. The Past Is Already Written Have you ever made a mistake so monumental that you wish you could go back in time and do it all over again? Join the club. It\u2019s called being human. I know you might feel immense regret, but beating yourself up over something that is already done serves no purpose. Shift your attention to the present, where you can take control of your life and move forward into a better future. 5. Tomorrow Is Not Guaranteed Steve Jobs said it best, so I\u2019m going to defer to him for this harsh truth: \u201cRemembering that I\u2019ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\u2019ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything \u2013 all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure \u2013 these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.\u201d The next time you catch yourself playing the \u201cI will do it tomorrow\u201d game, remember that tomorrow is not guaranteed. Traffic accidents, heart attacks, and acts of violence do happen. Live in the present and take action today, because that is where progress happens. 6. Just Because You\u2019re \u201cBusy\u201d Doesn\u2019t Mean You\u2019re Accomplishing Something If you like to brag about how great you are at multitasking, stop it because you are only kidding yourself. Changing tasks without rhyme or reason is wasting your productivity, stressing you out, and possibly causing you to make mistakes. It will probably take you longer to complete two tasks that you are switching back-and-forth between than it would complete each one separately. If you want to save time, instead of multitasking, try grouping similar tasks together. Have a bunch of e-mails you need to send? Do them all at once. Have an article or essay you need to write? Get it done before moving onto anything else. Different tasks require different mind-sets, so focus on one thing at a time. Being \u201cbusy\u201d does not guarantee that you are doing something useful (it probably just means you are doing a lot of things badly). 7. You Have More Time Than You Think You Do You should eliminate the phrase, \u201cI don\u2019t have the time,\u201d from your vocabulary because it is profoundly untrue. There are 168 hours every week. Let that sink in for a moment. That is a monumental amount of time. Where could it possibly go? The average person spends 4.09 hours on leisure activities per day according to a survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Most of that time, 2.8 hours per day, is devoted to the television. I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t think watching TV does much to help me grow as a person. You could spend that time creating art that adds value to the world, reading books that will help you improve your life, or exercising for a better body and health. The next time you say you \u201cdon\u2019t have the time,\u201d change your wording to say \u201cit isn\u2019t a priority.\u201d No time to exercise? Your fitness isn\u2019t a priority. No time to prepare healthy meals at home? Your health isn\u2019t a priority. No time to do something nice for the love of your life? Your relationship isn\u2019t a priority. It\u2019s harsh, but it\u2019s true. How you spend your time is a choice, so spend it wisely. You also might want to check out this article that will help you get more done in a day. Talk to us I know the truth hurts, but someone had to say it. If you want to accept personal responsibility and build the life that you dream of having, I invite you to apply these seven harsh truths to improve your life today. Now I want to know what you think: are there any I hope these seven harsh truths help you improve your life. Tell us all about it in the comments! Source: Lifehack ",
