            "answer_text": "Let us generalize the question: What is the \u201cbenefit\u201d of being anything? Well, let us list the benefits: Social Acceptance. Lets be honest, this is an important factor in making many career choices.The want to discover something new, or create something: This inner drive is rather inexplicable, but is exteremly powerful if wielded correclty.Money(unfortunately): This is a prime motivating factor for many people. However, specifically to the philosopher, money isn\u2019t going to be a large factor-as for as I know, philosophers don\u2019t make a seven figure salary(There may be exceptions)Now, armed with these benefits, let us understand 1. In the case of the philosopher, social acceptance does not come on a large scale-in fact most people will not understand what you are doing most of the time. So, the nature of social acceptance is that of a recluse, in a sense. Although, within you field people may accept you.Now, 2., the most important one. With philosophy, I personally believe that you are not creating, nor discovering, but, rather uncovering. Regardless, it is important to use this when being a philosopher, and you must want to use this in order to perform effectively. .Money: Sorry, you probably won\u2019t be earning a fortune. Not a huge motivating factor.I guess that it, and thanks for the A2A",
