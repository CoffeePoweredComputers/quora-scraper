            "answer_text": "I\u2019m no philosophy expert (at all), but I\u2019d start with the basic concepts. Any hobby starts with interest and basic material. Wikipedia will give you the fuel to find whatever particulars you need. Start with the philosophers and basic schools of thought and whatnot. Go read whatever you feel like. Aristotle, Socrates, Ethics, Kantian ethics. Feel free to fall down the Wikipedia rabbit hole. Then, read a philosophy overview book. Then perhaps an overview book for whatever philosophy you enjoy. A good list of things like that here: I'm interested in philosophy - where should I start? What should a beginner read? After that, or perhaps before that, pick whatever primary source seems accessible or interesting to you. I personally thought that Man\u2019s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl is an excellent book and a great starting place for philosophical lines of thought. Although, it might be more about psychology.  Good luck! I hope someone far more qualified answers your question. ",

            "answer_text": "What I recommend is to look at current events and your takes on them and look to transition that innate opinion to some sort of philosophical one. Philosophy really is just thinking critically and analytically, but it\u2019s also super abstract. The way that one looks at real events can reveal to them what they believe about hypothetical dilemmas and what they believe to be moral. If, for example, you see problems such as collusion between church and state as detrimental, you may look to Nietzsche or Sam Harris as to why religion is often fatal for the wellbeing of citizens. If you think us humans are inherently selfish, look to Max Stirner as to how everyone acting in accordance to their desires is better for society. ",
