            "answer_text": "\u201cI think therefore I am.\u201d Rene Descartes. That is one of the best answers to skepticism. Not to mention, Descartes knew that skepticism wasn\u2019t an end in itself. Doubt needed to serve a purpose. It wasn\u2019t enough for it to serve a just deconstructive purpose. Otherwise, doubt taken to the extreme: Is deconstruction on steroids, which is to say paralysis or navel gazing. The utter death of everything of value.Or just a kind of me-first philosophy in drag.If doubt simply serves a purely deconstructive purpose\u2014it ends up driving out all thought, belief, and values. The problem is all trought can be framed in a skeptical way. And that is where the acidic and nihilism tendencies of doubt and skepticism. Human life requires faith, belief, and values. All three concepts are interdependent. They necessitate the existence of the other in the same way hope implies faith and faith implies hope. One has to doubt one\u2019s doubt. If Aristotle taught us anything, it is that doubt has to be applied with balance looking at both sides of an issue and with common sense. Which begs the question: Is skepticism just nihilism in drag? I\u2019m beginning to think so. One can doubt anything. One can be cynical about anything. One can have questions about anything ad infinitum. However, there is NOTHING intrinsic to skepticism which checks that slippery slope down to the abyss of dehumanization, death, and nihilism. One can always be skeptical of World War II. That\u2019s what the Swiss did. That means to save the Jews or to save anyone for that matters. The risk of being involved in World War II involved a leap of faith. The government and the soldiers involved had no idea how it would end. In fact, the soldiers from the North didn\u2019t know how the civil war would end. And our Founding Fathers didn\u2019t know how the Revolution would end. But they all took a leap of faith. Faith and belief and the principle of the whole thing was the antidote to nihilistic and self-destructive skepticism and paralysis.  In some respects neither is fully realized its own best version of itself. I tend to think Hume\u2019s skepticism fails to understand that life is risk taking and knowledge is never complete. Something at least Russell would recognize. To be fair, Hume was honest about the limits of skepticism itself. And I think Hume and Nietzsche are fully the best examples of how skepticism goes awry. As are the sophists, the cynics, and the atomists especially when juxtaposed versus Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Life exists in the realm of belief and value. That is the land of meaning purpose or at least the trail one follows to get to the land of meaning and purpose. That doesn\u2019t mean one doesn\u2019t evaluate data and facts, just that infererences and intuition from evaluating and synthesizing that data\u2014is the basis of human existence\u2014in terms of both surviving and thriving. To attempt to do away with belief is a fool\u2019s errand, and one that ultimately ends in vicious chasing one\u2019s tail. To not acknowledge the presence and indeed vitality of both belief and values is to ignore the vital oxygen being sucked out of the room. Our lives are dependent on our values for good or for naught\u2014they guide and motivate our lives.  Without inferences, without jumping out in faith, there is no \u201ceureka\u201d moments: \"Eureka\" comes from the Ancient Greek word \u03b5\u1f55\u03c1\u03b7\u03ba\u03b1 he\u00far\u0113ka, meaning \"I have found (it)\", which is the first person singular perfect indicative active of the verb \u03b5\u1f51\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03c9 heur\u00edsk\u014d \"I find\". [1] It is closely related to heuristic, which refers to experience-based techniques for problem-solving, learning, and discovery. Source: Eureka (word) - Wikipedia And eureka moments help us provide insights which drive the process of discovery and innovation forward. Certainly, skepticism by eliminating options serves a purpose too. But to think that skepticism is the only kind of critical thinking is to miss\u2014it is to think that only defense attorneys are critical thinkers\u2014 Life is more than being against stuff\u2014at some point we have to decide what to be for. This is the lesson of the leaders of history. And given that you only get one life, you have to pick well. ",
