            "answer_text": "That\u2019s rather unlikely. We do have dreams during non-rem phases, sorta. But you rarely wake up when you are in that phase. Most likely your experience fits with the vast majority of more vivid dreams that occur during REM sleep, when we are near waking. You actually might wake up a few times during the night, but then fall asleep too fast for the memory to consolidate and you won\u2019t remember it, these also occur in REM or light sleep phases. You also have multiple dreams during the night, but you tend to remember or notice only the last one right before waking up. Such a shame isn\u2019t it? ",

            "answer_text": "If you woke up in the middle of a dream, does it mean you woke up during a deep sleep? Quite the contrary. If you were dreaming it means that you were nearly awake. Dreams occur during REM sleep\u2014which is about as close to being awake as you can get without being awake. Your conscious is aware of what is going on in your brain\u2014random images that your consciousness interprets as a narrative. You do not dream at all during the deepest cycle of sleep when everything is almost completely shut down. ",
