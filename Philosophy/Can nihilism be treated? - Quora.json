            "answer_text": "By understanding how nihilism is created, Nietzsche overcame it. From Walter Kaufman\u2019s translation of Nietzsche\u2019s notes in The Will to Power : 12. (Nov. 1887-March 1888) Decline of Cosmological Values ( A ) Nihilism as a psychological state will have to be reached, first, when we have sought a \"meaning\" in all events that is not there: so the seeker eventually becomes discouraged. Nihilism, then, is the recognition of the long waste of strength, the agony of the \"in vain,\" insecurity, the lack of any opportunity to recover and to regain composure--being ashamed in front of oneself, as if one had deceived oneself all too long.-This meaning could have been: the \"fulfillment\" of some highest ethical canon in all events, the moral world order; or the growth of love and harmony in the intercourse of beings; or the gradual approximation of a state of universal happiness; or even the development toward a state of universal annihilation-any goal at least constitutes some meaning. What all these notions have in common is that some-thing is to be achieved through the process-and now one realizes that becoming aims at nothing and achieves nolhing. - Thus, disappointment regarding an alleged aim of becoming as a cause of nihilism: whether regarding a specific aim or, universalized, the realization that all previous hypotheses about aims that concern the whole \"evolution\" are inadequate (man no longer the collaborator, let alone the center, of becoming). Nihilism as a psychological state is reached, secondly, when one has posited a totality, a systematization, indeed any organization in all events, and underneath all events, and a soul that longs to admire and revere has wallowed in the idea of some supreme form of domination and administration ( - if the soul be that of a logician, complete consistency and real dialectic are quite sufficient to reconcile it to everything). Some sort of unity, some form of \"monism\": this faith suffices to give man a deep feeling of standing in the context of, and being dependent on, some whole that is infinitely superior to him, and he sees himself as a mode of the deity. - \"The well-being of the universal demands the devotion of the individual\" - but behold, there is no such universal! At bottom, man has lost the faith in his own value when no infinitely valuable whole works through him; i.e., he conceived such a whole in order to be able to believe in his own value. Nihilism as psychological state has yet a third and last form. Given these two insights, that becoming has no goal and that underneath all becoming there is no grand unity in which the individual could immerse himself completely as in an element of supreme value, an escape remains: to pass sentence on this whole world of becoming as a deception and to invent a world beyond it, a true world. But as soon as man finds out how that world is fabricated solely from psychological needs, and how he has ab-solutely no right to it, the last form of nihilism comes into being: it includes disbelief in any metaphysical world and forbids itself any belief in a true world. Having reached this standpoint, one grants the reality of becoming as the only reality, forbids oneself every kind of clandestine access to afterworlds and false divinities - but cannot endure this world though one does not want to deny it. What has happened, at bottom? The feeling of valuelessness was reached with the realization that the overall character of existence may not be interpreted by means of the concept of \"aim,\" the concept of \"unity,\" or the concept of \"truth.\" Existence has no goal or end; any comprehensive unity in the plurality of events is lacking: the character of existence is not \"true,\" is false. One simply lacks any reason for convincing oneself that there is a true world. Briefly: the categories \"aim,\" \"unity,\" \"being\" which we used to project some value into the world - we pull out again; so the world looks valueless. ( B ) Suppose we realize how the world may no longer be interpreted in terms of these three categories, and that the world begins to become valueless for us after this insight: then we have to ask about the sources of our faith in these three categories. Let us try if it is not possible to give up our faith in them. Once we have devaluated these three categories, the demonstration that they cannot be applied to the universe is no longer any reason for devaluating the universe. Conclusion: The faith in the categories of reason is the cause of nihilism. We have measured the value of the world according to categories that refer to a purely fictitious world. Final conclusion: All the values by means of which we have tried so far to render the world estimable for ourselves and which then proved inapplicable and therefore devaluated the world - all these values are, psychologically considered, the results of certain perspectives of utility, designed to maintain and increase human constructs of domination - and they have been falsely projected into the essence of things. What we find here is still the hyperbolic naivete of man: positing himself as the meaning and measure of the value of things. 13 (Spring-Fall 1887) Nihilism represents a pathological transitional stage (what is pathological is the tremendous generalization, the inference that there is no meaning at all): whether the productive forces are not yet strong enough, or whether decadence still hesitates and has not yet invented its remedies. Presupposition of this hypothesis: that there is no truth, that there is no absolute nature of things nor a \"thing-in-itself.\" This, too, is merely nihilism - even the most extreme nihilism. It places the value of things precisely in the lack of any reality corresponding to these values and in their being merely a symptom of strength on the part of the value-positers, a simplification for the sake of life. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In note 586, Nietzsche also wrote : \u201cA nihilist is a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought not to be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not exist.\u201d In other words, judging the \u201creal\u201d against the \u201cideal\u201d is the act of thought that creates nihilism. ( Camus noted that the great tragedy of nihilism is not the loss of the ability to believe, but the inability to see the grandeur of what is occurring. ) ",

Bipolar disorder can be treated. A philosophical stance towards reality? That\u2019s well beyond the purview of psychology and medicine. How about this? Can your ignorance about what nihilism is be treated? Yes, please for the love of everything that\u2019s holy take some time to learn what nihilism actually is, and stop listening to the religious dogmas that conflate it with depression, mental illness, and immorality. It\u2019s none of those things, regardless of what Jordan Peterson and/or your local pastor have to say on the matter. ",

Generally speaking, we judge beliefs as being either true or false, not something requiring \u201ctreatment\u201d. Psychologists and psychiatrists are pretty much the only people who tend to regard a belief as a symptom, that is, something arising from an underlying physical or mental cause, and if that belief hinders an individual\u2019s ability to function in society they will attempt to address what is causing it (but even in these cases they aren\u2019t trying to treat the belief, to cure someone of a belief).
