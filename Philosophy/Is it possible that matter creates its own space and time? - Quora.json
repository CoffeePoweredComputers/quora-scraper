            "answer_text": "Well, matter implies gravity with its mass and we do know that gravity does manipulate space and time. Gravity wells cause the bending and contortion of Spacetime, which makes up both space and time. So, in a sense, yes matter does create its own customized version of space and time with its gravity even if minute relatively speaking. Another interesting note is that thoughts themselves have gravity. We know this from the law of attraction. If we know that our thoughts attract and that positive thoughts attract all the more forcefully, then we can explain this by saying thoughts have gravity and positive thoughts have the most gravity. By association, matter that we think about a lot may then have even more gravity than normal matter and even more so if we have positive thoughts about that matter. This could also explain the strangely magical and strong allure of physical happy places like Disney World. There are tons of sites around the world that many people visit far more by comparison but not with such fond memories. Perhaps the positive thoughts by many humans about specific physical things affords that special gravity which literally can change the fabric of space and time around that \u201cstuff\u201d by association.

            "answer_text": "No. Space is conserved, meaning it is not created or destroyed, but it is transformed. Time is a tad more ambiguous because it has various forms and potentials, some of which are created, while others are conserved. Matter is a very broad term, but all matter consists of conserved thermal value with an entropy configuration localizing as a spacetime definition. Entropy is a temporal variable, a form of dilation that is conserved. Dilation encapsulates a material identity into an inertial reference frame separating objects in time.  Matter is created by bringing into focus and kinetically mixing thermal and entropy values to create a local spacetime event. It sounds simple. In some ways it is. How each is treated as an axis, how those axes are put together, and in what proportion accounts for all perturbations of virtual matter and singularities. From that derive our familiar world of atoms, molecules, etc. ",
