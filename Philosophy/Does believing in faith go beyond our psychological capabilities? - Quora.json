            "answer_text": "For the average person \u2026 No \u2026 faith is not beyond their psychological capabilities. Two opposite examples: ( 1 ) Some people have faith in religious pastors preaching a literal hellfire torture forever, \u2026since their parents and loving grandparents taught them that way. (2) Some other people became disenchanted with Religion and came to have faith in scientific explanations of \u201cEvolution\u201d without any mention of God as the Creator and they teach their children the same. Both of these 2 groups have average people leading normal lives. But some people make things more exaggerated and complicated until faith is out of balance. You can find unreasonable people on both sides of almost any topic. Think about militant religious fanatics or zealots who want to judge and kill others that don't agree with them, \u2026without waiting for God to do the judging. Or, think about different political concepts worldwide as in World Wars 1 and 2. Careful students of the Bible do not accept what traditional religions teach about \u201chell\" nor do they accept the \u201ctrinity\"\u2026nor \u201ccreationism\u201d nor many other topics. --John 8:31-32. 2 Peter 2:1-3.

            "answer_text": "Yes. God created everything. EVERYTHING. He can make the desires of your heart reality. Sometimes our desires are way bigger than our current circumstances and bigger than our human psychi can comprehend. God's love for us is more than most believers can process. I've had God open doors that I couldn't open without him. Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\" Hebrews 11: 1 ",
