            "answer_text": "Neil Gaiman once neatly addressed this, writing, \u201cFirst there was nothing, which exploded.\u201d The deal is, nobody knows the answer to your question, so any answer will be speculation; some grounded in a bit of science and math, some pseudo science, and some just guesswork. One notion is that the universe is cyclic; that it bounces from bang expansion to crunch contraction. Two problems with this are immediate: 1. It just puts off the idea of absolute creation to some never-never distant past where your question would still apply; and, 2. There is zero evidence that the universe is doing anything but accelerating its expansion with little to no argument for gravitational collapse. All other ideas currently take us only (!) back to a few fractions of a second after the Big Bang, describing an unimaginable primordial plasma stew wherein the basic stuff of the universe is thought to have emerged as things settled down. Your question gets us to that old but charming question about what holds up the Earth. \u201cThe Earth rests on the back of a turtle,\u201d was the reply. \u201cWell, what holds up THAT turtle?\u201d \u201cAnother turtle!\u201d \u201cAnd below that one?\u201d \u201cLook, it\u2019s just turtles\u2026 all the way down!\u201d By this, I mean to say that no matter what we might end up with; no matter how simple, how elemental the ultimate bits we determine lay at the source of the Big Bang, we will still be stuck with the question of where any such thing came from. I have suggested elsewhere (The Structure of Space - Amazon) the the origin of things may not be things at all, but in the nature of space, specifically the Planck-Einstein vacuum energy. Max Planck and Einstein calculated a tiny minimum of energy resident in a Planck volume. Given that energy is expressed as a frequency, that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle would suggest that such frequencies will vary over the the vast expanse of space, and that mass (stuff) is expressable as a energy/frequency (E equals MC squared) \u2014 given those three propositions, I imagine that space itself would of a certainty create matter and all that comes with it. Of course, that leads us once more to a narrower, but equally pesky question: Where did space come from? ",

            "answer_text": "Imagine a stuff that cannot be created or destroyed, of which there is a good deal in existence, what would it be? Energy. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. This gives you a sense of what energy is: the most fundamental and simplest substance in the world. Since energy is the only thing that can exist before anything else does, the Big Bang had to start from an initial reservoir of energy. Picture a body so archaic that it lacks space, time, matter or gravitation. It is made of uncountable energy bits, quanta. Imagine now that a region of this body undergoes a spontaneous quantum fluctuation. It goes from a state of higher energy to a more stable state of lower energy by producing a bubble that spreads at a speed close to that of light. This gives you space. Inside the bubble walls, the very simple quanta self-assemble into more complex objects that further accrete into very large objects. This gives you matter. Lastly, the matter-energy density within the bubble gives space its geometrical properties. This gives you gravity. This is how you start a universe just from energy. There is more to this story\u2026 What was before the Big Bang? Before the Big Bang there was an energy singularity with no space, time, matter or gravitation, and zero density. There is a way to \u201csee\u201d this primeval body; it cannot disappear without causing every object spawned by it to also vanish. By lacking spacetime the energy singularity appears to have existed \u201cthen\u201d, continues to exist now, and will remain undisturbed in its \u201cplace\u201d even if our universe disappears. Why do cosmologists disagree on what existed before the Big Bang? The tested instrument that made the Big Bang a necessity is of no application before the very beginning. General relativity concerns space, time, mass, energy and gravitation, but the theory says these phenomena debuted together 13.8 billion years ago, throwing no light on what may have existed before such a bizarre epoch. Events prior to the Big Bang are deemed to be unobservable, their information lost to us. Even in the face of such impediments, cosmologists lack no ideas on what may have caused the universe into being. Scenarios range from a universe undergoing an endless cycle of birth, collapse and rebirth; a mechanism\u2014eternal inflation\u2014bringing into being a myriad of universes, making ours a part of a \u201cmultiverse\u201d; the idea that the universe is confined to a sort of membrane inside a higher dimensional space\u2014the \u201chyperspace\u201d\u2014and many others, including the possibility that \u201cnothing\u201d split in two opposite halves so that the total energy of the universe is zero (0=1-1), have been advanced. Why have physicists never proposed a singularity made purely of energy? Physicists are concerned solely with their subject matter, persuaded that physics is a senior science taking precedence over the rest. Because this is also the general opinion, they overlooked the known solution to the only other two \u201corigins\u201d dilemmas. Evolution, an old subject. Science first stumbled with an \u201corigins\u201d mystery in the second half of the 19th century. A couple of English biologists faced a seemingly impossible question: were current lifeforms created in their present shape or were they descended from earlier ancestors? What they found was evidence for an evolution. A series of slightly varying creatures, increasingly fewer and more rustic as one got into the past, produced the astonishing variety of earth\u2019s life\u2014science now places a single cell as the ancestor to all modern life. The ensuing scandal was to be made worse by one of the two Victorians who clung to the matter in regard to humans. Did we also descend from more primitive animals? He said yes and devoted a book to examine the issue at length. What about the top question, the emergence of life itself? Before the creation of the first living creature there was only ordinary matter, so Darwin envisioned life arising out of self-assembling organic compounds in a \u201cwarm little pond\u201d bathed in heat, light and electricity. The key to all \u201corigins\u201d conundrums. Darwin showed how discontinuous, seemingly incongruous qualities emerge from an unbroken chain of events. His method to the origin of new phenomena was to look in the preexistent, simpler environment. By following it he got the right answers, twice. Humans originated from primates and life from organic compounds ultimately made of ordinary matter. Where the arrow of simplicity points to. The straightforward mechanism of evolution forces us to look for some simpler, preexisting body capable of spawning the entire universe. It should have known traits; it should be completely \u201cdark\u201d in our eyes and yet very visible if properly looked for; its constituent stuff should be very ordinary and yet capable of taking many different shapes. The law of conservation of energy. The law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. By this law there should be an initial inventory of energy to create the universe. Energy lacks corporeality and yet it is a real physical property. As a conserved quantity, energy is also unaffected by time\u2014Einstein showed that time and space are part of the same continuum, spacetime, so anything alien to space is also so to time. Lacking corporeality and time does not prevent energy to transform itself into other, even tangible, forms. The mass-energy equivalence principle. Einstein showed that mass and energy are equivalent. Initially just a convenient theoretical tool, experimental physicists found practical ways to use this principle to transform mass and energy into each other. Atomic bombs and reactors have been made to release huge quantities of energy. In the other end, protons brought to a speed close to light are made to clash in frontal collisions to produce much more massive particles than those of the protons involved. More complex, tridimensional mass, abounding in uncountable chemical varieties, is made of confined energy moving at the speed of light. The energy of the void. By the end of the last century, cosmologists found that the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate. A low-density, \u201cdark\u201d energy, first proposed by Einstein as a \u201ccosmological constant\u201d, is doing the pushing. It has been referred to as the \u201cenergy of space itself\u201d, the \u201cenergy of the void\u201d, or \u201cvacuum energy\u201d. There is a catch. As the universe expands, in order to keep the thrust constant, more and more space has to be created. At the scale of the whole universe, energy is not conserved; more energy is coming from an unknown source. The other space, the quantum vacuum. Quantum mechanics is the other general physical theory. It describes nature at the scale of atoms, nuclei and subatomic particles. It is inconsistent with general relativity because quantum phenomena have no equivalent in general relativity. One fine example is the uncertainty principle. Quantum field theory treats the void as populated by fields that never go away. The uncertainty principle forbids knowing with precision the value of a field at a point in space. If a point in space were to lack particles, the field\u2019s precise value would be known\u2014it would have zero energy. The vacuum is thus populated by quantum fluctuations, virtual particles that pop into and out of existence. Because their contribution is however positive, the quantum vacuum has energy\u2014even infinite energy. Unlike the constant density of the \u201cdark\u201d energy, in the quantum realm, the smaller the scale, the greater the vacuum energy density\u2014as smaller wavelengths traduce into higher frequencies. Calculations jump many zeroes when going from the scale of atoms to that of nuclei to that of a thousandth of nuclei. Physicists stop at the Planck scale because beyond this scale existing theories make no sense. At this point the vacuum energy density reaches 110^112 ergs/cm3. The measured density of dark energy is 10^-8 ergs/cm3. There is a gap of 120 zeroes between the energy of the space at the cosmic scale and that of space at the quantum scale. This disparity alone should tell physicists that the two vacuums do not refer to the same phenomenon. The energy singularity. The incredibly thick energy barrier\u2014much denser than matter\u2014surrounding the universe in the direction of the very small is the energy singularity. This body is so archaic that it lacks spacetime; this is how it managed to exist \u201cbefore\u201d the Big Bang. Since gravitation is a geometric property of spacetime, the huge energy of this singularity does not have any gravitational effects on our universe. From the energy singularity to the universe. Starting with the energy singularity, the first step to produce the universe is the creation of spacetime: a bubble, membrane, higher-dimensional world \u201cinside\u201d the dimensionless singularity, driven by inflation, a false vacuum, or some other spontaneous reaction of the original medium, such as a \u201cquantum fluctuation\u201d. The accompanying event is the leakage of some of the\u2014very simple\u2014bundles of energy into the new medium. The space-less quanta then assemble into the 64 known species of elementary particles. Thanks to the second-generation phenomenon of spacetime, quanta can further bond and aggregate into the tridimensional arrays we know as matter. Quantum phenomena and why no one understands them. The simplest parts of a structure cannot disappear without causing it to also vanish. It follows that if the most elementary pieces of our universe come from the pre-Big Bang era, we should be able to confirm this, today. By taking a close look at the smallest chunks of matter\u2014elementary particles, atoms and molecules\u2014physicists have \u201cseen\u201d them dissolve into waves. The particles reappear after some sort of interaction, usually a collision with a macroscopic object, an event called a \u201cmeasurement\u201d. Much of this process is actually unobservable; the waves are mathematically modelled and there is a strong indication that they are just \u201cprobability waves\u201d\u2014a piece of math\u2014describing unphysical objects that exist at best in some sublayer of reality. We have problem dealing with this other, subtler layer of reality because our mind is not well suited to ponder events occurring in the absence of space and time. Violations of ordinary logic by quantum phenomena. Nontechnical accounts of quantum phenomena have provided us with illustrations such as the following. Quantum objects exist as superpositions of different states; they can be in more than one place at the same time. An electron within an atom can jump from one place to another without crossing the intervening space. Quantum objects can tunnel through barriers. If one wants to know the precise position of a particle then one cannot know its precise momentum and vice versa. Quantum objects going from point A to point B follow all possible paths simultaneously. Entangled particles can interact instantly across space. One cannot observe anything without disturbing it. In these examples the concepts of space, time and corporeality are violated. The reason is that quantum objects lack space\u2014and hence corporeality\u2014whether immersed in space or matter. If freely flying when \u201cmeasured\u201d\u2014disturbed\u2014by a collision or obstacle, such objects behave weirdly. Depending on the type of interaction, they can show wave or particle-like characteristics, and the measurement of the whole set of their properties by classical standards, as if they were true particles, is unattainable. The origin of probability in quantum mechanics. Quantum formalism\u2014its mathematical apparatus\u2014cannot predict the outcome of single interactions such as the precise spot where an electron fired against a screen will appear. Rather, it provides the probabilities to observe one of the possible outcomes. The predicted distribution of probabilities appears only after many runs of the same experiment. Why? There is no equivalent between a \u201cnon-object\u201d suspended in a space-less sphere and one existing in space and time. Imagine a cat posing for us, in the dark. At one time it will be standing and at a different one, sitting. It can be licking its right paw or the left one. It can face us, show us one of its sides or appear tail first. All these are valid \u201cconfigurations\u201d for the cat to be in. Suppose now that we have a light that lets us take a glance at the cat each time we flash it. With each flash we will see a single \u201cconfiguration\u201d of the cat. In no case we will be able to anticipate it, all we will know is that we will see a valid configuration. The many states of the cat\u2014its entire shape or structure\u2014will be evident only after many flashes. Entanglement. The phenomenon of entanglement is especially illustrative on how a space-less object behaves in spacetime. Two electrons are entangled if the properties of each depend on the properties of the other\u2014the pair is said to share the same wavefunction. For instance, if one is in a \u201cspin up\u201d configuration, the other will have the other, \u201cspin down\u201d. While freely flying they are supposed to be in a superposition of the two states\u2014really an unphysical state foreign to spatial traits. Now, it is possible to send the electrons in opposite directions. Suppose that a measurement is performed on one of them. If the outcome is \u201cspin down\u201d, we will find the partner in the opposite, \u201cspin up\u201d configuration. In other words, the particles communicate instantly across space. Why? The reason is that their primary bond is more elementary, so it supersedes their spatial relationship. Conclusion. Four singularities: the energy singularity, the universe, life, and humans. Biologists use the term \u201csingularity\u201d to refer to events or properties that are single or unique, for instance, landmarks in the history of life. Speaking from a broader perspective, Spanish biochemist Juan Or\u00f3 says that there are three large singularities in the world: the universe, life, and humans. The problem with this statement is that there are two mutually inconsistent physical theories competing to describe Or\u00f3\u2019s first singularity, the universe. The solution to this conundrum first requires understanding that the problem of the origin of the universe belongs in the same category as the other two solved by Darwin. Once the necessity of a simpler body is realized, its nature is easy to elaborate. What follows is the question of how such a space-less, timeless body fits in the framework of science. Realizing its relationship with the many weirdnesses of quantum mechanics requires much harder work. At its inception, the present work had nothing to do with physics. Its purpose was to device a way to a science of the fourth singularity, human history, but that is another story. (1) Life\u2019s Origin: The beginnings of biological evolution.

            "answer_text": "The answer to that can be grasped if there is a model that consistently explains Matter, Space, Energy and that is consistent with everything ranging from Cosmology, Particle Physics, Quantum Mechanics, Celestial Dynamics, etc. There is a model that can do that. My model (the Hypergeometrical Universe Theory or HU) does that in a simple way, although simple is in the eye of the beholder\u2026 I created a theory where matter is made of space. This means that one can create and eliminate matter in a simple way. Simple although not entropically favorable. To understand how matter could be made of space, imagine that you have a hyperspherical, thin hypershell. This is equivalent to say - start with the surface of a \u201csphere\u201d, where that surface is actually tridimensional. Now, forget the extra dimension to make thinking easier. Let\u2019s go through the steps to make matter out of the surface of a sphere. Consider that the sphere find out that there is extra space inside it. That extra space will always be inside the sphere as long as the spherical shell moves at the speed of space deformation propagation (in our case that is the speed of light). Later we will address what could cause some extra space dilation to be left inside the sphere. ########################################## Let\u2019s consider the instant when the sphere started moving. At that instance the tangential metric starts sensing dilation. Let\u2019s consider that results in a phase transition into a fragmented space with the highest possible density in this Universe. That is the density of a Black Hole. That phase is called Blackholium in my theory. I calculated the density to be around 1E21 kg/[math]m^3[/math]. As the \u201csphere\u201d expanded at the speed of light, its density decreased into a Neutron Star density (Neutronium)\u2026 At that point, small density variations started feeding back Neutronium Acoustic Oscillations. You can see them below:  You are not seeing the waves\u2026.:) This plot is the side view of the Universe map on celestial coordinates. That is equivalent to viewing all around the globe on any direction. The Universe map is a finely aggregated galaxy density map, so this cross-sections indicate that at distance = 0.30 [math]R_0[/math], you can find cells with density 1, 2,3,\u202636 \u2026 This density map is not consistent with a single Big Bang. This is also not consistent with a 4D Spacetime or General Relativity or Inflation Theory. None of those theories has any mechanism to explain waves along the distance dimension. These are consistent with Hyperspherical Acoustic Waves. The overlying modulation is consistent with the Lagging Hypersphere (a parallel Universe made of Antimatter). ########################################### How did that happened??? As the Neutronium Universe expanded, some regions release free neutrons sooner than others. The free neutrons decayed into protons, electrons and antineutrinos and ENERGY. The energy released during the first 3012 years of Universe life was equivalent to 1E21 Supernovae. The localized energy created density waves (Neutronium Acoustic Oscillations) which amplified density fluctuations feeding back into the NAO. Those are the 36 Bangs in the Big Pop and Banging Universe Cosmogenesis Theory (part of the HU theory). So, the astronomical observations are NOT CONSISTENT with the Big Bang Theory\u2026:) It is consistent with a the Universe being born as a Cold Blackholium (147 light-seconds 4D radius). So, everything you hear\u2026:) might had been a big mistake\u2026:) ########################################### Now, let\u2019s talk about the Big Pop You have the information to conclude how the Universe was created. HU uses the matter=coherence of deformed space paradigm to derive Natural Laws. It derived the Law of Gravitation as:  Notice that small details of G being proportional to [math]R_0[/math] (the 4D radius of the Universe). This makes G to be epoch-dependent. This also implies the type 1A Supernovae are epoch-dependent. Simple calculation shown in the article demonstrate that the Supernovae absolute luminosity is proportional to[math] G^{(-3)}[/math]. This introduces a bias on the \u2018observed\u2019 distances of [math]G^{(-3/2)}[/math]. Correcting for this bias results in smaller distances. Below are the predictions of HU for d(z) (distance versus redshift).  This is the FAMOUS d(z) derived from the type 1A Supernova Survey. This is the Ruler of the Universe. Every distance is derived from this function. Type 1A Supernova (SN1a) survey is the only source of photometric distances. One can always measure redshift directly from what you see in the telescope. Distances can only be measured using Stellar Candles. Up to now, they were considered to be always the same. HU shows that they are epoch-dependent. Correcting those distances yields a d(z) that is consistent with NO INFLATION, NO DARK ENERGY, NO DARK MATTER and the HU proposed topology (Universe as the lightspeed expanding hypershell). HU d(z) contains NO PARAMETERS.  where[math] R_0=1[/math]. THE BIG POP There is a brief description of the Cosmogenesis in the article. It included dimensional transitions, etc. It is simple but it is also complex\u2026Complex because it requires you to understand the deepest connection between Physics and Mathematics. Let\u2019s start the reasoning by the time the Universe was already a 4D non-compact spatial manifold. The Beginning of times starts with the creation of the Initial Fluctuation (IF). The Initial Fluctuation is like a 2S-orbital like hyperspherical metric deformation. In our Universe, the core metric was dilated and the outer layers were compressed. Immediately after being created, the Initial Fluctuation started recombining (dilated layer joining compression layer yielding flat space). All internal layers (minus one) reacted. At the end of the Big Pop, there was one extra dilated layer left (inside the hypersphere) and one compressed layer (our Universe). The internal dilation layer propelled the Outermost layer and induced the Blackholium phase transition. So, the Big Pop is to be understood as the recombination of compressed and dilated layers internal to the Initial Hyperspherical Fluctuation leaving enough dilation to send out the outermost layer at the speed of light. This was done without a single photon, no heat\u2026not vacuum field fluctuations\u2026 nothing fancy\u2026 just everything reasonable and standard physics. It is boring\u2026 you cannot write a bunch of articles and become famous..;) In fact, creating this theory will make me no friends\u2026:) That said, it had to be done. I\u2019ve just cannot stand people talking about vacuum fluctuations\u2026Planck time.. Planck Energy\u2026 etc.. It is just unbelievably stupid. In Summary If one creates a theory that explains everything, the Cosmogenesis will also be explained. Astronomical observations are not consistent with the current Cosmological Model. We observed Hyperspherical Acoustic Oscillations (Oscillations along the DISTANCE DIMENSION) on the SDSS BOSS dataset. That is something GR, Inflation Theory cannot patch, place a bandaid (if scientist have the least self-respect). Some might try..;) Others will just talk gibberish\u2026nonsense and will look like they are speaking in tongues..:) ############################## If you like my ideas and want to support my effort to change Physics, feel free to purchase this revolutionary book at Amazon.

            "answer_text": "You're asking a metaphysical question, and so far have received physical-based answers, which state that your metaphysical question makes no sense. And to those for whom the Universe is nothing more than a physical construct or process, I contend that they'll never be able to answer your question - because so long as they maintain a strict adherence to empiricism, they'll never be studying a complete cosmology. Let me add that the physicists of our modern age as well as those from science's fascinating past are brilliant minds who amaze and enlighten me with their insights. And their reluctance to speculate beyond that which can be demonstrated by either math and/or experiment is not only admirable - but a far more difficult road to tread than those who take a more speculative, or subjective, or intuitive route. Beyond the realm of empirical science we can strive to reach answers that work for each of us on an individual level - but may only seem like speculative fantasy to those dedicated to the empirical path. Sometimes, I choose to speculate - because without speculation we might not have the thought experiments that have ultimately led science to some of its most profound conclusions. Your question goes to the idea of \"First Cause\" - an idea that has riddled humanity since at least our antiquity. In our modern times, I like to think of the idea of First Cause as the energy source that provides the quantum world with its measurable properties.  So what is this energy source? Plato might describe this energy source as the \"Eternal Is\". In one of his final books, Timaeus, he provides a cosmology that begins with a source of existence; this source is eternal and it is unchanging. It simply is - whereas we in the physical realm are in a constant state of change and becoming. This infinite energy source is nonphysical - and now I speculate - yet it communicates its energy into the physical realm through fluctuation that ripples into physical existence like directed waves. Our Big Bang cosmology is a large-scale example of one of those fluctuations. Quantum particles popping in and out of existence are small-scale examples of these fluctuations - or information transfers from the realm of \"nothing\" to the realm of \"something\". So again, what exactly is this energy source? For now, I think I will leave it there. I hope that my speculation has given you something useful to ponder. ",

            "answer_text": "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. In the beginning was the Word. God spoke the Word. He said \u201clet it be\u201d, and it came to be. God is esse (to be) or actus purus (pure act). The (uncaused) being of all (caused) beings. The I AM WHO AM. All things came from Him and will return to Him. This is not a mere medieval mindset. Some have tried to argue that the universe, prior to the Standard Model of the so-called Big Bang (BB), was caused by an \u201cenergy fluctuation in the quantum vacuum.\u201d However, this cannot be supported by the Standard Model/BB theory, which postulates that there was nothing antecedent to the BB. There is no proof that a mere \u201cenergy fluctuation in the quantum vacuum\u201d could cause something as massive as the BB, otherwise we will reasonably inquire where did this \u201cenergy fluctuation in the quantum vacuum\u201d originate and is there proof of its cause. Until then, the claims of theism on the origin of the universe should be considered as a possibility. This is where cosmology (science) could be used to corroborate theology (religion), physics to bolster the claims of metaphysics. All what we are saying is that Elohim would be a possible candidate to explain the existence of things in the beginning if energy cannot possibly be an explanation for the origin of such things. If there is no natural explanation for the origin of the universe, then we should look for the supernatural explanation for such origin. If there is no ordinary explanation for the origin of the universe, then we should look for the extraordinary explanation for such origin. Thus, I submit that the nature of material reality, which is contingent and transient, gives us a reasonable basis for believing in a non-material entity, which is essential and eternal, from which the whole of material reality initially came.

            "answer_text": "From my new book: Preface: Imagine sitting on a ray of light riding into the universe, you would experience that all time dissolves\u2014you become timeless. Everything freezes & goes by in an instant because you are entering an absolute world where there is no up or down, big or small. There is no boundary that can tell you that this thing is small and this thing is big. In other words, we are dealing with a reality that is not even black or white. It is total nothingness. This is why the light isn\u2019t faster, because you cannot get frozen twice. Or, if you could, it wouldn\u2019t matter. This is also why the light is constant, because it is absolute; meaning borderless/no boundary. But note that this whole work is my guesswork. But how can this nothingness birth our universe? That is, how does the no-boundary universe become the bound universe? How does the Absolute become Relative? Answer this question, and you know what caused the Big Bang. From our thought-experiment, then it seems that only this thing called speed (i.e., ray of light) is up for the task of removing the borders completely in order to reveal the no-boundary world of the nothingness. The next logical step would be to find a geometry that is built for ultimate speed. The cuboctahedron. Part 1: My free energy device is the cuboctahedron. The cuboctahedron is the geometry of space itself. When you fold the cuboctahedron, you get matter. So, matter is folded space. Then matter is unfolded (or however that works; google Buckminster Fuller) in an eternal cycle of life. In other words, nature is immortal. Now, place immortal nature in your car and there you go. The cuboctahedron produces a dual torus, so if your magnetic motor = a dual torus, then it can produce free energy, in theory. The cuboctahedron is also the nothingness that birthed all things. But how can the cuboctahedron be the nothingness and space at the same time? Because, if you unfold all matter, you get a non-relative state. Space transforms into absolute space. If you have two things, then you can say \u201cthis is small\u201d and \u201cthis is big.\u201d But if you reduce nature to one thing, you cannot say if she is big or small. So, before the Big Bang, the cuboctahedron was a great nothingness, i.e., a non-relative state. And this state does not have objects in it; it is neither black nor white or any color, but it exists. So, real nothingness is not the same as nonexistence. Then the nothingness collapsed and we get relative spacetime. In summa: The great nothingness does not lie outside the universe but inside it. For example, what form/shape is the universe? When I started out with my free energy idea, I didn\u2019t know the words \u201cfree energy\u201d would draw so much hostility. And the reason was that most people equate free energy with a perpetual motion machine. And a pmm = \u201ca hypothetical machine that can do work indefinitely without an energy source\u201d (Perpetual motion - Wikipedia). And if \u201cwithout an energy source\u201d is your definition of free energy, I can clearly see why all the hostility. Of course you need a source! That goes without saying. You know, I\u2019m not a magician! And I never claimed to be one. Which means, my definition of free energy was always the dream of free energy = to be able to sit in your car and drive it indefinitely. You could accomplish this with the solar panels of the future; just smack one of those babies on the roof and you\u2019re good to go. Or, if we live in a holographic universe, then maybe we could find a way to tap our sun, or any sun, from our garage by manipulating the 2D field. Ok. Maybe this is too sci-fi. Anyway, our sun will die, so this is not the ultimate free energy we are looking for. Then I looked at Roger Penrose\u2019s CCC (conformal cyclic cosmology). In this model, the unavailable energy will transform into available energy again without violating the second law of thermodynamics. There was one problem: You need the whole universe to make this happen. Then I incorporated the philosophical idea that you can fit the whole universe in the palm of your hand, if we live in a fractal universe where the part = the whole. Then we could, in theory, make the unavailable energy into available energy again while our universe is still operational. Ok. Maybe this is too sci-fi too. But then I discovered through my own musings that our earth is growing. And if our earth is growing, then our reality is drastically different from the one we know. Now we can find a whole new way to tap energy. In theory, you could place the earth-growing mechanism in your car or ufo or whatever, and then \u201cfuel\u201d will grow in your fuel tank. And you can place the earth-growing mechanism in your car because the earth-growing mechanism = the cuboctahedron; and, the cuboctahedron comes in all sizes. And if this is not the ultimate free energy we have been looking for, then I do not know what is. In short, the inanimate never became animate. It is the animate the whole way down. Part 2: Imagine Albert Einstein sitting on a ray of light riding into the universe. What would he see? I imagine he would see the universe as completely frozen in time. But, why is that? Once upon a time a Tortoise and a Hare argued who was faster. We know the story: The Hare fell asleep and the Tortoise won the race. In case you didn\u2019t know, it\u2019s from Aesop\u2019s famous fables. But what if we upgrade the Hare a little bit: Let him run at light speed. Then the Hare would finish the race before the Tortoise even began! The result: from the Hare\u2019s point of view, the Tortoise seems frozen in time. But now let us go the other way: We are sitting on a beam of light and then we hit the brakes. We hit them so hard that all time will pass us by. We see the future flashing by in an instant! That is how slow we are. The Hare falls asleep, and the Tortoise seems to flash him by in an instant. \u201cBut if I hit the brakes on my car, everything else is not speeding up.\u201d Yeah, but you are still sitting on a rock called the earth, faring through space. When I say \u201chit the brakes,\u201d I am talking about some cosmic brakes, not the brakes on your car! If you are driving next to another car and then decide to hit the brakes, the other car seems to speed up and vanish in the distance, but then you arrive at a new relative state. So, imagine hitting the brakes here too; and then you arrive at a new relative state. Hit the brakes. And so on. Tell me where you arrive in the end, if you had the cosmic brakes from above. You would think that you would end up in a non-relative state. And if experiment shows that, no, you end up in a relative state, then it is true: slowing things down cannot create motionlessness because in any relative state there is a bit of motion going on (which is what is meant by \u201crelative\u201d). Only moving real fast can create motionlessness because then you have no one to compare yourself with and no one to compete with. You have truly entered the absolute state of things. A third option is to move so fast that you create a tidal wave in the spacetime fabric so that all time (the tidal wave) will follow right behind you, speeding up as you speed up. Like a surfer, surfing at the edge of time! In our mind\u2019s eye, we arrived at, at least, two extremes of motion: one where everything is frozen. And one where everything is moving so fast you behold eternity in a flash. But here is the thing: If you are moving \u201cso fast,\u201d everything seems frozen again. So, aren\u2019t they the same point of view? I think so. And, if you have moved so fast since eternity\u2014since eternity seems to be what we are dealing with here\u2014you need to push your logic even further: From the light\u2019s eternal point of view, everything is neither frozen nor happening all at once, rather, we see a landscape of total nothingness. How come? Because if everything were eternally frozen (i.e., the light\u2019s point of view), then that means that nothing has ever moved and, if nothing has ever moved, then we cannot have \u201ceternally frozen\u201d either. Likewise, if everything has already passed us by, then nothing will ever move again. So, whatever your point of view is when it comes to the absolute state of things, you will have no movement, a picture that contains no stars, no particles, no objects; no colors, no black, no white; and, no nothing. Again, since the speed of light is constant, then that must mean that the point of view (of light) is also constant and the light sees things as frozen in time; but, this cannot be the whole picture, the light must see a great nothingness as things have not had the time to freeze in this picture. If we push our logic, then the light must see a vast nothingness forever. In addition, the point of view of light is light. That is what light is. That is, we have to look at things from the light\u2019s own perspective. Our nothingness must be the absolute realm from which our relative universe came. Note that my nothingness is equal to a point of view of no time (timelessness) whatsoever, so it is literally a picture with nothing in it: no black, no white, no nothing. My nothingness is, however, that of existence. So, there is a huge difference between nothingness and nonexistence. What do I mean by nonexistence? Well, whatever nonexistence is, if it was real, we wouldn\u2019t be here to talk about it. So, I guess the nonexistence is like the nothingness in terms of looks/appearance (which isn\u2019t much!), but there is a crucial difference: the nonexistence is impotent, while our nothingness is potent; meaning it has the ability to birth spacetime, even if spacetime is an unwanted by-product of nothingness-generation. People seem to mean nonexistence when they talk about the nothingness. That is not what I mean. I simply mean, no black, no white, etc.. However, if nature could accomplish this state of no black, no white, etc., without the aid of motion, then nonexistence would rule supreme. But the only way to accomplish real nothingness is with existence (aka speed). In my mind, that answers the big question: Why is there existence rather than nonexistence? The answer seems to be: Because nothingness is speed. And you need the state of nothingness for your cosmic origins because otherwise you would end up with infinite regress and turtles all the way. Well, just try. That real nothingness, which we actually need, is accomplished with speed, truly answers the big question. Ok. Let us try: If we assume that existence always was, then we arrive at a number of paradoxes: Imagine an object in your mind\u2019s eye. Now, trace the object\u2019s trajectory. If the object always was, then its trajectory is infinite with no beginning or starting point. This is a paradox. But why is it a paradox? The solution here is that, it is only a paradox in a Relative Universe. A Relative Universe consists of things that you can measure against each other. This thing is small because that thing is big. Remove the big thing, and you cannot have small things. Remove all things so that you have only the one thing, and you have created an Absolute Universe in which no things are small or big. In an Absolute Universe, there is no paradox because there is no small or big, which means our trajectory is neither finite nor infinite. Our trajectory is absolute, like our light\u2019s point of view (from above), and that is a whole new ball game. I maintain that Existence can always be IF it is absolute. The absolute state of things solves the inherent paradoxes of creation, so to speak. Remove everything, all the boundaries (small, big, etc.), and you get a no-boundary world (i.e., no small or big), which is our Absolute Universe. \u201cRemove\u201d the no-boundary world, and you get a world with borders, like our universe. There is NO WAY to accomplish nonexistence. In other words, you would think that by removing everything, which is every single boundary or border, you would get nonexistence. But what you get is a no-boundary reality. This reality exists. This reality birthed our universe. And get this: When you fold the cuboctahedron, you get, among other things, the tetrahedron. And the boundaries of the tetrahedron amount to zero, from the statement: the boundary of a boundary is zero. What does that mean? It means that the tetrahedron is the perfect candidate for the building block of the universe because it has one foot in the absolute world (its borders amount to no borders/zero) and one foot in the relative world (its borders). So, it is like a mermaid that can swim underwater and breathe on land, which is the perfect bridge that connects the nothingness (absolute world) and our universe (relative world). The tetrahedron might explain why a particle can be both a particle and a wave, because: It IS both a particle and a wave. It is a \u201cfish\u201d and a \u201chuman\u201d at the same time, i.e., a mermaid. It also explains why everything is connected and that a particle can interact with another particle miles away because they are connected \u201cunderwater,\u201d even though they seem disconnected when we view them from \u201cland.\u201d Let me paint a picture what is meant by \u201cthe boundary of a boundary is zero:\u201d Draw two \u201cdots\u201d on the blackboard and draw two squares which they live inside. They each live inside their own respective square and can thus not talk to each other. The squares are the borders or boundaries of the universe or simply, they represent the relative universe. Outside the relative universe is the absolute universe, this universe has no squares which you can put things in. So, the rule here is, if you put the \u201cdots\u201d inside the squares, they will have a defined position, but if you put them outside the squares, they can be anywhere they choose to because they have no borders (squares) that define them. (Now you know what it is like outside the borders/wall of the universe; which means whatever lurks beyond the borders of the universe is also embedded within the universe.) Now, imagine you are a tetrahedron that can exist in both worlds simultaneously. Then instead of two \u201cdots,\u201d draw two tetrahedrons. These two can talk to each other even though they are galaxies apart because they can enter the absolute universe and choose to communicate wherever they want. I hope this example helps in understanding \u201cthe boundary of a boundary is zero.\u201d (If I understood it myself, that is.) Alternatively, fold a piece of paper multiple times and cut, say, a triangle into it and then unfold the paper. You will see that, in the folded world, the triangles are one; in the unfolded world, they appear separate. If you are one in actuality, you can talk to yourself\u2014because your mouth is actually not galaxies apart from your ears! And that is what \u201czero\u201d means. I believe: The universe came from a perfect point of view of no time. Buckminster Fuller called it the vector equilibrium. And I believe that this perfect view of the nothingness can only be accomplished with ultimate speed; which means that, if any god whatsoever wanted to create a perfect nothingness in every sense, he could only do it with speed. The god that just \u201cremoves everything\u201d in order to accomplish the nothingness, would fail. In my mind, that explains why there is existence rather than nonexistence, because \u201cno time\u201d is a great speed. And this great speed is what the no time or motionlessness is. And you don\u2019t ask how the motionlessness acquired its speed when it\u2019s not actually moving (because it\u2019s that fast!). Then how did the motionlessness create the universe? According to Fuller, the no time/motionlessness/nothingness/vector equilibrium = the cuboctahedron. And the cuboctahedron is built for ultimate speed. I like to use the picture of a gyroscope, which is only stable (\u201cmotionless\u201d) when spinning! So, nature is a constant battle to accomplish nothingness-generation. That is what evolution really is. And that is it for all time! The purpose of life is sex! Sex is ancient! Further, the cuboctahedron is basically a dual torus; which means the dual torus has always existed. Think of it as a giant whirlpool. This whirlpool is so fast and strong that, from its point of view, it is in a state of no time. How it all started: However, we know that whirlpools can create baby-whirlpools, and if these babies are not as strong and fast as their cosmic mother, then we see a spacetime as generated out of a \u201cnothingness.\u201d That is what I have come to believe anyway. Time will tell. What is going on in our oceans is a cosmic reflection of the bigger picture, which would be kind of natural, when you think about it. However, on this picture, we also have cosmic evolution, because now the babies make new babies and we have the exponential growth of spacetime called dark energy. I believe that dark energy is simply cosmic evolution. But we haven\u2019t had our cosmic Darwin yet. The world is still waiting for him. The day he arrives, the world will see that our earth, moon, sun; galaxies, etc., grow(s) (as a consequence of this cosmic evolution). Imagine harnessing the dark energy to power your car. \u201cYeah, but our oceans aren\u2019t growing exponentially, so your theory fails!\u201d To that I reply: How much are you willing to bet? Think about our cosmic gyroscope again, which is only stable (\u201cmotionless\u201d) when spinning. Here you will see that the ONLY way to accomplish motionlessness is with motion. Nature could not magically create motionlessness in any other way and, whatever your picture of nonexistence is, at least you need motionlessness in your picture of your grand nonexistence. The thing is, real motionlessness contains or holds a lot of motion. This motion gave rise to our relative universe of stars. From here, the only way forward is to make copies of yourself. There isn\u2019t much else to do. So, evolution starts at the dawn of time. And from the fact that everything must copy, everything must grow. So, I predict that the scientists of the future will discover that our earth grows. There was no Pangea. And we can also see that the whole universe is a giant animal because of the way the universe must unfold (i.e., copies make copies). Everything is connected and nothing is random, which would explain the fine-tuning of the universe. That is, if you make a copy/baby of yourself, then you cannot just abandon it and let it die, you must integrate it; which is a principle that must stretch as far back as the birth of time. This all means that the universe looks like a giant beehive where every part is perfectly integrated and nothing is random; which must be the case if you want to seriously explain the fine-tuning of the universe. And when you truly reflect deeply on that, then it would seem to suggest that all of reality = one mind. That would be great because it may mean we\u2019re immortal! But, who knows? I believe in Intelligent Design: \u201cAccidental, random mutations\u201d never appealed to me. I never believed in it. When I first heard about it 20 years or so ago, I didn\u2019t believe it. After reading a lot of books and watching all things Richard Dawkins, I still didn\u2019t believe it. Sure, randomness can explain some features. But, are you really willing to go that far in order to reject intelligent design? No. Only intelligent design can account for the complexity of life. You know, life is a lot more complex than Darwin imagined. That black box is growing bigger every year; at some point you need to address it. However, my intelligent designer is not God. My intelligent designer is the beehive. You heard right. Look at the beehive: The hexagons fit perfectly into one another. Imagine a particle being like a hexagon when it is produced. The next hexagon will fit perfectly with it. It is intelligent design, but there is no intelligent designer. I think nature is like that. I think geometry is the intelligent designer. But Darwinians like Richard Dawkins cannot fall into the ID tank, so they have to believe in something unbelievable. \u201cBut if intelligent design does not even require an intelligent designer, then we as Christians are totally screwed!\u201d Yeah, sorry about that! But you still have that famous Max Planck quote. Free Energy: And if our earth grows due to some cosmic evolution, we may discover a new way of harnessing energy. I believe this will be our ultimate discovery as far as our energy needs are concerned. And the conspiracy theorist in me is asking whether it was this source Nikola Tesla was tapping. So, I called my new and old source for free energy after the famous Nikola Tesla. But by \u201cfree energy\u201d I do not mean \u201cperpetual motion machine;\u201d so there was a lot of confusion about that. I am not here to violate any laws of nature or man. If we discover that the earth is growing, then maybe there is something to my reasoning above. In summa: The cuboctahedron is built for ultimate speed. The ultimate speed sees a great nothingness. Which means: The cuboctahedron is what the nothingness is. We should all listen more to Richard Buckminster Fuller and finally write our theory of everything with a picture of the cuboctahedron/tetrahedron on the cover. Note: If you are struggling with the concepts, then maybe it is my fault too. Maybe I need to put every thought differently and say it with different words, so here is another version I wrote a time ago, which I updated quite a bit. And I think this version supplements the one you just read, so I encourage you to read both even though there will be some repetition. In the text below, you will discover the baby Jesus. So, go ahead, read on! Part 3: What is the no-boundary world of the nothingness? Imagine flying at the speed of light: You would see, I imagine, all time crammed up into a tiny spot\u2014which looks like a giant nothingness or timelessness or motionlessness. Maybe this high velocity is what real nothingness is. I believe so. So, nothingness exists. Nothingness is the fullness of time. That means nothingness has properties. And properties are exactly what we need to give birth to spacetime. But how does the high-speed state of the nothingness acquire its speed in the first place? The solution here is that our high-speed state actually does equal motionlessness. You don\u2019t ask, how did a thing acquire its motionlessness? Motionlessness is a state that can have existed forever. The only way you can create motionlessness is with a high velocity, like turning up the volume of some Cosmic Speakers and the sound will be so loud that you can no longer hear it; likewise, motion passes on and becomes motionless. But what if you just slow an object down in order to create motionlessness? That you cannot do. You will always have some motion that way. Again, the ONLY WAY you can create real motionlessness is with a high velocity. But that means that motionlessness, which is free of the infinite regress, can give birth to relative motion or spacetime. Richard Buckminster \u201cBucky\u201d Fuller found our geometry: This motionlessness or nothingness has a geometry called the cuboctahedron. Fold the cuboctahedron to see what it is. It is spin. (Or a dual torus.) Now you know the origin of spin\u2014why our galaxies spin. Spin always was\u2014and there is nothing else. If motionlessness is primal and, if motionlessness equals spin, then the most basic thing there is, is a \u201cfrozen spin.\u201d This frozen spin is by definition alone. And if you are alone, then moving at an incredible speed can actually = motionlessness. But the point is, our \u201cfrozen spin,\u201d (aka nothingness) spins really fast in actuality\u2014which creates a whirlpool (in actuality: a dual torus). So, the nothingness is like a whirlpool. Whirlpools have the ability to create baby whirlpools. And, if these baby whirlpools are not as strong as the giant, cosmic, \u201cfrozen\u201d whirlpool, then we see these babies as spinning slower and they thus become unfrozen and therefore MOVE ABOUT. Magic! That is how nothingness creates somethingness. God just taps a little on the cosmic brakes. In other words: You are moving so fast, you stop moving\u2014because you dwell in isolation at this point, which means you are non-relative, which means you have no one to compare yourself with and therefore you have no borders or boundaries as these require a relative environment, which means you have become absolute. But if, at the same time, you are a giant mother and carry babies that are not as fast as you, then they will move about. The Mother set the babies going, but nothing set the Mother going because the Mother does not need to move about as she = motionlessness. The Mother is the \u201cPrime Mover.\u201d Moving on: The real whirlpools in our oceans are a cosmic reflection of the initial cosmic whirlpools. I believe that the baby whirlpools equal evolution and dark energy. But, why is there nothingness rather than nonexistence? Answer the last piece of the Cosmic Puzzle, and you have a complete picture. If you want nonexistence, then you have to \u201cremove\u201d the frozen nothingness. But if you did that, you would end up with the unfrozen somethingness; like if you want to melt some ice, then you need to use some fire, but then you end up with the fire\u2014you cannot just use your thoughts and \u201cremove\u201d the ice. But, you do not want the somethingness either, you want nonexistence (well, you do not really want nonexistence, but you know what I mean). Then you \u201cremove\u201d the somethingness, but then you end up with the frozen nothingness again! Now you get angry and try to remove both at the same time, but then, if you do the calculations, you end up with both! There is NO WAY you can have nonexistence, which means existence always was. To avoid the infinite regress, existence has to start from a frozen state, or rather the high-speed state of the nothingness. In other words: We start with a motionless state, and then we remove it. We end up with a state of motion or else you will have the motionlessness again. Or, you say, \u201cNo. We end up with a state of nonexistence.\u201d Does your nonexistence move about? \u201cNo. It is motionless.\u201d So, how is that any different from the state we started with? You reply, \u201cMy nonexistence is motionless and it cannot create anything.\u201d I reply, \u201cYou cannot do that. Now you\u2019re just inventing stuff. Rather, we agree on one thing, which is the motionlessness. We need to find out what it is. If we can create the motionless state with the stuff of existence, then we have indeed solved the riddle of existence and given a satisfactory answer as to why there is existence rather than nonexistence. If we cannot create true motionlessness with the stuff of existence, then we have a real paradox on our hands.\u201d When you think about it, if you want to get rid of a state that is motionless, then you end up with a state of motion and vice versa: because if you replace the motionlessness with a thing that contains no motion, you end up with the motionlessness again. Therefore the motionless state is that of motion, it truly answers why there is existence rather than nonexistence. You can only accomplish motionlessness with speed. If motionlessness were not an extreme form of motion, then we would not be here. \u201cBut if you have a thing that is neither of the motionlessness state nor that of motion, a thing that truly contains no motion, you have a nonexistence. So, why is there existence, then?\u201c The thing is, a thing that truly contains no motion = motionlessness. That is the clue. If you have no motion at all, true motionlessness, then you are moving at an incredible speed. That is the only way to do it. If you wanted to create a thing that contains no motion that is not moving at an incredible speed, you would not end up with a thing that contains no motion. The clue here is to truly recognize what motionlessness is and thus solve the riddle of existence. You are moving so fast, you stop moving. You are moving so fast that you end up in a state of loneliness; so who can say that you are really moving? And how can real motionlessness be any other way than that of an extreme form of motion? Perhaps we do not recognize it because if you are moving at an incredible speed, you are moving at an incredible speed, which is to say you are not actually motionless. But you forget what it actually means to move at an incredible speed. It means you are not alone, that you have some backdrop that we can use to measure your status. However, existence is alone, so moving at an incredible speed can actually = motionlessness. In short: Existence is eternal. The universe has a beginning. The Ocean of Nothingness remains, the Cosmic Whirlpools come and go. That is, the absolute motion or motionlessness is eternal, but the relative motion knows a beginning and an end. In fact, that is WHAT a beginning is: a relative thing. If you are alone, which existence is, then you cannot possibly form a beginning. \u201cBut if the nothingness never began to exist, how come it exists?\u201d Again, my great insight was that motionlessness = an extreme form of motion. But, this is also true: our extreme form of motion = motionlessness. (See what I did there?) And the motionlessness does not require a beginning to its movement when it is not moving. \u201cStill, it would require a beginning to its existence.\u201d No. Then you are confused about the word \u201cbeginning.\u201d The word \u201cbeginning\u201d entails motion. But you don\u2019t have that because the motion you do have is \u201cfrozen.\u201d If you are alone, which our state of motionlessness is, then you cannot tell if you are big or small, neither can you tell time\u2014you cannot have what your clock says. Then existence copied itself, by making baby whirlpools, and now you can have a beginning (a Big Bang or many mini bangs) because you are not alone anymore. \u201cBut how can a frozen nothingness birth spacetime? How does that literally happen?\u201d I think the true clue here are the properties of the tetrahedron. You see, the tetrahedron, which is an expression of the nothingness (i.e., the cuboctahedron), is eternal too. That means that its properties are eternal. And the tetrahedron can take the frozen nothingness and unfreeze it. How does that happen? The tetrahedron, as we said, is a \u201cmermaid.\u201d Think of it like that. The mermaid can have her tail in the water/nothingness and her hands in the air/our universe. But at this point, our universe has not been created yet. So, what is the air? The \u201cair\u201d is simply the fact that the tetrahedron can express boundaries or borders within itself, and when you run the waters of nothingness through that filter, so to speak, you will see that part of the nothingness becomes relative and therefore spins with a fury. This spin can create our universe or is our universe. \u201cBut how can you run the waters of nothingness through a filter when the waters are indeed frozen?\u201d Again, you don\u2019t need to. You only need to place a filter within that block of ice, so to speak, and then the filter will do the rest. And get this, that filter has always been there because it is a part of the geometry that makes up the nothingness (i.e., the cuboctahedron). And that is so awesome it is beyond belief! At this point you want to cry! \u201cNow you are making stuff up! You say that there is a filter within the nothingness!\u201d Yeah, there LITERALLY is! Fold the cuboctahedron and you will discover the tetrahedron! The tetrahedron has ALWAYS been there! A baby in the mother\u2019s womb. And the tetrahedron has these boundaries which the cuboctahedron does not have. And these boundaries unfreeze the frozen. Like if you are underwater and you have a snorkel that points out of the water, then you can do the impossible, which is to breathe underwater; which means, you are not actually breathing underwater. Likewise, the tetrahedron creates these borders within its borderless realm, and that is what matter is: folded space. So, it\u2019s like you discover the baby Jesus and you know how the whole of creation is put together. (Not that I\u2019m religious. I\u2019m a spiritual person, but I\u2019m not a slave to any box, label or dogma.) \u201cBut when does that conception happen, exactly?\u201d Think of the tetrahedron like the film that separates the water of nothingness (absolute spacetime) from the air of somethingness (relative spacetime). That film, that thin layer of half-frozen water is always there, like ghost-particles always popping in and out between our two worlds. So, the right answer would be something like: Any particle popping into relative spacetime is the first particle that ever popped! But this is surely a cop-out answer! Well, that depends on your point of view. This is a paradox as seen from the eyes of the universe, but, again, we must view reality from the light\u2019s own perspective. I think if we had such divine eyes, things would actually make sense. But, again, things will be hard to grasp when we stand on the border that separates the land of borders (aka the universe) from the wilderness (aka the nothingness). We understand only in terms of borders and boundaries, so it is hard for us to grasp. So, it\u2019s like a chicken and an egg thing. But the good thing about the tetrahedron is that it can be both a chicken and an egg at the same time, and it\u2019s not a paradox. The particle can be both a particle and a wave at the same time. It\u2019s hard to grasp that such mermaids can exist, but no harder than when life in the ocean actually found a way unto land. There had to exist animals, like crabs, that had gills and lungs. And, in fact, they exist today. And when you put it like that, then it\u2019s not really a paradox. How? Because, you can say that two particles popping into the universe are both the FIRST particle to ever pop or, you could say that, fold the piece of creation and see that they are one and the same particle. You know, it\u2019s just one big blanket. One gigantic whirlpool that is always spinning and creating mini-versions of itself; and its core is timeless and its wings are our home. Or, you could say, the eye of the storm is the nothingness and the storm is our home. So, the \u201cpopping\u201d is eternal. There is no on/off switch. \u201cBut I am still struggling with: how does the actual timeless core make particles pop/move when the core itself is not moving?\u201d Because the whole thing is one thing. You cannot separate the core from the rest. It is not like the core makes the wings move. It moves as a whole. But the core moves so fast it has become timeless, and it\u2019s from this perspective we make sense of creation. \u201cIf I stood at the edge of creation, I would still scratch my head!\u201d You know what, I would too! \u201cOk. But HOW can the nothingness just exist, again?\u201d Again, nonexistence would rule supreme if you could logically create the state of motionlessness without an extreme form of motion\u2014well, if you can agree that you would need the ingredient labeled \u201cmotionlessness\u201d in the making that is the baking of your nonexistent cake. But you cannot do that, you cannot create motionlessness without motion, as our experiment with \u201cthe light\u2019s point of view\u201d suggest. In all fairness, this is an actual answer and not a cop-out. \u201cSo, you have single-handedly solved the Riddle of Creation which philosophers could not do for thousands of years!\u201d I think Richard Buckminster Fuller did that. I am only trying to understand him with my own philosophizing. And I do not have a complete picture; there are perhaps infinite more details to this whole thing. And I don\u2019t think I am spot on with everything, as that would be scary. And imagine how scary it would be to actually get the real answer! You know, there is no turning away from that one! Because you are either immortal or you are dead forever, and that\u2019s the kind of answer you will unlock when you solve the Riddle of Creation. And do you really want to know?! But if the earth does indeed grow, then wow! More: The KEY here is to realize that the only way our primordial existence can form a beginning is if it copies itself, which means the copies inherit the same geometry and therefore the same properties and abilities, including the ability to replicate. Which means that time is speeding up as the primordial building blocks make copies of themselves, and the copies make copies, giving us exponential growth (evolution) and, at the \u201cend\u201d of time: the technological singularity (?). I believe that this exponential growth is what dark energy is. From here, you will see that everything grows, including our planets, moons and suns. Evolution/spacetime = the \u201cbaby whirlpool.\u201d Then you replicate the said earth-growing mechanism on a smaller scale and you can drive till the ends of the universe and back because now \u201cfuel\u201d is literally growing in your fuel tank so that you do not need to fill up your fuel tank from the outside. \u201cThen you replicate the said earth-growing mechanism on a smaller scale:\u201d The cuboctahedron can be replicated on a smaller scale, so this should work. Couple this with Roger Penrose\u2019s CCC (conformal cyclic cosmology) model in a fractal, growing universe, and you get the fact that individual parts of the universe can resurrect while the big universe is still operational. Now you get \u201cfuel\u201d which will grow in your fuel tank and, it will resurrect, meaning fuel will forever grow in your fuel tank. Now you can create a world of abundance where everyone is happy. You can travel anywhere in the universe. You can invent the warp drive. You can make Nikola Tesla\u2019s dream a reality. But what does the CCC or something like it actually look like? How does it work philosophically? Let me try: The available energy in the universe is constantly transforming into unavailable energy due to the second law of thermodynamics. In the future, the universe will not be able to support life. But what if you could turn the unavailable energy into available energy again without violating the second law of thermodynamics? Say you have one corner with white balls and one corner with black balls, this picture would equal order or the available energy which life needs. Over time, you will have a picture with randomness in it because the balls would escape their corners and mingle into one giant mess. That is it. Death for all time! A \u201cfree energy\u201d device, on the other hand, would be a sorting demon, sorting the balls to their former glory. But no demon exists. However, the Absolute World (of nothingness) does exist. And this world is always spinning (our eternal dual torus). Nothing can slow the spin down because the Absolute World dwells in isolation. That is, if you have no agent or second entity that can change the picture, which you do not have because you are in isolation, then the picture will stay as it is. As the spin forever spins, it spins with a fury that produces a core that knows no boundary. If our black and white balls were to come in contact with this core, then their boundaries would cease and can thus be recreated. The next time our balls come out of the creation hole, so to speak, they can once more take any form, black or white. So, we can turn the unavailable energy (randomness) into available energy (order) again. But why does the nothingness produce order instead of randomness? I think it has to do with symmetry. Once a black ball is produced in one corner, a white ball is produced in the opposite corner, as it were. Then the second law of thermodynamics mixes them. Then we can destroy the balls and create our two corners anew. Note that energy is not created or destroyed. Only the boundaries are created and destroyed, as it were. Nothing is actually destroyed! If the symmetry (from above) was not eternal, i.e., embedded within the cuboctahedron itself, life would not be possible. A quick sum up: The cuboctahedron spins forever. This is not a paradox because the spin is absolute. The spin can then make a giant cosmic whirlpool from which our universe may emerge; that is, things cannot keep up with the fast pace in the center and thus become other (bound) than the fast pace (unbound). A group of people running together are bound because you can say, \u201cThis one is running at this speed relative to this one. This one is tall. This one is short.\u201d But say that one person has outrun the others so that he is all alone. You cannot measure him. Now, if this was the Olympics, then you can measure the leader of the race because you can put him in the same frame as the others, you just zoom out with your camera. But imagine zooming out forever and you are still not able to catch the leader in your frame: do you understand what the unbound means now? \u201cWhere the hell is he? That\u2019s one fast joker!\u201d Big Sum Up: My answer to the Paradox of Origins is that the cuboctahedron is always spinning; nothing set it in motion. This is a paradox, of course, since then the spin of the cuboctahedron does not have an origin. We have an infinite regress. My resolution to this paradox was the Absolute Universe/nothingness (the light\u2019s point of view) where the spin is frozen (due to spinning so fast). If it is frozen, then we have an \u201corigin\u201d (no tail, no infinite regress). But then, how does the frozen spin start to actually spin in order to birth spacetime? Here I introduced the Relative Universe where the spin is not frozen but spins with a fury. But how do we bridge the Absolute (unbound) and the Relative (bound) in order to make this work? Here I introduced the tetrahedron that can live in both worlds. That is, the tetrahedron can be a wave (unbound) and a particle (bound), and that resolves the Paradox of Origins. Again: If you \u201cremove\u201d the Relative Universe, you get the Absolute Universe. If you \u201cremove\u201d the Absolute Universe, you get the Relative Universe. That is, there is no way to create nonexistence. Existence/motion(lessness) always was. The Relative Universe (motion) cannot have always been in its current form. The Absolute Universe (motionlessness) can always have been. Now we have a complete picture where motionlessness (unbound) = motion (bound). Motionlessness/timelessness/nothingness is an extreme, unbound form of motion. By bound and unbound I mean: If you have a small thing and a big thing and then you remove the big thing, you no longer have the small thing because all is relative, but that does not mean the small thing ceased to exist; it merely ceased to be a \u201csmall\u201d thing. The relative (bound) became absolute (unbound). If you are bound, you are bound to be, say, small. If you are unbound, you can be small or big or whatever. The unbound = one. The bound = two or more. Reality is unbound. Then it copies itself and becomes bound. But the unbound does not cease just because things get bound. An island does not vanish just because you set up a border and create two states. Rather, you get a reality that is both bound and unbound, which I believe is our wave/particle reality. Part 4: Aftermath That nothingness equals a very high velocity may seem farfetched to some, but, looking back at it, then what else can it be made of? And we have motion anyway, so we cannot just sweep it under the rug and forget about it. I think it is pretty obvious that nothingness = speed. And that our \u201cspeed\u201d here = the cuboctahedron The cuboctahedron has an innate ability to copy itself; this ability is what evolution is. The ability can also answer the riddle of dark energy. The implications of this primordial ability or cosmic evolution are that everything grows, including our earth. The earth grows. As above, so below: A baby in a womb is simply a reflection in the cosmic mirror. The technological ramifications are vast! If we could replicate the said earth-growing mechanism in our cars, then we could drive till the ends of the universe and back without filling the gasoline because now the creation engine itself (i.e., the cuboctahedron) is fueling your car. A second ability of the cuboctahedron is that it comes in various sizes, so we can literally have the whole of existence in our hands or, if we are truly clever, in our cars. But that means we live in a growing, fractal universe. On further investigation, the cuboctahedron opens up for the possibility of the warp drive. This sounds amazing. But if the cuboctahedron is the blueprint of all things, the very fabric of nothingness itself, then all that which is possible must be embedded within it. For example: the blueprint of the humanoid is embedded within the fabric of the nothingness: the dodecahedron. So, nature had plans to build us all along! This eternal geometry might explain convergent evolution. Other crazy ideas: If we live in the holographic universe, then we might find a way to tap our sun or a sun in another galaxy, from our garage! That is, if we can find a way to manipulate the unbound world to our advantage. Although, at this stage, I guess you could just tap from wherever. This was also my idea of a warp drive: If you could find a way to enter the unbound world, you can go wherever you want in a second. But how can a bound creature like us enter an unbound world? Maybe you don\u2019t have to. Maybe you could take two tori and then cleverly configure them so that you, your spaceship, sit in the middle of the eyes (where the \u201cstorm\u201d is calm). Now you have one torus contracting the space before you, so you can travel long distances in no time at all, while the other torus expands the space simultaneously so that you do not get crushed by the contraction. Thus, you need two toruses. You remain unaffected because you hide inside the eyes. The eyes would form a disc. Yes, you heard right: The only way to travel in the universe is in a classic-UFO disc-shape! I guess a cigar-shape could also work. The point is, you do not have a lot of options here. This phenomenon could also explain why our galaxy is flat even though we live in a 3D universe. That is, our galaxy is being squashed by two gigantic tori. This all means that, if you want to travel in space in no time at all, you need to look like a galaxy in terms of appearance. Like a fish swimming in the oceans, it needs to have a certain shape that reflects the environment it moves in. The warp drive works in my mind\u2019s eye. But will it work in reality? We will see. To Bob Lazar: If the folding of the cuboctahedron equals speed, then the more you fold it, the higher force you get, which means heavier elements are more efficient at producing gravity. You need a stable element because you want to work with it. Further, you need a high-speed element because you want to create your own gravity. Which means, you need a stable, high-speed element. Element 115. To paint a picture: If you have a piece of paper, then try to rip it apart\u2014it is quite easy. Then fold it, it gets harder. Then fold it multiple times, harder still. So, if you want a gravity-field that does not rip apart easily when you traverse spacetime, then you need to use a heavy (more foldings of the cuboctahedron) element. (There is only \u201cone\u201d element in reality; other elements are simply the one element further folded). Plus, you are competing with other gravity-wells in space, so your craft better produce a strong field. Following this logic then, you cannot replicate the propulsion system with lighter, earth elements. Bob was right. It is impossible, at least if you want to survive in space. Unstable elements: Buckminster Fuller said that the nothingness (i.e., the cuboctahedron) is unstable, very unstable (see link below). It then collapses down to the tetrahedron, which is stable because it has more layers to it than the cuboctahedron. Like if you have a piece of paper, you can easily rip it apart, but then you fold it and it becomes harder and harder to rip apart. This is how matter is created from space. But if the nothingness (cuboctahedron) is unstable and matter is stable, won\u2019t all space be morphed into matter and that will be that? The bit mysterious thing here is that, if you take a bunch of tetrahedrons and group them together, they can form the cuboctahedron again. So, it all seems like a giant cycle where space in the form of our timelessness is eternal, and this space creates matter, and then the matter is converted to space again\u2014and on and on forever. In the meantime we have evolution, which is just the folding of a plethora of cuboctahedrons. Vector Equilibrium: R. Buckminster Fuller: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sM44p385Ws Nassim Haramein gave a cool picture of a bicycle wheel which has twelve spokes (see link below). Remove one and the wheel collapses. However, if you have a minimum of twelve, the wheel stays operational. So, you want your nothingness to have at least twelve \u201cspokes\u201d so that it can rotate and spin. And spin is what we want to create the motionlessness, which will create matter as a by-product. They say Nassim Haramein is a crackpot. I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t studied him in detail. In all fairness, the man can be a crackpot in terms of the point of view of modern scientists, but that does not mean that his philosophizing about the dual torus is worthless. So, you should not throw the baby out with the bathwater. At the end of the day, learn to think for yourself. The Isotropic Vector Matrix - Nassim Haramein ( Abstract from Cognos 2010 conference): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGGvwkrDZNA But this is all impossibly stupid: \u201cYou are saying that the cuboctahedron, which is the ultimate spin, must collapse in order to create itself again!\u201d Yes. You must spin in order to spin. What is so mysterious about that? So here is a clear picture (not that this picture will ever be totally clear!): the cuboctahedron, which is the vector equilibrium, is the same as the ultimate spin you can imagine. But the vector equilibrium is very unstable, so it collapses. This is the folding of the cuboctahedron. And this folding is what the spin is! So, it is eternally folding. But this made no sense because then the spin has no origin. We solved that by seeing things from the point of view of the vector equilibrium/motionlessness. The spin is motionless at the point of the vector equilibrium, which means it is spinning as fast as it can at this point. From the light\u2019s point of view, we can see this point. This singularity we dubbed \u201cthe nothingness.\u201d But this point is unstable, which it must be, because once you hit maximum speed, you cannot stop; you must continue to spin in order to maintain maximum speed. But that means the cuboctahedron must fold\u2014and we get spacetime. However, nature does not hit maximum speed, as it were. She always was at maximum speed, which is the great paradox of creation we tried to resolve. If our nothingness is a piece of paper, then you must fold it in order to create motion, which the cuboctahedron does. But, as you fold it, the paper becomes stronger, which we call matter. So, matter is literally a by-product of a nothingness that tries to maintain maximum speed. Matter is folded space/nothingness, which is our tetrahedron. That is, the tetrahedron (somethingness) is the folded version of our cuboctahedron (nothingness). \u201cBut space is not nothingness.\u201d Again, we said that space can be absolute. This absolute state we dubbed \u201cthe nothingness.\u201d \u201cBut why use the word nothingness about a thing that exists?\u201d Again, because, from the point of view of the absolute state of things, we saw a picture that contains no black, white, etc.. I maintain that this is what real nothingness is. This thing is blacker than black! It is not a cop-out. This is the real deal. So, I am simply calling it what it is. And who says nothingness can\u2019t exist? In fact, the nothingness is right in front of you. Can\u2019t you see it? It\u2019s right there! Literally. Moving on: As we said, Buckminster Fuller said that the nothingness (cuboctahedron) is unstable. Like if you try to balance on a fence, it is much easier to fall off than to stay put. And nature is constantly trying to make you fall off. And that is the big cosmic picture: nature is always trying to fold the cuboctahedron. She does not want to stay in that state. But she always tries her best to recreate it! And on and on it goes. But this is no more mysterious than breathing. Once you breathe in, you reach a point where you want to breathe out, then you reach a point where you want to breathe in, and all is done so that you can stay alive. Likewise, nature collapses her perfect state of nothingness in order to accomplish that state anew in order to accomplish the state at all! That is, the state is a system. You cannot just accomplish the state and be done with it. It is a continuous process. But it seems like a contradiction: You are walking down a hill in order to walk up again! Why not just stay at the top?! Well, nature is related to Sisyphus, I guess. Another example is football. You play a match. One team wins. Then what? Well, you play another match! And on and on. Do they never get tired, chasing that ball? And I will be damned if everything you see around you, from your own lungs, to sex, to football, to galaxy formations to, well, everything ... is just a reflection, an echo of the big cuboctahedron in the sky! Well, now you know what a theory of everything means! In short: You must breathe, in order to breathe. Nature is like a set of lungs. Or, maybe it is the other way around: our lungs are based on the eternal blueprint. \u201cBut if nature is eternally breathing, that is, an eternally animated torus, did she start to breathe in first or out first, and when was her first breath? You know, these details are important and should not be swept under the rug.\u201d The cool thing here is, the cuboctahedron produces a dual torus, so it can breathe in and out simultaneously. That is, our universe is expanding and contracting at the same time, which means she is not going anywhere but stays put in the nothingness, so to speak. Trying blowing up a balloon: when that balloon expands, your lungs contract. And it\u2019s all one motion/action. So, when some part of the universe expands, some other part contracts. And, in the cosmic mirror, left is right. Or in any mirror actually. The universe came from a state that knows no borders, so left can be right. A bit mysterious. But nature will always be a bit mysterious. And her every breath is her first. We explained that too (above) with our example where all particles may = one particle or field. And we can take it even further: When our universe expands, how do we know that that BIG expansion is not a tiny contraction? Because, how can you measure that, against what ruler? That is what I mean by the nothingness, by the absolute world. We cannot know if a thing is big or small in the ultimate sense. You know, the nothingness is not some land far away; it is right in front of your nose. The nothingness is within the universe. The nothingness is the shape of the universe. But the universe has no shape. Exactly. Now you are beginning to see where the borderless world of the nothingness is located. It is everywhere. It\u2019s like the Matrix from the movie. It is everywhere and yet you do not see it. It is in your living room! But it is unfolded, so you do not feel it. But if it folded, you would feel that, because that is matter-creation. Right in front of your eyes: Hold an object in your hand. That object is the nothingness in its folded state. Moving on: How else do we explain matter-creation if nature is not in the business of trying to accomplish something? Why else are you doing it? And the thing which nature is trying to accomplish MUST BE the thing which it initially is, if that makes sense. You know, just like Sisyphus. Why else is the rock falling down once you reach the top if not the goal is to push the rock? And once the rock has been pushed, it must fall down again so that it can be pushed up again. The falling down part is our universe, which is a by-product of what nature is actually trying to accomplish. Then you might reply: \u201cWell, that is the DARKEST picture of creation I have ever heard!\u201d Well, at least you know I\u2019m not religious. However, to make my \u201ctheory\u201d a bit more family-friendly, we could say that the \u201cfalling down\u201d part is an essential part of the whole picture. Which it is. It is half the picture. It all depends on your point of view, I guess. So, from another point of view, spacetime is not a by-product, but rather an essential key in the whole process (i.e., take a bunch of tetrahedrons and group them together, they can form the cuboctahedron again.) But who knows? Maybe I am just sugarcoating it, because, even if spacetime was the nothingness\u2019 favorite son, we would still not be the end goal. The goal is more nothingness. We are just a means to an old evolutionary end. We will never be the point. But at some point we have to grow up and continue to push that rock! That rock needs to be pushed, forever. So, on second thought, maybe WE ARE the End Goal because the end goal is the pushing (translation: sex). And what we do defines who we are. Or, at least nature will fool us into thinking that. Alternatively, I just discovered the Great Filter! Suicide or eternal \u201csex.\u201d Take your pick. Part 5: The Cosmic Omelet Think of the nothingness as the way you experience the act of breathing in. You breathe in and you reach a point where you want to breathe out. You breathe out and you reach a point where you want to breathe in. These points are what the vector equilibrium is. They are unstable and must collapse. And you can feel just how unstable they are! But what they create is motion. And motion is exactly what we need in order to solve the Paradox of Creation, which was: Imagine an object in your mind\u2019s eye. Now, trace the object\u2019s trajectory. If the object always was, then its trajectory is infinite with no beginning or starting point. This is a paradox. In order to solve this paradox, nature had to become motionless for real, that way, everything is neat and clean, no trajectory. But nature could not just do as some old philosopher and sleep all day in order to remain completely still. The only logical way to create the point of stillness was with motion. But that temporary creates a paradox she must resolve, i.e., relative motion. But that is ok. What is not ok is to state that nature could do some magic trick and accomplish motionlessness that way. By the end of this you will see that the paradox was always resolved because no real paradox can actually exist. We just use it as a tool in order to explain \u201cwhat is.\u201d And that explains why there is existence rather than nonexistence because paradoxes like the one above cannot actually exist and, the only way to remove it is with motion/existence. But it seems like I\u2019m magically conjuring up a chicken in order to explain how the egg got there, and now we\u2019re wondering who got here first: the chicken or the egg? No. That is not fair. I am simply pulling the chicken from the egg in order to see how it was all put together. I\u2019m not magically conjuring up the chicken. The chicken was always there, so to speak. \u201cBut if motion is a paradox, why not just get rid of it?\u201d Exactly. And in order to get rid of it, you need real motionlessness. Or, to put it in other words, motion is not a paradox as long as you also got motionlessness. So, nature is completely fine with motion existing\u2014like you are completely fine with breathing in as long as you get to breathe out again. So, imagine a pyramid. The pyramid collapses and folds into itself and becomes a reversed pyramid. Then the reversed pyramid collapses and folds into itself and becomes the first pyramid again. And on and on. A fairy explains that this is the whole of creation. But then you scratch your head, \u201cHow could the reversed pyramid collapse when it is upside down? It doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u201d Then the fairy replies, \u201cTry turning with it!\u201d Likewise, we must see things from the light\u2019s own point of view. In this borderless realm, you cannot say that the reversed pyramid is the reversed pyramid, so you cannot say which pyramid collapsed first. But you can find out the reason why they collapsed, which Fuller did. I think it is like balancing on one foot, which is to say, you can do it, but you will fall down, eventually. But then you employ your other foot. Now you are walking. \u201cBut, where to?\u201d To nowhere. The point is the walking, not the destination. But just because this world is borderless, does not mean it\u2019s chaotic. Even pirates have guidelines. But this world is a bit different from our own, which makes it so hard to grasp. \u201cNo. I still maintain that you are bootstrapping. You are conjuring up existence and then you call that a paradox. Then you are conjuring up another part of existence in order to solve the first existence. Why not just leave all conjuring be and have a neat nonexistence?\u201d Because, in actuality, you are the one who is bootstrapping here! You are the one who is magically conjuring up a nonexistent nonexistence in order to use that same impotent nonexistence to hold itself up, which it cannot do of course, because its arms are so weak they cannot even lift a fly let alone pull its own bootstraps up. \u201cBut I am not conjuring up anything.\u201d Are you sure about that? But why not let us compete. Say that some magic elves\u2014and elves are some mischievous little things\u2014started to conjure up all sorts of paradoxes. And nature, she abhors paradoxes; she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with them. So, she sends out her best agents to look for wizards that can remove the impossible artifacts which the elves conjure up. Then the agents come knocking on your door, and you offer them your lazy nonexistence. Wouldn\u2019t you blush a little there? Then they come knocking on my door, and I offer them a real solution. Maybe there is some better wizard out there, but I still maintain that my solution is better than your puny nonexistence. I maintain that it is in fact cleaner to solve the paradox of existence within existence itself. My magic is better than yours. Deal with it. \u201cBut you said paradoxes cannot actually exist, so we have no elves to deal with; which means my nonexistence can do the job.\u201d No. I still maintain that your nonexistence is so weak that, if you employed it, the elves, if they didn\u2019t exist already, would magically spring to life and make life very difficult for you. Not even Gandalf would be able to solve that one, and we would all be stuck in hell. Good job. Alternatively, you can be smarter than Gandalf (which I doubt) and solve it all mathematically, and then you will see: Holy cow! I mean chicken. The chicken IS the egg, so it doesn\u2019t matter which came first! That is, the motion IS the motionlessness as seen with our cosmic gyroscope. No. Wait... It\u2019s still just spinning forever without ever having started to spin! But its collapse caused it to spin. But what caused its collapse? Well, \u201cnothing\u201d needs to \u201ccause\u201d it to collapse because you actually need \u201csomething\u201d to prevent it from collapsing. But there wasn\u2019t any \u201csomething\u201d because it hasn\u2019t been created yet. So, it must collapse. But when did it first collapse if it is eternal? So, it has just forever spun...? No on/off switch. But this is not a paradox as seen from the light\u2019s own point of view. But... Ok. I give up! Maybe it was the Grand Old Designer. Then some Buddhist monk will reply: I told you. This is all a cosmic dream of the Buddha. Of course it doesn\u2019t make sense! Or some Indian philosopher will remark: No. It is not a chicken. You all need glasses! It is, in fact, a Holy Cow. What you perceive as motion is not so. So, there is no paradox. Then the annoying Christian will reply: God did it. And then the atheist kicks in: Shut up, already! Christian replies: No, really. Convergent evolution birthed a superintelligence which fused with the nothingness and became immortal. But that is ONLY a story. You have to realize that, once you fuse with the nothingness, you always existed! So, God willed the universe into existence because that is the ONLY WAY you resolve the paradox of motion. Think about it, if motion never begins, then that is a paradox because you can go back and back and back and back and you are never starting, so how can you move at all? But it cannot set itself going, like I can\u2019t drive myself to work if I\u2019m already at work. Duh! So, we freeze the waters of motion. Now we have a block of ice. Cool. Paradox solved. But if no one intentionally melted that block of ice, then it must have been melting forever, and we end up with our paradox again. Only consciousness can resolve the paradox of existence, which is cool because, consciousness is here anyways, so we might as well employ it. The scientists of the future will discover that any act requires consciousness\u2014any act\u2014including the Big Bang. Atheist: Then who set God going? Christian: No one! God is not moving as he is one with the nothingness; only now, the nothingness has a will which can decide to melt the ice, so to speak. If the nothingness did not have a will, nonexistence would rule supreme and we would not be here! The Indian philosopher is in shock: Holy shit! I mean, Holy Cow. That actually blew my mind! A bystander: If you swear, will you go to hell. You said, \u201choly shit.\u201d The Indian philosopher retorts: Oh, please. You said, \u201choly shit.\u201d A bystander: But... The Indian: Relax. What do you get when the Holy Cow takes a dump! ...Exactly. Atheist to the Christian: Then how does his majesty\u2019s will unfreeze in order to decide to make things? Christian: You think you know it all, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re so clever. There is no God and it\u2019s stupid to believe in him. Well, you\u2019re wrong! Because, timelessness is a great speed, so you can have a lightning fast consciousness here. (All hell breaks loose when science discovers that the form of our consciousness is the vector equilibrium (aka nothingness). So, a consciousness could potentially exist in the grand nothingness...? Who knows?) Atheist: Then who created God? Christian: I already told you. Pay attention! Then the Buddhist monk says: That is not God. That is the great and awesome Buddha! And he did not \u201cwill\u201d the universe into being, he only fell asleep. And one day we will wake up, literally. We are not fans of poetry. When we say \u201cwake up,\u201d we mean it! Let us throw in the New Ager: The Buddha is God, dude. We are all one. Peace and love for all. All is one mind. And let\u2019s do the mushroom guy (I like this guy): Existence doesn\u2019t make sense and that is how she makes sense! Because, if she made sense, then that would be the grandest paradox of them all! Like if you are puzzling a jigsaw puzzle and you put that last piece in there, what happens: The picture makes sense! No. Well, yes, that also happens. But this also happens: Motion stops. You are no longer puzzling. And that would be a grand paradox. One time, the puzzle was completed and there was a big laughter. The Cosmic Giggle! Maybe it was a picture of your own face! Or your own son. That would be funny! The created is the creator. Mushroom guy: The real Cosmic Laughter, I guess, is when you figure out that you are only playing a stupid video game and that, you realize that you are not the avatar in the game. So, the laughter is one of relief. Oh, thank God. I\u2019m not actually stuck in hell! Imagine playing Doom or something. Or, if nature is a set of lungs, breathing steadily; imagine what happens when you laugh! What is the Cosmic Joke? I don\u2019t know. But it is fun to think about. Or, the greatest joke of all is that: everybody is right! Consciousness creates reality. So, God exists. The Buddha exists. The Flying Spaghetti Monster would have existed, but the atheists didn\u2019t truly believe in it. But, who knows? Anyway, nature, it seems, is forever trying to solve a puzzle she cannot resolve, which is why we get the constant matter-creation. What?! What was that?! I cannot actually exist! That is so funny! Ok. Then this is awkward! (Keep on trippin\u2019, my friend.) Ok, the torus is forever spinning. It is like a chicken and ever moving about. And that is a paradox. But the egg is awesome; it is clean and paradox-free because it is not moving. The egg would be the vector equilibrium. So, for my last act, I put the chicken back in the egg! Ha. Solved it! \u201cWell, that\u2019s pretty smart!\u201d Thank you. When the chicken is out of the egg, it is a paradox because she is ever fluttering about. But, from time to time, put the chicken back in the egg, and the chicken will stay still. Nailed it. \u201cBut how did the egg get there?\u201d Hello, we have a chicken! \u201cWow! Suddenly that made sense! I got it! But... Then who made the chicken?\u201d No more butts! The real answer is that our egg is a magical World Egg that is both a chicken (matter) and an egg (space) at the same time, and can therefore always have existed. Because, at the end of the day, that is what the vector equilibrium is: It is the thing you are left with when you remove all matter. But why not remove the vector equilibrium and achieve real nonexistence? Because, when you remove the vector equilibrium, you end up with matter-creation again. Well, just try. Nature cannot accomplish nonexistence, so she had to settle for an \u201cegg\u201d that does not make sense to us. However, I maintain that, if we view the egg from the right angle (i.e., the light\u2019s point of view), it does make sense, at least partially. So, the egg came first. \u201cBut...\u201d But just google David Bohm\u2019s Fish Tank and see for yourself: The chicken is the egg and vice versa. The wave is the particle. They are the same entity. Oneness. Oneness solves the paradox. Alternatively: If we believe Robert Lanza, then the spacetime we experience might be a tool of the animal mind. It\u2019s a great tool for navigating the local environment, but when you apply the tool to the beginning of time, it just falls apart. The tool was never made for that sort of thing. Robert Lanza: The Theory of Biocentrism, Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zI_F4nOKDSM (watch this!) So, in all fairness, I don\u2019t think we can explain the borderless world of the nothingness to 100% satisfaction. At some point we have to cop out and eat our donut! (I am so good with puns.) Because, after all, we didn\u2019t evolve to do this shit. Or at least be satisfied with \u201ctrue enough\u201d and \u201cget a life!\u201d or \u201cmake an omelet.\u201d So, let us make the best omelet in existence: Imagine that the nothingness is a giant whirlpool that spins forever without ever having started to spin. This is a paradox until we see that the core of the spin is motionless. This motionlessness is there in order to quell any grand paradox. Where the spin is not motionless we see virtual particles popping in and out of existence. These particles are the minor paradox nature allowed in order to produce a real motionlessness. So, when we see particles popping in and out of existence, we wonder where they came from. They came from something much larger. The minor paradox (spins forever without ever having started to spin; when did the particles first pop; which was the first particle to pop) is resolved by the fact that the particles are dual creatures (i.e., mermaids), which means they are one with the motionlessness where there is no paradox. So, seen from the right angle, there is no paradox. This dual creature is the tetrahedron which carries the motionlessness inside itself, i.e., just unfold the tetrahedron and you get the cuboctahedron (motionlessness). So, the cuboctahedron = the tetrahedron Seen from the side of the tetrahedron, everything is a paradox: spins forever without ever having started to spin; when did the particles first pop; which was the first particle to pop Seen from the side of the cuboctahedron = all is neat and tidy, a great nothingness Good thing the cuboctahedron = the tetrahedron!

I had a meeting at twelve-o-clock, so when the alarm went off, at nine-o-clock, I just turned the other way and slumbered a bit. Likewise, before the Big Bang, how long does the nothingness slumber before it decides to get out of bed, so to speak? I think the answer is: it does not matter. Because creation starts when I get out of bed J Schrodinger\u2019s lazy cat?? Part 6: A Fuller Philosophy I cannot write about the origin of things without seeing how our physicists are doing. One cool explanation I found was Lawrence Krauss\u2019 A Universe from Nothing. However, it is painfully obvious to watch the fact that physicists are down-to-earth folk when they debate the philosophers. From: 2013 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: The Existence of Nothing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OLz6uUuMp8 The philosophers\u2019 notion of a nothingness is that of an impotent nonexistence, like when you want a cup of coffee in the morning and you are out of coffee, now you will experience real nonexistence! That is an empty coffee cup even if there are a lot of atoms buzzing around in there. I am not a physicist and I don\u2019t pretend to understand what they are doing. My wave/particle musings are simply attempts to understand how a system can be dual, nothing more. But I wondered about our physicists\u2019 notion of a creation out of nothing, namely: Why does Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle allow these popping particles? \u201c[...] Instead of position and momentum, Heisenberg's equation can also be expressed in terms of energy and time. Again, the more constrained one variable is, the less constrained the other is. It is therefore possible that, for very, very short periods of time, a quantum system's energy can be highly uncertain, so much that particles can appear out of the vacuum. These \"virtual particles\" appear in pairs \u2013 an electron and its antimatter pair, the positron, say \u2013 for a short while and then annihilate each other. This is well within the laws of quantum physics, as long as the particles only exist fleetingly and disappear when their time is up. Uncertainty, then, is nothing to worry about in quantum physics and, in fact, we wouldn't be here if this principle didn't exist.\u201d From: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/nov/10/what-is-heisenbergs-uncertainty-principle To attach the creation out of nothing from physicists unto my own idea, then: My nothingness is borderless, i.e., non-relative, which means it is highly uncertain, both in its time aspect and energy aspect, because there are no borders that can pin it down, so particles can pop out of it. Ok. I am not a physicist! But I fail to see how the principle is an explanation! But I will try to give myself an explanation anyway: \u201cBut things are uncertain, which means particles could be popping into existence right over there. We don\u2019t know. Nature doesn\u2019t know. It is all uncertain. But what is certain is that, with an infinite time of uncertainty, a universe will pop from nothing. Infinity is big, something is bound to happen.\u201d Still, I fail to see how this is an explanation. My idea is simple: Motion always was, but its primal form is that of an absolute spacetime where all matter is unfolded/unpacked. That motion always was is a paradox which I try to resolve. My picture of the nothingness is like a piece of paper. We call the piece of paper, \u201cspace.\u201d Then we fold it, and the folded paper we call \u201cmatter.\u201d I believe that real nothingness is a state in which you have no matter. When you remove all matter, you are left with space, but this space is then all alone, which means it transforms into an absolute space where relative space and time are no longer to be seen. So, you no longer have space and time in the classical sense. This absolute state is not even black, it is true nothingness, but it exists. You cannot say if this state is big or small or what, there are no borders which define it, the laws of physics break down: this is utter nothingness. But, what it is not is nonexistence because the laws of physics, in the form of the tetrahedron, are embedded within it, tucked away in the black heart of nothingness (i.e., the cuboctahedron). \u201cYou cannot say if this state is big or small or what, there are no borders which define it,\u201d so who says that this state cannot simply exist? \u201cBut the cuboctahedron have these 12 lines, how come they have always existed?\u201d That is just a way to illustrate the thing; I don\u2019t think the lines are physically there. \u201cBut is the universe made of tetrahedrons?\u201d Sorry, I thought that was self-evident, which is why I forgot to write about until now. I thought that it was pretty obvious. But if you cannot see the obvious, you can understand it: Nature is lazy; she is all about finding the most energy-efficient configurations. Actually, I believe she wants to be a nothingness, which is why she collapses her state of nothingness, so that she can once more be a nothingness. The example I used was breathing, you want to breathe in (remain a nothingness), but in order to continue to do so, you have to momentarily breathe out (generate spacetime), so that you can breathe in again. That\u2019s just life. And if you can find a better solution than the tetrahedron, please let me know. Because you and Nature are lazy, the rule is: Enclose space with the least amount of parts while keeping it energy-efficient. You get the tetrahedron. It builds itself. You don\u2019t need an intelligent designer here. But please read this book. Most of my knowledge of Fuller comes from this book, as I was too lazy (and probably too stupid) to read Fuller\u2019s own work: A Fuller Explanation by Amy Edmondson: https://buckyworld.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/afullerexplanation-by-amy-edmondson.pdf You will understand things such as: \u201cYou thus get: \u201ctetrahedron, octahedron, icosahedron, cube, and pentagonal dodecahedron (Fig. 4-6). Like it or not, we have reached the end.\u201d \u201cThe structure essentially builds itself in that there is only one possible outcome [...]\u201d \u201cAdditionally, we can learn from nature's structuring method: converging and diverging, she produces bubbles, explosions, stars, and the radially expanding sound and light waves. Energy pushes out, and its expansion is countered by tensional restraints such as the pull of gravity and molecular forces. Eventually, the two dynamics reach an equilibrium, a tentative balance such as a soap bubble [...]\u201d \u201cIf you are willing to go along with the physicists, recognizing complementarity, then you will see that tetrahedra plus octahedra\u2014and their common constituents, the unit-volume A - and B -Quanta Modules\u2014provide a satisfactory way for both physical and metaphysical, generalized cosmic accounting of all human experience. (950.34)\u201d \u201c(Such sublime disclosures by nature must not go unheralded!)\u201d \u201c\"if you use cubes, you use 3 times as much space as necessary\". And, once again, \"Nature is always most economical\".\u201d \u201cThe vector equilibrium array is thus generated automatically, [...]\u201d \u201c[...] separated by the inevitable by-product tetrahedra.\u201d \u201cTwelve around one, creating 60\u00b0 angles both radially and axially, with alternating tetrahedra and octahedra, is the closest packing.\u201d \u201cFuller certainly isn't going to let that one slip by!\u201d \u201cAngle and frequency modulation exclusively define all experiences, which events altogether constitute Universe\" (208.00).\u201d \u201cWe simply cannot have fewer than three or more than five triangles around all vertices and create a closed finite system. We thus encounter a first upper limit.\u201d \u201c\"There are only three basic structural systems in Universe\".\u201d \u201cSo that's it for squares.\u201d \u201cA Limited Family.\u201d If you want to know what this is all about, read the book: A Fuller Explanation by Amy Edmondson And, yes, Amy, I got the pun! When you read Fuller, you get angry and want to kick scientists in the butt while you scream: \u201cAdopt Fuller\u2019s vision into your own thinking! Anything else is a complete waste of time!\u201d Walking Through Walls: Personally, I have always wondered, why can\u2019t I walk through walls? What is the magic stuff that makes things solid? Science will have its ridiculous answer. But I want to know from the depths of hell: what is it that makes things solid? I believe the nothingness is not solid, which means nothing is really solid. So, solidity and therefore space must be an illusion. Let us go back to the race: \u201cA group of people running together are bound because you can say, \u201cThis one is running at this speed relative to this one. This one is tall. This one is short.\u201d But say that one person has outrun the others so that he is all alone. You cannot measure him. Now, if this was the Olympics, then you can measure the leader of the race because you can put him in the same frame as the others, you just zoom out with your camera. But imagine zooming out forever and you are still not able to catch the leader in your frame: do you understand what the unbound means now? \u201cWhere the hell is he? That\u2019s one fast joker!\u201d\u201d The unbound leader, so to speak, he is the ultimate incarnation of reality where things are not solid. For Hercules, a rock is not solid because he is so strong. So, solidity must lie with the mortals, not with the gods! I believe: The solidity of the world is simply the fact of the relative state where we can say, \u201cThis one is tall. This one is short.\u201d In order to differentiate between things, you need solidity or things would just mesh and you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell who is short, who is tall. That is, as long as the slower runners cannot catch up to the leader, they have not earned the right to be non-solid, so to speak. They have to be solid, meaning interact, because they find themselves in a relative state. But that real solidity that we experience may just be a trick/tool of the animal mind, like pain is not in the object, say you cut yourself with a knife. More: If you have to be solid, then you must take the form of a tetrahedron (from our reasoning above). So, imagine the Cosmic Whirlpool spinning so fast that it is not solid; meaning, it does not interact with anyone because this is the leader from the race above. Then these baby whirlpools form from the spin of the Cosmic Whirlpool; and these will not be as fast, like you were not as strong as your father when you were born. They must take the form of the tetrahedron because they will find themselves in a relative state. But if you don\u2019t like the term nothingness, just use the term absolute spacetime or, a piece of paper (from above)! Moving on, could quantum tunneling be the fact that the tetrahedron can morph into the cuboctahedron, which means the tetrahedron-particle can briefly exists anywhere it chooses to because, in its cuboctahedron armor, you have no borders which pins down your position? If this is the case, then I used quantum tunneling without even knowing it in order to explain how the universe got here. From above: \u201cHeisenberg's equation can also be expressed in terms of energy and time. Again, the more constrained one variable is, the less constrained the other is.\u201d I have only space, does that mean that this variable is constrained, which means that the matter-variable is less constrained and we thus see these particles popping in and out of existence? Ok. I am not a physicist. Well, they are not popping in and out of existence, which is just a way of talking; in actuality, they are simply jumping from one world (absolute) to the other (relative) and back. The philosophers say that nothingness = not anything. In my mind, not anything = nonexistence. In my mind, nothingness = absolute existence = a state that is not even black = a non-relative state So, nothingness and nonexistence look the same, they have the same faceless face. The main difference is, nothingness is potent and nonexistence is impotent. QT: Note that all this is pure guesswork The quantum tunneling concept as a way to explain how our universe came to be is ingenious, and I believe that the cuboctahedron is the thing that allows you to do that because the cuboctahedron is essentially a set of lungs which can breathe in and out\u2014which means it has an in-phase and an out-phase; which means it can be both a particle and a wave at the same time. That is, the expansion and contraction happen simultaneously, thus all is connected, which means it is a wave. However, the expansion and the contraction do occur, they do not cancel, they just run at the same time\u2014thus we also get particles therefore the particle is like the whole package that is the cuboctahedron. The wave is the fact that all cuboctahedrons everywhere are connected; more, they are one and the same because the expansion and contraction happen simultaneously, which means that there is only one place/spot in existence as all things connect creating this one spot (or Big Bang?). Everything is this spot or dot. 3D is an illusion. This is how I understand the concept, note that I could be wrong: This video (What is Quantum Tunneling?) explains how quantum tunneling birthed the universe. Let the left side of the mountain = everything will collapse, thus no universe. Let the right side of the mountain = everything will expand = our universe. What is Quantum Tunneling? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTodS8hkSDg Classically, there is no way for the expansion to happen because you would violate conservation laws. The singularity would just collapse into itself. However, with quantum tunneling, you can tunnel to the other side of the mountain, thus giving the singularity a boost such that it will expand instead. This trick the tetrahedron can do because it exists in many worlds, both the unbound and the bound. The tetrahedron = Quantum Tunneling. Perhaps one of my greatest ideas ever: That is, we can have a Big Bang, which would be a huge cuboctahedron, and then we could have a series of smaller cuboctahedrons that would not be as violent as the first, and these we could place in your car. That is, just because science has found a Big Bang does NOT MEAN that all came from that Big Bang. It only means that all came from that point, which is a huge difference! For example, if you have a Russian doll and this doll contains a series of smaller dolls inside it, then it looks like EVERYTHING came from the biggest doll or point, but it does not follow logically! With smaller \u201cdolls\u201d we can have a less violent process that we can put in your car. Basically, Santa has helpers. Ultimately, it all springs from Santa, though. But there is a huge difference if you get your presents directly from Santa or one of his helpers. What I mean is, the point of singularity could have been replicated and spread across the whole of creation. A lesser singularity could explain why our earth grows, if these singularities produce matter. Why is there more matter than anti-matter? This is a tough one. A Nobel Prize is awaiting the one who puzzle out the answer. I am not here to claim that prize, however. I just want to see what the answer might be philosophically. The obvious starting point for any and all starting points is the black hole because the black hole is the thing that draws all things into itself. If we look at a black hole, then we will see that it is spinning because of the matter that whirls around it. Plus, Einstein said that spacetime can bend, which means space can curve, which means spin is on the agenda. We can even say that a straight line is a circle with infinite radius. That is, everything is curved. The universe is crooked. Spin, then. If you want things to spin, then the next step would be to find a geometry that is best suited for the task. I looked into the world of geometry and found the cuboctahedron. What does all this mean? It means that the cuboctahedron is the fundamental blueprint (that which everything else is based upon) and the fundamental building block of the universe. The cuboctahedron happens to be spineless, thus the universe is not supported on any structure. That is, the universe does not need a structure to support itself on. Rather, as we can see in the cuboctahedron, Nature is a system. Nature is a set of lungs. She is formless, balance, nothingness; and, she is moving very fast. So, there is no actual \u201cbuilding block\u201d in that sense. It all depends on your definition, I guess. If the cuboctahedron is the fundamental thing in Nature, then we can start to look at what anti-matter is. The matter was accomplished when we folded the cuboctahedron and attained the Platonic solids. This folding happens when the cuboctahedron is out of phase, meaning, when the cuboctahedron is not in perfect equilibrium. I defined perfect equilibrium as the state that defines the fastest possible speed. This speed is what the nothingness is. Where the arms of the Cosmic Whirlpool are not moving as fast, due to the Cosmic Traffic Jam, we see the production of matter. Anti-matter then, must be like matter, but, at the same time, it must have the ability to cancel whatever ordinary matter it meets. Two cars crashing: There are two possible ways you can fold the cuboctahedron: press down and right, down-left. Do this while you are standing in front of a mirror and muse: How many possible ways are there for the cuboctahedron to spin? My answer: One possible way. Symmetry is a oneness (left is right), not a duality (left vs. right). When the cuboctahedron collapses/folds, it folds in all possible directions simultaneously in logical space. You thus get toruses that annihilate each other (due to spinning opposite directions as they crash), like two cars crashing into one another. In addition, you get toruses that drive (spin) the same way, thus forming a relationship when they \u201ccrash.\u201d In other words, matter and anti-matter are formed equally, but because half the matter formed will spin, say, right and half left, the same will apply to the anti-matter. Thus, half of the anti-matter will form a relationship with matter and we will view that as ordinary matter. And the other half of the anti-matter will cancel when interacting with matter. This leaves us with an abundance of matter. Note: Use the mirror in order to capture the whole of reality, therefore the Mirror World is the right world also. Yin & Yang 1: \u201cConcave\u2013convex, tension\u2013compression, proton\u2013 neutron, male\u2013female: Universe is always plural, supporting interdependent, inseparable pairs which are not simply mirror-image halves. It is thus reassuringly consistent that the essence of structure and space should also exhibit this fundamental dualism. There is no single building block of Universe.\u201d Yin & Yang 2: How a wave can be a particle and vice versa: Here is uncertainty principle in action: See the picture in Amy\u2019s book, page 200: octahedron at junction of 8 cubes = Fuller\u2019s inherent complementarity. Basically, you can view one thing from many angels, and all the angels are true. So, a wave is a particle. Yin & Yang 3: Say that your ultimate equilibrium is like the Skwish (a tensegrity toy). Take your hands and collapse it, then remove the pressure, and it will automatically reassemble again. Automatically reassemble = Nature always moves towards equilibrium Your hands = the eternal speed of the nothingness You don\u2019t need to pull it back up, meaning, now you can have two forces in nature for the price of one. That is the true nature of Yin and Yang. That is, you only need one force in order to get Nature\u2019s heart pumping. Isn\u2019t that what happens? Electricity passes through the heart and then the heart starts pumping. The Vector Equilibrium: \u201cTwelve vectors, or independent forces (6 positive, 6 negative), must be applied to a body in space to completely restrict its mobility.\u201d What is the cuboctahedron/vector equilibrium? \u201cIn conclusion, degrees of freedom measure the extent of a system's mobility: how many alternative directions of motion must be impeded before the body in space is completely restrained.\u201d I.e., immobile. Imagine you want to restrain a guy who is not acting rational. You call for help. In the universe, you need a minimum of 12 men to restrain that 1 guy. Seems like overkill, but that is how the math works out. This is the Hulk or something. If the 12 men were able to hold that guy forever, there would be eternal death for all, \u201cUniversal Death,\u201d a complete timeless nothingness. But Fuller points out that Nature is imperfect, she cannot actually accomplish death. However, nature is always trying: \u201cNature exhibits a fundamental drive toward equilibrium.\u201d I think this imperfection is the fact that nature is a system, like our lungs. Fuller is ardent in this. This is not a structure. This is a system: \u201cTime is responsible for these asymmetries. Separate time out of the picture, and you are left with the absolute perfection of timelessness.\u201d Ok. But even if you read everything Fuller ever wrote, you are still wondering: What thing collapses the cuboctahedron in order to birth spacetime, that is, in order to open up the degrees of freedom again. What thing forces the men to let go of Hulk? Well, the uncertainty principle: Maybe Hulk was strong enough? Maybe he wasn\u2019t? We don\u2019t know. Nobody knows. Wait forever and suddenly, he was! Ok. I am not a physicist. Let me explore different options. And the right answer is time itself: motion My solution was that if you restrain yourself so that you have 0 degrees of freedom you are completely motionless, but the motionlessness = a very high velocity, i.e., the speed of light\u2014which we saw in our thought experiment. This means that the Hulk is HULK, he can easily fight off those 12 men because he carries more motion than the men. However, the 12 men will always try to restrain Hulk, but they will never be successful. But then the question becomes: Why would Hulk fight in the first place? You need something to fight for. Here we introduce the fact that the motionlessness is not a thing/object, it is a process, a system. When you collapse the cuboctahedron, you get spin. Then imagine spinning so fast that you get 0 degrees of freedom (i.e., the light\u2019s point of view), then you end up at the state of the cuboctahedron again. Then you can see that nothing caused the cuboctahedron to collapse in the first place, it has always been collapsing/spinning. And this spin is so fast that it has become absolute, displaying 0 degrees of freedom. And this fast spin is always there. It is eternal. Nothing caused it. It has always spun and will continue to spin forever. It is a perfect timeless, motionless, nothingness. And this spin will always collapse the cuboctahedron because that is what the spin is, an eternal collapsing cuboctahedron. But when you collapse the cuboctahedron, you get spacetime. So, spacetime is a byproduct of the perfect nothingness which we all came from. And this picture is consistent with that of an eternally spinning cosmic whirlpool (dual torus) that produces baby-whirlpools. \u201cIf I send a ball down a hill, then vector equilibrium in that case would be when the ball comes to a complete stop. It will never roll again. So, how does that ball start to roll again so that creation can continue?\u201d I believe that a physicist would say something like, there is still some motion left in that ball. We can blow up that motion using quantum mechanics and start a new universe. Ad infinitum. My solution is something like, that ball never came to a complete stop. Don\u2019t you see it? It is moving faster than ever! You don\u2019t see it because the earth is in the way. You reply, \u201cNo. I can see the ball. I can pick it up. That ball was dead.\u201d Still, I maintain that our notion of motionless states is all backwards. When you picked up that ball, didn\u2019t you use your muscles? So, there was some fight left in it. \u201cNo. That is gravity doing that. That is not the ball.\u201d In my mind, there is only motion, there is nothing else. But what can a hobby philosopher hope to accomplish in this world? \u201cBut vector equilibrium is like, if I am lifting weights, then I will have an urge to drop those weights, and seek equilibrium/rest. So, I do not get more energy. I get less.\u201d If you get less energy from lifting weights, then maybe you should reconsider. \u201cHaha. You know what I mean. I mean that, equilibrium is death, not life.\u201d To me, this picture is so backwards because you do not get \u201cless\u201d energy, you get restrained energy. You get to transform states. But you cannot make Eternity weaker, as it were. If existence is all alone and she moves at the speed of light, then there is nothing which can slow that picture down because we have no second agent that can interfere with Nature if Nature is all there is. And, if you have a piece of paper and no scissor, you cannot cut in it and make changes. The paper can fold (make matter) because it has that property, but it cannot be cut, so to speak. So, what you perceive as low energy is only an illusion. For example: If I set a paper boat on a river and I hold it, it seems not to move, like our ball which has come to a complete stop. But if I let go, the paper boat will sail with the river. Likewise, that inert ball is in actuality moving with the cosmic river always (which is what gravity is: lift the ball up and she wants to flow with the cosmic river, you feel it; then you drop her and she stops, but that is because she is being blocked by the earth); and, if you remove the relative state that constrains the ball, you will experience the cosmic river for real. But at that point, you no longer have a ball. Cosmic paper & river = my nothingness What you see as death, I see life. And when I say life, I mean it. I see that you can completely reanimate dead, unavailable energy and make it available again. How? By unfolding the folds in the cosmic paper; that is, by turning matter into absolute space again, which means you can fold it again. Or, simply, you can make new baby whirlpools. And the cosmic paper/river is the one with all the power here, so it can do whatever it wants. But physicists say that, no, there is no power; it all amounts to zero energy. I don\u2019t care. I see everything as fast spinning motion, i.e., timelessness. However you want to define that is really up to you. You cannot change \u201cwhat is\u201d by a definition. Well, it has zero energy in the sense that the state is absolute, if by energy you mean I can lift this glass. In this absolute state, that is impossible. But let us see how Fuller defines energy, which is really the best definition I can see: \u201c\"The vector equilibrium railroad tracks are trans-Universe, but the icosahedron is a locally operative system\" (458.12).\u201d \u201cBall bounces back from the wall at the same angle it would have made with the wall on the other side had the wall not been there.\u201d \u201cHence in A-modules, energy is seen as contained, able to bounce around inside the net without many available exits, whereas in B-modules, energy is quickly released.\u201d If I haven\u2019t misconstrued Fuller here, then energy is simply motion moving through our universe\u2019s railroad track. Eventually, that railroad track configures into equilibrium and the energy is useless for life (unavailable energy). But the motion itself is always 100%. So, if you could rearrange the equilibrium, you could have energy which is useful for life again (available energy). And if the railroad track is simply a folded version of the motion, then it can unfold again, thus transforming unavailable energy into available energy again. Motion is not the same as energy because you can have motion that does not follow our universe\u2019s railroad track; this would be absolute motion or motionlessness. Energy then, is constantly born and renewed. But it is not ultimately created and destroyed in the sense that motion cannot be created or destroyed. So, our universe has zero total energy. And a universe can come from a state of zero energy because motion is not the same as energy. Energy = motion running through the folds we call matter Moving on: \u201cBut if this is what gravity is, why isn\u2019t the earth moving at the speed of light?\u201d Because of our creation out of nothing: We said that only the leader of the cosmic race (above) is in an absolute state, the rest is in a relative state. That relative state is a set of relationships, i.e., two tetrahedrons can interact because they have borders that define them. And those relationships dictate another relationship, which is the relative\u2019s relationship to the absolute. So, the cosmic river is trying her best to move our earth towards the speed of light, but it is easier said than done because the earth is a sea of near infinite interacting tetrahedrons. Like if you have a set of cars that can only run at a finite speed, and they would run forever at this speed, but there is a major traffic jam preventing them from running at their desired speed. Clear the traffic jam, and the cars would run normally again. Try running at the speed of light with a trillion children on your back. Not even the Flash can do that. And that was my creation out of nothing: There is a big, cosmic whirlpool (dual torus) that is forever spinning and the core is so fast it is timeless. The layers further away are unable to spin as fast and we see them as relative, spacetime particles. And there could even be a traffic jam of sorts, because it is an \u201cundefined body\u201d and there is a lot of movement. But this body could be big in actuality. I also thought that this whirlpool can produce baby whirlpools. So, maybe there are three kinds of creation out of nothing: outer layers, traffic jams, and babies. \u201cBut why isn\u2019t my ball eager to flow with your cosmic river when I drop it into space?\u201d Ok. I admit that I am just a hobby philosopher; I am trying to understand the cuboctahedron/tetrahedron relationship. But if the tetrahedron is the doorway to the realm of the cuboctahedron, then the cosmic river (cuboctahedron) is hidden inside the tetrahedron (the tetrahedron is the folded cuboctahedron). So, more matter = more gravity. You will not find the nothingness \u201cout there.\u201d The nothingness lies within the system. It is the heart of the system. Literally, like a heart; it lies within. If matter is folded nothingness, then the nothingness does not lie \u201coutside.\u201d However, the nothingness does lie outside too, in the form of light. The difference between light and matter is simply that the light has not been folded so extremely. Like if you try to make cream, then the light would be more like the milk you use to make the cream. The cream would be more churned/folded. Remember, all is spin and there is nothing else. Gravity then, is not of the universe. Gravity exists in the absolute world, but we feel its effects in this world. Maybe that is why you cannot unify gravity with the rest of the flock? Here is Fuller\u2019s gravity: \u201cGravity is that invisible limitless tension force. \"The Earth and the Moon are invisibly cohered\u2026\";\u201d My world is simple: 1. Eternal absolute motion. 2. Relative motion that takes on various folds. 3. That\u2019s it! So, energy, for me, is the motion passing through the folds animating it. Motion is eternal and can never decrease. Only the folds reach equilibrium, at which point the energy is useless to sustain life. But the cuboctahedron can be folded again, and Nature is thus immortal. The cuboctahedron can be folded again = unavailable energy transforms into available energy Because motionlessness = speed, if you truly accomplished the state of the cuboctahedron, you will get Universal Immortality, not Universal Death. Why? Because the ultimate vector equilibrium/cuboctahedron (death) = the universal torus which brings life. Life and death are inextricably linked. I wonder what Fuller would say to that. \u201cThe vector equilibrium is an omnidirectional equilibrium of forces in which the magnitude of its explosive potentials is exactly matched by the strength of its external cohering bonds.(430.03)\u201d Well, what if you remove the bonds! \u201c[...] equilibrium is not inactivity, but rather a dynamic balance.\u201d Existence: Existence exists because nonexistence, i.e., not anything, has to be a motionless state by definition, or else I don\u2019t know what you are talking about, a \u201cnot anything that moves?\u201d Or a not anything that is not motionless (i.e., it must move). Or a not anything that is not anything, i.e., a human fantasy! (You know what I mean!) And the motionless state can only be made of a high velocity. But that existence always existed creates a minor paradox which nature must resolve. And this paradox we have resolved. Why the torus? Space automatically self-configure into the alternating tetrahedra and octahedra, which creates the vector equilibrium. But the point is, you do not need actual physical material to create the vector equilibrium. The vector equilibrium is always there. Rather, when God throws stuff, then that stuff automatically rearranges itself into the vector equilibrium. But the vector equilibrium itself is Platonic in the sense that the vector equilibrium is Nature\u2019s will. The torus flows naturally out of the way the self-configuration of nature tightens up space. See: The Isotropic Vector Matrix - Nassim Haramein (Abstract from Cognos 2010 conference): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGGvwkrDZNA But the real reason for the torus you will find at the end of this book, so read on. If you can read Amy\u2019s book and still conclude that space is NOT made up of alternating tetrahedra and octahedra, well then I will pack my bags, invent a rocket and fly to another planet. Then I don\u2019t want to live on the earth anymore. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t physicists exploring the imaginarium of Fuller more in their search of ultimate truth?\u201d I hope the answer is simply: They haven\u2019t read Amy\u2019s book. Mulling the Deep: The relative is always 2. 1 is the absolute. In order to interact and thus create the relative, you need clockwise and anticlockwise spin, 360 + 360 = 720. WWWW; where we went wrong: \u201cIn Fuller's view, we have been blinded to a whole family of rational order by an initial (90-degree) wrong turn\u2014itself a result of humanity's early perception of an up-down platform Earth.\u201d This reminds me of our scientists doing solid work for 50 years and they still produce a silly picture called Pangea. How is it possible?! I know! They are 90-degrees off! Actually, I believe they are 1080-degrees off, but that\u2019s just me. 42! \u201cHaving established the shape of symmetrical nuclear spherepacking we proceed to investigate numbers. Twelve balls fit tightly around one; how many does it take to completely surround the twelve with a second layer? By carefully placing balls in the \"nests\" on the cluster's surface, we generate a 2-frequency VE shell of exactly forty-two balls.\u201d A short note on God: (because I am about to address a very dark picture) So, nature self-configures. But what happens if timelessness is this great speed? If all time is crammed into one spot, then the self-configuring of timelessness can result in a powerful God. \u201cHold on! You are not serious.\u201d Another way of saying that is that convergent evolution will produce a superintelligence that will become all-consciousness and fuse with the timelessness by fusing with the light. But from that point of view, this God always was. This is sci-fi; but, you have to remember that our \u201cimmortal will\u201d is eternal as long as Nature produces humanoids. Somewhere in infinity, and if design space allows it, this event must have already occurred. For example: Imagine a trillion supercomputers or superintelligences combining into one\u2014you are not even close! Or, life turns out to be so complex that evolution cannot have made it, in which case you have to solve the problem of: \u201cWho made God?\u201d The solution is Fuller\u2019s self-configuring Nature applied to a very real, tangible timelessness. But this is just a wild thought. But I thought I should mention it. The reason why I believe in \u201cGod\u201d is sevenfold: 1. I experienced Nirvana. 2. Other people have experienced it. 3. I solved the riddle of the Philosopher\u2019s Stone where heaven is the octahedron and the earth is the cube = cuboctahedron. Or triangle and square. 3 and 4. And, although man can discover this world for himself, as Fuller did, I think the original instance of this knowledge was given to us by extraterrestrials. Why else keep it such a secret? Meaning, the Masons\u2019 knowledge of the cuboctahedron stretches far beyond Nature\u2019s eagerness to find a balance! 4. Our will is eternal as long as convergent evolution is a fact. At some point, our will must be satisfied. 5. We have good philosophical arguments for immortality. This is not just wishful thinking. This is a real problem that can be solved. 6. I think the evolution of consciousness and opposable thumbs are the hard obstacles to immortality, the way forward is much easier. We are almost there. 7. I think we are not alone in the universe and that E.T. has already discovered that God is a fact. By \u201cGod\u201d I mean an entity that is all-consciousness that dwells in timelessness. You are a part of this God. \u201cBut how can God be all-consciousness?\u201d If consciousness is a feedback loop and the feedback loop we are looking for is the torus, then the geometry is always itself and can be scaled to infinity, meaning we are all one. There is no such thing as separation, just like space is not separated. \u201cBut I am \u201cover here\u201d and my brother is \u201cover there.\u201d We have our own unique consciousness. We are not one!\u201d This works until you create a technology that is so powerful that you can replicate a brain on the nanoscale. The two identical brains should be able to generate the same consciousness, yet, they will be two unique states of mind anyway. Or, there is no such thing as uniqueness, and consciousness is not an object. Consciousness is a process, a pattern. And if you replicate the pattern, you should have two patterns. Yet the patterns must produce the same consciousness. But, which pattern is you? I think the solution to the riddle is that, consciousness is neither an object nor a pattern. Consciousness is all patterns that are intricate enough to produce consciousness. \u201cThat is great. Then I shoot you in the head and the next baby who is born is you, because we are all one! And is a rock conscious now?\u201d I don\u2019t think so, but you never know. I think the solution here is that, if you look at space, it is everywhere the same, yet it comes in finite packets. Like bubbles in a glass: the bubbles are separated from each other, yet they are not separated in the sense that they share the same reality. This dual aspect of Nature can be seen in the tetrahedron. \u201cBut if I am one of the bubbles and the bubble is destroyed, no matter how many bubbles you create that is similar, I will never be recreated even if you tried to recreate an infinite amount of similar bubbles. That unique bubble is lost forever.\u201d Which is why we fear death! So, the only way immortality is real, is if space is an illusion: from earlier: \u201cfold a piece of paper multiple times and cut, say, a triangle into it and then unfold the paper. You will see that, in the folded world, the triangles are one; in the unfolded world, they appear separate.\u201d So, if the torus generates consciousness and, all tori are one in actuality, then you can see how immortality for all is possible. By \u201call\u201d I mean, every dog, cat, human, bacterium, an infinite infinite line of unborn that will never be born! They too will be born if all is one. So, if you kill me, then yes, \u201cthe human me\u201d is gone. That would be like cutting away one of the triangles in the unfolded paper, but the core of my consciousness will remain. This core cannot die. Or, if it died, it would simply self-generate. And that core is also your core. There is only one core. We are the Cosmic Whirlpool, so to speak. Human consciousness would be like a, I don\u2019t know, a 100 trillion tori working together? \u201cThat is great. Then I still shoot you in the head and the next baby who is born is you, because we are all one! Or, will you admit that the 100 trillion connections in my brain are special and unique.\u201d I believe that Shamans can testify as to the nature of the illusion of space, for example. If matter is folded space, then all must be one in actuality, just like our \u201cfold a piece of paper\u201d example above. But as long as we are living in the unfolded version of reality, then I can be the core + another triangle, and somebody else can be the core + a completely different triangle. So, there could be layers of consciousness where I am not this and that layer. So, we are unique. We could have our own souls! But the final layer is the same for everybody, so we are one in actuality, just like the Shamans experienced. In conclusion: the human me will die, but the core of my consciousness will life on, or so I hope. Then this core can take on a humanoid form again, for example. \u201cYeah. But that new humanoid would not be me!\u201d I know how you feel. You have to experience real ego death in order to truly see that this new humanoid could be you. How? Simply because the real you is not humanoid. You are the core. So, you have to look at the picture from another angle. In theory, God can die, but if that happens, \u201che\u201d simply self-configures again, just like the vector equilibrium. And if God is like the vector equilibrium, then God always was. God is the most natural picture of Nature you can ever produce. IT COULD NOT BE ANY OTHER WAY. And that I think is the best definition of God any man can give. \u201cWait! So, beyond all the jargon, you are saying that my immortality is the most natural picture of Nature that Nature herself can produce?\u201d Yes. Nature is immortal and you are Nature. So, should you go to church, then? Start praying? No. This is a God for atheists as well as believers. I mean, if you discover for real that God exists, then you could try to expand your awareness a little. A little doesn\u2019t hurt. But nowhere in the great multiverse exists there a universe where I am a slave to a dogmatic belief system. If everyone was Christian, I would be a Satanist. If everyone was a Satanist, I would be a Christian. Why? Because I am a truth-seeker first, second and last. And, yes, if this God exists, then science should be able to detect \u201chim.\u201d God is the sum of all the \u201cpapers\u201d (fold a piece of paper) in the multiverse. So, even a universe which we will never come in contact with, will connect to our core. Even if there were an infinite number of multiverses, they would still connect. To further strengthen your bond with the oneness, you can read David Bohm\u2019s work, his Holomovement. Man: Imagine you discover the true properties of space, and then you unpack the geometry and out pops the blueprint of a humanoid! (and a starfish...?). The Roman Dodecahedron - An ancient mystery solved? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poGapxsanaI The geodesic also has the pentagon/dodecahedron in its body: \u201cA geodesic is the most economical relationship between any two events\" (702.01).\u201d I believe the nature of geometry solves the puzzle of convergent evolution. R&R: Relearning and Rethinking Everything: I don\u2019t think Fuller knew how the universe got here or else Amy would have mentioned it. I don\u2019t think she would forget or neglect to mention the greatest discovery of all time, namely, time itself. So, once again we turn to the mystery of time: 1. If you trace an object in your mind\u2019s eye, then it will have an infinite trajectory and therefore no starting point. 2. To solve this paradox, Nature needs to start in a state that has zero spatial extension, or else you can make a trajectory. 3. If you have no room, zero spatial extension, then you cannot move; you are therefore motionless. 4. We cannot get rid of the object from above because we have no universal trash can. So, we need to get rid of the degrees of freedom instead. 5. In geometry, this brings us to the cuboctahedron. 6. And now we have found the starting point of creation, which is the center point in the cuboctahedron. 7. But Nature is motion, so what do you get if you want to create the cuboctahedron using only motion? You get a torus (in actuality: a dual torus). 8. The torus expands out from a center and then circles back and joins itself again, the result is that it does not move! It is like a car simulator, you can drive and drive but the car stays 100% put. This is real motionlessness. And real motionlessness can only be accomplished with motion. If you want to go from point A to B, but you stop and circle point A forever, you can never get to point B. 9. In order to stay motionless, Nature has to continually generate a torus, and therefore must continually fold the cuboctahedron and continually recreate the cuboctahedron. Why? Because the cuboctahedron is the geometric version of a torus biting its own tail, so to speak. And the folding of the cuboctahedron is the geometric version of the torus coming out of its center, thus breaking its motionless state momentarily in order to accomplish motionlessness again. 10. We get the creation of spacetime, i.e., the breaking of the motionless state, as a byproduct. Philosophical investigations: \u201cWhy not remove the torus and have complete nonexistence?\u201d If you removed the cosmic torus, you remove the motionless state. If you managed to pull that off, I believe you would generate the paradox of all paradoxes. Imagine creating a hell that is so deep you land on Heaven\u2019s rooftop! Yeah, not pretty. You would not get nonexistence. In my mind, nonexistence does not move, and the only way to accomplish motionlessness was with motion. So, nonexistence is not an option. This leaves us with an eternally animated torus. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Nature just stay put in that one motionless spot? Why must she leave it and then come back to it?\u201d That is the exact same reason why you need to eat food, that is, you cannot make structures! You can light the fire, but you have to continually bring the coal, so to speak, in order to create the illusion of structure. Likewise, Nature has to be a system, she has no choice. \u201cA perfect static balance is impossible; hence the dynamic, eternally fluctuating events of Universe.\u201d \u201cWhen did the first breaking of the motionless state occur?\u201d If motion has always been, then \u201cwhen\u201d is no longer an exact date on the cosmic calendar, but a point on the universal torus, namely, the point where the torus-flow exits the center. But be aware that the torus never stops to move. The torus itself never becomes frozen, even when it enters its center. It has spun forever, but what it produces is motionlessness/nothingness and spacetime. And/or: Take a Lego house. Nature starts with the house already built. No one built the house. It is self-generated. Fuller explains the self-generation of Nature. Then time destroys the house so that what is left is a bundle of bricks. When that happens, Nature reassembles the house again. Ad infinitum. But then you ask, \u201cWhen was the first house ever built?\u201d The answer to this mysterious riddle may lie in the mirror. Imagine there is a mirror world where you have the opposite occurring: When your house is a bundle of bricks, the mirror house has just been assembled. And when your house has been assembled, the mirror house is a bundle of bricks. From your point of view, your house was the first in existence. From the mirror world\u2019s point of view, their house was the first. So, who was the first house? I think that Nature will always contain a little mystery. Go to the mirror and muse: Nature is uncertain. She is undecided. She cannot decide whether your hand is left or right. It is both! You know, there is NO left and right in the universe, so when Nature is forced to make a decision, you get the mystery where left is right. Likewise, when the second particle popped from the nothingness, it was the first particle to ever pop, or something like that. \u201cCan\u2019t the universal torus just flow in and out generating motionlessness, why must it generate spacetime to boot?\u201d Say you have this motionless spot and you must move out of it, how do you find your way back? You must create these folds and find your way back. These folds are what relative spacetime is. \u201cShit!\u201d Yeah, tell me about it! \u201cBut is not spinning forever without a beginning a paradox?\u201d Not if you start from a motionless state. The paradox was that an object cannot have existed forever because it would have an infinite trajectory with no starting point. The other paradox was that we have to have motionlessness or else we have, I imagine, \u201ca hell that is so deep you land on Heaven\u2019s rooftop.\u201d Another limitation is that structures cannot actually be formed for real; only the illusion of structure can be made, as Fuller shows us. The solution to all these problems is an eternal motion in the form of a torus. No other solutions exist in logical space, or show me another thing that can solve all of our problems here. \u201cBut is not the infinite trajectory of your eternal torus essentially the same as the object\u2019s?\u201d In essence, yes. It is. But the infinite trajectory is not the paradox; the paradox is the object itself. Remove the object and that infinite trajectory becomes lonely/absolute/boundless; at this point, the trajectory is neither finite nor infinite, it is uncertain. There is no up and down in heaven. Only hell knows up and down. The devil wanted to make sure of that! \u201cIn a universe consisting entirely of fast-moving energy, we must ask how something holds its shape.\u201d \u201c\"Structure is defined as a locally regenerative pattern integrity of Universe\" (606.01).\u201d \u201cStructure is also \"a complex of events interacting to form a stable pattern\". Similar, but more specific: the pattern consists of action, not things.\u201d \u201c\"Regenerative\" is an important qualification, because of the transient nature of energy. The pattern, not the energy flowing through, has a certain degree of permanence. A structure must therefore be continually regenerating in order to be detected.\u201d \u201cStructure is \"local\" because it is finite; it has a beginning and an end.\u201d \u201c\"We cannot have a total structure of Universe\" (606.01).\u201d \u201c\"Interacting\" signifies the emphasis on relationships.\u201d \u201c[...] prompted Fuller to write \"one of the deeply impressive things about structures is that they cohere at all\". There is nothing \"solid\" about structure.\u201d \u201cWhat do all structures have in common that allows their coherence? Triangles. At the root of all stable complexes is nature's only self-stabilizing pattern.\u201d \u201cRemember that only three systems can be made out of regular triangles: tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron. These are the \"three prime structural systems of Universe\".\u201d Now you know why God is depicted as a triangle! Because only the triangle can create the illusion of structure/solidity and therefore Creation. Immortal Nature: I have a question: Does the \u201coutward flow\u201d of the torus unfold the cuboctahedron, and the \u201cinward flow\u201d fold the cuboctahedron again? The unfolded cuboctahedron = unavailable energy, maximum entropy The folded cuboctahedron = available energy, minimum entropy As the eternal motion animates the cuboctahedron, Nature is constantly transforming unavailable energy into available energy again. Thus Nature is immortal. Final Words on the Cosmic Riddle: I believe I have solved the Riddle of Time: how we all got here. And the reason I did that was because I asked the right question. As I said earlier: If everyone was Christian, I would be a Satanist. If everyone was a Satanist, I would be a Christian. In other words, when philosophers for over 2000 years have asked the question: \u201cHow did a nothing create a something?\u201d then maybe it is time for a revelation? I mean, if you have been looking at a map for 2000 years and you still haven\u2019t figured it out, then maybe you are looking at the map upside down! Duh! So, I turned the map and asked the question in reverse: \u201cHow can a nothing stay a nothing?\u201d And the solution was the torus which stays put in one motionless spot because it expands and comes back to bite its own tail, so it is never actually going somewhere. \u201cBut that is so dark!\u201d I know. But from another point of view ... I believe that the Cosmic Riddle has no other possible solution. Eureka! I have found it! So, Nature is like a wizard lost in the dark. In order to find his way home, he creates this intricate donut-mace that takes him home. ",

            "answer_text": "The Big Bang did NOT create space. The Big Bang was an event that occurred IN space. All the matter in that space was drawn by gravity into a singularity which, eventually, due to its immense mass, could simply no longer sustain itself and the enormous amount of energy that this contained spontaneously exploded in an expansion that is still happening today. Actually, there is nothing complicated about this. What makes it hard for some people to understand is the VAST amount of time and space that is involved. Humans tend to think of events in a historical manner where a typical human lifetime is a long time. They don\u2019t typically think about trees that are over 5000 years old. However, the Big Bang happened about 13.7 BILLION years ago and, during all that time, universes, galaxies, stars, planets and their satellites have been slowly evolving into the Milky Way galaxy as we now see it and the fact that it won\u2019t look anything like it does today in 5 billion years\u2019 time is inconceivable to most. Astronomers have only had the equipment to enable them to understand this in the last 100 years (a lifetime to us but a mere eyeblink cosmologically speaking). The expansion is still happening and, again, for a human standing on this tiny speck of cosmic dust that we call Planet Earth, the fact that we are actually travelling through space at about 2.2 MILLION kilometres an hour is inconceivable for many. This is to say that, relative to a neighbouring galaxy (Andromeda), in just one Earth hour, we will be 2.2 million kilometres further away from it! I DID say that the numbers involved in the expansion of the cosmos are mind-boggling! One thing that these numbers DO clearly show us is just how insignificant (on a cosmic scale) we really are and yet, on an Earthly scale, we are (arguably) the most highly-developed life form there is. So, to answer the question, the Big Bang was not \u201ccreated by\u201d but actually, \u201cthe result of\u201d pent-up energy. As a footnote to the above, whilst scientists don\u2019t have any idea how long the expansion is going to last and given the fundamental physical law that energy cannot be destroyed but only converted, I am bound to consider the possibility that, eventually, the energy released by the Big bang will, once again, morph into gravitational energy and everything in the universe will, once again, be drawn by that gravity into a singularity (some call this \u201cthe Big Crunch\u201d) at which point, the Big bang will be repeated. So the Big Bang could be compared to a cosmic heartbeat where there is one beat every one or two hundred billion or maybe even a trillion years (who\u2019s counting?)! The term \u201cyears\u201d is merely a word we use to refer to the time it takes for Planet Earth to make one complete orbit of the Sun (which it does at 107000 kilometres an hour) and, in actual fact has absolutely NO significance anywhere else in space. So maybe we need to devise a whole new word to refer to the \u201ccosmic heartbeat.\u201d Anyone got any suggestions? How about \u201ccordis ictum.\u201d? ",

            "answer_text": "Well, the big bang is one of the most documented and confirmed ideas in science, and, the explanation for it, the big bang theory, is a working model of what is happening. IE: The evidence, measurements and observations indicate that the big bang happened, and that it was teeny, and, not an explosion. So, the big bang happened to the best of our knowledge. What was going on BEFORE the big bang is not observed or measured, etc, because the evidence has been rendered unobservable to our current technology. Luckily, BECAUSE the big bang theory discusses some things NEEDED for the big bang to occur, we do have at least some basic pre-requisites for these pre-conditions. In the mean time, our known universe is still expanding, and, is projected to continue to do so until it dies a heat death\u2026expanding so much that the density of spacetime is so low that molecular motion stops. Recent research efforts have confirmed that there is a such a thing as a Higgs Boson, and, calculations regarding the Higgs Field indicate that if the density of spacetime is too low, the Higgs Field can collapse. Calculations regarding collapse of the Higgs Field indicate that the RESULT of that collapse would look a lot like the Big Bang. Soooo\u2026.if we look at the overall picture, while considering that our known universe is expanding, and projected to reach a state of extremely low spacetime density, and, that state of low density spacetime can collapse the Higgs Field, and, that the collapse of the Higgs Field can cause a big bang\u2026 \u2026that picture looks like a cycle in which universes can have spacetime expansion due to Higgs Field collapses, caused by the end of the expansion phase, which trigger a new phase of expansion. So, its not a big crunch, in that there\u2019s no \u201cimplosion\u201d of everything back into a point, but, a Higgs Field collapse triggered by the loss of density at the end of a heat death. So, the big bang itself is solid and confirmed and has no conflicting evidence\u2026but the Higgs Field collapse, and so forth is supported by calculations, but no observations or measurements have been able to have been derived to take it past the hypothesis phase. If future research into this is sufficiently completed so as to indicate if the Higgs Field operates as calculated thus far, we can then reverse engineer a lot of the remaining mysteries regarding how our universe came to be as we see it. And, if the future research finds that the Higgs doesn\u2019t operate as calculated so far, then, hopefully, the process of falsifying the current work will provide insights into a more robust explanation, etc. :) ",

            "answer_text": "Big Bang is a huge illusion.There has NEVER been a sound, an explosion or such a singularity. The universe of universes are a created and eventuated event into a part of the grand universe with time and space. There are parts of the Grand universe outside time. Time as such is a cosmic consequence of eternity. There cant be time without eternity. Eternity is the centre and outside the huge circulation circuit of the universes of time and space, are several outer space rings, at present uninhabited, all in the making into potential future inhabited universes. It is all theoretical rhetoric, based on mathematical mysticism plus an unknown amount of atheistic philosophy minus love, plus a severe dosis of mental speculation reduced by the lack of cosmic consciousness. At best his hypothesis can be classified as medium sci fi with a touch of craziness plus a splash of unlimited fantasy. God (with little g), God (with big G) and GOD (with capital) have not created the universe of universes with big bangs and black holes in. (No matter the color) How silly to think so childish. The universe of time and space eventuated from divine thoughts and wisdom from an existential Deity, as such a creator, by the free will, decided to create a universe of time and space, within eternity. This is the divine attitude of a loving Deity, to share eternal life with its own created creatures. The universe of time and space rotate, as a huge circuit around the center of eternity, within an infinite universe. The idea of BB is invented by slothful human minds in a poor atempt to explain a begining, that never happen, but the mind of man have an inherent tendency to think in straight lines, instead of creation as a perfect event. As a cause in relation to an effect. Duality in the cosmic universe is an essenitlal part. There cant be time and space without eternity. The univers of time and space is an inherent consequence of divine eternity and as such a creation from a creature with potential creative existential experientials to create whatever an universal creator wish. Both eternity and the universe of universes are eventuated events appearing as The Quantum Plenum and Space Potency , a technical concept inherited from quantum physics, This nonliving energy that is inherently resident in space itself as space potency - ALONG WITH THE DIVINE ENERGY OF LIFE ITSELF -\u201dproceeds\u201d from the Father-Infinite in a beginningless and endless stream to all universes. But true it also is that big bangs can happen, but such an event always take place within the mind and is generally called enlightenment. An expansion of cosmic consciousness, an uplift of insight and in certain occasion also a amalgamation of spirit and soul. The absonite level of reality is characterized by things and beings without beginnings or endings and by the transcendence of time and space. The absolute level is beginningless, endless, timeless, and spaceless. For example: On Paradise, time and space are nonexistent; the time-space status of Paradise is absolute. The concept of the I AM is a philosophic concession which we make to the time-bound, space-fettered, finite mind of man, to the impossibility of creature comprehension of eternity existences \u2014 nonbeginning, nonending realities and relationships. To the time-space creature, all things must have a beginning save only the ONE UNCAUSED \u2014 the primeval cause of causes. Therefore do we conceptualize this philosophic value-level as the I AM, at the same time instructing all creatures that the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit are coeternal with the I AM; in other words, that there never was a time when the I AM was not the Father of the Son and, with him, of the Spirit. The ability to discern and discover mind in universe mechanisms depends entirely on the ability, scope, and capacity of the investigating mind engaged in such a task of observation. Time-space minds, organized out of the energies of time and space, are subject to the mechanisms of time and space. Motion and universe gravitation are twin facets of the impersonal time-space mechanism of the universe of universes. The levels of gravity response for spirit, mind, and matter are quite independent of time, but only true spirit levels of reality are independent of space (nonspatial). The higher mind levels of the universe \u2014 the spirit-mind levels \u2014 may also be nonspatial, but the levels of material mind, such as human mind, are responsive to the interactions of universe gravitation, losing this response only in proportion to spirit identification. Spirit-reality levels are recognized by their spirit content, and spirituality in time and space is measured inversely to the linear-gravity response. The universes of time and space are gradual in development; the progression of life \u2014 terrestrial or celestial \u2014 is neither arbitrary nor magical. Cosmic evolution may not always be understandable (predictable), but it is strictly nonaccidental. Time and space are indissolubly linked; there is an innate association. The delays of time are inevitable in the presence of certain space conditions. In science the human self observes the material world; philosophy is the observation of this observation of the material world; religion, true spiritual experience, is the experiential realization of the cosmic reality of the observation of the observation of all this relative synthesis of the energy materials of time and space. To build a philosophy of the universe on an exclusive materialism is to ignore the fact that all things material are initially conceived as real in the experience of human consciousness. The observer cannot be the thing observed; evaluation demands some degree of transcendence of the thing which is evaluated. May I for further insight into cosmic concepts and spirituality of divine origin, suggest you read the Urantia Book from which the quotes above comes. ",

            "answer_text": "If the Big Bang created space, then what created the things that created the big bang? Answering this question, as stated, involves circular logic and meaningless tautologies. Thus, it would be better to start from scratch and use Nothingness as a starting point, that way no gods, givens, or turtles are needed. So let us assume that the Big Bang didn\u2019t create space but space created the Big Separation leading to the Big Bang. To be more specific, the Cosmos of Nothingness, where Space = Nothingness = 0 = (+) universe of regular matter and (-) anti-universe of dark matter, is best guess that provides balance and logic with no starting materials needed. And in the beginning, assume further that a wave separated from its anti-wave partner to form a (+/-) Binary Universe System from Nothingness = 0, as in the following diagram:  And since waves/anti-waves are pure energy, and energy can condense to form matter, then over time a universe/anti-universe can arise from Nothingness. See: George Davros's answer to Could there be an older Universe that existed before the Big Bang? Could there be matter left over that was never consumed by the \u201cBig Crunch\u201d or BB? How would you even measure or detect matter that was produced before the Big Bang? ",

            "answer_text": "The only option is that Existence Exists before time, and that Existence created a vessel (quantum field), and then smashed with a tzimtzum (expansion and contraction), as is described in the big bang theory described in the Kabbalistic work called the Zohar which is thought to date back to 2nd century CE. Everything in the universe thus proceeds chronologically from that smashed vessel, and that things didn\u2019t just appear, as in the case of spontaneous generation, but the universe, and later life evolved, as it continues to evolve up to the present. The best option is to make science fit the model unless there is a better one available. I do not suggest to dumb down to the model. I suggest to stop smiting people that believe in G-d when there is no better explanation or wait until a time when there is a better explanation than the big bang and smite believers then. As of now, I think the God Delusion that without God there is no grandeur is quite a delusion in itself. Until proved wrong I have a hypothesis that there is a G-d and I consider all that is to be a part of that experiment. I don\u2019t believe it has harmed me in the slightest way to believe that humanity is better off believing that the universe and everything in it, has a G-d that created it. By affirming my faith, I must say I do not suggest that surgeons, for example, should send their patients away with a prayer and no surgery if surgery is needed. When one does their work they may pray for success or something else, but they should act as if no G-d exists and do their job. However, I do think there comes a time outside of work where everyone should have faith that G-d guides the universe and that if we are able to please G-d we will be rewarded, as it is written in the Psalms, \u201cDelight in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart.\u201d I consider my life to be evidence. I grew up without belief and accomplished nothing until I chose to have faith believing that there is a G-d on my side, and worshiping G-d daily. My success is of course from my point of view. May someone be able to quantify such things to a greater extent in the future, but I have made an observation of myself in the grand experiment. I think the problem with turning such information about religion into science is that there are just too many variables to be able to make reliable conclusions except for personal testimony, like I gave. In addition, I need to say that G-d has no gender. There is no trinity. Jesus is not Lord, not to me at least. G-d is not a man nor will He ever be a man or have a body. Like Einstein, I worship at Spinoza\u2019s altar. I have no reason to believe that I\u2019m a Jew. I\u2019m not a Christian or a Muslim either. I consider myself a religionist. ",

It finds nothing in the matter at hand , matter, photons , protons , particle , wave and then nothing .Why did Buddha say SHUNYA , Nothing , why did Vedas say root of all roots is rootless ? There is nothing , what all is there is what we all are , what we all see , it all is being , for joy of being . It is a conscious entity that by its own choice of being is being, Human form came into consciousness, or consciousness came into the human form is of no matter. What matters is that , that something from which it all is being , it all is being created; and this something is consciousness and that ultimate truth science too finds in matter at hand , but does not know what it is.

We lack a theory that could describe the universe at that time, and even less before. How could we know if there were laws of physics before there was a universe in which they could manifest, or if they appeared with the first particles when they started interacting with each other? Obviously we can not make any experiment to choose between one or the other. If the particles were first, how did they agree on how to behave with each other? And if there were laws before the universe then it does not come from nothing, because if nothingness contains laws allowing it to become something, it was not nothing in the first place. It is a metaphysical question and we will probably never answer it. Of course you could say that God created it all, but it is not a satisfying answer. You can explain absolutely anything by saying: \u201cBecause it is God\u2019s will.\u201d. But if you want to try to undersand how the universe works, it wont get you very far because you cannot possibly understand God\u2019s will unless God is an old man with a white beard and humanlike motivation (which would be quite scary).

Dark matter and dark energy according to the Big Bang theory are similar, too. In 1995, I pointed out that the time of Big Bang would be pushed back according to observations of more distant heavenly bodies. And the existence of heavenly bodies 14.46\u00b10.8 billion light-years away from Earth was discovered. The existence of carbon or oxygen was confirmed in heavenly bodies 13.3 billion light-years away. In the Big Bang theory, it is explained that the other elements except hydrogen and helium were made with a supernova explosion. Therefore, many supernovas had to be made. And many explosions had to occured before their heavenly bodies were made. And cyanobacteria of 3.5 billion years ago is living now. It means that now inertia force is almost same as then. If the universe is expanding according to the Big Bang theory, inertia force must decrease greatly. Energy of electromagnetic wave and gravitational wave decreases with the course of time. Therefore, Big Bang, Dark Matter and Dark Energy are \u201cether\u201d of the 20th century and not required. In 1995, I reported that the Hubble\u2019s law is a phenomenon according to the stress equation dE/dt=kE. The Big Bang theory can be explained with an approximate equation E(t)=E(0)(1-\u03b1t) of this stress equation. Dark matter, dark energy and limited galaxy size can be explained with the ignored energy E(t)=E(0)[1-e^(kt)]e^(kt) defuced from this stress equation. Cosmology need not be supporting creationism according to my theory. I reported these state in \u201cRelations between Human Thinking and Chaos Theory - Unification of all Academic FIelds (2019).\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "There is such a thing called the principle the existence of a necessary being. We are all contingent beings. Our existence depended on our parents, whose existence depended on their parents, and so on. We are all contingent beings and things - except one. The universe also is a contingent thing; it did not always exist. It had a beginning. There has to be one thing or being that is not contingent; it necessarily exists. Otherwise, we will have a case of infinite regress - we will ask ad infinitum [forever] \u2018who created who?\u2019 So there has to one thing or being that necessarily exists: the first uncaused cause, the unmoved mover, the first thing that ever existed and its existence is necessary. Someone may ask - if God can exist necessarily, why can't the universe exist necessarily? Science points to the fact that the universe began with the Big Bang. The redshift among the stars also shows that the galaxies are moving away from each other. This means the universe began at a certain point in the finite past. Thus, the universe never existed forever in the past. And since the universe is all of matter, space, time, and energy, the cause of the universe must be immaterial, spaceless, timeless, and very powerful - God, who necessarily exists. ",

If the universe began with the big bang and there was nothing preceding it, we always wonder what went before. We can\u2019t actually comprehend absolute nothingness. Mankind has typically imagined a god as the answer to this imponderable. But, that just begs the question, \u201cWhere did God come from?\u201d How is this any more of an explanation than saying that the universe just came into being or was one of an infinite series of universes? Before the world was discovered to be a sphere, it was considered flat and supported by a turtle. But, what is the turtle standing on? No matter what the explanation, the human mind inherently expects a cause for every effect. But, carried to the limit, there either has to be a first cause \u2014 hence a belief that there must be a god \u2014 or there has to be an infinite number of causes and effects. Your question states this conundrum quite well. We may never know what went before the big bang. Surely, all information that preceded it has been lost. The best we can do is acknowledge that either something can appear from nothing \u2014 in fact, some physicists say that this must happen \u2014 or that there are an infinity of universes one after another or in parallel, or both.

            "answer_text": "Alan Guth has recently added to the inflation hypothesis by saying that a quantum fluctuation that produced one gram of matter in a space about one billionth the size of a proton would have been sufficient to trigger inflation, which then amplified that gram into all of the matter/energy in our entire universe (about 1000 times the size of the currently observable universe) which then triggered the hot big bang. In this scenario, there never was a singularity or anything infinitely dense, just one gram of matter in a small enough volume to trigger inflation. Time, space (but not spacetime), and the quantum fields may be past eternal in this version of inflation, those being the most fundamental underpinnings of reality. This is a multiverse hypothesis because every time a rare but inevitable quantum fluctuation produces one gram or more of matter in a small enough volume, a new universe is generated. There are three or four anomalies in the CMBR that may be the signatures of other universes bumping into ours. In the next decade we should have enough precise and detailed data from the CMBR to tell which, if any, of the current multiverse theories has correctly predicted the nature of these potential signatures.\ufeff ",

About the only difference is that \"North\" is a well-defined concept whereas \"created\" is a rather loosely defined high-level concept. When you can appreciate why there is nothing North of the North Pole you will have an inkling of why it is meaningless to talk of something before the Big Bang (in the conventional model).

            "answer_text": "Good night everyone! Hi. My opinion: [1] If not for the possibility of quantum probabilistic physics creating several multiverses, and among them, by probability, there will be at least one, ours. FAQ # 1 = Could a black hole and a white hole (Einstein-Rosen bridges) have triggered the bing bang? My opinion: [1] I mean the black hole as responsible for keeping the seeds (matter) between the connected multiverses and the white hole for spreading the seeds, through the big bang. [1] An exit to the origin of this universe would be that this universe is connected to a larger, closed, cyclical universe (different from Penrose), older and spatially infinite. [1] And when the first of a series of other multiverses comes to an end what happens is what we see in the Hubble parameter: a difference in the rate of expansion, an increase, due to the energy generated by the end of a multiverse. Thanks! cya \u270c\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d Best regards, Cleiton da Costa \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 Brasil \u2013 RJ P.S.: my english is a work in progress, I accept corrections for a better understanding! Reference [1] Costa, C., (in progress). WOULD THE BIG BANG BE A CAUSE OF THE CONTINUOUS EXTENSION OF THE LIMIT OF A SPACE SURFACE OF ANOTHER UNIVERSE THROUGH A WHITE HOLE? ORCID orcid.orgCleiton Da Costa Cleiton Da Costa (0000-0003-4848-2478). E-mail: yamabushicleiton@gmail.com Dedicated to the memory of Fred Hoyle This article presents a scenario configured for what would have triggered the big bang. The inspiration came from renowned British astronomer Fred Hoyle. Until his death, he never accepted the idea of the big bang, even with the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation (Penzias & Wilson 1965), the oldest in the universe, present throughout the cosmos and practically the same in any direction, suggesting that at some point that distance had been much closer, in a hot and dense point until it suffered cosmic inflation. But his conviction that the universe has always existed, will exist and will continue to exist, an eternal universe, served as an expiration for this research, with the configuration of a scenario it was possible to put its persistence in a logical and linear model. RESUME In this article I will give an outlet to one of the greatest mysteries of astrophysics: what was there before the big bang? (Penrose et al. 2018) Apparent evidence for Hawking points in the CMB Sky, reported remnants of a universe prior to ours, were identified in cosmic microwave background radiation, through certain patterns that seem swirling, called Hawking. The Stationary state, (Hoyle et al. 1948) x inflationary state, Georges Lama\u00eetre (1927 and 1931), this defended an expanding universe, that a stationary, homogeneous, isotropic and spatially infinite universe. Alan Guth (1981) cosmic inflation, hyperinflation greater than the speed of light. Albert Einstein (1917), proposed his model of universe, based on his theory of general relativity, being homogeneous, isotropic and static. Stephen Hawking, BBC Brasil report (2015) \u201cIf you fall into a black hole, don't surrender\u201d, at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden; \"There is a way out\". Multiverse, Erwin Shor\u00f6dinger (1952), in a lecture in Dublin, the first known reference to the multiverse. One of Karl Schwarzschild's solutions, White holes, also foreseen in the theory of relativity. The big crunch, one of the theories for the end of the universe. If there was a way to combine all this knowledge, among others possible, in a single model of pre big bang, evolution of a universe previous to ours, where they all fit together to explain what was there before the big bang, however, not individually, in order to configure a scenario in which it may be possible to explain this questioning. I explore the possibility that all of these studies can complement each other to form a timeline. Research and observations over the next decades, for a more complete model, through technological advances for the collection of more data is necessary, as well as the use of synthetic scientific computer simulation methods, with algorithms and techniques, to measure, refine , define and reproduce this scenario.

            "answer_text": "This question backs scientists into a corner they can never escape. Before a Big Bang to occur there had to be an Origin of Time, Space, Matter & Energy. To suggest that it is cyclic just kicks the can down the road because that fails to answer where the original Time, Space, Matter, Energy came from in those so-called other universes. So we are left with only 1 possibility. A creator or designer, whatever you can bring your lips to say. There is no ignoring it or dismissing it. Simply saying \u2018we don\u2019t know\u2019 is not sufficient. You cannot use all your scientifice instruments, computers and theories to dream up how something came from nothing. If one says well it always has been also kicks the can down the road because if it always has been then it ignores the question then what caused a Stasis of no action for billions of years to at some point a paradigm shift into an action or series of actions that caused a reaction called The Big Bang? Lastly the definition of the Universe is expanding is inaccurate. Since stars are burning out, the sun is slowly going to burn out and life in general is in a state of decay we can hardly consider our Universe as expanding but rather it is all in a state of decay.

The Big Bang is the initial expansion of space-time. Nothing has to have created it. The Universe itself does not have to follow the same rules of causality that the objects within it do. But, for the technical, I can explain it like this: A scalar field (or maybe several fields) collapsed to a lower energy state, resulting in the creation of four-dimensional space-time. The Higgs field collapsed to a lower energy state resulting in the creation of mass. The inflaton field collapsed to a lower energy state, resulting in the creation of what we now know of as matter and energy. And now you know the rest of the story. ",

            "answer_text": "If the Big Bang created space, then what created the things that created the big bang? First, we always need to be careful about what we mean, but specially when we talk about objective reality. The Big Bang did not create space, the Big Bang was an spatial event. Completely different. Then, the root of the problem is precisely the distinction between objective and subjective\u2014that is, personal\u2014reality. Amazingly\u2014for me\u2014materialist scientists insist on taking for granted that the only \u2018real reality\u2019 is the material reality, from which we come and are a part of, no matter how evident is the impossibility of reducing human experience to materiality. In fact, as the material, unintentional, fatalistic\u2014even if random\u2014 cannot give rise to the spiritual, intentional and free, it\u2019s the latter that must be producing the former. Thus, the solution to the absurdity of everything observable today magically coming into existence out of nothing is not\u2014as Michael Mooney claims\u2014the \u201cBang/ Crunch\u201d model, but a personal being, within whom the spatial-temporal can take place. His reality cannot be proved\u2014as is to be expected\u2014by experiments in his material creation and, again, it amazes me that they fail to take this into consideration. In accordance with his personal nature, the evidence available is personal, and personal our response. That may explain the obtusely reductionist attitude of otherwise brilliant minds. ",

For example we don't know why particles at the quantum scale exhibit probabilistic qualities such that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes but that they just do because simply said, our theories are simply discriptions of the universe and how it could work, but are definitely not complete explanations so therefore I nor anybody can answer your question as it would involve knowing why there was a big bang in the first place and where the matter came from.
