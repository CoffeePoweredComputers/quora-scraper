            "answer_text": "Oh boy. Where do I start? Let\u2019s assume that I became Dictator-for-life of the Philippines, just like old Apo Marcos himself, but minus Imelda. This means I have all the power, with congress and the supreme court tied around my little finger. What would I do first? Why, enrich myself, of course!! Why am I in power for?! Just kidding. Here goes: Encourage business. The Philippines has long been the laggard of Southeast Asia because of poor economic management. The first thing a third world country needs to do is attract foreign investments and encourage local business. Reform left leaning labor laws, foreign business ownership laws, taxation, etc. Improve infrastructure, and rethink stifling regulatory policies. Cut red tape.Install competent and honest people in government agencies, and give them the power to fire people. One of the things that keeps us from reforming the system is the inability of leaders to weed out incompetent and corrupt people on government.Reform our justice system, cutting down on delays and reducing corruption. Submit judges to peer reviews, to be used as basis for promotions and bonuses.Professionalize the police force. Hire consultants from comptent agencies (eg, FBI), forensic experts, and forensic Pathologists. We rely too much on witnesses and not on physical evidence. No wonder we have the highest acquittal rates.Professionalize the military. Corruption has left us with a mismanaged and incompetent army. With the money we have, we can have a lean yet mean military with emphasis on mobility and surgical strikes.Reform healthcare. Encourage the best doctors and specialists to work in government hospitals through proper compensation and professionized working environments. Weed out corruption (see number 2).Invest on education. Fix our public school system. We have very poor quality public education outside of the UP system.Rethink traffic rules, road engineering policies, safety measures, and enforcement, with focus on efficiency.Fix the public transportation system. Proper jeepney and bus stops, limits on tricycle routes, removing of unsafe vehicles from the roads (especially pedicabs!), fix corrupt airport transfer systems, and consider efficient subway systems. Fix airports and fire corrupt officials. Corruption should be eradicated in the DOTC.Work with the church. Encourage an effort towards moral reformation. However, be firm on a population policy.How\u2019s that for a 10-point plan? ",
