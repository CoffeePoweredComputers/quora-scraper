            "answer_text": "Bonifacio was just another warrior. He was influential in the military, but the military itself was not very influential in the grand scheme of things. It had very little actual power versus the Americans, who handled two consecutive wars like it was nothing.  If Bonifacio wasn't killed where he was, there's a high chance he would simply have been killed or just simply died somewhere else, as the mortality rate for Katipuneros was generally high not only due to combat, but also due to diseases from poor living conditions and skulking around in jungles.Rizal, though--I'm not sure how different the Philippines would be if he survived, but Bonifacio did use his name as a rallying cry for revolution, expressly against Rizal's own wishes. Anyway, he was killed under the pretext that he was trying to \"decatholicize the ever Spanish Philippine islands,\" in the words of the then-Governor-General Eulogio Despujol. Anti-friar leaflets were found in his luggage, likely planted by the friars themselves. Rizal was framed because Despujol feared that the Filipino colony he (Rizal) wanted to set up in North Borneo would serve as a base for a future rebellion.  Rizal would only have survived if he did not return to the Philippines and stayed in Hong Kong, or if he did return but did not write to the Spanish Governor-General about his plans to move the Calamba tenant farmers to North Borneo. If he perhaps used a proxy to push through with his plans, he may not have been arrested and executed. Rizal was primarily a writer and activist as far as his influence is concerned, so if he survived he may have written more books than simply the Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. He also wanted the Philippines as a whole to be assimilated and become a part of Spain, because he wanted the Filipino people to enjoy the same rights as the Spanish. He did not want a war. The ending of El Filibusterismo is itself an allusion to Rizal's opinion that revolution was futile.  Extrapolating from those ideas, if Rizal survived long enough to see the Philippines declare independence and subsequently come under American influence, it's likely that he would have become a Cabinet member of whoever was President at the time. His experience traveling Europe would have made him invaluable as an adviser--I'm sure he had no ambitions to take power himself. Rizal may have also been able to establish his colony in North Borneo. That may have resulted in the first community of overseas Filipino nationals, and may possible have given the Philippines some claim over North Borneo. ",

The country would not have had to experience the Marcos Regime with the (pardon me) Imeldific implications, nor would there have to be so many American (neo) colonial reverberations.
