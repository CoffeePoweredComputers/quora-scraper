            "answer_text": "Consider death, if we do not have a soul that leaves the body at the time of death and that goes on to live thereafter, then the experience of death would not exist. Because without anybody who knows, who has registered what the experience of death is, the experience of death would be outside of the realm of consciousness; it would be like nobody ever died. However, we see people die in front of us, we see them experiencing death. If they do not go on to live another life, all be it in another realm, and hold on to that last experience that they had with their bodies, that death that we saw them go through could not have happened. It would mean that our conscious experience of witnessing their death was an illusion, and if that was an illusion, then all our other experiences are illusions as well. We might not have seen their souls leave their bodies, but that death that we saw them experience, nobody other than them experienced it. If there is not a soul that goes on to live after that experience, then that experience never happened, because nobody knows what death is really like except the dead, and if that is not registered into the human consciousness, and there is no way to register it except through the soul that leaves the body at the moment of death, then the \u2018feeling\u2019 of death does not exist. By extension, if an experience, like that of death, can only exist by it being registered in someone\u2019s consciousness, then all experience needs to be registered somewhere in someone\u2019s consciousness in order for it to exist. As for the physical material realm, we could look at quantum physics where the latest experiments say that, at least at the quantum level, \u201creality does not exist if we are not looking\u201d. This could be an indication that in the physical realm as well the unknown does not exist. ",

The easiest way to start to play with it is to try to relax the judgmental and critical faculties and just try to be aware without thinking too hard about it. This sounds anti-intellectual, but give it a try and see what you can see. It might surprise you and provide new avenues for exploration into existence. ",
