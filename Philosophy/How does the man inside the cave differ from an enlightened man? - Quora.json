The enlightened man knows he's in a cave. He investigates why the mind likes shadows. He investigates how the fire and the puppets work. He makes his own shadows and redesigns his section of the cave. He might try to free some prisoners once and a while, because he would like some company. He makes his own entertainment, and makes his own dream.  What message does Plato's Allegory of the Cave convey?  ",

            "answer_text": "Plato's allegory and the question are both based on a misconception. They seem to assume that there are two sorts of beings (unenlightened and enlightened) and two sorts of worlds (illusory and real) No person can become enlightened... for the apparent world and every person (including me... and you) is an illusory appearance in Consciousness. How could an illusion become enlightened? Enlightenment is a concept. Any experience of enlightenment is an illusion. Seeing this seems like enlightenment :) Consciousness needs no enlightening. ",

Some find it easier to reach and maintain elevated states ofconsciousness by withdrawing from people and activities, however it is not arequirement. A cave experience can be a means to an end of achieving elevatedconsciousness. The cave provides minimal distractions which makes it easier tosustain a peaceful and expanded state of consciousness than is often possibleby living in a society with its requirements. Once the ego fades andenlightened states become sustained, a person will find they can be comfortablein any situation.  ",
