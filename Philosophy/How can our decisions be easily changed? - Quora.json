            "answer_text": "Well I think that it's not easy to change a decision which is already made. We must think before making any decision whether it's right or not. We must also analyse the consequences of the actions we take. So it's very important that while making any decision in our life we must be sound and calm and should think from every angle possible. And if by any chance if our decision goes wrong, we should not panic in that situation, we must try to be calm. If our decision is wrong then we should have the capability to make it right. We should make our decisions right. As quoted by Ratan Tata, \u201cI don't believe in taking right decisions. I take decisions and then make them right\u201d. It's a very motivational quote and a very appropriate answer to the question asked here.  And if you feel that the decision made by you is wrong then there you can gain experience. Experience teaches us a lot and it will refrain us from making anymore wrong decisions. Thank You! Open to Suggestions! ",
