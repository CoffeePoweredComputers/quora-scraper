            "answer_text": "I can only make an estimate of the purpose of this question. Perhaps it should be worded this way. \u201cIs it a method of philosophizing where truth is based on a person\u2019s consciousness?\u201d If this is an accurate wording of the question, the following may logically follow. First, the answer is yes. That would be at least an approximation of Post Modernist Philosophy. That philosophy proposes that each individual person has their own \u201cnarrative\u201d and a truth that is unique to that individual. Post Modernism is a unique way of explaining human experience, and it has some value for our understanding of personal experience, even though as a general worldview, it is more or less discredited. It is an abandonment of logic as a knowledge criterion. It is based upon ambiguous definition for \u201ctruth\u201d an other essential terminology. The way in which it can assist us in understanding experience, is that it does recognize that all people generate some sort of \u201cnarrative\u201d even if that narrative is confused or incomplete or illogical.

            "answer_text": "Since I never finished my trip, I cannot vouch for Zen as your answer although that is the goal of the practice. With the aim of exposing the opportunity, I found this quote on page 69 of Phillip Kapleau\u2019s book, Three Pillars of Zen. https://terebess.hu/zen/mesterek/KapleauPillars.pdf The second of these aims is kensho-godo, seeing into your True nature and at the same time seeing into the ultimate nature of the universe and \"all the ten thousand things\" in it. It is the sudden realization that \"I have been complete and perfect from the very beginning. How wonderful, how miraculous!\" If it is true kensho, its substance will always be the same for whoever experiences it. ",
