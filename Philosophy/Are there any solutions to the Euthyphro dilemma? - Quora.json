            "answer_text": "Whatever sustains eternity is what is loved. The only thing that can truly love eternity is Almighty God. We simply don't know what eternity really means. The idea then is that there's nothing separate from Him. He is the Universe as Conscious Energy. He would not violate Himself eternally, and would not allow us to violate eternal standards. This includes the angels, as Lucifer was one. He, the personification of the Enemy, both inside and outside, violated the sanctity of eternity. That even puts us in danger. We don't really have any power to violate the laws of eternity, but we can't act like something is valuable when it is not eternal. ",
