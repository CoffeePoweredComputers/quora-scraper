            "answer_text": "The context of your question is not clear to me so will try to address some possibilities. Objectivity is usually defined as: \u201cExternal or material reality.\u201dSubjectivity is usually defined as: \u201cThe private, arbitrary, and limited element of self; that which is peculiar to an individual mind: as, the subjectivity of Byron or Shelley.\u201d In that sense, I consider subjectivity to be subordinate to, or biased representation of objectivity. I recognize that doesn\u2019t work perfectly in all uses but believe it to be a useful expression. It occurs to me that you might be asking about the roles of objectivity and subjectivity within one\u2019s individual thinking and that may be almost the opposite if one considers them as parts of a process. If we agree that one\u2019s impression of reality outside of one\u2019s own mind is subjective, subject to one\u2019s own filtering, imperfect perceptions, then I believe it to be useful to conceive that we begin our life experience completely within the subjective. Over time our subjective impressions confront reality in which the inaccuracies of our subjective impressions impact with reality/the objective. Over time we begin to appreciate if only because of the consequences, that our impressions, our model of reality, is subjective, inaccurate, and that it has utility to attempt to reduce our subjectivity towards the objective. In that sense, I believe it to be accurate to say that our (personal) subjectivity (of experience) does create (a value for/appreciation of) reality. This was just a \u201ctype & post\u201d without even rereading so not as polished as might like but hope it offers something of value. Are either of these responses able to address your question? ",

            "answer_text": "object is anything which isn\u2019t your self-sense. self-sense gets a pass as object, doesn\u2019t cause a physical reaction. subject is created when the senses fill and express as urgency. the subject looks for an object. \u2018objectivity\u2019 is just this search for an object. it\u2019s not a submarine cable to your inner child. it leaves the child behind and goes hunting. so, to have an object to flavor reality as objective, you need a self to create a subject for the beginning of the organization of thought-ness. objective and subject have no content.
