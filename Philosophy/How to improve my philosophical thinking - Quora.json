            "answer_text": "There are a number of things you can do: Dispel the idea that there is \u2018philosophical thinking\u2019. There is just trained thinking that invokes a method, and then there is what lay persons do, which is something less than formal thinking.Dispel the myth that \u2018better method\u2019 will cure all. Most polemic failures arise, not from a lack of thinking methodology, but from a lack of subject knowledge. There is a lot to know, experiences to be had, perspectives to be understood. In the absence of that, logic, or awareness of logical fallacies, or syllogisms, is not going to help.Find a single philosopher that resonates with you, as \u2018easy to learn\u2019, as offering an integrated, coherent world view, with a lot of breadth, and master that person\u2019s ideas, or that \u2018schools\u2019. Keep doing so until you find points of digression. When you find people, a particular school of thought that differs from \u2018your school\u2019 the most, then study that. Keep doing that, until you develop confidence in a world view.Now, it is hard to have confidence in one\u2019s world view\u2019 until you have applied it to the real world, so I\u2019d next be looking at engaging with real people, in real life. i.e. Comments sections on world news articles. Facebook groups where you can debate, forums for philosophy. You are going to find that the biggest bone of contention, as stated, is not whether you know the popular logical fallacies, which is great, but whether you know something about history, science, human nature, finance, economics, psychology and law. If you didn\u2019t previously integrate these subjects into your \u2018world view\u2019, then you are going to be making assumptions that will affect your understanding. In the absence of these subjects, particularly economics, finance and psychology, there is good reason to think you might be intellectual dishonest, just as a source of vulnerability, for the \u2018sin of not needing these subjects before\u2019, and not having the opportunity to learn them, and simply because society as a mob, hasn\u2019t needed to learn them either.Truth is rare; don\u2019t expect it to be popular. If you want to be able to think with efficacy, then it is not enough to be a master of methodology. I find it helpful to differentiate yourself from everyone. You won\u2019t be liked; but you will be efficacious. Oh, and you will be an outcast. Most people don\u2019t like to stand corrected. I think that\u2019s the type of \u2018intensity of engagement\u2019 that is required to be an effective thinker. It has to be automatic. Self critical and critiquing everyone, everything you confront. ",

            "answer_text": "Friends,In order to increase your philosophical thinking,let's share few things.There are two sources from where philosophical ideas/thoughts/discourses etc.come to us.They are:A.Higher conscious sources &B.Lower conscious sources.Main difference is that in first category,person has higher consciousness.His information/database may be even less/inferior than us-who have average nature gifted level of consciousness.Wherese,in second category,person's level of consciousness is equal to level of consciousness found in all of us,but his information/database is always higher than us.    First category literature is called esoteric science or spiritual scriptures.It is also known as \"New ideas\"and they have generated not from \"thinking\"known to us,but from \"seeing\",the higher faculty operates only in presence of higher consciousness,all to gather unfamiliar to us.They are called \"seers\"& not writers.We,in presence of our average consciousness,understand what is \"writings\"& what do we mean by writers,but,as we lack higher consciousness,faculty of seeing is beyond our reach of understanding.If you study esoteric literature and if you meditate simultaneously,you can accentuate your philosophical thinking.As it comes from higher consciousness,for you it is necessary to raise your level of consciousness by meditation.To study philosophical literature from second category,simply study is enough,you don't need to meditate,as it comes from level of consciousness equal to you.Thanks.Q guru ",
