            "answer_text": "That is a VERY broad question! I suppose you would have to add some specific context to your question. Fo example, say you want to know if a newspaper article is written primarily for political purposes of the writer, funder etc or for purely informative purposes- to describe an occurrence. Then your question is specific and can be answered. To my mind the primary factor is the stated or unstated goal of the author in writing and distributing the news item. Also, is the item simply restating a record of events \u2018a fire broke out in the Dorchester Hotel last night forcing 112 quests to evacuate\u2019 or is it an effort by the author or publisher to impact the opinion, bias, feelings of the reader. \u2018Supreme Courts upholds Presidents draconian and neo- fascistic Immigration Ban in a striking blow to the human and civil rights of all of us\u2019 in a broad sense everything to do with how a group of people choose or are otherwise compelled to share an underlying set of rules of government and law IS POLITICAL.

            "answer_text": "I view politics as a discipline that deals with coercive power, along with the authority to exercise it. As such, it considers subjects like government, sovereignty, rights, freedom and slavery, manipulation, coercion, violence, warfare, aggression and defense, justice, statutes, adjudication, legislation, elections, et cetera. The most fundamental issue of politics is arguably when we are or aren\u2019t justified in exercising coercive power over something. Political philosophy developed to provide moral guidance (like religion does) about the rightful/wrongful exercise of coercive power. Libertarianism, for example, was an attempt to derive a clear consistent political philosophy from Christian scripture, whereas alternatives like communism arrived at very opposite conclusions. Political science also developed to scientifically study political processes in an attempt to derive general laws/principles, not through morality-based reasoning like political philosophy but only through experiment-and-observation. Political science is less concerned with right-or-wrong than with cause-and-effect, and it\u2019s helpful in comparing the relative effectiveness of political techniques. ",

I thought I was going to see a movie about super heros and all I saw was how we need to embrace peoples feelings and everyone is equal. I just wanted to see shit blow up. Not to mention every netflix original ever made. Cant we just watch a movie or show with an actual story and not a political statement. How about the boycott on in-n-out, because they donated to a republican cause. Really? Lets hurt a family business because they have different political beliefs. C'mon man! How about sports? I love football. I haven't watched it in 3 years because all that's important to the NFL is kneeling durring the anthem. You make millions of dollars and your complaint about inequality? Give me a break\u2026. The list goes on\u2026. I just don't think that all those things should have any business in politics. It ruins everything. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me display my tiny amount of classical learning. The \u2018polis\u2019 in ancient Greece was the city-state and its supporting lands. It was the homeland, the thing the Hellenes gave their loyalty to. And \u2018politics\u2019 is the art and craft of living together in a \u2018polis\u2019. Nowadays the equivalent word is \u2018polity\u2019 and it means all sorts of arrangements for living together, republics and monarchies, oligarchies and theocracies and what have you. Now, whenever we are not off by ourselves in the unclaimed wilderness, contemplating our navels and the infinite whichness-of-the-whatever then we are interacting with our fellow human beings and we do it in the context of the political arrangements both formal (laws and such) and informal (customs, manners and so on) that our polity runs on. Now, when I finish this answer, drain my cup of tea and head out into the sunlight I will not be indulging in politics in the more specific sense of campaigning, kvetching about the government, standing for office or anything like that. But the bus route I will travel into town on, the shops I will go to, the lack of crime and danger on the street are all the result of political activity some of it recent (the bus franchises) some of it centuries deep (the laws governing buying and selling, the police force). So almost anything you do is done in a political context. Some more so than others of course. ",

Finally he said, \u2018when a husband and wife argue, that\u2019s politics; when you try to discipline and negotiate with a child, that\u2019s politics; when you ask your boss for a raise, that\u2019s politics\u2026\u2019 I am sure you get the idea.

            "answer_text": "Pretty much everything is political, especially nowadays. It\u2019s said that there are two kinds of people in the world, politicians and producers. Producers go to work and get the job done; politicians start acting like they\u2019re working when the boss comes around, knows how to schmooze, etc. I would say that an example of politics would be doing things to make your opponent look bad. Doing things like lying to get votes or otherwise intentionally deceiving voters is just dishonest. One whole party in our system uses logical fallacies extensively to fool voters. ",
