            "answer_text": "Spacetime cannot itself be granular as the spacetime measured between two objects is entirely dependent on the objects in question. Let\u2019s say that, I have a frame of reference with its origin at me. One km from the origin in this frame is a reference point. A post. At some time, t=0, we launched 2 near lightspeed projectiles, one from the origin, one from 1km on the opposite side from the origin such that they pass each other at time t=1 in this frame of reference. At time, t=1, just as the two projectiles are passing each other in the original reference frame, we consider a rail cart heading towards the post, itself going nearly c passing the origin. i.e. we rapidly accelerate to near c, and see what happens. In this frame of reference, we must consider the lorentz transform for both projectiles independently. The first projectile was moving away from the origin, so we have no (nearly) matched velocities with it, so rather than being 1km away the distance between us undergoes length contraction - with a smaller velocity - so the distance gets longer, and the projectile coming towards the origin is now even more length contracted so it closer to the origin. That same fixed distance is, as a consequence of our frame change, now two different distances - one to each projectile. So, which of these 3 distances shall we attempt to granularize? ",

            "answer_text": "I believe \u201cgrains\u201d or bubbles of space are created inside the nuclei of atoms when virtual particles annihilate within the strong force between quarks. These bubbles are so compressed when created that they just bounce quarks and electrons around. I believe they decompress by the time they flow through other atoms and then can contain a quark and become attractive. When space flows outside a galaxy, I think it becomes repulsive again. You might notice I left time out of the answer. It does not have a physical quality of existence. Time is only our measurement of interval. Space time only exists on paper in math. ",

            "answer_text": "Space doesn't seem to be granular. Werner Heisenberg apparently tried to construct such  theory, but quickly abandoned it. Although the Planck length is the smallest distance that makes any sense, relativity implies that space is unlikely to be found in discrete packets with boundaries. The boundaries would give us an absolute standard of rest, for which there is no evidence in favour and quite a lot against. To make a very rough and poor analogy, if all you had to measure things was a centimetre rule, you wouldn't be able to measure anything smaller than a centimetre. But that wouldn't imply that space is blocked out in centimetres. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually if spacetime is granular, I would say based on blackhole thermodynamics it would have to be a volume bounded by an area of 4 planck unit squared.  The information content of such a volume would be 1-bit, and I can't imagine fractional bits being particularly plausible.  I suspect the link with the boundary (holographic principle) is the fundamental reason some attempts at quantum gravity (e.g. causal dynamical triangulation) imply the universe is 2D at small scales.

The only distance shorter than 1 Planck length is zero, and you can't have a time interval shorter than one Planck time.  The two are related exactly by the speed of light, so that is the spacetime concept. What is Planck length? What is Planck time? ",

The main obstacle is that the plank scale is soo small that we don't have the means to do experiments.Let me choose my favorite possibility:  spacetime is an emergent concept, if you try to probe it in a small enough distance you will find a lower dimensioanl field theory.
