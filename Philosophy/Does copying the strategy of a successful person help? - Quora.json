            "answer_text": "Yes, It does ! Only when it doesn't ! I have two versions for the question or maybe the answer. Strategy for me as an Entrepreneur has always formed a meaning of, Plan and Execution. Though, there could be many versions of the definitions, probably as many as there are minds, at-least. The answer will still be on the lines of the above definition. Well, strategy on an average, is based on the observation. There are some unknown unknowns which vary in mysterious way, so if one could plan for their variations in the course of success, the journey flows in continuum. Almost all the times, these unknown unknown for a particular field of success get a similar dimension in planning for it. For example, If One would know about the stock exchange and wants to do the technical sampling for the various stocks, MACD of various stocks could be different but if you compare the average deviation of all the differences in MACD for stocks of the same domain, (let's say Life science) it would typically form the shape of domain index, (let's say Life science index) all the time. In conclusion, average of the deviations, even it the variables are unknown unknowns, remains almost same. Why it does follow the pattern ? Answer is simple, for almost all the marketers playing in the same field, though with different opinions, balance the charts. This is a very peculiar case in the stock market. In this type of field, copying a single strategy would make you successful, only if on an average all other players are successful. Magical right ! So, when the copying doesn't change the parameters of success, it does help, ( Yes, It does ! Only when it doesn't !). Now, I'll share some of my experiences about strategy in real-life. I have been engaged in incorporating two of our startups (both failed with huge losses). We had the different insights than to market when it came to the product development part. We actually wanted to be innovative and creative in the product design and features both, since the product was a physical piece of wood for patented design packaging product lines, we had our own freedom. What we thought, if we will be the original, we will create the market pull by genuineness of the design and innovation to which the packaging cost was reducing by almost 35% to 38%. We had our hands on, Creativity, Cost control, Eco-friendliness, Light-weight and Easy manufacturing with FMS (Flexible Manuf. System). Even, we failed to the competitors who still do not have any of the above. Why ? Answer is easy...!! We didn't copy the strategy of market. How the market was planned with what kind/type of demand matrix that, we skipped to innovate. This turned out to be the brutal mistakes both the times.  Yes, copying does help, if you copy the market strategy of need/demand function.  This is simple then, Copy, only when you the parameters of need/demand function and your strategy of copying the strategies flooding the market must not change the parameters of the demand function. It doesn't help any single soul, who doesn't follow the two golden rules.  Now, Plan, here is to plan how to locate, measure and re-iterate the demand function, Execution, here is to execute the planned, in a way which does not differentiate the continuum.  A) Copying helps if you know the demand/need function B) Copying helps if it doesn't change the continuum of the function  1) Plan, is to locate, measure and re-iterate the demand function2) Execute, is to roll-out the planned, in a way which does not differentiate the continuum If you can do this, you're successful. And if you can repeat it, you be the successful function. ( So yes ! Keeping in mind the above aspects, if you could copy the successful functions or people, you could be the same (with some variations of-course)). Cltrl + C !Cltrl + V ! P.S : Almost 5 times I used the Cltrl + C and Cltrl + V while writing ! :) P.P.S : The second version of the answer/question can be found at  Does copying the strategy of a successful person help? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, if you can -  not only copy what all the successful person did and also recreate the exact circumstances that he was in while achieving success. The former may be possible, though not easy, the latter is not possible. Each moment in this Universe is unique. Call it luck or Chance, it is not easy to make the same moment happen exactly the same way again. Even the most successful people have had advantage due to the circumstances they were in, on which they did not have control. On the other hand, you can learn lots of best practices that successful people apply and modify them to your context and work on your ideas.  On the other hand, every typical business is a copy. There are many businesses which are similar and successful. And many fail, following exactly the same model. At a higher level, Industries copy each other and nations copy each other. But the results are mixed. Compared to other living beings, human beings are able to mime each other and take advantage of the knowledge. We copy all the time! So as you cannot control the circumstances, the answer is \"No\"  Success is a combination of natural traits \u2013 not just those born with, but developed due to the unique circumstances that person has gone through in life, ability to acquire new skills that are required in the context - call it constant learning, being curious, tenacious, and leverage existing advantages - rather than worrying about what is not available, taking advantage of the emerging circumstances on which you have no control - but use your ingenuity and creativity and making it favorable to you, and ability get support, help from people who can provide the link ( no doubt, everybody is so bullish on social networking), and having the ambition and attitude, and the ability to take risk, which you can manage, and the willingness to fail, if required and stand-up again, and finally enjoying what you do. And the most important thing is, you have to define \u201cwhat is success as felt by you\u201d. Very often it is not just money, power or status. It may be often, what means valuable to you in your life!   The real enjoyment is in the process! ",

            "answer_text": "This is my understanding - that any technique developed by anybody else  cannot make you a real successful. You can borrow it, but it is almost as if  somebody is copying a painting of Picasso. You can copy it - you can copy it perfectly well.  You can be such a perfectionist that even the original may look a little faulty  compared to the carbon copy, but then too the carbon copy is a carbon copy and there is no value in it.  When somebody invents, discovers a technique, in the hands of that man the technique has a magic. The magic comes from the discovery, because the man and his technique are not two things. He has grown up with the method. The method is almost like blood and bones. It is part of him; the method is not separate. The originator has grown, and the method has grown out of so many life situations, observations -- pain and suffering and pleasure. It has grown; it has seasoned through experiences. It is not a hot-house plant. It has really grown in the rains, in the hot sun, in the winter, in the cold, in the snow, it has grown. It has encountered life, and out of that total encounter, it has a conclusion. It was something authentic that was rooted in him. It is true about everything. Now a problem arises. When a method has been successful, any other people will start imitating it, they will start borrowing. It will not be in their being. It will not be connected to their roots. Their own core will remain aloof. Then the magic is lost. This is something very significant to be understood. People are surprised at what has happened and why it used to work. Always remember it. Each person has to develop his own technique, his own methodology, his own philosophy, his own view. Learn from everybody, nothing is wrong in learning but never depend on that learning alone. Otherwise you will always go on missing something.  Thanks For A2A ",

You determine a person is successful after he/she has achieved what somebody else did not. So, he has done it and its a passe'. There would be number of people who would try to cash in the model he/she followed, because that led to him/her being successful and that is where the problem starts. You would have lots of competition, and outdo all the people who are trying to get a bite at the new successful.Another importation thing is to have the patience, determination and will power to cross the finishing line. Its easy trying to follow someone but its a different thing all together to be a finisher.Hope my answer her and thanks for the A2A! ",

Combine it with your dexterity and voila! You'll do wonders.So,if copying the strategy means the amount of hard work which will be poured in,yes, it is helpful. Napoleon Hill went as far as calling it idol worship. Do it. If it imbibes certain good qualities to your character,you ought to do it. It is a step towards a better character. Having said that, copying blindly is forbidden. You need to think and improvise it. Add value to it. If needed, revise the strategy. However, don't think it is going to yield the exact same results which it did for the original follower. That's just day-dreaming because you couldn't replicate the exact conditions and wish for same outcome. ",

However, when you ask about \"copying the strategy of a successful person\", I would doubt that you know that person's complete strategy.  For one thing, the path that someone has taken to accomplish whatever goal or outcome that you have observed was likely littered with numerous obstacles that aren't known to you. A strategy  is a plan for getting from 'here to there'.   In order to decide upon the best plan to implement, you will need to consider a host of variables.  These would include such items as your own penchant for risk taking, your ability to influence others to your way of thinking and your ability to recognize customer needs.  These are not items that are copied from someone else. If it was me, I'd consider as many options as I could in order to develop the best strategy for achieving my goal.  During that process, I'd be open to the idea of looking at the elements of another person's strategy to see if they fit my plan.  I would not attempt to simply copy. ",

If you look up to a successful person and admire that person, it will be very important to understand the traits that led him to be successful.  However, when it comes to emulating strategy, one such example I know is Louis CK, a stand up comedian. He really looked up to George Carlin and took a cue from him. After that his ability to build on it and make it suitable for his own personality made him successful and not just the copying part.  It is very subjective and would be outrageous to attempt this answer in a yes or no.  So in your particular situation if it seems the strategy of a successful person is innately applicable for your situation. Please go ahead and imitate. But that alone will not assure the success of your endeavor. How you build on it and execute it will be rather critical. ",

Your moves might lead you into the exact trap your opponent was setting up. Now think about this. When you can't win using the strategy of a winner, in chess, where the world is just Black And White, how can you expect to win the match in the real world, which is so gray.

What you miss when copying is the context, depth, emotional intelligence and decision making abilities of that person , circumstances in which a particular person made that person use a certain strategy . Reading/knowing about all of the strategies etc is good as it expands your mind and will kickstart your thinking process so you can comeup with a strategy on your own that suits the situation you are in or will be in.  If you copy, it might backfire and copying itself is not a good strategy or thought process to begin with. ",
