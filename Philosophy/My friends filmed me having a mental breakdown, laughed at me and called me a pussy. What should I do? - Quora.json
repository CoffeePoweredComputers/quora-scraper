            "answer_text": "Ditch these assholes. And be firm about it. They are not your friends and you deserve to be surrounded by people who uplift you with empathy and kindness. There is no forgiving people who try to humiliate you when you are at your lowest. Let yourself feel whatever sadness and anger you need to feel. If you truly need closure, say what you need to say to them. If not, leave it as it will just further your pain. Then cut them off and search for new friends. Block them on all social media. Always remember this is a reflection of them and their weak and pathetic characters, not you. Never feel ashamed of this moment. And no matter how lonely you may feel, don\u2019t ever go back to them. The world is full of empathetic and kind people who would never do something like that to you. There are worthwhile people who make worthwhile friends everywhere. But its important to remember friends can only support you so far-if you are dealing with mental breakdowns you should consider seeing a therapist. Furthermore, you should strive to be your own best friend, because I know from personal experience situations of betrayal like this are often (however not always) the result of having weak boundaries and letting the bullshit of others slide. Not to say you are at fault- absolutely not- but that we all should strive to safeguard ourselves against others cruel and abnormal behaviour. Being your own best friend means establishing healthy boundaries, showing yourself love and respect and not tolerating bullshit from others. Put yourself first, always. TL;DR fuck these \u2018friends\u2019 ",

Talk to your support network whatever that consists them and let them all know what\u2019s going on. Do not be ashamed of yourself, you have mental issues you never wanted in the first place. You, me and many others. They are the ones who should be ashamed of themselves. Do what you can to make sure they get some kind of consequences for their behavior. ",
