            "answer_text": "Smell , Smell\u2026\u060c To dream of smelling something reflects your feelings or gut instincts about something. Bad smells reflect distaste for a situation, bad feelings about something, or gut instincts that something wrong. ... Feeling that something is wrong. Good smells reflect positive feelings about a situation or person. Many of us would say that we dream in images, occasionally waking up after a crazy, scary, cinematic adventure in our unconscious heads. There may be a soundtrack too, with voices or music. But what about smells? Few people would say they smell in their dreams, but Francesca Faruolo talks vividly about her own experiences. Her dreams are often fragrant, she says. \"I have very positive olfactory dreams, especially featuring orange flower, a flower linked to the heart,\" says Faruolo, director of the Smell Festival which takes place every May in the north Italian city of Bologna. \"Olfactory dreamers do exist,\" she insists. \"They are people who, in their everyday lives are either very sensitive to smells or have a highly trained sense of smell.\" Academics have done little research on the subject, tending to focus instead on the effect of external smells on our dreams. Some of the earliest documented scientific experiments date back 150 years, long before the advent of sleep research labs and electroencephalograms. In his 1865 work, Le Sommeil et les reves (Sleep and Dreams), French scholar and physician, Alfred Maury - whose studies were cited by Freud in The Interpretation of Dreams - describes his self-induced sensory dream experiences. To ascertain whether olfactory stimulation could affect our dreams, he instructed an assistant to put eau de Cologne under his nose while he was asleep. On awakening, he reported that he had dreamt he was in Cairo, in the workshop of Giovanni Maria Farina, the perfumer who invented cologne, before embarking on an exciting series of adventures. Nonsense, says Rachel Herz, a professor of psychiatry at Brown University and author of The Scent of Desire. Her research and experiments indicate people do not respond to odours while they are in the dreaming phase of sleep (REM) or deep sleep. \"You cannot smell while you are asleep,\" she says. \"You don't smell the coffee and wake up; rather you wake up and then smell the coffee.\" But, she says, if we very briefly wake up and perceive the scent of coffee, it will wake us further if we are interested in it. Any odours that are experienced in dreams, like Faruolo's, are \"created by the brain not from outside\". That is one theory. Prof Thomas Hummel of the University of Dresden's Smell and Taste Clinic has another. His research corroborates Herz's conclusion that smells do not rouse us from sleep, but olfactory stimuli do influence our dreams, he suggests. In one experiment, in which volunteers were stimulated with hydrogen sulphide (the rotten-egg stink-bomb smell) and phenyl ethyl alcohol (which resembles the smell of roses), participants reported having more positive dreams with the sweet-smelling stimulus and more negative dreams with the foul-smelling one. However, none of them reported Maury-style direct incorporation of the smell stimulus into their dreams. Both Herz and Hummel, though, do accept that olfactory dreams exist, as does Rosalia Cavalieri, author of Il naso intelligente (The Intelligent Nose), though she says they are very rare. Just like dreams, smells have an evocative nature which is difficult to express in words Rosalia Cavalieri, Author One reason for this, she speculates, is that the sense of smell is \"disregarded, doomed to marginality\", especially in Western culture, which gives priority to sight and hearing. Immanuel Kant, the German philosopher, called smell the \"least rewarding and most easily dispensable\" of our senses. \"Just like dreams, smells mostly act outside our conscious sphere and nevertheless condition our behaviour,\" Cavalieri says. \"And, just like dreams, smells have an evOlfactory perception studies have shown that if a smell is familiar or can be named, people perceive it better, even when conscious. This would explain why so many olfactory dreamers are, in Faruolo's experience, involved in the perfume sector. They pay more attention to the sense of smell, and are better at describing smells in words. Faruolo dedicated this year's Smell Festival to \"the scent of dreams\" partly because she is fascinated by the idea that in dreams it may be possible to experience smells we have never experienced, or that do not exist in reality.ocative nature which is diffiThe most convincing evidence of this on record, according to Cavalieri, comes from the memoirs of the deaf and blind author, Helen Keller, \"'compelled' to exert\" her sense of smell more than most people. In her book, The World I Live In, Keller writes: \"I smell and taste much as in my waking hours... In my dreams I have sensations, odours, tastes, and ideas which I do not remember to have had in reality.\" So perhaps, if we develop our odour awareness, we are all capable of having fantastic scent-rich dreams. A word of caution though from Professor Hummel, who confesses that, in spite of years of research in the field, he still does not experience olfactory dreams. \"I do not have any. But my wife does.\"cult to express in words.\" Can the smell of rotten eggs or roses change the type of dream you have? Quite possibly, new research suggests. Stuck said that previous research had shown that other types of stimulation, such as sound, pressure or vibration, could influence the content and the emotional tone of dreams. The study included 15 young, healthy females. As the women entered rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep, when dreaming occurs, they were exposed to either a non-odorous control smell, the rose smell or the rotten egg smell. Each woman underwent three REM \"awakenings,\" so they were exposed to each test once. Pamela Dalton is an expert on odour perception and a sensory psychologist at the Monell Chemical Senses Centre in Philadelphia. She said, \"We are aware at some level of our odorous ambient environment at all times, and I don't think we appreciate that. At some level, our brains are always aware. If this study shows that we can alter the emotional content of dreams, think about what an odour can do to your mood without you even being aware.\" Know that the different aromas of perfumes can also influence the interpretation of dreams. And if you are a woman and you dream of perfume, or you are a man and you have the same dream, know that your feelings and experiences will be different. This is because perfumes are currently seen as an aromatic identity of these two genres. Just so you have an idea, when a woman has a dream that involves perfume, it is probably related to love, romance. Already a man when he has the same dream, this may indicate success in his professional or personal life. People dream about perfumes in many ways. Let us know the interpretations about the main ones?   In our dreams or in everyday life, we often smell familiar smells that take us back to a certain moment or simply make us wonder, why are we sensing this smell right now? We often assume that there must be that this smell is coming from something around us, but these smells can often be spiritual signs or messages from the higher forces. In today\u2019s text we will discuss the meaning of smelling sulfur and what this represents for us. We will also learn more about sulfur itself and his mentioning in the Bible and in Christianity. So, if you smelled sulfur recently and you can\u2019t understand what it means, then keep on reading. Sulfur, chemical symbol S, is a metalloid that occurs naturally in sulfates, in the form of crystalline sulfur or amorphous sulfur, often together with characteristic minerals (Celestine, SrSO4, baritine, BaSO4, aragonite, CaCO3). The sulfate are deposits of sedimentary origin formed in the MIOCENE SUPERIORE (25 million years ago) in so-called EVAPORITES soils formed by evaporation of marine waters in lagoon environments and with hot and dry climates. The evaporation of water and the flowering of algae made the environment, rich in fish and body organisms enclosed in a limestone shell, increasingly poor in oxygen, to the point of causing the death of almost every living species. The organic substance that fell to the bottom was attacked by organisms capable of living in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic bacteria) and over the centuries gypsum and then calcium carbonate and sulfur were first formed. Thus originated that layer called sulfur formation (sulphurous limestone\u2019s associated with gypsum, clays and, sometimes, rock salt) from which we extracted sulfur until a few decades ago. Already known in ancient times, it was used as early as the 9th century BC as medicine, as we still do today. In the 12th century the Chinese invented gunpowder which is a mixture of potassium nitrate (KNO3), coal and sulfur. In Italy, the extraction of sulfur began in Sicily from the beginning of the seventeenth century, near the sulfur springs of the Caltanissetta area. Here the landscape appears as a territory of barren and yellowish hills (except in spring, when the grain dyes them) of intense green), where you can still see and visit the abandoned sulfur mines.  Sodom and Gomorrah are two ancient Biblical cities that God has aligned with earth for absolute mischief, sin, perversion, orgy, violence, and life expectancy. Only the Lot who was the only righteous and his daughters was saved from these two cities.  This biblical story is a warning to the absolute ruin of a society that occurs when a man renounces God and gives away sin. For example, today\u2019s sin has so much overcome that mankind is only destroyed and God\u2019s punishment as Lot\u2019s time is not even needed.  Although many attempt to deny the evidence, the fact is that scientific research confirms the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. These cities were near the Dead Sea between Israel and Jordan. But even today, 4,000 years later, the place where these two cities appeared burnt, and sulfur balls were found there, which is by no means a coincidence. Scientists have proved that all the stone was found in Sodom and Gomorrah actually burned and it is assumed that the cities were really burning at unbelievable temperatures. The scientist agrees that this place is unique in the world by its geological texture, which differs from everything else in the area. They claim that sulfur balls, falling into a true storm, created a temperature of 5000 degrees Celsius, and sulfur still covers the whole place today. Also, geologists argue that on the remains of Sodom and Gomorrah, it is clearly visible that the stone was drenched and blasted, which was not found anywhere in the world. Father, as he walked among the people, he stopped beside someone, and the serious man said to him, \u201cYou are ashamed!\u201d The Christian who seeks to give the Lord the best of himself in the same way that Mary did, sister of Lazarus, will be the Lord with the scent of the Holy Spirit, the unborn love of the Father and the Son. Many pilgrims in the presence of Father Pia felt a heavenly smell. Even today some pilgrims who go to San Giovanni Rotondo have sent a questionnaire that was not available. Many more than a year ago and after he went to visit, you can decide what P\u00e9re Pia is, otherwise unsuitable for your child. It is said that Father Pio makes his smell feel like he is to address. Heavenly Father puts wine again in the old bunks, Jesus cubs. The Holy Spirit is undeniable poured on the one who is facing seriously. He saved Holy Spirit makes it all come to a supernatural love. What are you doing to Jesus? Come Mary, we are called not to waste the waste of our daily lives, but the first fruits. It comes to Cain who sacrificed the lamb to the Lord, but you came Abel who sacrificed the Lord\u2019s first-fruits to the Lord. The Lord are gentlemen who are generous toward him. The Lord loves all, but his only love is what he will with all his mind, with all hearts and with all his strength. Souls or beings try to come into contact only with those people who have a certain transcendence. That is, people whose frequency already vibrates higher and therefore can relatively easily connect with spiritual worlds. We call such souls dead or alien beings from other worlds as spirits. I believe that from their world (dimension) I can see very well who they can \u201cknock\u201d, so to speak, because they can perceive the vibration of higher frequencies in people on Earth. Here are some examples of how ghosts are trying to contact us: Spirits or ghosts can appear as an ectoplasmic entity. In parapsychology, ectoplasm is the substance of a spiritual energy that makes ghosts visible. There are many theories about whether ectoplasm really exists. For the paranormal researchers, it is a mostly mist-like substance that can take all forms. It is believed that ghosts use ectoplasm to make themselves visible and that every human being possesses ectoplasm, which is released into the world as energy when dying. Some believe that our astral body or etheric body consists of ectoplasm. There are reports that people in the mirror have seen an ectoplasmic appearance, although no one else was in the room. Another way in which ghosts can make themselves known is the entry and exit of electric light. A lamp suddenly turns off or on by itself. In Peripheral Perception, some people report the sighting of a mind they have seen in terms of their field of vision. The peripheral field of view is the field that is not in the center of our field of vision but outside. You can see a shadow moving or a shape that you cannot define exactly. Usually it is only fractions of seconds in which one perceives such a shape or movement in the corner of the eye. The classical variant for the assumption that a ghost is present is the moving of objects. Pictures that suddenly hang crooked or objects that are no longer in their original place. A very common variant are odors. You suddenly smell something that cannot be there at all. For example, people report that they smelled a cigar, although no one in the room smoked. Ghosts often try to make themselves felt by significant odors. If someone has smoked cigar during his lifetime, it may happen that one smells of his presence after death in the form of cigar smoke. Or someone who loved the smell of fresh hay, could make his presence noticeable after dying with the typical scent of fresh hay. The smells spread by spirits always have to do with the things they liked during their earthly existence.  A tingling or tickling sensation on our body could be the touch of a mind. Or a slight pressure on our head, which could mean that a spirit is trying to contact our crown chakra. The typical hair bobbing and the feeling of goose bumps often tells us that ghosts are present. Also typical is a cool breeze that suddenly blows through the room, although no window is open. Smell and Taste Disorders Some people are born with these disorders, but most are caused by: Illness (for example, cold or flu, sinus infection, and allergies)Head injuryHormone changesDental or mouth problemsNasal polypsExposure to certain chemicalsCertain medicinesExposure to radiation therapy for head or neck cancerCocaine snorted through the noseCigarette smoking  ",
