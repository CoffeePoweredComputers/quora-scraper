            "answer_text": "Pick a reason to live and run with it.  The Existential Crisis has only two solutions, two sides of the same coin. Think of The Joker and Batman in this situation as solutions to the Existential Crisis. Both of these characters deal with the apparent lack of meaning in life in two drastically different ways. The Joker would represent Nihilism.  To The Joker, everything is a joke; even life itself. In The Joker\u2019s darkest moments, he came to the realization that nothing matters. His life and the lives of others are just a small part of a universal circus where morals, values, and purpose do not exist. While many of the things that The Joker does are seen as evil, to The Clown Prince of Crime himself, the word \u201cEvil\u201d has no meaning. Batman would represent Existentialism.  Bruce Wayne was just a little boy whose life was forever changed by the actions of one lowly criminal. In those moments, Bruce lost the two most important people in his life at the time; his mother and his father. When Bruce lost what gave his life meaning, he created The Batman to give it a meaning again. Bruce understood that within the void he found himself in, no one would be there to help him escape. Once Bruce created the persona of The Batman, he was free to give meaning to his life in anyway he saw fit. Batman and The Joker both recognized that life is inherently meaningless. The main, polarizing difference between them both is that while The Joker abandoned finding a meaning in life, Batman made one. So if you wish to be free from the Existential Crisis, quit searching for a meaning to your life. Make one. ",

Meditation is a great way to practice this. I suggest you learn more about buddhism and the 4 foundations of mindfulness because theyve helped me in times of existential crisis.
