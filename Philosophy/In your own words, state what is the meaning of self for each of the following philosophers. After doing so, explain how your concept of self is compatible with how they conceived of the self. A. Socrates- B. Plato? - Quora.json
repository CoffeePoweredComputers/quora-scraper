            "answer_text": "According to Socrates sprit and body are parts of Self. Sprit is eternal and non-tangible. On death it goes to another plane. Our body is tangible,subject to continuous changes and on death it decay. Accrding Plato Self is the cumulative existence of Sprit, logic or reason (intellect)and appetite. It is our sprit direct our life which include values, emotions and desires. In principle he accept Socrates version of Self. (Appetite refers to desires, emotions and feelings) My concept based on Shaiva Siddhantham ( a sect. of Hinduism). Self-Jeevathma is eternal, non tangible, beyond any change, gives existence or life to our body but clouded by impurities like anger, jealousy, lust, greed etc along with ego ,karma and ignorance. Just like pure white crystal takes the Colour of which it associated with. On death it takes new birth with new body. But once freed from impurities it becomes one with Paramathma-Brahman but still separate. Self can't exist independent of Brahman. We may say Self is the holographic part of universal consciousness-Brahman like waves in the ocean. Like electricity we act by the presence of Self but it doesn't take part or initiate our actions. Though both concepts compare us to a chariot there is marked differences. In Hindu faith there are five horses which represent our five senses.But Plato version is different. There are two horses. One is noble and of noble BREED and the other is just opposite. Noble horse represents spirit and the wild horse represents appetite. The rider represents reason. All three must act in harmony for good life. How to control the wild horse is the question. May be intellect controlling the wild horse (appetite) through noble horse (spirit)But in Hinduism the word BREED is insignificant in this context. Further reins to intellect and rider is mind . Self is the master. Master is only gives directions. Our mind must control the senses through intellect. If the mind allow itself controlled by senses our life will go without any direction. ",

            "answer_text": "A fun question! I cannot accurately covey the meaning or interpretation of \u201cself\" according to A) Socrates and B) Plato because I am not them and they are not me. Furthermore, their ideas have been filtered through other people and passed down through generations. Even their writings (like mine herein) are filtered through the readers reality. So all I would be doing, is placing words in their mouths. Whether or not how I perceive the self and if it is compatible with A) or B) is a judgment filtered through no other than the self. So the human self, is a filter in which we get to use to create or attempt to create our own realities and then experience the outcome of that creation. The challenging part is sifting through all these selves or even recognizing that the selves exist in the first place. Therefore, only the ego can deny it's own existence while the human creates it's own reality. ",
