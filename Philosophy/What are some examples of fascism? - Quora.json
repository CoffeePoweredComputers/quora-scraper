            "answer_text": "There is only one example, which was Fascism in Italy led by a Fascist Council with Benito Mussolini as the leader. The Fascist movement took it\u2019s name from the Roman Fasca, which was an axe around which rods were tied with leather cords. The Fasca represented the power of Rome and the Roman state, and it\u2019s components such as the axe, the rods, and the leather. The Fasca is found in most American symbols of power also, and Fascas are found in the US Senate Chamber and the US House of Representatives. The Lincoln Memorial features Lincoln sitting in a chair with two Fascae on either side. Think about that next time you call someone a \u201cfascist.\u201d Fascism was very different than National Socialism in Germany under Hitler, or any other similar movements or states. National Socialists never for a moment thought of themselves as even similar to Italian Fascists. In Spain the Falanke was inspired by Fascists, and but contained socialist planks like nationalization of banks which were opposed by both Fascists and National Socialists. In Lebanon the Falange was inspired by the Falanke and the Fascists. In Latin America there were several governments which people falsely label as Fascist but all these governments were merely authoritarian states assembled by oligarchs and were very conservative. The chief difference among many between National Socialism and Fascism is that National Socialism was socialist, and was oriented towards the interests of laborers and farmers and against aristocrats and oligarchs. Fascism was a creation of oligarchs to form a counter to communism which they could control. National Socialism struggled with little popular support until the great depression because no oligarchs would support them and most laborers gravitated to the communists. When the depression came the oligarchs of Germany turned to the National Socialists out of desperation to stave off a communist take over. But whatever you do don\u2019t believe people who conflate Fascism with National Socialism or other rightist ideologies which are distinct from each other and hold only superficial similarities. ",

            "answer_text": "Fascism as a political system is summarized well by Don. As an economic system its where the state directly or indirectly controls the business decisions of companies via laws, allocations of contracts and dictates, threatening sanctions if they do not comply. Arguably a recent example which if was to become common place would be Fascism, was Donald Trump \u201cforcing\u201d Ford not to relocate jobs to Mexico through threat of sanction. Now this was seen as a good thing by Trump supporters but unscored with \u201cgovernment violence\u201d in the form of taxes. In civil rights, fascism is often called when authorities overstep their bounds and use disproportionate violence against peaceful protesters exercising their rights to peaceful protest and assembly. A famous case in America was the Kent State shooting in 1970 Kent State shootings - Wikipedia, which started off as peaceful protests against the government and the war and became steadily more violent culminating in shooting of 13 students with 4 being killed. These are all examples of fascism with a little \u2018f \u2018 i.e. not a fully reinforcing system of authoritarian rule but examples of government utilising violent means to achieve their aims whilst overriding the rights of the other party. Fascism is rule by dictate, by a party or person which claims the right to rule through elitism i.e. being the right race, colour or creed and that claim to have a superior right to rule over the masses. As as state system it abolishes opposition and democratic assembly or turn it into a rubber stamp. Typically one party rules the state and party members gain considerable advantages over the general populace. ",
