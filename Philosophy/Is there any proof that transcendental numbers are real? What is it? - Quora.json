            "answer_text": "Not all transcendental numbers are real (for example [math]ei[/math] is not), but real transcendental numbers are real, by definition. There\u2019s nothing to prove. You may be asking how do we know that any real numbers are transcendental \u2013 meaning, they are not algebraic. There are several ways to do this: The easiest way is by counting. The algebraic numbers are countable, and the real numbers are not. Therefore, there are uncountably many real transcendental numbers.The number [math]\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty 10^{-n!}[/math] is transcendental. It is sometimes called Liouville\u2019s constant, in honor of Joseph Liouville who proved that it is transcendental in 1844. This is probably still the easiest proof that a particular number is transcendental.Various specific, familiar real numbers are proven to be transcendental, including [math]e[/math], [math]\\pi[/math] and [math]e^\\pi[/math]. The proof that [math]e[/math] is transcendental is easier than the other two; all of these, and many others, can be found in Alan Baker\u2019s \u201cTranscendental Number Theory\u201d.",

            "answer_text": "Alon Amit's answer answers the question assuming the mathematical notion of the real number, and some commenters wondered that maybe some other meaning of the word \u201creal\u201d was intended. Then the question becomes philosophical (what do we consider \u201creal\u201d?) but once we agree on the philosophical views, we can stilll prove some things formally. Well, we do not know (yet?) exactly how our reality works. Maybe, if we look close enough, everything is discrete (like in Conway\u2019s Game of Life); I think some physicists believe that this is actually the case. If so, then I would say that only integers are \u201creal\u201d, and even non-integer rational numbers are just mathematical constructions. On the other hand, we could consider abstract notions such as numbers to be \u201creal\u201d if we can define them precisely. This idea can be formalized (computable number, definable real number). Transcendental numbers such as [math]\\pi[/math] or Liouville\u2019s constant are definitely definable (and even computable) and thus \u201creal\u201d. (Liouville\u2019s constant is easier to compute, and it is easier to prove that it is transcendental.) By L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem we know that, if a model of ZFC exists, then there exists a countable model of ZFC. Such a model behaves exactly like the class of all sets: it has its own 0, 1, [math]\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{Z}, 2/3, \\pi[/math], it has all the computable numbers, and all the usual theorems also work in this model. Since this model is countable, its [math]\\mathbb{R}[/math] also has countably many elements (but the model does not contain a bijection from [math]\\mathbb{R}[/math] to [math]\\mathbb{Z}[/math], so it looks uncountable from inside the model). Maybe one of such models is actually the reality, and thus there are only countably many \u201creal\u201d reals, and all the others are \u201cvirtual\u201d and do not really exist. But all the computable (or just definable) numbers such as [math]\\pi[/math] are all in the model and are definitely \u201creal\u201d. I do not think there is any reason to consider algebraic numbers \u201creal\u201d, but numbers such as [math]\\pi[/math] not. ",
