            "answer_text": "To be straight foreword yes they can become . It depends on if they want to or not! You know hackers have to wright python codes , backdoor , shells and all other malware and stuff.. So what better if a programmer wants to be a Hacker . But first you need to train and gather some information already out there on different levels of protocols, encryption and security. Yes there are some extra things to do but someone has to do them anyway in order to become hacker and being a programmer you wold have a better way out becoming one. but there is more to it , hacking in most cases required physical excess which is a social thing and programmers are bad at. Not everyone lacks those social skills but still there are some out there. There are somethings that you need to consider if you wanna go Black Hat . wipe out as much as information you can on internet and social media. Never let your friends and family know what you do. Always be hidden from people in public place where you are going to execute any hack . Browse the web anonymously. Upgrade to Linux as its more open and gives you more option and like windows it doesn't store much information about yourself . ",

If you\u2019ve been working in software long enough, you\u2019ve \u201chacked\u201d things to change the way the code works. However the security meaning today, I would say it is more-so a different mindset instead of \u201csmarter than\u201d. Programmers/developers mostly want to build, and the hackers wish to circumvent/exploit. I\u2019ve seen exploits in the wild, patched a few myself. I dabble in security and go to security conferences but I\u2019m no offensive security professional that\u2019s a whole other field. The tools and similar skills are there for both to cross over, programmer <= => hacker I\u2019ve seen some of the code that \u201chackers\u201d write to use as tools. The code was very poorly written\u2026.but then again, it worked and ran the exploit so \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af Different mindset, different goals. ",
