            "answer_text": "Norms are behaviors that are culturally approved and/or widely accepted. Morals are more aptly understood as distinguishing a behavior as right or wrong regardless of whether or not said behavior is culturally approved or widely accepted. Ethics then is the systematic approach one uses in making a decision regarding a behavior. So how are these similar? I think the intent of each is the promotion of a stable, safe and productive society. You might think of these as elements that, when they come together, help ensure that result. If normal behavior is working with a general sense of morality and the methods by which we make choices don\u2019t conflict with either, then you have stability. A oversimplified example: let\u2019s assume you are driving along a road without posted speed limits. Let\u2019s also assume for the sake of this argument that you\u2019re driving in a place where you aren\u2019t exactly sure which traffic laws apply. How do you determine your speed. The other traffic seems to be maintaining a normal range of 55 to 70 mph. Persons going over or under these speeds are disrupting traffic flow; you observe that these people might cause an accident which is something you don\u2019t want. Going over all this you make a decision to cruise at 65. Hope this helps\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Norms are the existing level of behaviors in current society and there are many norms that aren\u2019t acknowledged in listings and parameters of social norms that actually are avidly pursued by many if not most of the citizens of a particular time or place. Morality is trying to objectively treat your fellow man or woman as you would like to be treated and to not do wrong. Ethics is akin to morality. It is a discipline of conduct in people to deal with their world. There are people with very low ethics and people with very high, but most people seem to fall somewhere between the two. In a civilized society more will fall closer to high than to low. I think America is that way. I think most humans are that way. Hope this is enough to explain clearly enough to explain the difference between the three. ",
