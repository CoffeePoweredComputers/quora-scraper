            "answer_text": "There is no restriction for anyone to live in a capitalist society the way they want. Then such countries have products that are extremely functional and one has no choice other than consume them for your basic needs. You can live in small towns where there are materialistic consumers though rational in doing so to some sane extent. You can choose such places like small but rich towns in countries like USA, where 85% of the population live. They too are materialistic but not to the extent of onnanistic levels of paranoia. ",

You will probably be surrounded by ambitious people who won\u2019t want to have anything to do with you because you will be dissatisfied with your life in a capitalistic country. But then, there aren\u2019t any capitalist societies anymore, just mixed, so you\u2019ll possibly find people like you. ",
