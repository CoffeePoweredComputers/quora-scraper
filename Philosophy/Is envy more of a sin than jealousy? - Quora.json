            "answer_text": "The same world that says pride is a virtue also says jealousy is a vice. And most of the religious world has fallen for both lies. Get a Bible concordance and look up the words \"jealous\" and \"jealousy\". You'll see that jealousy is very much a good thing. God says repeatedly, \"I am a jealous God.\" He does not want us chasing after other gods, because he knows they are not good for us. He will be angry with us if we are unfaithful; but he will be even more angry with anyone who tries to lure us away from him. All of this is an expression of his love. It is the kind of love that a husband should have for his wife. He should be faithful himself, but he should also expect his wife to be faithful. And woe to any who try to come between a man and his wife! (Proverbs 6:32-35) \"What God has joined together in marriage, let no man put asunder.\" (Mark 10:9) Some Bible translations use the word \"jealousy\" in place of \"envy\". The two are really quite different. Envy is a form of covetousness (wanting what does not belong to you), and it is very much a sin. Illustrated sermon: Jesus or Money ",

            "answer_text": "Envy can lead to more wicked things. When we are wicked, it makes us want to hate people, have malice, and many other terrible attributes (1 Peter 2:1\u20133, Galatians 5:19\u201321, etc). It is the root of all evil (James 3:14, 16). But jealousy can also do some of those things, so it depends on how you look at it. I recommend you watch the video because it goes into detail about why envy is a sin, and the dangers that come from being envious of others.  ",
