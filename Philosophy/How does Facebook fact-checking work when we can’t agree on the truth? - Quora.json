            "answer_text": "Of course we can agree on the truth. Let me give you an example. When President Obama was in office, every December there would be complaints on Facebook that we longer had a National Christmas Tree. There were claims that nobody was allowed to say \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d anymore or talk about the birth of Jesus. I got tired of arguing. So every year, starting on December 1, I used to post a link to the previous year\u2019s Christmas tree lighting. There was President Obama on TV, talking about the birth of Jesus, wishing everyone a Merry CHRISTMAS, and lighting the National CHRISTMAS tree. It was televised every year, and the video continued to be available on the White House website. Truth is out there, and we don\u2019t have to take anyone\u2019s word for it. We have brains. We have resources. Facts are facts. (Do you think it\u2019s true that President Obama said \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d every year in that broadcast? That he called it a \u201cChristmas\u201d tree? That he talked about Jesus? Or are you one of the people who throw up their hands and say we can\u2019t distinguish between true and false?)  ",

            "answer_text": "I believe this to be the difference between fact-checking and opinion. If a political ad claimed, \u201cBarack Obama let millions of illegal immigrants into America without deporting any\u201d that would be a lie. (Two million were deported under Obama.). But if an ad said \u201cBarack Obama was a disaster for our immigration policy,\u201d then although many might disagree, there\u2019s no FACT to check or contradict. So fact-checkers do what the name says. They check facts, usually based on statistics, dates, quantifiable claims that can be verified by reliable sources. These are what any fact-checker weeds out, allowing opinions to flourish. ",

            "answer_text": "You are confusing opinions with truth. There is no agreeing/disagreeing with truth. The only thing that needs to be checked is the source to ensure its valid or supports the truthful statement. If you believe something is true or not true - you cannot just make that statement and expect the rest of the world to fall into line. Prove it. If you prove it to be true then no one should be disagreeing with you. If you can't prove it to be true or not true - then it is an opinion and Facebook will undoubtedly not waste time fact checking opinions, unless the person stating their opinion insists that it's TRUE. Be very careful what you read. Just because you heard it from \u201cthe source\u201d doesn't make it true. What makes it true is that it can be proven without human say so. Sometimes, an opinion is made and others try to present it as the truth. If the original poster has made it clear it is just their opinion, I doubt Facebook will do much to fact check it. At most, they'll mark it as \u201cdubious source\". Take for example, the editorials written on newspaper sites, and plenty of blogs out their that are just opinions. That would fall into a dubious source, especially if others are sharing the editorials or blogs as \u201cfact\" and failing to mention they are editorials. So to answer your question Facebook factchecking doesn't care if you agree or disagree, all Facebook cares about is - does it have provable facts or not. ",
