            "answer_text": "Depends on what you mean; equal in what? Are all people equally gifted (equally good in anything, or equally good but in different things), or equally intelligent? No. Some are smarter, some are better in carpentry, etc. Are all people equal according to how they run their lives? No. Some can make their lives a success despite setbacks, while others will fail despite the Sun shining on them. Are all people equal in, or because of, how they organise their lives? In other words, are all cultures equal. No. Culture is a way of regulating a society. Are these regulations based on logic, equality of and benefit to all? The less so, the less the culture is. Are all people equal in value? Basically, yes; each human being is worth one life. That is the intrinsic value, or the value you are born in. Ah, you say, but not all people are born equal; many cultures value a daughter less than a son. Indeed; see the question fight above this one. Are all people, basically, equal? As said above, yes. Each life is one life. A multi-billionaire is not worth more or less than the poorest person on Earth, a new-born baby is worth the exact same amount as a 100-year old person. Each is basically worth one life. Or, if you want to put it in numbers: each person is worth exactly zero (= 0). When you are born, you add one life to this planet, but that life itself has added exactly 0 in any sort of true value you might want to consider. Whether that value rises or fall, will become a large positive or negative, depends on how that life is filled. Does the new-born baby bring happiness to its parents and surroundings? Its value rises. Does the person, when adult, add useful to society through work, being helpful, and add to or improve other people\u2019s lives? Its value rises. Does the person life a life of deceit and crime? Its value drops, possibly below zero. Does the person take a life, or even more (by direct murder, but also by shortening other lives through its cations or lack thereof)? Its value becomes irretrievable negative. So, are all people equal? Essentially, yes. But existentially? Their lives, to be measured against all the live stheu tough directly or indirectly, shall be the judge of that. ",

            "answer_text": "Every human being is unique from a consciousness perspective. When we are first born we are equal from a physical perspective of around 30% of us. The other 70% is the entity that we are. Of course there are physical differences, but in general when we are born is the closest moment to us being equal. From that point onwards we begin the creation of our personality for this lifetime. Personalities are different, even those of the same entity who are us over different incarnations. If we could view ourselves from the position of our future self then we would be able to see the different personalities that we are formed from. At our third density of consciousness we do not have the ability to do that except in our dreams. For our entity we are in his dreams. The creator is not polarised but does take on the male creating principles and the female wisdom ones so it is easier saying the male aspect rather than \u201cit\u201d, which sounds disrespectful no matter how it is put. It is a thing, the creator is infinite intelligence and love. Mind is feelings, tones of sound, colour densities of light and intelligent energy. From the human personalities perspective, they are unique. From the entities perspective they are all equally loved and respected for their input towards the experience of the Infinite Intelligent creator. ",

            "answer_text": "According to science or quantum mechanics, everything and all is made from the unified field energies (4 energies that actually is one expressing in 4 different forms). So all of the universe is made of one energy expressed in infinite different ways. This correlates to the law of one in spirituality, brahman, holy spirit, consciousness etc, where everyone and everything is connected by 1 infinitely large hyperintelligent energy that is not different in substance. What is different in humans is that some are more mature or more evolved than others, thats why some are born more intelligent, more athletic, more skilled in certain talents etc. Also our experiences are different, but eventually we learn or have a collective intelligence from each others. If your evolution has developed enough you can tap into that collective pool of knowledge and speed up your evolutionary process. Although everyone will eventually evolve to their highest potential at some point. ",
