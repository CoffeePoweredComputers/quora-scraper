            "answer_text": "Can we acquire any experience without the use of our senses? I assume you mean say I am 20 years old \u2026 \u201cCan I acquire any kind of experience with out any of my many senses?\u201d How does someone define experience? Using our senses, we gain knowledge or practical wisdom from what is observed, encountered, or undergone.Experience may also be one's level of competence or expertise, in a particular field or know-how, again gained by way of the senses.We also may gain experience by way of mental experience, which involves the intellect and consciousness experienced as combinations of thought, memory, emotion, and imagination, and may include unconscious cognitive processes.What you are asking about is definition number 3 above. If you use your mind and discover something new in mathematics, programming, create a patent, etc. If you totally use your mind to design a shed (or anything) before you use any of your senses to write down the design, would you not classify that as an experience? You may be thinking about someone and realize that your are falling in love with them as an emotional experience. Again, no senses are involved now, but you have a memory from your senses of that person. As a programmer, many times my mind would create a unique solution to a problem. The solution to the problem came from my unconscious. When I realized the solution, I would experience a feeling of elation about the solution. I could go on with many more examples, but the answer to your question is YES! ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think so. Unless you're talking about the classic 5 senses, but we have all known since middle school that humans have more than 5 senses. If you don't perceive something in any sense, in any way, you aren't experiencing anything. This includes the sense of self, introspection, thoughts, etc. If something happens that is imperceptible in every way, it is the same for you as if that thing never happened. ",
