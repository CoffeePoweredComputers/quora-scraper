            "answer_text": "If you mean like as in a \u201cmetric of freedom\u201d, there are metrics of this kind, various indeces that measure the freedoms of a society. If you mean as in \u201cboundaries of freedom\u201d, which is a philosophical discourse on the nature of freedom then I got bad news for you. Societies limit freedom, are not a source of freedom. More democratic societies have fewer leashes on the freedom of the individual, but regardless of the form of governance, society means setting rules of conduct to the effect of limiting freedom. The etymology of freedom in Greek (btw the national anthem of Greece is an ode to Freedom) \u0395\u039b\u0395\u03a5\u0398\u0395\u03a1\u0399\u0391 relates to the verb \u0395\u039b\u0391\u03a5\u039d\u03a9 which means I boldly go wherever I please whenever I please, if I so please. States have issues with that. Even open societies do. The less they do, the more free they are. ",
