            "answer_text": "The more they talk about how they practice good things, the less you should believe they practice what they preach.The more they complain about and judge others, the less you should believe they practice what they preach.The more they seem smug and superior, looking down on others, the less you should believe they practice what they preach.The more they view sinners, the lost, and the struggling as \u201cother\u201d kinds of people, the less you can be sure they practice what they preach.If they preach, but never, never, never talk about how they practice doing good, that\u2019s a good sign.If they preach, but never, never, never talk about themselves, that\u2019s also a good sign.If they point out sin and how to avoid it, without actually pointing the finger at anybody, that\u2019s a good sign.The more they treat others as equals, and even go beyond that, treat everyone with courtesy and respect, not matter who they are, that\u2019s a good sign.The more they speak of sinners and the lost as people we can help by our prayers and example, that\u2019s a good sign.The more they talk about God and the things of God, and avoid speaking about themselves, that\u2019s a good sign.",
