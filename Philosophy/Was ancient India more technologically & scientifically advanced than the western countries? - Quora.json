            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Ancient Indians were good free thinkers and produced a lot of new ideas in all major branches of science but few of these ever resulted in useful technology as far as I know. This was because knowledge transmission suffered bottlenecks due to the famous Indian reluctance to maintain records and transmit them freely. This is where Greece and China trumped India. These two civilizations were avid record keepers, particularly the Chinese. In addition, their secular knowledge was less mixed with religion and mysticism than Indians\u2019. Technology is application of scientific knowledge to practical applications. Both Chinese and the Greeks excelled at this. However, Indian economic output remained huge, as much as 30% of the world economy for a in 1st century AD. The reason was not technology but the climate of India. Hot humid summers and mild winters permitted Indians to cultivate crops year round without making any effort to improve agricultural efficiency. Much of Europe could manage only one crop a year. This kept Europe poor till they started using their brains to bring their harsh climate under their control. While Greeks, Romans and Chinese executed irrigation projects to improve their agricultural efficiency, Indians relied on rain gods and conducted homas and yagas to please the rain god. India has been traditionally an exporter or cash crops and food grains. India could export so much food also because those who actually produced food were largely lower castes and untouchables who traditionally not supposed to consume beyond their basic needs. It was like keeping 30\u201340% of your population enslaved without having to chain them up \u2014 their minds willingly enslaved them. Caste system in India also prevented horizontal transmission of knowledge. While both Chinese and Greek societies had their own class systems, and slavery, these were not religiously dictated so were immutable. Thus it was possible for geniuses to emerge from lower classes and even from among slaves, particularly among the ancient Greeks and Romans. Such slaves were given freedom and full citizenship. Thus ancient Indians, despite having the best opportunities and resources in the ancient world, mostly sat over them for centuries and let other civilizations overtake them. Conclusion: Two factors prevented Indian technology from developing like that of the Chinese or the Greeks. (a) poor record keeping affected transmission of knowledge, and (b) caste system that prevented spreading of knowledge which was transmitted only vertically, that too by word of mouth, seldom horizontally. These deficiencies remained hidden at first due to the natural bounty that made high yield out of lazy farming. But the climatic advantage that Indians enjoyed started disappear about 700 years ago, which saw the per capita income of Western Europeans exceed that of India, Middle East and China, and this differential continued to increase. The Plague of \u201cScience\u201d in Holy Books I thought that it was the Christians and Muslims who first made these irrational claims about their holy books beginning the 1970s. But I was wrong. According to this essay by Aldous Huxley, Indians might have been the pioneers. Huxley wrote this almost a century ago. He says that Hindus make huge claims about the science in their holy books without evidence. Maybe we owe reparations for spreading irrationality to Christian and Muslim worlds.  ",

            "answer_text": "I will be answering this as per my understanding of historical events. Firstly, we aren't the same, bruh! For you, only this is technological or scientific advancement :  But, for me, not only the above ones, these are also indicators of technical knowledge :   For you, \u2018science\u2019 refers only to physics, chemistry, geophysics, astrophysics, aerodynamics, etc. But, in my opinion, there are two broad kinds of sciences : Natural sciences.Social sciences.Now, consider these : In Harappa, houses that were made of similarly proportioned bricks were excavated \u2014 does this indicate good architectural knowledge, with respect to these times? Probably, yes! The same Harappan civilization was known for excellent drainage system and good roadways. Does this indicate good knowledge of town planning? Probably, yes!The Great Bath was known to have been water - tight. Its designing has also been appreciated. Ploughs were also used in agriculture to upturn the soil.Various methods were employed in crafts production in Harappa.Again consider these : Now, going by your definition of science, was their any kind of scientific knowledge? Let's pick up a random topic, say, evolution. Have a look at the avatars of Lord Vishnu once : Matsya Avatar : It can be interpreted as the one initial kind of vertebrates. As per scriptures, during this time, there was only water on earth. Kurma Avatar : Kurma Avatar is an amphibian. Kurma Avatar can both swim in water and walk on land. Varaha Avatar : It is often said to be of the indication of the advent of mammals. Narasimha Avatar : It is half - lion and half - human being. Indication of the beginning of human thoughts can be seen from here. Vamana Avatar : This the first avatar when Lord Vishnu incarnates as a complete human being. He is a dwarf. Parashurama Avatar : He is taller than Vamana Avatar and has well - developed physique. Shri Rama Avatar : Sri Rama was the perfect human being. He had an unmatched level of patience, and certainly, was calmer than Parashurama Avatar. Sri Krishna Avatar : He is more diplomatic in nature and is more into political activities. Gautam Buddha : He is mostly revered as a human being, who renounced all the luxuries and led a simple life later on. Kalki Avatar : We humans, through our bad deeds, are destroying ourselves day - by - day. At the end of Kaliyuga, He is going to destroy all the foes and violators of dharma. As a conclusion, we can have the view that He will signify how we, as human beings have engaged in self - destruction, with time. You are free to perceive them as mere Puranic mythologies or symbolism , but I have one question though : How were these so cautiously put in an evolutionary order? These, if not completely, can roughly have evolutionary perceptions. Now, if I talk about social sciences, then the best possible example is nobody other than Chanakya. His diplomacy is revered till date. He is also known for his \u201cArthashastra\u201d.  Now, coming to those arguments which claim that missiles and all existed in India. I am yet to read Bhagawad Gita. But, would like to quote Dr. Carl Segan : The Hindu religion is the only one of the world\u2019s great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths.It is the only religion in which the time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma, 8.64 billion years long. Longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half the time since the Big Bang. I wouldn't like to comment anything, as of now, regarding this. I am yet to explore this thing myself. During this age, the West is taken for granted as an \u2018indicator\u2019 of development in the field of technology or science. But, we should note that every culture is having its unique developmental characteristics. I wouldn't mind, I would encourage you to share your thoughts as per your understanding. -miliSou \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb ",
