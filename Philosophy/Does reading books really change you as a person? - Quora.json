            "answer_text": "Simple answer, YES! I never read a whole book throughout my school years. I thought books were boring and they were useless - i would rather watch a movie! The best thing about book reading is how far and wild your imagination can go. Once you realise what you enjoy, you find a book about it and you can re-live that enjoyment everyday! I am your average 29 year old who is about to get married and love dogs and hiking \u2026 but my favourite thing in the WORLD to read is Italian mafia books. I have a whole bookshelf dedicated to John Gotti, Sammy \u201cthe bull\u201d Gravano, Richard \u201cthe ice man\u201d Kuklinksi .. but on the other side of my bookshelf, i also have really random genres like horror, romance, autobiographies and self-help that i have enjoyed reading time and time again. The upside to reading is that if you REALLY enjoy the book, you will not want to put it down. You get lost in the book and your imagination runs wild pending how descriptive the book it. There have been books that are 500+ pages that i read in a week because i couldn\u2019t wait to make some free time just to read. From a change perspective, it opens your mind to see things differently in life. The mafia books interest me because you see life through the eyes of someone else in a time where you weren\u2019t around. Italian mafia \u201cbig boys\u201d span from 1920\u2019s through to the 1990\u2019s (and now too perhaps but the big boys i enjoyed reading about & movies were made about are now long gone) Books about romance make you appreciate your loved one for the things they do for you, no matter how small they are. Horror books open your eyes to the realisation that some of this stuff could only happen in a book or a movie and never in reality. Self-help books? Well they speak for themselves. My absolute favourite is \u201cthe subtle art of not giving a f*ck\u201d by Mark Manson. Self-help books assist the realisation of your true potential in life, employment, love life and family. In short - reading is the bomb-diggity! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, reading can change you as a person, provided you are interested in reading. Reading lets you understand the author's perspective and takes you through their world of thoughts. You can literally be in another world while reading! Personally, I prefer reading nonfiction to fiction. Specifically, memoirs, autobiographies and philosophy genres. It generally provides me a lot of insights about life and creativity. Therefore, if you are a beginner to reading, first find the genre of your interest and read at least a few fixed number of pages every day. You can slowly notice the changes it brings in you with time (Of course consistency is the key for observing these changes). ",

            "answer_text": "Just reading books will not help you to change yourself. Reading books help you to realise so many things you might not aware of those things. For example a person who always talk negative in life and who see the flaws in other may get some idea from the books that how this attitude affects life of person negatively but most of times people learn these things from books but don't apply in real life which does not change person. So reading book won't help you untill unless you apply those things in your life. Even not just about book, your life won't change untill you are willing to change through actions. Small actions are much better than having bigger plans/thought s without actions. ",
