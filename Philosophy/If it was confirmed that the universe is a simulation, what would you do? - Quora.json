            "answer_text": "None of these answers were particularly satisfactory so I'll attempt to answer. I was looking for an answer to this same question. First. I'm assuming that only I *personally* know the universe is a simulation. If the world as a whole knew our society would likely collapse, amongst other problematic scenarios. Given that, the first thing I'd do is likely try to find some other like minded, intelligent people that could be convinced the universe was a simulation. It would be lonely indeed if you were the only one to know. Second, I would brainstorm with them regarding what the best course of action is. Understand: You would be the equivalent of an ant trapped inside a NSA supercomputer. Your chances of \u201chacking the simulation\u201d would be effectively nil. Frankly you should feel honored you even realize this fact. You would be the equivalent of an ant not only realizing it's trapped inside a supercomputer but understanding what the basic function of the supercomputer is. Third comes the hard part. You and your group would have to accept you're not getting out of the simulation. This could lead to feelings of pointlessness and bitter disappointment. Fourth, act upon the best course of action. Perhaps you decide the best thing all of you could do is improve the quality of the simulation by solving global warming, or extending the life of your fellow player characters. After all, there is a decent chance that anyone that dies has their consciousness deleted. Fifth, try to stay at least a little practical. While it is cool realizing the universe is a simulation, it doesn't matter as much if you get hit by a bus crossing the street. TLDR? I'd do what I try to do in every video game I play: Grow in power and wealth, enjoying the journey along the way. Ideally by the latter half (50) of my simulation's life I will be in a position of great power and wealth with a loving wife and player character children. After all, the best simulations have a strong sense of progression. I could write a book about my answer to this situation. But those are the first steps. ",
