            "answer_text": "Abortion morally justifiable? When the pregnant woman decides so. For an ethical evaluation one has to see the involved parties. 1. The pregnant woman: her body, her dignity, her sanity, her mental capacity. She holds the main burden of carrying the child to term. She is not a machine and thus one has to also understand her mental struggles. This is the simplest form of liberty, the most basic form of self defense and self determination. Denying her that right (including funding by society) is forced pregnancy, akin to rape! 2. The fetus, the (unborn) child, the unfinished human. This clump of cells is no human being. It has no stake, as it can't have any. The fetus can't carry any complex emotion and won't care. Human growth is a lasting process. What makes us human is achieved earliest around the time when children typically start to speak. Before the infant has no self-consciousness (a feat, even achieved by animals humans kill for fun) it can't have any say! 3. Close society (family, friends), here it gets difficult. They are most likely impacted and definitely they need to be considered. Possibly they desire children, they see the pregnancy grow and thus will have a mental loss with an abortion. A close knit family (or friend base) that exists by trust will have their influence on the pregnant woman. Close society is the reason to keep abortions at a minimum and drive ethical policies to proper sex-ed, free or cheap contraception and access to medical care.  4. Society at large. Humans are a pest on this planet. We pollute everything, drive many species into extinction, etc. Not a single more extra human is needed! Au contraire, unwanted humans increase the risk for wars and possibly even human extinction. Extra children against the pregnant womans wish are abhorrent. This is to breed humans for extending the own power base. This is hyper-unethical. If a society sees a need to soften overaging and can't do that by immigration, they could reduce abortions by mandating work protections for pregnant women, (paid) parental leave and the programs mentioned under #3.  I despise the \"pro-life\" crowd. They are so blatant hypocrites. They need abortions! They need to blow them up to feel meaningful and morally good for themselves. Most of them support war, lethal self defense (even if their life is not at stake) and of course killing criminals or putting them in jail for the remainder of their life. They oppose mandatory organ donation or stem cell research, no matter how much suffering those reduce.  And then they think the little fetus is already a small human being, with all their rights. But once the children are born they lose their rights immediately. Or how do they justify genital mutilation of the infant or abusive indoctrination with silly superstition of children? Pure religious power grab that is... PS: I love children, I fathered at least three and would like to add three more. I adore pregnant women or couples pushing their strollers. PPS: I am very open for discussion in every topic. I would love to read from someone opposing abortion a reasonable evaluation of all sides... EDIT: I needed to edit a misunderstanding sentence. Sorry, I am not a native speaker. the old sentence (4th paragraph, 5th sentence) was: \" What makes us human is achieved earliest when the child can speak.\" ",
