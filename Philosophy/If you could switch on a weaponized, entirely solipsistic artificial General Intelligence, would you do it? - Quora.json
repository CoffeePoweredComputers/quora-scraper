Is there even another answer to this? Your basically positing an AI that is designed to be dangerous (weaponized) and believes itself to be the only actual thing in existence which means it cannot have any sort of respect for other life of any sort. We have enough to worry about without building in solipsism and weaponizing to our hypothetical AGI. Merely failing to align the value systems would be enough. ",

You\u2019d think the whole \u201csolipsism\u201d thing would not stand up in the face of contrary evidence, you-n-me aside.OMG ! Can you imagine the lawsuits ?You madman ! If there is real-world History to appeal to, it is that Humans don\u2019t Trust their machine creations. WE have always insisted the Computer tell us Why it made the decision it did before implementing their insights in the real world.",
