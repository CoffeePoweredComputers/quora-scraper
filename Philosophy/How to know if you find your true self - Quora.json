You\u2019ve a view of what others think of you. This is View \u2018B\u2019. (3) Others\u2019 actual view of you. This is View \u2018C\u2019. (4) We come back to the Quora question: How do you know when you have truly discovered your true self? Answer: When you find that the above A = B = C.Complete consonance of you, and your relationship to the world. Metaphysical unity bliss.But, it\u2019s not definitive truth. Because you can\u2019t ever be sure what others really think of you, even if they tell you candidly, sincerely, honestly. What they think of you plays out in their minds. You\u2019ve no access to their minds.You have a higher probability of the tri-congruency if you live in a society that gives primacy to the collective. Communitarianism.Conversely, you have zero probability of the tri-congruency if you live in a society that rah rah celebrates the soaring Individual. You\u2019re a perpetual work-in-progress in this society because of enforced individualism.That said, you can truly know yourself if you live in complete isolation. You\u2019re defined by View A, period. But then again, there may be no self for you to know. Your self is defined in relation to others, as a mountain is defined by its valley.(5) Related: Sam Qwato's answer to Why do most people have an average life? How does one have a higher life? ",

During this period, think about what makes you happy and what makes you sad, what inspires you, and what discourages you. (Note: It would be more beneficial to write the question and answer down to later reflect on) Also, think about your flaws, for example, if you're prone to anger or say things you don\u2019t mean, think about what kind of people you have allowed in your life, since your friends reflect who you are, ask yourself what do you hate and what do you like, and who do you think you are or wish to be.

No longer bound by fixed beliefs about your identity, the floodgates open and you sense that you\u2019re channeling an infinite possibility generator.Genuine responsiveness to life: you\u2019re moved by stuff \u2014 things that happen to others, the pain of others, the joy of others. You\u2019re flowing on a river that includes you and everything else, and it has an emotional depth and richness that you cannot express in language.A profound sense of responsibility: you recognize that this is very much your world to save, you stop thinking that it\u2019s \u201cout there\u201d like something you can ignore, and realize that it\u2019s \u201cin here\u201d with you, in a container that\u2019s vast and open-ended. A prison cell that you share with the world and cannot ignore.Peace that isn\u2019t withdrawal. Before, you could only be at peace if you isolated yourself from sources of upset. But true self can be at peace in the midst of chaos.Tolerance for uncertainty: you\u2019re no longer bothered by not knowing what\u2019s next. Your ability to dance with the music means that you don\u2019t freak out about tripping over you feet sometimes when things change unexpectedly.I can go on. The point is that the \u201cbar\u201d for this is a lot higher than most people think. Complacency is not appropriate, in light of that. ",

Like a sword that cuts, but cannot cut itself. Like an eye that can see, but cannot see itself. Like the mind identifies, but cannot identify itself. Being Buddha is finding your true self. This being is free from any world attachment. This does not mean that he has no feeling, emotions or sense of pains. It is just is. Don\u2019t think of it as a spirituality context where you are thinking about God when you are peeling potatoes. You are just peeling the potatoes. When it\u2019s time to get dressed, put on your cloths. When you must walk, then walk. When you must sit, then sit. Don\u2019t have a single thought in your mind about seeking your true self. Because you are already it. You may have doubts and such that you are not from all the experiences but just let the sky is always blue. Clouds will change the colours to grey and block the view. But no matter what blocks it, the sky will always be blue. I talk more about this topic in this video.  ",

            "answer_text": "Oh goodness. So many ways this question could be answered, but how much justice can words really do? I\u2019m not sure your temperment or tendencies, but if you\u2019re into contemplation, listening, learning, transformation, reflecting, being open to change, I\u2019d recommend checking out Adyashanti\u2019s writing and lectures. There are others like him, too. Eckhart Tolle is very accessible. If you find their talks on YouTube, you might be led to others\u2019, too. If you\u2019re into meditation, first of all, realize that lots of meditation practices are not aimed at better self-awareness or gnosis or\u2026 the idea of knowing the self means different things in different traditions. But, if possible find a Vedic self-inquiry meditation teacher who is familiar with and appreciates Ramana Maharshi. In general, explore the internet with the term \u201cSelf-Inquiry\u201d. You might find some interesting things. These are some recommendations. :) Edit: Since this question was (originally) phrased, \u201cHow do YOU find YOURself?\u201d Well, for me\u2026 I am not entirely sure. I\u2019m not even sure there\u2019s a self to find. But the things I mentioned, and more, and things I explore. On another level of \u201cself\u201d, I also take stock and check in al the time (repeatedly throughout each day or even hour) with how much I am enjoying ot not enjoying a given tsk or thought or choice or experience. When I follow wisdom, i make these choices consciously, in a way that is love and joy oriented. I do not alwys make these wise choices - I will tell you that. Following through on joy and love is a way of showing my \u201cself\u201d or my heart in a way that feels\u2026 like making the most of this life. But on another level, I seem to be very gradually letting go of how important everything is\u2026 all my thoughts and feelings on things (and thoughts and feelings are ultimately our perception of everything after all right? We percieve through our eyes and minds). So I can take life less seriously. But you know. These are just words. Nobody really knows what\u2019s going on :-P ",

But, doing math is something that\u2019s thrust upon you, either by your parents/school or society. Anything you do at your own will, own interest, and when and if you derive happiness from it, we can call it being your true self. At the end of the day it all boils down to a very primitive, simple fact. Doing what you love, your calling, your dream. Whatever you enjoy doing is the true self you are looking for. Anything that you love doing, should be your job, and it should surprise you because, someone is paying you to do that. Any epiphanies? ;) I guess that\u2019s all I have to say. Good luck discovering your true self and be happy always.. Cheers..! PS : If you revel in doing something, enjoy it to the core, then you are already there. True self is what you have found.

Take a close look at your life. What you are thinking and what you are doing. You are the sum of those two things. Where you want to go from there will take some imagination, but it\u2019s up to you.
