            "answer_text": "That it has mass. That it acts as an anchor for its only close neighbor, the moon. It possesses an atmosphere. It is the third planet from the sun in a planetary system consisting of seven other planets, and one newly titled \u2018minor\u2019 planet, Pluto. The earth is the only planet we know of - so far - that inhabits life; its physical characteristics also make it the most unique planet so far discovered, both within our solar system as well as the hundreds of others discovered beyond it. I also believe it\u2019s a fragile place, and . . like anything fragile? it will take only so much abuse before experiencing catastrophic failure. Lastly? I believe we need to respect the earth as much as most Americans, who own cars or homes, respect them as well. ",
