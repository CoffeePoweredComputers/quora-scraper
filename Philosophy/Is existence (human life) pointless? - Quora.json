            "answer_text": "If that\u2019s your question, and you already have The Answer (\u201dhumans are complex biological robotic units\u201d), it seems a bit beside the point to get into a discussion over it. You already know what you think: life is mechanical and pointless. People who agree with you will agree with you, and suggest ways to try to enjoy life anyway, find some point in it for yourself, and so on. People who don\u2019t agree with you will probably talk about religion and its comforts. As for me, I\u2019ll just say that I also spent some time thinking that life is pointless when I was in college and reading the Existentialists, and later on reading science popularizers like Robert Ardrey and books like \u201cThe Selfish Gene\u201d. Who knows, I may come back to thinking that way sometime before (or right after?!) I die (I\u2019m in my late seventies, so that\u2019s not some far off hypothetical notion). One of the points I\u2019d like to make is that people with questing, restless minds are likely to find different belief systems that suit them at different periods of their lives. Since (so far) nothing is provable as an answer to your question, there is no standard answer outside of religious or materialist dogma. Seems to me that everyone may search, if they so choose, until they find something that seems like a good fit to their own personal perceptions of reality, and stay with that as long as it works for them. IOW, if you\u2019re troubled by the answer you\u2019ve got at present (biolgical robotic units), I would keep looking and look elsewhere. Read widely, listen to many answers. If you\u2019re not firmly anchored in a satisfying religious belief structure, finding other answers is a DIY job. For the record, I was raised as a (very) reform Jew, got entranced by intellectual Catholicism (Theilhard de Chardin, Thomas Merton), ran across Zen Buddhism (Alan Watts, bunch of other writers on Zen in America) and began rather spotty meditation practice that has lasted ever since, and about 35 yrs ago became interested in paranormal exploration (starting with \u201cSeth Speaks\u201d, and lately Ian Stevenson on accounts of reincarnation in young children). That\u2019s about where I am now: I think that we reincarnate over and over until we, as souls, learn what ligr in these sapient mammalian bodies can teach us, the point being to bring that learning with us when we \u201cgraduate\u201d on to whatever (non-physical) existence comes next. That\u2019s enough of a \u201cpoint\u201d for me, but mileage varies of course. And I can\u2019t prove a thing, and wouldn\u2019t try to if I could. So that\u2019s my answer, for what it\u2019s worth. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve never seen a bunch of more confused answers to any question on Quora and that is saying a lot. Life may be pointless, but that is not simply \u201ca given fact\u201d as so many of the other answers here have alleged, and if the question is reduced to the subjective then it isn\u2019t at all meaningful\u2014just because you don\u2019t believe that you life is personally pointless doesn\u2019t mean that in objective fact it isn\u2019t actually pointless if indeed life is objectively pointless. In the U.S. and most of the Western world there are two predominate mythological commitments: naturalistic atheism and Christian realism. The former professes the world to be dysteleological and the later teleological. If the world really is dysteleological than existence is objectively speaking pointless. As a philosopher whose main area of research is in the philosophy of science. I can tell you that all the philosophical schemes that people are committed to\u2014largely if not exclusively\u2014because they have a prior commitment to the world being dysteleological ultimately produces an incoherent metaphysics. Indeed a lot of philosophers I know are much happier with subscribing to an incoherent metaphysics than to accept a teleological universe. In short, this totally irrational desire to want to reject that the world may in any way be teleological, which is to say meaningful, is widely subscribed to. However, most of these same people are also happy to live with the cognitive dissonance of then inconsistently ascribing meaning to their own live\u2019s. Me, I am a guy who privileges logical consistency over all else, and so I believe that life has a point and this point is found in living a life of authentic virtue which isn\u2019t just a platitude\u2014I mean most people today (and here I am speaking of educated people) don\u2019t even understand what a virtue actually is, and even when they do intellectually they spend zero effort trying to realize any of them in their own lives.
