            "answer_text": " Am kind of astounded by all the wishy-washy answers to this question. The answer is that Utilitarianism is obviously better. If Kant would be asked by a bunch of SS Nazi officers whether he is hiding jews in his basement then he would tell them which is obviously and ridiculously wrong. Kant is an incompetent snake oil salesman hiding behind sophistry and nearly incomprehensible, needlessly complicated German sentences. (I read some of Kant in German, it\u2019s horrible. The guy fails completely to communicate relatively simple ideas) Also, people don\u2019t really seem to get Utilitarianism, they always interpret it in a dumb and naive way, making it seem intuitively wrong. Let\u2019s take an example: Imagine you live in a society where it would be legal to extract the organs of (i.e. sacrifice) one healthy person to save five people (who have different organs failing). How would Utilitarianism handle this situation? Now, the naive, superficial, psychopath-Utilitarian would say \u201cThat is a good system because you save five people and only lose one so we have net utility of 5\u20131=four people.\u201d That\u2019s bullshit. Imagine a society with such a system. People would be anxious and fear for their lives all the time. That\u2019s *huge* systemic negative utility far outweighing the utility gained from the saved lives that would result from living under that crazy law. It\u2019s not just the quantity of human lives but also the quality of them; life is supposed to be good. Utilitarianism all the way. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, that question actually doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, and I\u2019m explaining why. How do we define what is better and what is worse? Or, more generally, how do we define what is good and what is bad? Usually, it\u2019s a pretty subjective decision. I mean, you like what you like for whatever reason of yours. You also think that something is right while something else is wrong because your heart says so, and no one can proof that you are objectively mistaken. Of course, seeking to decrease arbitrariness, misuse of power, and to make it possible for different people to peacefully coexist, we developed systems that can uniform this sort of judgement. So that we have standardized logical processes, which we can use to evaluate what is better, in an \u201cunbiased\u201d fashion. But the problem here is that there even when it comes to these systems, there are many of them, and we can\u2019t say that any of them is \u201cbetter\u201d in an absolute sense. As a matter of fact, whether you do prefer Utilitarianism or Kantianism, you are going to arbitrarily choose which criteria for defining what\u2019s good and bad is the \u201cbest\u201d one (whatever that means for you). Therefore, if you\u2019re an utilitarian, and you use the utilitarian metric, then you can argue that Utilitarianism is \u201cbetter\u201d, because it delivers what utilitarianism defines as \u201cgood\u201d more efficiently. On the other side, Kantianism is obviously better from a kantianist perspective. So, this discussion ends up being pretty nonsensical, and this we can claim objectively. ",
