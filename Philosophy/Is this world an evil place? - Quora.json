            "answer_text": "A Dog is dying but it can be saved if someone was to cut off its tail. To cut the Dogs tail off an inch at a time though, is pure Evil. The Earth, as a ball of lifeless rock would be neither Good nor Evil - nobody to label it. Nobody to know either way. So the \u201cPlace\u201d our existence \u201clife\u201d is a mixture of both - I have concluded it is mostly an Evil place - at the end yes Evil- to put any emotional and feeling beings through such trials is Evil. On the basis that most things have to die for another to live (even if the death is quick - the constant fear of it happening (for the prey) is Evil) Even hunters fail and starve and can\u2019t feed the offspring . - Suffering and thus evil. The harshness of how some animals exploit other animals in order to feed or breed - is Evil. Not all deaths are quick - some methods are slow and painful - needless suffering is Evil. Yes, life has good things and Evil things - but we evolved in a World where there is mainly suffering - as no matter how fair, how charitable, decent & loving you are - you will suffer - the loss of loved ones and the loss of yourself at the end for sure - guaranteed - the only good that would come of this is if it was quick and painless. Anyhing else would be evil to allow you to endure. Death by a thousand cuts - evil. If the World (life) was created, it was created with evil intent. I do not believe in a afterlife or a God - but any God that could create such a place of suffering - even if your death is quick and painless, without any suffering - you have still had more than your fairshare of suffering up to this point - those left behind will suffer your loss. If you want to win a marathon - at times in training and the race - you will suffer - but there is a reward - you achieved something, you are fitter, you get a time, a story and a medal - what do you get after a lifetime of suffering? Rest I guess - where we no longer suffer. And you\u2019ll feel nothing - you will be dead, no life, no mind. Then I guess this is where God comes in, along with afterlife and faith - I really do not want to meet the creator of this life - I feel he is Evil for sure. Even the Church and Jesus say life is suffering - then why make such a place of such suffering thats quite Evil. If God was so loving - and all powerful - he could take all this needless evil / suffering away - after all he is God! - Unless he is controlled by a more evil God. All you can do is find peace and live for the moment - count your blessings and hope the Evil you experience will not be so bad - but of course more suffering and Evil by just knowing how many people / animals are right now, around the World suffering under worst kind of Evil. Your empathy for them will cause you suffering, again more Evil to bestow on us. Yes, this is an evil place \u2026.even more evil as I was not even asked if I wanted to be here - far better to never have been born. You would not suffer - ever see evil and nether see good - but as you were never born you would not care. I for one would trade all the so called good in this world for not having either the good or evil. ",

            "answer_text": "Well I hope you must be aware of the fact that this is not a simple YES or NO question! I will try to explain it in my way. Good and Evil are actually relative terms and depends solely on one\u2019s perspective of Good and Evil. If you are too good in a way, you might consider even slightest \u201cless good \u201d behavior of others as evil (and vice-versa :P). Or better think of it as measuring this on a scale. If, out of 10, you score yourself 6 on your goodness and 4/10 for your evil side\u2026 So, basically \u201cFOR YOU\u201d, people below 6 on \u201cgood \u201d scale and people above 4 on \u201cevil\u201d scale are EVIL for you!! And if majority of people you meet or know of lie in this range then the world is an EVIL place for you !! Hope you can see my point that in the end, its only YOU who can decide if this world is GOOD or EVIL place :) ",
