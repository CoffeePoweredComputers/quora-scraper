            "answer_text": "Your initial assumption, \u201cAs time never stops\u201d, is erroneous. Time does not go, move, travel, flow, so it is meaningless to,say that it does or does not stop. Time is one of the dimensions of spacetime, in which we exist and move. Although a different \u201ctype\u201d of dimension to the 3 spatial dimensions, you can use these as a partial analog to the time dimension. Just as you can move along the spacetime dimensions (in fact you are moving through them continuously, as the surface of the Earth on which you stand moves at several hundreds of miles per hour West to East, the Earth orbits the Sun, the Sun orbits the centre of the Milky Way, the Milky Way orbits the centre of the local group of galaxies, etc.), you can also travel along the time dimension. In fact, you are travelling along the time dimension always, at a speed approaching that of light. \u201cNow\u201d or \u201cthe present\u201d is just a location along the time dimension. There are an infinite number of \u201cnows\u201d along the time dimension, and the one that you feel that you are experiencing is a function of how your brain works. ",

I prefer to understand what I perceive as consciousness as being inside the \u201ceternal now\u201d. Duration is a concept related to the concept of time, but from my viewpoint, it has a three dimensional aspect that straight \u201clinear\u201d time does not encompass. While not \u201cphilosophically fashionable\u201d these days, Henri Bergson see: Henri Bergson - Wikipedia has some rather unique perspectives about time and I have very much enjoyed reading his book \u201cTime and Freewill\u201d see:Time and Free Will - Wikipedia See: Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness: Henri Bergson: 9780486417677: Amazon.com: Books mrc109 ",

            "answer_text": "Every time you exit the sensory world, time stops. As soon as you re-enter the sensory world, time starts up again, not from the reference frame immediately after the one you left, but the reference frame your body is in when you are again aware of your body. Linear time is conditioned on an object changing location and perceiving this object's previous location as a past event. The truth of the matter is that for every different location you have a different object. No objects actually ever move. ",

            "answer_text": "It can be argued both ways. First, you can never really feel the present. Because no matter how precisely you try, the present moment is gone. There goes another one. And another. It can't be seized. Second, the only time that exists is present. Because that's what we can experience or feel. You can think about the past or future, but you can only experience or do stuff in present. So present exists and doesn't exist. One of the illusions of time. ",
