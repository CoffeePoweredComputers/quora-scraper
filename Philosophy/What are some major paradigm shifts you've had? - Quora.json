            "answer_text": "Like many scientists I used to despair of the general public\u2019s ability to really understand a number of scientific issues. I wasn\u2019t doing a lot of public speaking or writing at the time - most of my technical communications were with colleagues. But when I attended public meetings I was dismayed by the fact that so many of those present were so woefully uninformed - dare I say ignorant - about so much of what my colleagues and I took for granted. I wasn\u2019t sure if this was because people couldn\u2019t understand the science - or if they refused to understand it. Either way, I was convinced that trying to explain the scientific and technical parts of my work to most of the public. Two things happened in quick succession to change my mind. The first was a technical short course I attended on some fairly challenging aspects of radiation safety - it was organized by a health physicist (a radiation safety professional) for whom I have the utmost respect; both as a professional and as a person. He took the approach that an interested lay person - even if not a scientist - was capable of understanding the science and the majority (especially among those who attended public meetings) were genuinely interested. In addition, his short course included a few hours on how to communicate technical issues to the public. It was an eye-opener. Especially when I found that I seemed to have a knack for the subject. The second was my reading an anecdote by Richard Feynman, for whom I had tremendous respect as well. He related an incident in which a reporter asked him if he could explain his latest research in terms that the readers could understand. After some thought, Feynman replied \u201cI can\u2019t - I guess that means I don\u2019t understand the material well enough myself.\u201d This made an even more profound impact on me because it put the onus - rightly - on me to understand the topic well enough to explain to a lay person, rather than placing responsibility on the person to understand whatever I was saying. These two incidents, happening in quick succession, convinced me that I had been wrong and that I should first blame myself if I wasn\u2019t getting my point across to whoever I was trying to communicate with. And I have kept that view ever since. One last thought. Recently (about 5 years ago) I was attending a training class on how to combat a terrorist attack against a radiological facility. It was an exercise that included cops, hospital security, and me. At one point a cop came up to me and asked \u201cOK Doc, what can you tell me about this?\u201d So I started in on the factors that were important to ME as a radiation safety scientist. After about 30 seconds the cop stopped me. \u201cDoc - I don\u2019t care about any of that shit. I have one guy who\u2019s got a gun and another who wants to blow me up. Just tell me where the fuck I should stand and how long I can stay there.\u201d He was absolutely right - I had no business trying to turn him into a radiation safety person in just a few minutes. Far better for me to distill my knowledge down to the essential that he HAD to know - everything else was just (from his perspective) fluff that would only distract him from the important stuff. ",

            "answer_text": "Funny to say this but being a recovering addict helped me reach a massive paradigm shift and since then, my life has turned around for the better. For the first time in my adult life, I saw the man I was and then I realized who I wanted to be.  These two people were not even close to a match. From that day on, it was easier to make changes, remove bad people from my life, accept my faults and find my authentic self.  I'm also taking more risks and daring to shine. Recovering from drug addiction leads you to self discovery.  Self inventory, acceptance and just being brutally honest with yourself is something everyone should do in order to find their authentic self. If I didn't hit rock bottom I wouldn't have had this paradigm shift.  I'm not where I want to be yet but I'm closer than I was yesterday. ",
