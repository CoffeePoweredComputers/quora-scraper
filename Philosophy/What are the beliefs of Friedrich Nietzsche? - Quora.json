            "answer_text": "First of all, I must take issue with your word \u201cbeliefs,\u201d since Nietzsche was not a philosopher whose ideas could be briefly summarized. As with all great men and thinkers, there runs through Nietzsche\u2019s thought and life deep spiritual anxiety\u2014 and one of the highest order. But, despite and perhaps because of these contradictions, he was certainly the most important philosopher of our Age. It would be naive to think that to study his thought is a \u201chistorical\u201d enterprise. To speak of him is to refer to Burkhardt, Wittgenstein, Jaspers, Marcel, Heidegger, Husserl, Camus, and Sartre among others. All of them lived and struggled with a world that had been enunciated and foreseen by Nietzsche, and all of their attempts at a new basis for philosophy is in large measure commentary on Nietzsche, and an attempt to respond to the profound, paradoxical and nihilistic issues he recognized in Western Philosophy. Instead of providing a seriatim of his \u201cbeliefs\u201d or \u201cquotes\u201d which would necessarily be an oversimplification of his thoughts, importance and the issues with which he \u201cfought,\u201d I will try to elucidate some aspects of his \u201cphilosophy\u201d and his \u201clife\u201d\u2014which is simply another way of saying that who Nietzsche was, and what he wrote, with all of his contradictions, in many ways reflected each other and all of their inherent ambiguities. Given this \u201cforeword,\u201d which I must acknowledge is much too limited for a discussion of such a philosopher, I have chosen to elucidate what I believe to be some of his most significant philosophical insights and themes and those aspects of his life with which he wrestled because of, and in spite of his insights. To begin with: Nietzsche saw that the \u201chighest values\u201d had begun to \u201cdevalue themselves.\u201d He dramatically characterized this devaluation of values, and hence our life, with his resounding and provocative statement that \u201cGod is dead.\u201d (No statement by any philosopher has been so universally quoted, and so misunderstood, as this statement.) He was correct in his analysis that, before him, there had been no suspicion that there was anything problematic about morality. For instance, Nietzsche brought to the modern mind that the Christian value of truth-telling, institutionalized in the form of science, had paradoxically undermined the belief in God, disenchanting man with the world and excluding his soul from a pre-established harmony between the nature of the world and man\u2019s mind, desires, and dreams and that the evaporation of a morality or sense of worth inherent in the world, an a priori bond between man\u2019s value and meaning, between morality and truth, was henceforth invalid. And, thus he took it upon himself to expose these lies. But it would be insufficient to say that Nietzsche merely recognized the catastrophic result of this devaluation\u2014this severance of man and morality, and his place in the world\u2014that would inevitably crush man who would fall victim to despair in the face of nihilism, and the recognition that life has no intrinsic value or meaning. Until Nietzsche exposed this moral catastrophe, or catastrophe of morality, the connection between the nature of man\u2019s soul and his place in the world had supplied man both with an unassailable morality and human value that grounded man\u2019s firm place in the world created by God. Thus, Nietzsche was the first philosopher to recognize the profound depth and consequences of the sickness of this Age: nihilism. (Of course, this phrase immediately makes one think of Kierkegaard and his thoughts on the nature of the \u201cmass man.\u201d He wrestled with many similar issues as Nietzsche and anticipates many of the thinkers I previously mentioned, perhaps most importantly Marcuse.) But, many have misinterpreted Nietzsche's thought as if his focus on \u201cnihilism\u201d was a moral license for any type of conduct, merely a reference to a \u201cstrong\u201d or creative individual, someone who could take responsibility for his own meaning, or one who could live by a subjective morality by \u201ctransvaluing\u201d the highest values by establishing a new \u201corder of rank.\u201d But this analysis completely misses the point. He dreaded the new age of nihilism which he was compelled to bring into being. And he saw huge world wars that would be fought after he was gone, all in the name of ideology\u2014and he was not wrong. As a creator, facing the gaping abyss which opened after he had crushed the morality his contemporaries believed still existed, he was faced with the agonizing question: \u201chow could morality be judged in the absence of a divine source?\u201d In this regard, one of his most important insights was the recognition that the fractures in Western Metaphysics required man to reestablish morality on a new foundation. And left with the only source that he believed could still provide such a basis: \u201cThe question,\u201d he asked, \u201cis how far opinion is life furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic judgments a priori belong) are the most indispensable to us, that without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable, without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers, man could not live\u2014that the renunciation of false opinions would be a renunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so, has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.\u201d Thus, the essence of such a venture to confront nihilism was to \u201cphilosophize with a hammer,\u201d as he put it, to undermine what was undeniably false and destructive to man\u2014the recognition that nihilism already existed in Western Philosophy. Nietzsche did not \u201cinvent\u201d nihilism\u2014though he did coin the term, he recognized that it had already appeared on the philosophical stage and that the philosophical efforts during the 19th Century could all be considered furious attempts to avoid this truth. Most interpretations\u2014and interpreters\u2014of Nietzsche completely misunderstand his relationship with morality and truth. In so many descriptions of Nietzsche, he is characterized as being an aberration in the Western tradition, believing him to have been a destroyer ushering in a time of chaos and amorality. This description completely misses Nietzsche the creator, a man who despaired over the loss of pre-established harmony with which man had understood his place in the world, and who tendentiously proposed the \u201cEternal Recurrence\u201d (to live as if one would live that same life over and over), and the \u201cUbermensch,\u201d a new type of man who could rise above conventional Christian morality to create and impose his own values as perhaps the only spiritual cures. [Thus Spake Zarathustra (1883\u201385).] But there is no question that Nietzsche as psychologist, in his role as destroyer of outmoded and hence destructive lies passing themselves off as truth: Nietzsche states: \u201cwho knows if they are not really trying to win back something which was formerly an even securer possession, something of the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the \u2018immortal soul,\u2019 perhaps \u2018the old God,\u2019 in short, ideas by which they could live better, that is to say, more vigorously and more joyously than by \u2018modern ideas\u2019?\u201d Or, speaking to those who would embrace valuelessness as a credo for life, he said, \u201cYou desire to LIVE \u2018according to Nature\u2019? Oh, you noble Stoics, what fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration, without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain: imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power\u2014how COULD you live in accordance with such indifference?\u201d Thus, Nietzsche recognized that his challenge was two-fold, one which I have already discussed, the destruction of a priori metaphysics, the untruth which is presented and the morality that it half-heartedly supported. This is the key to Nietzsche\u2019s attack on truth and morality\u2014they had always supported each other. The strength of Morality, Nietzsche recognized, had been, since Plato, the inversion of morality\u2014the belief that truth was the basis of morality\u2014and that morality of life and life-affirmation had never been attempted. Perhaps a more simple way to describe this is that the Greek, that is to say, the Socratic, notion of morality was that if one \u201cknew\u201d the truth, one would necessarily follow it. But in the 2000 years since Socrates, the purely absolute truth (a priori metaphysics\u2014a truth beyond our existence and fundamentally beyond the mind of man) had never been found, nor could it. The abolition of this conception of morality was for Nietzsche was a necessity and a \u201cmorally\u201d required purpose. Nietzsche realized that, until false, outmoded, and questionable conceptions of morality had been destroyed, the ground could not be cleared for something stronger, deeper, and life-affirming. To accomplish this, Nietzsche\u2019s fundamental idea or recognition is that \u2018God is dead\u2019\u2014and the resulting nihilism which ensues. As he stated, providing a fairly accurate description of this Age: \u201cExistence has no goal. Deep down: not knowing what is valuable; what is there left? intoxication: the attempt to overcome it by intoxication; intoxication as music, intoxication with cruelty; all purely moral demands without their religious basis must needs end in nihilism; or some sort of mysticism, art for art\u2019s sake, truth for truth's sake, narcotics against self-disgust; some kind of routine, any routine, blatant fanaticism, but none of these drugs can have any lasting effect; he who no longer finds what is great in God, will find it nowhere\u2014he must either deny or create it.\u201d And thus we hear the despair Nietzsche felt at the core of his being. He was attempting to fight two battles at the same time, for and against himself, and so one must ask with him, what can exist after the death of God, what is there left to create? Is there any cure? And, if there is a spiritual cure, whether goodness, innocence, saintliness or self-sacrifice, \u201cwould [it] nevertheless be interpreted as a compensatory maneuver of the mind to \u2018transvalue\u2019 weakness and frustration?\u201d \u201cThe trouble,\u201d he recognized in one of his more profound observations: \u201cis that there can no longer be such virtues. For virtues are reflected upon by minds, and even the purest virtue will be suspect to a mind filled with suspicion.\u201d Nietzsche, like the physician who exposed the patient to the disease, yet had to cure him without having the antidote. This is partly what I mean when I say that he and his thought was a paradox and that this is the reason why he and his philosophy are so often misunderstood or ignored by \u201cmodern\u201d thinkers who believe that his observations are easily or, more mendaciously or pitifully, have been overcome by materialism, abstraction or self-referential, empty reflections about something or other, but not about existence, and not about the struggle to live an authentic life. Yes, even here Nietzsche recognized the paradox in the title of his last book: \u201cTwilight of the Idols: How one becomes who one is.\u201d And, indeed, he recognized the inevitable conflict between being and becoming\u2014almost as if he could not, even at the end, escape the whirlwind of his mind. He was unquestionably a truly great psychologist\u2014and he often used it to strip away the veneer of outmoded and destructive morality. (He rightly called himself \u201cthe first psychologist.\u201d) Without question, many of his most powerful writings attack the insipid morals and virtues of his day, including their source, that God no longer held sway on man, and thus had to be destroyed because such beliefs were inauthentic and false, indeed, had led man to nihilism. Man\u2019s false beliefs were spiritually and morally destructive. Nietzsche, the psychologist, went even further (and to him, we owe a great deal, and may curse him as well), since man\u2019s nihilism would certainly bring about his spiritual destruction from disillusionment and frustration. And, once he opened the gaping abyss, he could not close it: he repeatedly asked how will man live in this Nihilistic Age? He first tried to use a negative path: \u201cman would despise his former self for craving moral sanctions, for satisfying his will to power in neurotic sublimation, for deceiving himself about the \u201cmeaning\u201d of life, and what will such a man be, who at last knows what life really is?\u201d Nietzsche\u2019s personal account of such a man and his all-too-human nature, his analysis of the threadbare fabric of traditional values and truths, might he not be a monster, a barbarian, a conqueror of the world, shrieking bad German from under his dark mustache? Nietzsche (and Dostoevsky, in The Brothers Karamazov, Ivan) very much feared this result though this did not\u2014nor perhaps could not\u2014stop him. He believed firmly that nihilism was the reality of this Age, and that his passion for the truth required the destruction of the lies of the past. He realized that he was ushering in a period which could destroy itself from nihilism or truth, and would bring man to the edge of a terrible truth, but at least to truth. He was often filled with terror of the coming age\u2014our age\u2014in which a vulgar caricature of people would come to power\u2014not in any type of democracy, but in a dictatorship since man could no longer trust or value himself, that he or anyone else could make any moral or even intelligent decisions\u2014at least rational decisions\u2014because he no longer believed in or knew the truth\u2014and so man would hide himself in the mob if only to be part of something. On the other hand, Nietzsche recognized that, in the coming age of nihilism, man would need a \u201ccure\u201d or he would suffer self-destruction. In one of his notebooks, he wrote: \u201cI perform the great experiment: who can bear the idea of the Eternal Recurrence?\u201d (The substance of this quote appears in \u201cThus Spake Z.\u201d) This, I believe was an expression of a painful measure of Nietzsche\u2019s recognition of the barren world he saw stretching out ahead of him. The Eternal Recurrence was the nightmare of nightmares to him\u2014the idea that to live according to that concept, to live his life again and again was a truly painful thought: as he wrote: \u201cLet us consider this idea in its most terrifying form: existence, as it is, without meaning or goal, but inescapably recurrent, without a finale into nothingness\u2026 those who can not bear the sentence there is no salvation, we ought to perish!\u201d Obviously, the Eternal Recurrence was, in truth, a \u201cmoral exercise.\u201d Live as if you would live your life again. Could meaning grow from such a principle? It is, I believe, not unsurprising that Nietzsche recognized that, even as a \u201cmoral principle\u201d to live by, at its core, was the recognition that such a life was unbearable. From a larger perspective, he also knew the dreadful future for man after he could no longer feel anything spiritual in his life: that those who were sensitive to this loss would be overrun by the worst and their gluttonous machines of death. The essence of all Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy may be that God is Dead, but it is also that man has not yet come to the point of understanding or appreciating this fact\u2014even if he no longer believes in God\u2014and, if God is indeed no more, then for Nietzsche man was an eternally cheated misfit, \u201cthe diseased animal\u201d as he called him, \u201cplagued by a metaphysical hunger which was now impossible to feed even if all the Heavens were to be ransacked. Such a creature was doomed: he had to die out, giving way to the superman who would miraculously feed on barren fields and finally conquer the metaphysical hunger itself without any detriment to the glory of life.\u201d Earlier in his life, he wrote The Birth of Tragedy (out of the spirit of music), and, in my opinion, Nietzsche\u2019s prose and passion of that book expressed that transfiguration of life in lasting images of true beauty could overcome meaningless chaos. And though this was a short period in his life during which he was enraptured by Richard Wagner, it ended quickly when Nietzsche realized that Wagner was, according to him \u201cno more than a petty Romantic who sought the goal of life in the beyond.\u201d Nietzsche later chastised himself for what he called his degradation. In his analysis of this period of his life, he stated that the: \u201cbelief in art turned to skepticism and scorn; and his anger was provoked by those \u2018metaphysical counterfeiters\u2019\u201d, as he called them, \u201cwho enthroned the trinity of beauty, goodness, and truth.\u201d In the paradoxical mind of Nietzsche\u2014the essential aspect of understanding him\u2014he contradicted his numerous battles with art, saying: \u201cWe have art in order not to perish of Truth,\u201d and, in Zarathustra, \u201cpoets lie too much\u201d, but adds \u201cBut Zarathustra too is a poet .. We lie too much.\u201d And perhaps he did, because, at the same time that Zarathustra preached the Eternal Recurrence, Nietzsche wrote: \u201cI do not wish to live again. How have I borne life? By creating. What has made me endure? The vision of the Superman who affirms life? I have tried to affirm life myself\u2014but ah!\u201d This could not be more telling. He chose to fight against his mind, and his mind fought against life. Was he, having lost his bond, his salvation in the oneness of God, truly capable of believing in anything? I come back to another of his most quoted statements, in which he said: \u201cHe who no longer finds what is great in God will find it nowhere\u2014he must either deny it or create it.\u201d Not many people quote, or perhaps even read or consider this trenchant comment. Nietzsche often doubted himself to the point of despair\u2014so often did he regret his destruction of, or at least unmasking of morality. One could say, it had to be done, and one could also say that the quote ends on a positive note\u2014greatness, and meaning could be created. Nietzsche was, indeed, a paradox, he had a passion for truth and no belief in it. He had the love of life and despaired of it. A few years before he lost his grasp on life in 1889, he wrote: \u201cMy life is now comprised of the wish that the truth about all things be different from my way of seeing it: if only someone could convince me of the improbability of my truths.\u201d And another, \u201cLonely and deeply suspicious of myself as I was, I took, not without secret spite, sides against myself and for anything that happened to hurt me and was hard for me.\u201d But what was he suspicious of? When he was terrified by the prospect that all the better things in life, all honesty of mind, integrity of character, generosity of heart, and fineness of aesthetic perception, would be corrupted and finally cast away by the new barbarians unless the mildest and gentlest hardened themselves for the war which was about to be waged against them: \u201cCaesar\u2014with the heart of Christ!\u201d But perhaps he was not truly a rebel, the destroyer of God and man during his life. A very close mentor and friend once commented on what, infrequently, Nietzsche\u2019s tormented mind called his \u201cRosengeruch des Unwiederbringlichen,\u201d which he said, of course, was untranslatable, but that the closest translation he believed was Yeat\u2019s lines: \u201cMan is in love and loves what vanishes. What more is there to say?\u201d But despite what so many commentators have written\u2014and aren\u2019t there only commentators now?\u2014Nietzsche was perhaps a traditionalist by heart, a desperate lover who castigated what he loved because he knew it was true and even should truth abandon him and the world. One of my favorite quotes of his was written late in his life: \u201cI once saw a storm raging over the sea, and a clear blue sky above it; it was then that I came to dislike all sunless, cloudy passions which know no light, except the lightning.\u201d And yet this was written by the same man who said that his tool for philosophizing was \u201ca hammer,\u201d and of himself that \u201che was not human but dynamite.\u201d About the message that he brought to man, namely, that God is dead, he stated: \u201cPerhaps the best will be driven to despair by it, the very worst accept it?\u201d Above all, this was perhaps his greatest doubt and greatest fear\u2014that the hopes he felt when destroying the last vestiges of decaying morality: that man could forever be free of his shackles, and could embrace freedom not known before, was in fact impossible. In this respect, as in so many others, he was a paradox\u2014and is not this Age itself a paradox? He may have brought about the very opposite of what he desired. When this terror overcame him, he was terrified of the world he helped to bring, the consequences of his teaching. But, what Nietzsche may mean for this Age, what he could not embrace: this poet, lover of truth, hater of truth, destroyer, creator, lover of life, and one who despaired of it, a man who resolved to seek out the truth at any cost, and the soul of a redeemer who believed that \u201conly one who has learned to live without truth and without belief and delighting in life actually wills the Eternal Recurrence: Live in such a way that you desire nothing more than to live this very same life again and again.\u201d ",

He thinks humanity is wonderful the way it is as it is a rope between the beast and the overman, i.e. a transitory stage which should be appreciated. However, man should strive to become an overman. The overman is someone who has overcome themselves and has achieved their supreme form. The overmen have developed both their thinking and their feeling sides; and their bodies, minds, and souls. They have very strong personalities and do not make compromises with the weaknesses of the rest. He also believes that people should go beyond good and evil. The contemporary morality (which has been the same in the last few thousand years) is the morality of the weak. They use their weakness as a weapon to chain the strong and brave ones. The world needs new values and the overman's purpose is to be the creator of such values. Furthermore, he loves this life and this world. He is against the idea that this world is less important because it's transitory. He believes that humans should appreciate and enjoy everything Earth has given them instead of being modest and feeling small and guilty. Briefly said, Friedrich believes in the supreme, in humanity, in power, strength, boldness, true joyfulness, true suffering, improvement and in the future. ",
