            "answer_text": "Using anything on the skin that is not intended for such use (what I often refer to as \u201cThe Wrong Stuff\u201d and including poster paint, acrylic paint, and oil paint) is a really, really bad idea. The first thing that can go wrong is, you will have trouble getting it off (see Girl covers her face in bright pink \u2018wash off paint\u2019... and this is how it looks after). The second thing is that you can have a reaction and/or poison yourself\u2014and you may not even know you\u2019ve poisoned yourself right away as sometimes the effects of certain things leeching into the bloodstream from the skin takes weeks, months, or years to become apparent. Stick to body art cosmetics intended for use on the skin such as TAG, Paradise, Diamond FX, Global, Cameleon, Ruby Red, and Snazaroo (among others). I happen to use TAG myself but will agree to get painted with just about anything that\u2019s intended for face/body art and not \u201cThe Wrong Stuff\u201d. ",

Especially near sensitive places like the eyes and mouth. There are plenty of high pigment makeups on the market which can be used with oil or water to create different effects. There are also face-painting specific paints like Snazaroo. Using paints and make-up which are specifically designed for use on the face will make sure you don\u2019t get a nasty shock! ",

            "answer_text": "The skin on the face is very delicated. Use only professional product especifically indicated for face painting. Consider that apparently harmless craft paints, which usually have a \u201cnon-toxic\u201d label, contain formaldehyde. This is a nocive substance and can cause at least important allergic reactions (and even cancer). Moreover, even low quality face paints should not be used on the face either. Thus the answer to this question is obviusly a great \u201cNO\u201d.
