            "answer_text": "There are two ways of interpreting your question: can we imagine absolute nothingness, or are there any physical examples of absolute nothingness?  The answer to the former is Yes; you have done it.  The answer to the latter is No, because \"the vacuum\" is full of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs popping in and out of existence.  Nature really does abhor a classical vacuum.   :-) Probably you are referring to the issue of, \"What was there before the Big Bang?\"  Since time came into being with the BB, it is technically meaningless to talk about \"before the BB\".  I know this is an assault to common sense, but common sense has been taking a beating for the last century or so!  I guess we need to cultivate \"uncommon sense\" to navigate the world of modern physics.   ",

From the Big Bang model we can deduce an \u201cinfinite density\u201d. Conspansion (from the CTMU) inverts the Big Bang\u2019s expansion scenario into a model of \u201cinternal collapse\u201d, whereby the \u201cinfinite density/pure freedom/nothingness\u201d remains entirely static and unchanged, while the \u201cobservable universe\u201d is the means of \u201cpure freedom\u201d coming to its own self-realization.
