            "answer_text": "If we agree, initially, that philosophy of X is the interrogation on what X is, when something becomes X or stops being X, what makes X X, and so on\u2026 Then there is plenty of philosophy of philosophy. Many philosophers (if not all of them) have given their explanation of what philosophy is, what it should talk about, and what should be its methods. Even amongst the ancient Greeks there were different opinions: for example Plato intended philosophy as a way to access the ultimate truth*, while Epicurus intended philosophy as a mean to find peace and happiness in this life **. Even in the twentieth century this was still a matter to be debated. Heidegger, for example, notably argued that philosophy needed reforming from his earlier works. As of now, we are in dire need of a rigourous philosophy of philosophy. As you may have noticed, anyone who thinks high of himself can call himself a philosopher, and there is nothing we can do about it (as opposed to an engineer, a mathematician, or a doctor). This is setting back philosophy in the eyes if the public, and giving philosophers a bad reputation. If you wish to know more, my suggestion is to find yourself a philosophical dictionary (they exist, and the are very useful when studying philosophy) and look up the word \u201cphilosophy\u201d. It is usually at least a dozen pages wide. Have fun! *: According to him, there is an ultimate truth that your soul is aware of. However once being born you forgot it all. Philosophy doesn't let you acquire knowledge, but rather remember it. **: Philosophy was called, by epicureans in the roman era, the \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03d5\u03ac\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd (tetrafarmakon), literally \u201cthe four-fold remedy\u201d. Philosophy was the cure to four diseases: fear of the gods, fear of death, lack of pleasure, and pain. For this reason he thought that philosophy was necessary for everyone to be happy. His famous letter to menoeceus starts with: \u201cLet no one who is young put off engaging in philosophy, nor anyone who is old weary of it. For no one is either too young or too old to attend to the health of the soul\u201d. I really suggest you read it, it's heartwarming and easily findable online. ",

            "answer_text": "I firmly believe that the function of philosophy is meta-theoretical analysis. We have questions about reality and our lives. The common understanding is that philosophy is supposed to provide answers to those questions. I don't think that's a fruitful way to approach philosphy. Philosophy is more like a mother than her child. Most people argue that philosphy has some how been depricated by the sciences for failing to yield practical results to the questions thrown its way. It's hard to argue against that when considering the facts but I believe those facts are cherry picked. Theorizing about theory is hard to wrap your head around and the fruits that philosophy yield are not obvious. Antiquity tells us as much when we consider the seemingly simple or mundane questions that serve as valuable starting places for enriching our lives in some way and the long time it takes to get there. There's a lot that happens between theory and practice. We care more about a product than we do its incubation period. I guess when we have the tools we need, we forget how those tools were developed. We become accustomed to and take the labor for the construction and fine tuning of those tools for granted. In my opinion, philosophy is in the business of scrutizing, disregarding, or developing theoretical or methodological frameworks for answering life's questions. Philosphy is not meant to solve emperical, personal, or social problems. Instead it births systems that do, like physics, psychology, and the social sciences. Primitive ideas are the building blocks of the philosopher. That's what they work with and it's hard to consider the impact those primitive ideas have on the macroscopic scale of our lives. The questions that seek answers guide philosophical thought to produce tools for approaching those questions with logically valid answers. That's how systems are born. ",
