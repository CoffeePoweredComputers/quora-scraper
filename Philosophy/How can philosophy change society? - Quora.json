            "answer_text": "Philosophy is (supposed to be) based on logic, which has been dubbed the study of the ideal form of thinking (the existence of \u201cideal\u201d is a separate debate, damned epistemology, making everything complected). Philosophy can change society by helping remove those personal and psychological biases that cause us to believe in things that are not \u201ctrue\u201d or do not appeal to the benefit of mankind, but rather to a certain group. Once these blinds are peeled back, and humanity can gaze upon reality, can we truly navigate the complex world that we live in. ",
