            "answer_text": "Do you think mathematics is a universal truth? Good question, but with elastically defined terms like truth and universal truth. Philosophers and philosophers of mathematics have written a lot on this question. As I see it, two important features of mathematics are: (a)Mathematics embodies a framework with concepts and relations that is remarkably suitable for/consistent with many natural phenomena. (b)There are fantastic consistencies in the theorems and entities that are part of mathematics. From these considerations I am inclined to regard mathematics as embodying a type of truth that is beyond the categories fact and imagination, empirical evidence and palpable reality. JOPO TIOLI. Peace, with Truth, local, universal, or whatever. 15 July 2018 ",

            "answer_text": "To me, math is a \u201cmisleading evidence\u201d, a language we made up trying to make sense of our surroundings. Math structures allow us to translate nature into information we can make use of, but the Universe does not use math. Math can only get us a Chinese replica of reality. Imo, it sticks to the obvious that created it in the first place. It is precisely an errorneous system that generates correct predictions \u2014 up to a point. The point where math is no longer in touch with reality might be forever out of our reach, and a hint of the existence of that point are some of the ridiculous theories physicists come up with using mathematically verified computer models. Scientists / mathematicians say that every new step in science has to be consistent with what\u2019s already established, with the previous \u201cproven\u201d step. Well\u2026 So is playing Sudoku. You place a number where it apparently belongs, then you place another one considering the previous move \u2014 and so on. But it sometimes happens that the last two numbers fit neither way. Similarily, math might not make sense all the way of the nature of the Universe. :)  ",

            "answer_text": "One proposition can be true or false. Mathematics is made of many propositions. Some of them that relate to the real world are true, but those which describe abstract relations between abstract entities are neither true nor false; they are either consistent with the system in which they are expressed, or not. For obvious reasons, we have created a system of mathematics which reflects the real world fairly closely. But where mathematics deviates from observed reality, it is the empirical propositions that describe reality which are true. Truth is a purely linguistic property ",
