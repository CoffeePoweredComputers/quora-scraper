            "answer_text": "\"What is better, knowing or believing?\"  If you are going to deny the Fullness of the Gospel of Christ, it is better that you had at first just believed.  If you knew and then denied the Gospel, your eternal future is in greater jeopardy. However, if you desire to LIVE the Gospel of Christ, then you are benefited if you KNOW.  And here is how a Christian leader once taught how we could KNOW and not just believe: Now, as I said concerning faith\u2014that it was not a perfect knowledge\u2014even so it is with my words. Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge. But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words. Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves\u2014It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me. Now behold, would not this increase your faith? I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect knowledge. But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will not this strengthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow. And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness. Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away. And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good. And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand. O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now behold, after ye have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect? Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good. And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit. But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out. Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof. And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life. But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life.  And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst. Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you. Thanks, Jasmine, for the request for an answer. ",

            "answer_text": "So you just ordered pizza. Do you know it will show up or just believe it will show up? Do you start setting the table with plates and your wife says \"what are you doing? It might not show up!\" You try and explain you've ordered pizza before, it's never not showed up, you feel perfectly confident setting the table. Although many things could happen to prevent the pizza from appearing, how can you say we don't know it will show up? We are so sure we are willing to set the table, get our money ready, call in the kids. But today is national pick-off-a-pizza-delivery-guy day. Typically thousands of pizzas don't make it and many delivery men are even killed. You've ordered the pizza and you wait and hope. No sense dusting off that nice china you inherited. And when your wife says she saw some guy running with a pizza just get pulverized, your belief is pretty certain you'll be opening a can of soup instead. You even start looking through the pantry to pick one out. So when the pizza guy actually does show up, huffing and puffing but with a very nice pizza, you are terribly surprised because you were sure, i.e. of strong belief, that he wouldn't. If belief didn't constitute knowing, we would never leave our house because after all the outside world might not even be there. People confuse knowing with proof. You'll be able to prove to everyone the pizza has arrived when you're slicing it up and the kids are arguing over it, but until then simple belief is more than enough, either to dust off the china or prepare for something else.

            "answer_text": "I will share an example where believing and knowledge cross.  This was in a letter to Christians in the 1st century. Some were saying \"I believe in God and that is all that is required\". James presents the argument that believing is not enough.  He starts with this: (James 2:18) 18\u202fNevertheless, someone will say: \u201cYou have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.\u201d  Faith or belief should have an effect on a person. They act in harmony with that belief. The above James shows that what a person does about that, proves one's faith to have any value.  Next he goes on: (James 2:19) 19\u202fYou believe that there is one God, do you? You are doing quite well.  Believing that there is only one true God made some think that is all needed. Sort of like the modern phrase that some Christians say \"I believe in Jesus as my savior\". James then shows the error in thinking that belief is all that is needed. (James 2:19) .\u202f.\u202f.And yet the demons believe and shudder.  If there was ever a group that had sure knowledge of the existence of God would be his angelic sons who abandoned their positions in heaven. What affect did this knowledge have on them? They \"shudder\". Why? Because they KNOW that God has ordained that they will be executed. They had already suffered from the limitations that he put on them after the Flood, and it was with certainty that the day of judgment would come. Did they change? No. That \"belief\" has no value.  (Jude 6) .\u202f.\u202f.And the angels who did not keep their original position but forsook their own proper dwelling place, he has reserved with eternal bonds in dense darkness for the judgment of the great day.  If we try to evaluate the values between knowledge and belief is to try to compare apples and oranges. Knowledge can give a basis for belief, but only belief in action, (discerning what that Knowledge directs us to do) brings about positive effects. That is the point James was making.  Someone used this illustration: You are standing on a roadway. You see a bus coming in your direction. That is knowledge. As you watch, you determine that it will hit you. That is discernment. You making a move to get out of its path, that is wisdom.   ",

            "answer_text": "This question brings to mind a discussion I had with an Atheist and advanced Meditator recently - a person who had been brought up by Christian parents  but has, for whatever reason, rejected their birthright and their family tradition. The questions posed by my friend are bold and my answers underneath. There were 3 main ones.  1.Those Religious nutters who claim ''TO KNOW'' miss so much in life whilst rigorously defending a position that is based on FAITH and nothing else... Well not really . You  for example are so definitive in your written statements about \"being in the now\"  you leave little wriggle room for doubt. How do you know? This is a paradox of your own argument since you say that there are infinite possibilities in \u201cConsciousness\u201d so therefore even the possibility of the Religious narrative exists if that is your preferred way of obtaining feedback from the void. ( the Void is a mediational objective which is thought of as the \"true\" reality behind the world of illusion)  2.If and its a big IF the theory of intelligent design is proven and God reveals himself in a form that we simple beings can understand, I will then refute all other suggestions, theories and beliefs but until that day my open mind will remain just that... Well  I do detect an element of \u201cdoubt\u201d creeping in here?  The difference between my journey and yours is that you have started from a na\u00efve, Papa and Mama induced view of Christianity and raced to the other end of the spectrum in disgust, whereas I was brought up on a diet of Darwinism and Natural Selection and cause & effect science and then progressively saw that there were too many exceptions and coincidences for this to be \u201cTruth\". This prior to understanding the \"presence\" of the Holy Spirit in my life. However I would tell you this for your journey and in all humbleness: \u201cDoubt everything \u201c and draw your eventual conclusions from the balance of evidence.  Until you are at that stage remain AGNOSTIC but through diligent enquiry explore Christianity with a vengeance. Faith does not mean the absence of DOUBT or that Christians have had a Mind-bypass.  True and resilient Christians feel the Truth with their Heart but also reason their way to Faith by looking at the available evidence and applying a reasonable hypothesis. Those Christians who only \"FEEL\" risk having their Faith undermined by logical arguments of unbelievers and the many doubters out there. Their foundation in faith is not solid.  3..Your view seems to be fixed in ''THE KNOWING'' when you are merely guessing !..after digesting libraries of works by others , who also digested the same amount of literature by others before them... You just don't know, as I don't. .....Now there is a truth!   So here we have another question.How does one \u201cKnow that you Know\u201d? I am not trying to be clever here or use words to confuse as there is a science and religion behind  \u201cGnosticism\u201d, which I have explored,of which Stephen Hoeller is a major contemporary luminary. For centuries, philosophers from Plato forward have used the term \"noetic\" to refer to experiences that pioneering psychologist William James (1902) described as:  .......\u2026states of \"insight\" into depths of truth unplumbed by the discursive intellect.  This results from  intuitions, illuminations, revelations, are full of significance and importance, they are all difficult to articulate though they remain with you ; and as a rule they carry with them a curious sense of authority.  The term \"Noetic Sciences\" was first coined in 1973 when the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) was founded by Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell, who two years earlier became the sixth man to walk on the moon.  Ironically, it was the trip back home that Mitchell recalls most, during which he felt a profound sense of universal connectedness\u2014what he later described as a \"samadhi\" experience. In Mitchell\u2019s own words, \u201cThe presence of divinity became almost palpable, and I knew that life in the universe was not just an accident based on random processes. . . .The knowledge came to me directly.\u201d So we can understand from all this that \"knowing\" is linked to \"believing\" but the knowledge is not exclusively derived from the Logical Mind using the normal conscious thought processes. That is what most Atheists miss since they live exclusively within their so called \"rationale conscious mind\". The processes that go on there are only a small part of the overall picture and process through which knowledge and beliefs arise. Neither is the word \"Evidence\" to be understood purely in the scientific laboratory material definition of this word since evidence comes in many forms and anyway when considering people there has to be room for the subjective since all experience for Man is subjective to him. Like the science of \"knowing\" - Noetic Science there is also a science for Evidence and a philosophy known as Evidentialism. This is a theory of justification according to which the justification of a conclusion depends solely on the evidence for it and though belief is typically the primary object of concern,evidentialism can be applied to doxastic ( attitudes of belief) attitudes generally. Evidentialism is a theory of justification according to which the justification of a conclusion depends solely on the evidence for it and evidentialism implies all faith-based beliefs are unjustified.This is the position of most Atheists on Quora but it is not that simple since even Evidentialists admit, in their philosophy that evidentialism is only meant to separate \"justified\" beliefs from \"unjustified\" beliefs and many Christians would say their beliefs are entirely justified after rationale inspection. Also Many contemporary epistemologists reject the view that evidential support is the whole story about the justification of beliefs.  While no sensible epistemologists generally urge people to disregard their evidence when forming beliefs, many believe that a more complete theory would introduce considerations about the processes that initiate and sustain beliefs.  An example of one such theory is reliabilism. The most influential proponent of reliabilism is Alvin Goldman. According to a crude form of reliabilism, S is justified in believing p if and only if S's belief in p is caused by a reliable process\u2014a process that generally leads to \"true\" beliefs. So we have seen that the whole process of \"knowing\" is complex and the whole support of \"Evidence\" is equally challenging which is why most discussions on Quora between Atheists and Theists fall out over the semantics and connotations of these words.  It is good to define them carefully at the outset of the discussions so that we do not enter into facile , personally demeaning discussions when all the time these words mean different things to the protagonists of the argument. Finally we come to this word \"Belief\" so far we have only discussed the processes and information which leads to belief. Here we have to look at the composition of that mystery of mysteries the Human Mind. The Mind is generally thought in modern times to be loosely separated between the Conscious Mind and the Subconscious Mind.The Subconscious Mind is extremely powerful and for the most part the hidden portion of the \"iceberg\". Although the conscious mind is creative and time aware and is able to analyse and choose - once a well worn track of thinking and deduction has been laid down the subconscious take over. That is why we are able to drive a car  while thinking of something completely different. We have resigned ourselves to autopilot. It is not widely understood how important aligning the Conscious with Subconscious really is in everyday life. Disparity and dissonance in word and deed between these two areas of the mind can lead to psychological tensions and indeed psychosis. Your accreted beliefs reside in the subconscious where they govern your instincts your attitudes and your behaviours when not overridden by the conscious mind deliberately. Hence the term \"Freudian Slip\" which gives an indicator about what really goes on in your head - Behind the Mask you wear for others benefit! Obviously your Beliefs carry the baggage also of your upbringing and changing them is a quite a process once these programmes have become embedded. That is why it is commonly said it takes 30 days of conscious work to form a subconscious habit in your behaviour for example. It is quite feasible to formulate Beliefs which of course are erroneous and fly in the face of rationale argument and evidence - that is why good Salesmen appeal strongly to the the emotions !.........One of the great Scientists and/or Philosophers did say that even if Christianity was not true - it didn't really matter as the Belief in Christianity made for a much better society. Many come to Faith this way they just make up their mind to Believe and their Faith grows and expands to take care of the rationale mind later. This is known as the Way of Devotion. Why are Beliefs so important ? - they guide and shape your reality - and not just your reality they contribute to the prevailing World View.  The World View supports and defines a society and a world. It has ramifications throughout the systems and processes that run the world in which we live - for better or for worse. That is why Christians are so concerned about the Secular Humanistic thinking that currently pervades our governments and our countries - We in the West have taken Christianity out of the picture and left a \"God sized\" hole into which Fundamentalist Islam is jumping right in! - instead of celebrating our Christian roots we do all we can to denigrate and mock it. This is not without precedent in History as the Bible clearly teaches ...there are grave consequences. Conclusion Knowledge and Belief go hand in hand - they are not mutually exclusive terms in the same way that Science and Faith are not mutually exclusive terms.  ",

            "answer_text": "Knowing is better than believing, but faith is better than knowing.   You may be rolling my eyes and thinking \"He's talking nonsense,\" but hear me out on this. My faith tradition (Christianity/Mormonism) teaches that \"faith\" is a principle of power.  We Mormons define faith and belief differently than even the dictionary might, because our scripture defines faith as being a belief in things you cannot see but which are true.  Belief can be in things which are true OR false. So we believe you can only have faith in what is true (i.e. consistent with the knowledge of god) but unknown to you (i.e. not yet consistent with your more limited knowledge). Thus, you cannot have faith in that which is false. You can only believe it, to your harm. And if you say that faith then begs the very question, you're right. But God gives us the Holy Spirit to help us know what is true and what is not even before we \"see\" so that we can have faith IF we learn to recognize and heed the Spirit. For an excellent passage of scripture that addresses your very question, I would refer you to Alma 32  in The Book of Mormon. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A... There are already plenty of good answers here, and it seems to me that believing can be considered as the subjective side of knowing. I believe whatever I think to be true based on the facts that I know (currently). However, I would like to climb just slightly out of the epistemology context of the question... I will do this by including the Biblical (Christian?) understanding of the nature of \"believing\" or \"faith\". For biblical faith is not simply knowing something, but knowing something to such an extend (being so sure of it) that I act on that knowledge and put my trust in it. Moreover, faith (or belief) in a person (like Jesus or God) implies not only that I know that He exists (that is only knowledge), but also that I entrust myself to to Him, because I trust His character (based on my knowledge of who He is). In this sense believing (faith) then is more (better) than knowing, since knowing is only the first step, while believing is drawing the logical and practical conclusions of that knowledge, the next step of being sure enough of the facts so that I am willing to act on that knowledge.

            "answer_text": "Epistemology: What is better, knowing or believing? Most people do not understand the definition of \"believe.\" This prevents some from realizing that believing and knowing are, in a practical sense, the same thing. Sure, one could be wrong about what one \"believes.\" But one could also be wrong about what one thinks one knows. The difference is \"without absolute proof,\" but either way, your actions will be actions of one knowing. You believe you will get to work every morning and go to your first meeting. You do not believe you will get in a car accident on the way. You still act upon knowing you will attend that meeting when you tell your boss you will bring the presentation. Believing is not \"wishful thinking,\" nor \"hoping something might be true,\" nor \"to speculate without data.\" That is not the definition of the word believe.  To believe means to have confidence in the truth of a matter.  If you think this distinction is not important, see Philip Mayor's answer   According to Dictionary dot com: believe [bih-leev] verb (used without object), believed, believing. 1. to have confidence in the truth, the existence, or the reliability of something, although without absolute proof that one is right in doing so: Only if one believes in something can one act purposefully. verb (used with object), believed, believing. 2. to have confidence or faith in the truth of (a positive assertion, story, etc.); give credence to. 3. to have confidence in the assertions of (a person). 4. to have a conviction that (a person or thing) is, has been, or will be engaged in a given action or involved in a given situation: The fugitive is believed to be headed for the Mexican border. Thus, there is no such thing as the proverbial \"blind belief\" some might charge others of having. Because that does not fit the definition of belief, which is \"confidence in the truth of a matter.\" One who is confident something is true, has essentially the same actions as one who knows, even though technically, knowing is stronger than believing. Therefore nobody lives their lives as if the things they know and the things they believe are different.  ",

            "answer_text": "Knowledge can be tricky, in that the senses -- along with one's conclusions -- can easily be and generally are fooled.  But beliefs are inherently deceiving because in and of themselves, they distort perception of reality. I don't need to believe in that tree standing outside my window.  I can see it, go out and touch it or measure its dimensions.  It's as real as any aspect of life.  Still, even sensing it reliably, there are many aspects to that tree that I may not be aware of -- e.g., that it houses many species of insects, birds and squirrels, that it fits into a huge, interactive ecological system, that its leaves and seeds nourish many other life forms, that its wood may one day be used for furniture that people could continue to use for centuries, etc.   Knowledge about things is useful, then, but may not cover the whole picture -- and thus set up fallacious conclusions and a resulting distorted picture of reality. Beliefs, on the other hand (as I would understand the word and it is commonly used), are conceptualizations that have no substantial basis for their declaration.  You can believe in God (the deity with the name beginning with a capital \"G\"), Allah, Vishnu, Thor, Ahura Mazda, Apollo, Quetzalcoatl or any other proclaimed god.  None of them ever existed -- but each seems real in the perception of the believer.  Beliefs are thus inherently deceiving: they distort perception to confirm their own artificial veracity. The difficulty in reliability of either knowing or believing lies in the flagrant inability of the mind -- the conscious, perceptive capacity of each of us -- to distinguish experienced reality as it is, without distortion caused by held beliefs and learned definitions.  The mind invariably interprets experienced events based on held beliefs and definitions -- most of which were put in place during early childhood, most of which are common, popular cultural notions and most of which are false. Much of our adherence to belief as a useful means to understand life stems from age-old passing down of religious notions.  Reliance on knowledge as a common and useful tool only dates a few centuries, as it was as recent as 1600, thereabouts, that European thinkers began to develop reason and empirical evaluation as reliable means to understand life.  But all such ventures suffer from the problem I just mentioned: the propensity of the mind to confirm its own held beliefs. In effect, in life, each of us engages a series of events and relationships that unfold daily in meaningful ways.  In actuality, the conscious Self (you included) engenders patterns in life -- repeating patterns in success, health and relationships that reflect its own nature.  You can change those patterns by delving into the subconscious, finding underlying elements of struggle, conflict, suggestion, punishment, etc., and change them.  When you do that, life changes in response. But we all learned, as a combination of belief and knowledge, that external sources and forces make life happen: gods (religion), bacteria/government/bad people/mothers-in-law (science and tradition), luck and fortune (superstition) all seem to \"cause\" one's life to contain negativity and resistance to one's will.  In actuality, you attract those negatives based on your own mindset. Believing in gods and luck, knowing that scientific precepts are valid -- both of these deter immediate perception in the interactive oneness with which life functions.  In that regard, they are both deceptive and damaging to life experience.   But belief is much worse because it is founded on mere conjecture.  Knowledge can be incorrect and invalid -- but it can also be accurate and useful.  As to your original question: of the two, knowing is much superior to believing -- but only if what you know is true and accurate!  Whether it is or not, though, is difficult to determine, as flawed knowledge will distort your perception just like phony beliefs!! Better than either is direct perception untainted by either knowledge or belief.  That's attained by ridding the mind of both deceptive beliefs and inaccurate knowledge.  ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. . . First I'd better define these two terms so anyone reading will know where I'm coming from. Knowing is being convinced in your mind that something is factually true and you have data and observations to back that up.  You \"know\" the sun will rise and set each day.  Could a day come along when that doesn't happen?  I suppose it could, but most of us \"know\" that will happen (because the earth is rotating).   Generally this falls in the realm of science. Believing is accepting something without hard observations and evidence to back it up. Those who choose to believe there is a God do so without hard proof.   They do so because it feels right to them and as spiritual persons it makes them feel good and complete in their life. Generally this falls in the realm of religion. Somethings fall in the cracks.  When science deals with \"the Big Bang,\" the Higgs Boson, the space time/continuum, etc.  there is somewhat of a fuzzy zone between \"knowing\" (hard facts) and \"believing\" (it makes sense to me). Now back to your question.  Each person's answer will depend on their own points of reference. For me, as a tech-no geek person, I'd rather know that believe.  I'm more comfortable with facts and proof.  However that doesn't stop me from choosing to believe there is a \"supreme force of the universe.\" ",

Even if the data is 100% valid, it can still be inaccurately perceived, incompletely perceived, or misinterpreted by the brain.   The brain is a biological organ that can be impaired by chemicals, age, disease, emotions, etc..  Also, everything the brain knows, or thinks it knows, comes to it through the nervous system -- which is also subject to impairment.    There is a continuum that describes the extent to which perception is based on objective, verifiable, evidence.   On one end, the objective evidence is high, and on the other end, objective evidence is non-existent.   It is a generally a good practice for us to keep our limitations in mind and to consider all data and evidence critically.   It also seems prudent to rely more heavily on beliefs that are based on objectively verifiable evidence and avoid beliefs that are not. ",
