            "answer_text": "I found the following here: What Unlocking Your 7th Sense Could Mean For You Every human being intermittently uses his or her seventh sense, but most do so unconsciously. You are using your seventh sense when you ask the Universe a question and receive the answer as your own thought with such clarity, there is no doubt. It is pure knowing. You could have recently used your seventh sense for something as inane as walking into an unfamiliar grocery story, wondering where the balsamic vinegar was, and allowing your feet to carry you directly there without questioning why \u201cleft\u201d was the thought. You cultivate your seventh sense when you consciously make use of all the resources available to you in the Universe. Quite literally, nothing can be hidden from you by any part of Creation\u2014past, present, or future. All you have to do is tap into your seventh sense and inquire. This happens by sitting quietly in contemplation\u2014or remaining in a state of open wonderment. The wonder of a child is still contained within you, as you, and is a gateway to greater knowledge. In reality, all of life is a gateway to higher consciousness or enlightenment\u2014Self-Knowledge. Want to know how the Universe works? Or mankind\u2019s true history? Ask! The information will flow to you at a level you can understand, the spectrum broadening when you are capable of going deeper. Be advised the information is relative to the physical plane as a more comprehensive version of reality, but is by no means complete. No human nervous system has the capacity to contain the totality of light. ",
