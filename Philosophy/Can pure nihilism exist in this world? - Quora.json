            "answer_text": "Depends on your definition of Nihilism. Let\u2019s take the most common version: most people believe nihilism to be a belief that nothing exists, or that nothing has inherent meaning. This, of course, cannot coexist with the very concept of nihilism. The belief that nothing is real means that nihilism in and of itself cannot be real. It\u2019s a bit like saying, \u201cThis sentence is false.\u201d The next version, the one I would tend to follow, rather than believing in nothing, is not believing in anything. You might call it a sort of all-encompassing metaphysical agnosticism. In other words, this sort of nihilism would have it that nothing can possibly be proven in any capacity, as we cannot prove that anything, such as the universe itself, any system of beliefs or whatnot, can be objectively shown to exist. If you say \u201cgravity exists because you fall when you jump,\u201d this sort of nihilist might say, \u201cprove that you fall,\u201d \u201cI experience myself fall,\u201d \u201cwhy are you so certain the what you feel is real,\u201d and so on. This is not to say that believing the universe doesn\u2019t exist would make any more sense to this nihilist. On the contrary, believing nothing can or cannot be proven leaves one with the assumption that all things both exist and do not exist at once. Everything is both real and a lie, simultaneously, and to an utterly equal degree with everything else. Believing in one thing would be 100% valid, just as disbelief in that thing is equally so. In this second scenario, nihilism not only exists, but allows itself not to exist at once. So, yes, pure nihilism (of one kind or another) can exist in the world. But it also doesn\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "Pure nihilism Does exist in this world! It is the foundation of existence itself. It is as if we begin with a clean slate. The reality of meaninglessness, total meaninglessness, throughout all of existence, is simply unacceptable to a thinking mind. An analogy would be \u201cnature abhors a vacuum.\u201d As nature rushes in to fill the vacuum, so does the human conscious mind rush in to fill the emptiness with meaning. Matters not that the meaning is purely illusion, anything is better than the abyss. Nothingness is too cold. Mind cannot survive in nothingness. Mind needs the warmth of the imagination, the glow of light, even blinding light, given off by reasons and answers and explanations. It is the nature of the mind to question. It cannot help but to do so. In the objective world, the questioning mind finds outlets everywhere. Adam gives names to all the animals. When the mind enters the realm of the existential, it suddenly finds itself lost, unable to communicate, for there is nothing to communicate with, at least not in the language of the mind. The reasoning mindruns smack into the wall of meaninglessness. It has no place here and can serve no purpose. This is the world of existence, devoid of meaning. Here, only experience can traverse the vast deserted landscape. Here the senses are in command. The emotions, feelings, the tastes and sounds and sights, the smells and, yes, the feel of the overall experience. There is no meaning to any of it. That is why our ever questioning mind  assigns meanings to it. Yet the meanings are artificial, they are not intrinsic to the reality of existence. Our imaginations run wild in the wide open canvas of philosophizing art. We come away with gods, then God, with morals, then Laws, with such a myriad of ideas and opinions that they cannot help but clash. And when these imaginative ideas become beliefs, we are restrained and shackled. And when these beliefs clash, as they are destined to do, the result is violence. Violence of every kind. Continuing violence which we are powerless to prevent because we are unwilling to discard our belief systems, not realizing that, all along, they are but illusions we have constructed to counter the reality of meaninglessness. Generation after generationcondemned to a world of violence, needless violence, due to our hubris as much as to our ignorance. The Nihilist stands alone, aware of the actual meaninglessness, unafraid to stare into the abyss. Unencumbered by the false tales of gods with their moral imperatives, untouched by the violence of stubbornly held beliefs, the Nihilist waits;  waits for the time when mankind will have achieved the mental maturity to accept and to face the ultimate truth of its existence. Then will he lead. ",

            "answer_text": "Nihilism in itself is a bit of a contradiction. It preaches the hollowness and non-existence of values, yet it is a value in itself. Some contest that nihilism isn\u2019t a value as it is just a realisation of what is. However, nihilism makes the assumption that everything else is tinged with human bias except for the claim that \u2018everything is tinged with human bias\u2019. So it refutes itself. Though many philosophers that entertain nihilism claim that \u201crationality repudiates itself\u201d (Camus), or reject logic as a human creation and at the same time accept it (Nietzsche). ",
