            "answer_text": "We can know who we are by a process of self-realization, that\u2019s pretty good proof. There is a science to self-realization and the best proponents are from India. As a yogi who sits in meditation for decades controlling the life airs, it\u2019s possible, but not really practical in this age. One has to live a solitary life, giving up not only all sexual activities, but even the thought of sex. One cannot eat very tasty foods, nor indulge in any activities based on satisfying the senses. In this way the senses have to be brought fully under control so that they do not disturb the meditation. Then one has to go deep inside one\u2019s consciousness to the soul and Supersoul and meditate on both until one achieves realization. This astanga yoga process was meant for a different time when life was simpler and longer. Now the process is bhakti yoga where one starts at the end by accepting that we are spiritual entities and acting as such by performing spiritual activities under the guidance of a qualified guru. As the spiritual activities increase, the material ones will decrease and we will get glimpses of our spiritual nature. We have a spiritual identity, but it is rare to know what it is during our life-time. However our spiritual nature can be perceived gradually by associating with Krishna through the sound of His name and through worshiping His archa vigraha deity form. Our original identity is very different to who we think we are. We have a mind and a body, and our identity is based on these, but they are material and constantly changing. Our real self, lies covered under this material illusion of who we are, and only when that covering is completely removed, usually by death, can we know our original spiritual identity. ",
