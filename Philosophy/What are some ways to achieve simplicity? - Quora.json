            "answer_text": "Focus! That's the only way and I doubt that you will need anything else. Focus really hard on the problem that you are trying to address.   Steve Jobs was very fond of repeating one of the best quote on Simplicity by Leanardo d Vinci: \u201cSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication\" What Steve meant is that when a facing a difficult problem. The normal approach is that you start with a na\u00efve simplicity to address the problem, to fix whatever it is that you see is broken. But then you find all kinds of problems if the problem is complex, you come up with all kinds of corner cases. So you switch from a na\u00efve simplicity to an informed complexity. And most people stop either at the earlier stage or at this stage, when they release a solution that address all the issues but is very complicated to use. But if you push it really hard, in the end, at the other end of tunnel, you come up with something simple and elegant, which is the informed simplicity. It addresses all the corner cases and it is the ultimate of the sophistication.  That\u2019s actually the biggest problem that I have with the \u201cMinimal Viable Product\u201d movement. That I think it allows people to give up in stage 1 or 2, and say \u201cthis doesn't work, I need to pivot and move on\u201d. To come to the informed simplicity you really need some faith that the problem is so important to address that you are forced to have faith that at the end of the other tunnel, there will be a simple and beautiful solution that will change everything. That's a hard, painstaking and faith-requiring process that not everybody's willing to go through. It requires a whole host of things, a willingness to suffer through the amount of time and energy it's going to take to get there, a desire for simplicity in the beginning (or a clear realization that the market will not take anything unless it is completely simple) and a faith that if you stay in it long enough that you're going to get to something simple.    Yet the outcome could be so beautiful, think of iPad, a device that Apple has been working on since early 2000s, well before the iPhone. They kept working on it because it was not ready...for years. So the ways to reach simplicity is simple...but it is not easy. ",
