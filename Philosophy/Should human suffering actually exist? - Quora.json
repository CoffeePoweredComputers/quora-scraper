            "answer_text": "We are here for testing. Testing missions are not supposed to be easy and comfortable. The test questions are not supposed to be known in advance. God is testing us in our short life on earth; the wealthy father has the right to test his children before distributing the wealth. The obedient son who takes care of others should be rewarded better than the disobedient son who persecutes others. Our life on earth is a very short period compared to the universe time scale; It could be a temporary test period. There are hundreds of verses and teachings about that as mentioned in the following answer: https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-... We have been asked to believe in God and Heaven but we have not seen God or heaven. Our fate will be determined based on that belief and on our good deeds. Why did God make it a difficult test for us? The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free \u201cThen you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\" John 8:32 Here are some more detailed answers with verses and teachings: https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-... https://www.quora.com/What-makes... https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-... https://www.quora.com/How-can-we... https://www.quora.com/Is-eternal... https://www.quora.com/Do-the-suc... https://www.quora.com/What-do-yo...

            "answer_text": "Poor wording of your questions. Surely you mean\u201d Should human suffering be allowed to exist\u201d. My answer is.. yes; we have mutant genes eventually causing cancer, communicable diseases caused by viruses and bacteria. We have nerve endings which cause pain which is a protective device.. and so do OTHER animals. Humans, especially males, as in much of the natural world, aspire to being powerful. The pursuit of power often over-rides the feeling of compassion, hence others get hurt in the process. Conquests; battles; wars; fights; acquisition of territory; et al; are a human condition. Get over it. As one Australian prime minister once said\u201d Life wasn\u2019t meant to be easy\u201d and dear friend, it sure ain\u2019t for about 50% of the world\u2019s population. Nah; God couldn\u2019t care less as he/she/it has to tend to the runnings of the infinite universe. Busy busy busy. ",
