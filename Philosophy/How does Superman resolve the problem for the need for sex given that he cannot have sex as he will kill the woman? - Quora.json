            "answer_text": "Oh isn't that cute. Someone has read \u201cMan of Steel, Woman of Kleenex\u201d and has taken it seriously. I seem to recall a less famous version of this that went into the problems of sex with Supergirl but it never got the circulation that this one did. Okay, so about now I usually go into my stock explanation of why Superman can have sex with Lois or Lana or a just about any other human being, how a human can be impregnated by a member of a totally different species, how Supergirl can have her super-strong hymen torn by Brainiac 5 or whoever her current boyfriend is, and indeed how any comic book character can do just about anything: Because the writers say they can. In comics and any fiction, the writer is a good and gets to make the rules. But let's not take that tack (although it is the real answer) and instead go to the source material. Comics: The only times that we know that Superman was in a relationship where sex was possible was after the John Byrne reboot. Up until that time Superman wasn't married and the Comics code was mostly in effect so no sex before marriage. Superman was depowered when he and Lois got engaged (and then broke up) and again when they got married. There are indications that they figured out ways to be intimate that didn't put her in jeopardy, through giving her powers, or by placing them in a situation or place where he was depowered. The New 52 dealt with the situation by not dealing with it. They decided that the iconic 70 year old triangle between Lois Lane, Clark Kent and Superman wasn't right or wasn't working, so the gave Lois a live in boyfriend and put Superman with Wonder Woman as the ultimate power couple (in more ways than one). Apparently DC decided that in the New 52 characters didn't have time for love or romance, and certainly not with \u201cordinary people\u201d. Fortunately that went away. New 52 Superman was replaced with Byrne Reboot Superman with Lois and a son, Jon. Jon was the result of a year depowered in the Convergence Universe (maybe the only good thing to emerge from Convergence). Movies: For Superman and Lois to have sex they had to take away his superpowers in Superman II. While he eventually got them back so he could defeat Zod, Ursa, and Non, and stole Lois's memories of their night together to boot, if Superman Returns is to be believed the consequences were not ruled back (either Lois want on The Pill, or there was still a little super-oomph left in his stuff). I haven't seen Man of Steel (I own it, just haven't watched it yet) but in Batman vs Superman they seem to ignore the whole issue. Lots knows who Clark is and they are apparently intimate enough that they take baths together. Television: In Smallville, Clark and Lana lose their Ursa together when he had lost his powers. When he gets them back, he's afraid of what could happen so its hands off. Which is frustrating to Lana because apparently it was good for her. She ends up marrying Lex Luthor. And then divorcing him. And then leaving the show. She does come back later, with powers of her own, and they do the deed. It causes small earthquakes which leads to Chloe disorderly them. Unfortunately the source of her new powers means that she and Clark can never be together Asian, so that goes away. Finally, after Clark tells Lois about his powers they eventually start living together at the Kent farm. When the issue comes up (with Chloe naturally) Clark simply says that he's learned to control himself. It may be related to a story where Clark met another Kryptonite who used Blue Kryptonite (in the comics only effective against Bizarros) to deeper himself to have a normal life. But it seems mostly that the show decided that they didn't want to make a big deal of it. Conclusion: The two resolutions that are most common both involve bringing the two people down to the same power level. In other words either creating a circumstance where Superman is depowered and doing it with a normally powered woman, or where Superman partner has been given powers approaching his own. Or, by just ignoring it entirely. In the end though it comes down to my stock answer - because the writers say they can. Now that doesn't necessarily mean the results will be good. After all, a writer at Marvel thought it was a good idea to magically eliminate the Spiderman and Mary-Jane marriage for no good reason that I can discover. ",

            "answer_text": "The Writers actually have not satisfactorily resolved that issue. They have come up with many ways but none of them manage to convince the possiblity. You may say they have sex under red sun, but during his fight with Braniac where he got trapped in the bottled city of Kandor with red sun, he still managed to cause enough damage. In Superman II he managed to get rid of his powers temporarily. In Batman v Superman, it's never resolved. In Smallville show, he \u201c figured\u201d out how to adjust his power. Many of the answers here state that he has learned how to control his powers through experience and his time on Earth. Thats why he can shake hands without breaking them. Okay, first of all; Sex is not like shaking hands.Sex involves secretion of semen and that itself can kill the woman taking it, like a bullet.Clearly, it implies that to have sex, Superman has to go through the trouble of getting rid of his powers, or finding a place with red sun. Which means he is not free to have sex with people anywhere the woman wants (no romantic honeymoons), no blowjobs or masturbations at any given time. He gets a boner, especially when a supervillain is around, I can't imagine the embarrassment. (Will his dick tear through the pants and stand straight) This is why I'm not a fan of Lois Lane as Superman's girlfriend. It makes no sense. This is why I prefer Wonder Woman. It is possible for her to 'take' him. They make perfect sense. But NOOO! Fans would rather have him living like a hermit with Lois. Thinking : 1000. Poor guy. [ Ive not read Man of Steel Woman of Kleenex, and if you've read it, or intend to tell me to, don't. You wouldn't be here if you did.] Writers have made it possible, but have yet to explain how it could work.   ",

            "answer_text": "Well, let me just suggest an answer by taking a story line from Frank Miller\u2019s Dark Knight (DK) universe. While many argue that this is not canon, I believe it can help answer the posted question. In Miller\u2019s DK universe, Superman has a daughter named Lara from his relationship with Wonder Woman. Several panels, especially from DK-2 (The Dark Knight Strikes Again #2), illustrated how Superman had sex with Wonder Woman with his unrestrained power.  The sexual activity itself created natural disasters, such as a tsunami, hurricanes, and seven-point-eight-Richter-scale earthquake! As you can see, the magnitude of a sexual act performed by Superman without power restraint can produce a disastrous consequences for the Earth and its inhabitants.  Storywise, the sex acts in the panels resulted in Wonder Woman\u2019s being pregnant and giving a birth to a son, named Jonathan, whose care and roles were described in one of the subplots in Miller\u2019s DK-3 (The Master Race).  In the subplot of DK-3, Jonathan became the object of fights between a group of Kandorians under the command of their cult leader Quar and the Amazons under the leadership of Wonder Woman in Themyscira. But for sure, Superman would eventually accept his responsibility as a father for a powerful daughter and son and teach them how to negotiate their roles and position among human beings on Earth.  So, there you have it. Superman could have sex with a powerful woman, in this case Wonder Woman, without having to lower down his power as suggested by the other answers. As illustrated above, the sexual acts themselves can be catastrophic to the Earth. However, as long as the acts can produce powerful children, it might be worth the risk. ",

Of course what you or anyone could say is that there's no way he can have sex with women like Lana and Lois and feel completely satisfied. There are bodily functions in the sex act that go beyond control, and in the climax unless he has a condom made with a near indestructible material, then he would have killed Lana and Lois.

He\u2019s lifting a freighter with one hand. The problem with that is that if you apply that much force to that small an area you won\u2019t lift it. You\u2019ll just punch right through. What he\u2019s doing is transferring his flight power or his durability to the freighter by touch\u2026or perhaps both. If Superman wants to touch a human and not break them, then they won\u2019t break. Because he\u2019s Superman and he can do anything he wants anyway. ",
