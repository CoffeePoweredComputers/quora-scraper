            "answer_text": "Not only Socrates but countless others down through he ages have expressed similar. Take for example a Buddhist religious leader, the Dalai Lama, he said: \u201cI believe that the very purpose of our life is to seek happiness.\u201d He then explained that he believed that happiness can be achieved by training, or disciplining, the mind and the heart. \u201cA mind,\u201d he said, \u201cis all the basic equipment we need to achieve complete happiness.\u201d Belief in God is unnecessary, he maintains. In contrast, consider Jesus, who had strong faith in God and whose teachings have affected hundreds of millions of people over the centuries. Jesus was interested in human happiness. He began his well-known Sermon on the Mount with \u201cHappy are . . .\u201d (Matthew 5:1-12) In that same sermon, he taught his listeners to not simply to be content with what they were used to doing but to examine, purify, and discipline their minds and hearts\u200b\u2014replacing violent, immoral, and selfish thoughts with peaceful, clean, and loving thoughts. (Matthew 5:21, 22, 27, 28; 6:19-21) What we think about matters. The Bible encourages \u201ccontinue considering\u201d things that are \u2018true, of serious concern, righteous, chaste, lovable, well spoken of, virtuous, and praiseworthy.\u2019\u200b\u2014Philippians 4:8. Jesus knew that true happiness involves relationships with others. Have you ever seen someone isolated for long periods of times Happy? Or someone who is at constant odds with others happy? We humans are gregarious by nature, so we cannot be truly happy if we isolate ourselves or if we are constantly in conflict or in argument with those around us. Bottom-line, We can be happy only if we both, feel loved and if we love others. Jesus taught, of whom those \u2018others\u2019 should include fundamentally, is God. Here especially, Jesus\u2019 teaching departs from that of the Dalai Lama and many other philosophers, for Jesus taught that humans cannot be truly happy independent of God. Why is that so?\u200b\u2014Matthew 4:4; 22:37-39. Animals can be content with mere eating, sleeping, cohabiting. We never see animals sitting on a log in a thinking position or looking up at the stars wondering how and why. Unlike animals, we have spiritual needs. Created in God\u2019s image, we can to a degree cultivate divine attributes, such as love, justice, mercy, and wisdom. (Genesis 1:27; Micah 6:8; 1 John 4:8) Our spiritual needs include the need to have meaning, reason and purpose in our live\u2019s and in finding it in the things around us. How can we satisfy such spiritual needs? Math, science, history, biology, sports, etc\u2026 can go but so far is satisfying some needs. Nor through transcendental meditation or mere introspection. Rather, Jesus said: \u201cMan must live, not on bread alone, but on every utterance coming forth through Jehovah\u2019s mouth.\u201d (Matthew 4:4) If we really want something in abundance, why not go to the Source? Many self-help books today are often misguided. It tends to play to selfish desires or to the ego. And or It is based on limited knowledge and experience, and quite often it rests on false premises. If you want to know how to get the best use an I-Phone, do you go to an Android seller? Or Vice Versa? But if you want the best use of you phone, and you had an opportunity to go to the maker and designer personally, which option would you choose? Jehovah God knows our makeup and what will make us truly happy. He is our Maker and Designer. He knows why he put man on the earth and what the future holds, and he lovingly shares that information with us in the Bible. What he reveals in that inspired book strikes a responsive chord in individuals and inspires happiness. (Luke 10:21; John 8:32) Such joy intensifies when we allow Bible truth to guide our life. Here is 1 Common keys that are found with happy people. Keep your life simple. Chose to keep spiritual things in first place and maintain a simple life-style.\u201d Put first the things that are really important, such as our relationship with God, family concerns, and other related matters, then our \u201ceye\u201d will be \u201csimple,\u201d uncluttered. Jesus did not advocating asceticism or extreme self-denial. After all, Jesus himself was not an ascetic. (Matthew 11:19; John 2:1-11) Rather, he taught that those who view life as little more than an opportunity to amass wealth essentially miss out on life, miss out on it\u2019s meaning, and have little realization of of\u2019s purpose.

            "answer_text": "Everyone finds fullfillment in different things In my opinion true happiness is created in union. When we have our closest friends and family and are able to live in an environment that we all work together and find our best talents and gifts to serve one another is the closest I can imagine a happy life would be.. Now I know that my answer seems very hallmark cardish... And many people will disagree and alot of people may feel family is not the answer, however many people may have developed a survival key to protect themselves because they have been in traumatized situations or hurt very badly by people they love and this little answer I have written isn't realistic and I mean no harm or to offend anybody I know there are some monsters among the human race and some people would prefer to be alone. And in some cases who could blame them. I for one have had a walk on easy street as far as life goes I feel fortunate and I know some or maybe most habe been through hell and poverty and abuse.. And I'm grateful for my life and my heart goes out to the pain some have endured.. When we talk about things like religion or love or happiness the common factor is union. We are by nature Co dependant creatures that's how we have been able to survive up until now. It's grown into individual independent situations and the more we separate it seems the harder it is to find happiness. In comparison with the 1970s people had littler homes and more friends now people have bigger homes and less friends. Honestly ask yourself what is it going to take to find happiness and where can you truly find it? It's obvious to me even though I know many will disagree In my heart we all want very similar things... ",
