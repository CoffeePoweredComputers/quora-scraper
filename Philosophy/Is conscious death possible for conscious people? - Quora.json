            "answer_text": "You are asking whether it is possible to die while being fully aware about the world around. I have not witnessed such a death myself, but it is not impossible for a person to be aware until his body and brain finally shuts down for death. No one can be aware at the moment of death, because awareness requires a functional brain, and brain must stop for death to happen. Consciousness is not dependent on brain, and it leaves with the departing Jiva for afterlife and rebirth. ",

            "answer_text": "All people are capable of consciousness, although some develop greater skill in utilizing this mental function. Even when one is unconscious, as during stages of sleep, the potential for consciousness remains. The philosophical question is whether consciousness continues after the physical body is no longer functional. Therefore, conscious death is not possible as long as brain functions exist. ",
