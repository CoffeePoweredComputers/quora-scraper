If something is actually true belief is not needed or required. All you need is evidence to corroborate whatever you are being told this \u201ctruth\u201d to be. Can you believe something to be true without any evidence for it to be true? You can believe anything you want but, the fact that some people believe some things to be true does not make them true unless they are proven to be true in the first place. Word salads will not help you there. Something is either true or it is not. With no evidence is not the truth, its a claim. ",

            "answer_text": "There is more to believing than uttering some formula. Belief involves or consists in personal commitment, and this is expressed as a component of personality in many ways. We discover what we believe, and we can also be mistaken about what we believe. A [propositional] belief may be defined as a claim that is consistent with every aspect of the believer\u2019s behaviour (including any pretence of disbelief). We have traditionally defined knowledge as \u201cjustified true belief\u201d, but there are some well-known problems with this definition. For example, the justification cannot be accidental (this is called the Gettier problem). I may believe that there is a service station just up the road because I can see it in the distance. This is definitely a genuine belief. The totality of my behaviour is fully consistent with the claim that there is a service station just up the road so, for example, I may experience digestive system effects in imminent anticipation of stopping for lunch. This is also a justified belief, because in the ordinary sense \u201cseeing is believing\u201d, even though all I actually saw was a mirage. My justified belief is also shown to be true when it subsequently turns out that (despite the mirage) there really is a service station just up the road. However, we would not say that I knew there was a service station just up the road, in spite of my justified true belief. ",

            "answer_text": "People think with the help of mental models of reality. These mental models have some internal consistency. For example: When people are angry, they may take steps which are harmful to others; God is angry and hence God\u2019s actions could be harmful to us; God is kind to his/her devotees; why? We know that powerful people are kind to their followers; These mental models have some empirical basis too. X is going through a difficult time now; His current star position according to the horoscope is closer to Saturn. There is a connection between his current difficulty with the horoscope position. Hence all mental models have some internal logic and empirical basis. However there are problems or inaccuracies with these internal logic and empirical evidence. This is not only related to religious issues. It can be there on other aspects too (for example, political ideology). The key issue is that some of these mental models are not grounded in actual reality. However this is not apparent to those who use these mental models. ",

            "answer_text": "Our brains can only process a very small part of what in it receives. Meaningful conclusions are only possible using filters. Some things, carefully selected, must be ignored. When we ignore the important, we have blinded ourselves, but that is a risk we have to take. The best answer is to be willing to make some mistakes, and recognise quickly when you have made a mistake. If you believe anything is possible, you believe it is possible you are wrong. That is an important insight. ",
