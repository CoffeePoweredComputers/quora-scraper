            "answer_text": "A very good quetion. As an individual we follow a mundane routine of 5-day work timetable. We go to office everyday, sit in the same cubicle, run the same codes/excel sheets and after 8 hours of uneventfulness and monotony  we drive back home and enjoy with friends/family and finally go to sleep. The next morning the loop starts all over again.  Some thouands of years ago the earliest of our species also went through the same ordeal of life. Of course there were no air-conditioned offices to work, smart phones to chat or clubs to hangout with their loved one. Their primary target was survival in the wilderness, protecting themseleves and their clan from getting killed by wild beasts, adverse weather and deadly diseases. But the most intelligent race on earth did not submit to the nature's whims easily. They stayed together, hunted together. Unity was key to survival. The cavemen from the Early Stone Age accidentally invented fire, a big necessity of modern lives. Fire's purposes were  multiple, some of which are to add light and heat, to cook plants and animals, to heat-treat stone for making stone tools, to keep predator animals away. Today we use fire right from cooking to performing industrial reactions. Then came the discovery of wheels which happened in the late Neolithic, and may be seen in conjunction with other technological advances that gave rise to the early Bronze Age. It was one of the great achievements of human society. From transportation of humans and cargo in that age to functioning as a turbine in engines and machines to lend them mechanical advantage, Wheel has revolutionised human lives. Fast forward to The Renaissance(14th to the 17th century). Considered a the bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history.  It was the period of innovation. In politics, the Renaissance contributed the development of the conventions of diplomacy, and in science an increased reliance on observation. It transformed the concepts of humanism, art, science, medicine and religion. People started exploring and discovering unknown terrains. Mankind was at the pinnacle of innovation and develpoement both culturally and in the fields of science. Then we entered the age of computers , micro-chips and nanotechnology .The whole world is now connected through the World Wide Web. Smart-phones and gadgets makes our life fast and eay.Now we send telescopes on long journeys across the cosmos to study galaxies millions of miles away from earth and aim to settle on Mars. All the above that we achieved till now, is the result of collective efforts and ideas of many scientists, thinkers, philosophers, writers, politicians, workers, craftsmen who contributed with both their minds and muscles to reform, revolutionise and develop humanity. Everyone knowingly or unknowingly contributed something , big or small, to the society throughout the history of evolution. We marched on reaching newer milestones So even if you find your life mundane , redundant and search for inspiration and purpose of your existence always remember everyday you are contributing to the society ,to the progress of mankind through your work. Everyone cannot be like Aristotle, Galileo, Einstein, Darwin, Da Vinci, Columbus, Shakespeare...( its a long list). They were pioneers, they showed alternate paths in life. Its upto the common people, us, to carry out their legacy, to build on the foundation stone they layed, to take humanity to newer heights.  Make this the purpose of your existence. You may die but your footrints will remain. ",

            "answer_text": "Yeah, about a couple of years ago. I came to a conclusion, and never have thought about this question ever since.  I don't know what was it that triggered this intense internal questioning about life's purpose, but it definitely made me think really hard. Anyway, this is what I have come up with.  What someone chooses to believe about the meaning of life is actually irrelevant because there isn't any inherent meaning in life, which leads to my next point;Life is made out to be this out of the ordinary thing, when in fact it is just a juxtaposition of various molecules clubbed together which make you alive. You could not have taken birth, and you would have never found out about it, because \"you\" don't exist.>>Why do we work for 5 days and enjoy on weekends? That is because the Julian calendar combined with the Western work ethic dominates the world. But some differences persist. My dad back in India works for 6 days a week, and Arabs work for around 4 days a week (at least in the rich Arab countries). And I am not even going to talk about tribal people whose societies are organized in a completely different manners than of those here on Quora.  >>Are we not here to make create some huge impact for us belonging to the smartest species of this globe, with the smartest genes who have come a long way through adaptation? No, not really. This is simply because as I said earlier, I disagree with the view that there is a purpose in someone's existence at all. Surely there are internal purposes that we assign to our individual and filial lives, but in an abstract manner life is meaningless. If choosing to believe that you personally have some greater purpose behind your existence, suit yourself. But life as it is (from a biological POV) has absolutely no meaning. ",
