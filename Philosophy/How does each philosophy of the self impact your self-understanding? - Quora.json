            "answer_text": "I think outside of \"each\" philosophy of self. I can't speak for anyone else's self, nor can they mine, so only my own philosophy of myself would matter to myself, and yours to you. my philosophy of self is \"why\"? I focus my attention on motives, so I can know (\ud83e\udd23?) what I actually want and therefor am. What I \"want\" will drive my thoughts, memories, interactions with others, and my impressions of their interactions with me, which is what actively and reactively creates the physically presenting \"me\" to myself and the world. It also is what will draw certain things to me, which must be continually evaluated for potential necessary revisions. That, what I attract, is the most important, because I become what I surround myself with and surround myself with what I identify with and identify with whatever inwardly portrays what I outwardly wish to present. This all surrounds, at the core, whatever it is I WANT\u2026.. Like really want. And that's the \"why\" This \"why\" doesn't have to own judgement, either; so long as I'm aware of it, I'm satisfied. My \"why\" could be that I want to cause trouble. It could be I simply don't care. It could be that I'm angry, needy, entitled, grandiose, or whatever else- doesn't matter. Own your shit. Thx \ud83d\ude0a ",

            "answer_text": "From my perspective there is only one philosophy of the self, and that is philosophizing about the self as a continuous practice of looking to myself. This kind of philosophy has nothing to do with philosophical systems, thinkers and their theoretical writings about the self, reality, the truth, the world, God\u2026 Philosophizing is not a mind activity but a silent contemplation of that which contemplates reality as the self. There is no results to be expected out of this practice- persistently practicing contemplation is itself the goal; one practices until it becomes the practice... This is like living for being while being aware of it- it happens without any effort. All one needs to do is watch/observe/witness. ",

            "answer_text": "To know the self is the start of wisdom. Understanding the self is like understanding a rainbow? Though we think we understand the self in its entirety, I find it impossible, WHY? if we understood our emotions we would be in total control, yet I have not seen anyone in TOTAL self control. Some turn to movies, drugs/alcohol, need other peoples praises, and the likes. A self controlled person needs nothing to prove their worth, to define who they are. I have not met such a person. So in self understanding, if ever achieved, then we find true wisdom. The impact then would be tremendous when we have total self control. ",
