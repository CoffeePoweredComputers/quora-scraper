            "answer_text": "I had never heard this saying, until i married my happy (American) husband. However, as i was already a happy person when i met him, he felt as though, he would not be spending his life trying to make an unhappy person, happy. Which, clearly, is not his responsibility. When i asked why he wanted to marry me, rather than other people he had dated, he said that, i was already happy inside. Although obviously i was acceptable in the looks department also. And i could cook. And i am a redheaded, sort of weirdo, with English humour. All very attractive things in their own right. Unlike other relationships i had been in, my husband does try to make me happy. By that, i mean that he listens to my conversations, no matter how random or trivial. We discuss stuff. He eats my cooking failures - \u201cOh, i am going to make Ethiopian Key Wat, and Injera bread, and can you take me everywhere in this town, looking for the weird ingredients i will need to make this concoction, that i have no idea how to cook, and then will you eat it, without complaining?\u201d (He did complain actually) He does not make me watch programs on tv, that i dislike (and i don\u2019t make him watch The Great British Baking Show either) He lets me go away for girl weekends. He buys me nice perfumes, even when it\u2019s not an occasion. He cooks, not because i pout and demand it, but because he enjoys cooking. He also knows it\u2019s unwise for me to get hangry. He cleans, because he believes we have joint responsibilty for this sort of thing. He irons his own work shirts, and won\u2019t let me do it, though i do believe i\u2019m better at it. And because of all this, i am happy, and because i am happy, i do nice things for him too. Take him out for lunch, bring him a sneaky brownie, don\u2019t interrupt him, when he spends his whole evening watching YouTube vids, don\u2019t nag when he isn\u2019t doing something i want. I unload and load the dishwasher, cos he hates doing it. I go to restaurants he wants to try, even when i don\u2019t like the sound of them. I go to see movies that don\u2019t really appeal to me, cos i appreciate that i have a husband, who goes out of his way to treat me right. I buy him weird cheese, and parts for his classic old car. Silly stuff really, but he is happy. So, for us, it\u2019s true. Happy Wife, happy life. ",

            "answer_text": " It\u2019s been 18 years, I love that woman more than sharks love blood :) It is without a question true! Try living with a b**ad girl for a week and you will probably listen carefully to the 2 best advices an old man gave me long time ago: Find how she measures loveYou either are right or you are happyI know a lot of couples, divorced or not, it always boils down to one of these two. Find how she measures love If possible, do that before marrying. If you are already in a relationship, great, you need to know that and make sure she knows it as well. Every woman is different but there\u2019s a constant. She is measuring your love in some way. It is probably totally unconscious and innocent but there\u2019s a bias in her that says: \u201ceverytime he does that, I know he loves me\u201d. For my wife, it is laughter. I love to make her laugh and we spent several years together before I connected the dots. She loves to laugh, this is what makes her say, this is the one. You either are right, or you are happy! We, men, tend to believe that in order to be THE MAN, we need to be in charge of [Place anything related to our virility]. It is related to parents, society, friends\u2026 as a whole. In reality, I can guarantee that the moment you make peace with the voice inside you that says \u201cI\u2019m right, I know I am\u201d you start to really enjoy your life as a happy couple. At the end of the day, it\u2019s not about who is right and/or who is wrong, it\u2019s about being happy and contributing to the overall happiness of your couple and family. Make her happy, she will give it back 1 million times! ",
