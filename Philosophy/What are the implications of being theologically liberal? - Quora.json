That's like believing that earth is half round and flat to the other halve, or seriously pondering that one plus two could be five as well. There is no god, so any form of 'theology' is crap. The most despicable thing is that there are so called \u2018universities' which \u2018teach\u2019 \u2018theology' goddie crap to children!!! My dear goat, can you imaging alledged \u2018intelligent\u2019 adults doing that? It's almost 2020! Leprechauns, fairies, fortune tellers and goddies, it's all the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Being theologically liberal means doing the hard work of thinking for yourself, rather than accepting the simplistic answers that are given to children. It means understanding that ancient peoples may have had important insights into life \u2014 because human nature changes very slowly if at all \u2014but that these ancient peoples lacked the tools of science, journalism, and modern historical techniques. By analogy, being theologically liberal is understanding that there was indeed a Saint Nicholas, and we can keep alive the spirit of giving that he epitomized, but that doesn\u2019t mean that Saint Nick is going to come down your chimney. Being theologically liberal means understanding that parts of the Bible may be parables \u2014 and that it\u2019s not important whether Jonah was or was not swallowed by a whale\u2026 but rather what\u2019s important about that story is that Jonah learned to forgive the people of Nineveh. Being theologically liberal means using the brains that God in His wisdom gave us. And being theologically liberal means believing Jesus when he said that the most important things were love, compassion, forgiveness, and service to others. ",
