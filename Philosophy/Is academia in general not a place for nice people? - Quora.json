            "answer_text": "At least in engineering fields (which is what I\u2019m most familiar with), academia is filled with people who decided to take a high-stress, high-effort, job in which they will make only a fraction of what they could easily make in industry. Why did they decide to do that? For most, it\u2019s because they care about improving the world through their research and/or teaching more than they value making money. That sounds like at least a pretty good start toward being nice\u2026. Are there some people in academia who aren\u2019t nice? Of course. People are people. How many are not nice? Well, it depends a lot on the local culture. In my area at the University of Kentucky, I don\u2019t think we currently have any faculty who aren\u2019t at least reasonably nice (and that culture is part of why I\u2019m here). On the other hand, from what I\u2019ve seen elsewhere, it\u2019s pretty common to have a single-digit percentage of faculty be not very nice in ways ranging from being too focused on their personal prestige to simply not caring about the students they are supposed to be teaching. I think education and having a career tend to make it easier to be nice; they give a sense of purpose and stability that make being kind to others not feel like it is at your expense. In seven years of foster parenting, I learned that the fraction of the general population who are un-nice enough to abuse their kids is frighteningly higher than I had ever imagined\u2026 but I also saw patterns in the abuse. The abuser usually had neither a sense of purpose nor stability, and often had been abused themselves \u2014 which usually meant they had no positive role models. In some sense, one could say that the whole point of academia is to sow the seeds of purpose and stability that will allow niceness to blossom. ",
