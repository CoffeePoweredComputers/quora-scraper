            "answer_text": "I do need to! Mature philosophy requires a skill set that is learned like any other. Everybody believes they have a philosophical opinion like everyone believes they have a medical opinion. This is not untrue, but just as my medical opinion as a qualified physician is not equivalent to the layman\u2019s view of medicine that may be expressed by an intelligent bricklayer, so my philosophical opinion as physician is not equivalent to a trained philosopher\u2019s. But how is one trained in philosophy? How are they qualified, and by whom? In the same way and by similar authorities that I was trained in medicine. Isn't such a Hegemonic system untrustworthy and invalid with respect to the essential and ineffable art and science of philosophy? Well, let's put it this way: Any literate and reasonably intelligent person can read a book on anatomy and physiology and develop an understanding of the concepts it describes. They could move on to texts on surgical pathology and operative technique. Heck, let's even give them infinite time and total recall. Is that person now a surgeon? If not, why not? They have all the relevant knowledge, even more so than \u2018qualified\u2019 surgeons. They probably even improved on standard procedures given the infinite time that they had to develop their comprehensive understanding of their subjects. If you believe we are all equal philosophers then let that person operate on you. Come on. Why are you afraid? Do the letters they don't have after their name and the unbestowed patriarchal approval of \u2018universities\u2019 really matter? Isn't all that just a sham to perpetuate the status quo? In the same way, philosophy is not read, it is done. The love of wisdom is not passive. The \u2018Love\u2019 is in its verbal form. Philosophers train and garner practical experience just as junior doctors ply their trade. Both get their hands dirty. Once your teachers and peers agree you have got enough blood, sweat and tears embedded into those hands then you may claim your title. Anything less is just pretentiousness. (My respect and regards to Philosophers reading this as a junior medical student to his Consultants) ",

            "answer_text": "You aren't going to find an intelligent person on Quora bashing philosophy. Philosophy literally means \u201clove of wisdom.\u201d I can give you three arguments, however. Because everything can be explained by science now. That's a popular one. Little do people realize just about every field we have today was once part of philosophy. Biology, chemistry, physics, and especially math. If you refer to ancient philosophy, you will notice many philosophers were also mathematicians (Descartes, Leibniz, Blaise Pascal, and Bertrand Russel, just to name a few). And some things actually can't be explained by science. Some questions are strictly philosophical (\u201cWhat is right and wrong? Is there even a right and wrong?\u201d) whereas some questions can't be answered at all (\u201cWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d).It's just a bunch of outdated arguments. Which is also false. Philosophy encompasses more than people realize. It overlaps several other fields. Formal logic is actually very mathematical and incorporates set theory, and metaphysics (not in the new age sense) incorporates physics to explain the nature of space and time. There are courses such as philosophy of mind and philosophy of physics (which discusses quantum mechanics and generally requires one take courses in physics). Ethics is also still very relevant and many hospitals often refer to ethicists during controversial situations. Law is another field in which philosophy is abundant, and it is not uncommon for universities to have a course in philosophy of law. Philosophy majors have one of the highest scores on the LSATs, typically within the top three majors. Furthermore, philosophical arguments are still being formulated today. This school is called postmodernism.It\u2019s useless. This is another favorite. A common argument is that philosophy degrees are frowned upon by employers. But in actuality, philosophy hones critical thinking and problem-solving skills, two traits employers seek out in employees. Philosophy courses often involve deconstructing arguments, extrapolating information from complicated texts, and conveying one\u2019s own thoughts in an articulate and often eloquent manner. In fact, the IT industry loves philosophy majors because of their critical thinking skills; and while some say philosophy isn't a lucrative major, those who major in philosophy have a median mid-career salary of $82,000.So, while there are reasons intelligent people may not study philosophy, they are not very good reasons.

            "answer_text": "I wouldn't say intelligent people don't need to study philosophy. In a college setting, philosophy just isn't a school which is going to make one money. You're not going to retire on lofty thoughts. Philosophy is not worthless though. I study some philosophy in my spare time. The development of the atom by Leucippus and Democritus, Plato's philosophy of forms, the story of the Cave. I haven't gotten to Hobbs, Kant and others, but I expect to someday. Reading fiction is fun and rewarding, but reading and understand philosophy and scientific text is mental weightlifting. And reading is just fun to me anyway. Philosophy unveils the way people thought at the time, what the ideas entertained by the educated movers of the world were. This day in age, philosophy isn't really a requirement for intelligent people to do life, but I consider it a valuable enough pursuit on an individual scale. Definitely don't major in philosophy unless you're a really original and relevant thinker, but definitely do read philosophy if you get bored of text books or sci-fi/fantasy novels. Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, is a great novel that is very philosophical in nature. Card is great at writing meaningful stories, and his use of time dilation near light speed to make Ender alive 400 years after the ending of the war makes him semi-realistic with his science approach, at least in that regard. The Wheel of Time is another great series with a very philosophical plot. The hero's journey, coming of age, Robert Jordan wrote a masterpiece with a huge interconnected world. The series takes a very good look at people and how they change, makes good connections to real life despite being total fantasy. ",

I\u2019ve gotten along without knowing a programming language for years. In the same manner, many people have no desire to know how we know what we know. We can\u2019t all have the same expertise. Philosophy is a bit like studying psychology. In psychology you learn theories of the mind and personality. There may be some research with facts, but much of it is based on observation. Often there are no hard facts to learn, rather you learn postulates, theories, and thought experiments. Actually, more science is actually that way than most people are willing to admit. I never formally studied philosophy but I still read the works of philosophers because I enjoy it. When I read a philosopher's work, I am aware when someone\u2019s ideas conflict with my own or when they are not really saying anything concrete. I search out and read those that help me to understand more than I currently do. ",

It helped me to understand art theory and history and thus helped to to write my Master\u2019s thesis. I would not presume that everyone is interested in philosophy, just because they are intelligent. Your interests might lie in the area of physics or pure mathematics. If this was the case, you could be tempted to study the philosophy of science, I guess. However, it would be a matter of personal preference. I\u2019m sure there are extremely intelligent people out there who don\u2019t wish to study anything! They might be happier doing menial tasks and spending all their spare time laying on the beach drinking cocktails. ",

For me, despite no formal training in philosophy, the type of logic and metacognition that we were instructed to hone in that course was something I had already perfected at a very young age. In order to get any real benefit from the field, I probably would have had to go a few levels deep in the course chain. It was certainly something I enjoyed, but not something I needed to devote an excessive amount of time towards. ",
