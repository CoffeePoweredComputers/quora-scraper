            "answer_text": "You can work with a bound morpheme or less common affix, -ize. This means to make, undergo, perform, or do the act of, modifying whatever primary root given. You are considering the more common noun, metamorphosis, combined from meta + morph + osis. Each of these parts carries a meaning, which I encourage you to read about. The morpheme meta means beyond, past, outside, no longer in scope, out of context; the morpheme morph means change, taking shape, form, movement from one to another; the morpheme osis means the condition of, usually a sickly or ill condition, or the state of with a negative sense. You can combine these morphemes, they are all bound, to form the newer word as suggested metamorphosis. This combined altogether suggests beyond the state or condition of changing or forming, usually some great change in the shape, body, or form of that thing. You can then add on the known though less commonly used suffix, to form metamorphosize, though this is not strictly a word. We call things words insofar as people are willing to say them or write them in ordinary grammar applied in most appropriate settings such as classrooms, social meetings, or workplaces, and especially public places.
