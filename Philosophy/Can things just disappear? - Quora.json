            "answer_text": "The bonds that hold atoms together to form molecules are called covalent bonds. A covalent bond is a chemical bond formed by the sharing of one or more electrons, especially pairs of electrons, between atoms. For instance, most plants take light and use it to make bonds between carbon atoms and molecules of cellulose. I believe that for some reason which is not yet known, something at the atomic level disturbs or misaligns the electrons. These interruptions at the atomic-molecular level, cause the object to temporarily blink out of existence. As the electron (s) realign, the object blinks back into existence, sometimes at a different location. I don\u2019t believe that the universe, god or wormhole is the reason for objects to spontaneously disappear. I don\u2019t believe that it is a cause and effect of any consciousness. I would compare the incident it to the traffic on a highway. All it takes is one car on the highway to carelessly pull into another lane and disrupting the flow of traffic. Generally speaking, the traffic eventually realigns itself, often times several hundred yards down the road, and the flow of traffic returns to normal. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Scott. By the laws of our universe, things can\u2019t just disappear. Here are some ideas where you can look: Is there a trash can near your bathroom counter, and if so, did you look there?How about the toilet? Weighty items that fall into the toilet can actually slide down into the closet bend. You\u2019ll need a snake to get it out. (If you notice your toilet clogging or having difficulty flushing, that\u2019s where it went.) Also, look on the floor between the back of the toilet and the wall.Do you have baseboard heating? It may have fallen on the floor, then slid under the baseboard.Good luck! ",

Whats happening is that you and everybody else are a lot less random than you think. That means that without meaning to you are probably skipping over the spot with the lost item again and again. To get around this search methodically one inch at a time. Pay no attention to how foolish looking in a clearly \u201cempty\u201d space may seem. If you have exhausted the possible, begin on the \u201cimpossible\u201d! I assure you the item did not slip into a parallel universe but it may very easily have slipped into a crack you did not think it would fit into. ",
