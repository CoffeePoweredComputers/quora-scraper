            "answer_text": " Human beings are continuously striving to achieve an instinctive concept known as \u2018happiness\u2019 yet most have no concrete idea on how to go about achieving it. Most people just settle with \u2018an idea\u2019 and believe assumptions of what would make a person happy, but happiness is not necessarily guaranteed. A mass adoption of the concept of happiness is that when everything in life falls into place and we finally have everything one would like to own, we will be happy. \u201cHappiness, as defined by psychologists, is a state of mind and a feeling of wellbeing where a person experiences positive emotions like feeling a pleasant state, being content with one\u2019s life and feeling joyful\u201d Vivienne Lewis (University of Canberra: Professor of Psychology) However, people do not realize that an individual\u2019s perception of wellbeing is highly specialized and personalized, hence what makes one individual happy may not be as effective as ensuring happiness for another individual. There are two main \u2018types\u2019 of happiness and humans are rarely in a permanent state of happiness, happiness at times is fleeting, for one moment it\u2019s there, and in a few hours it dissipates, however there are things that can be done to optimize our sense of wellbeing. Happiness is a state of emotional, mental and spiritual wellbeing and results in the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in your brain. Happiness can be found in two forms: hedonic and eudaimonic. A hedonic state of happiness is when you are experiencing a transitory state of pleasure, consuming a exceptional meal, enjoying a glass of wine, getting a relaxing massage. Eudaimonic state of happiness is related to an individuals\u2019 state of self-realization, discovery, wellbeing, fulfillment and engagement with the environment or society. In both situations, one does not need to be wealthy to experience both states of happiness. How can one seek happiness? Happiness can be experienced by practicing gratitude daily, being mindful of others and investing in personal relationships. Happiness can be harvested by investing time in building your craft or speciality and dividing your time in a balanced manner to distribute a reasonable amount in scholarship, with relationships, and experiences that bring you joy and most importantly by being honest with yourself. If you\u2019ve come this far, thank you for reading and I hope my post was a good experience for you! I wish you the best in your pursuit of happiness! Always know that the power lies within you!

            "answer_text": "It is important to consider basic definitions of words which we tend to take for granted in order to understand what they really mean. Happiness is one of those words which has lost its original meaning, and is often confused with pleasure. Happiness is unconditional. The difference between pleasure and happiness is that to be happy does not require certain conditions to be present. Happiness is when you are filled with joy for no apparent reason, when you can just feel full of yourself, of life, without being able to point at a particular event. Pleasure, on the other hand, is when you are happy because of something else. Someone tells you that you are beautiful or handsome, or you are good at something or you win something, and that makes you happy. That happiness is fleeting, momentary and disappears before you know it. It is not true happiness but pleasure. If you are happy because of something else you will soon be unhappy again because the thing that made you happy can be taken away or may disappear of its own accord. You are famous one day, and ignored the next; happy one day and unhappy the next. If your happiness is dependent on outside events then you do not know happiness. We have all fleetingly felt real happiness; when you see a beautiful sunset and something inside wells up, or a new day fills you with wonder. The sunset cannot be bought, it is not exclusively yours, it is not doing anything for you, but it fills you with joy. This is not because of the sunset as much as it is about you being lost in yourself. For a brief moment you are lost to the outside world and its problems, you are oblivious of everything. Everyone has momentary glimpses of real happiness, but it is always very short because you are drawn back into the 'real' world and the problems and stresses and anxieties of the everyday. We start with the wrong position when we call this life of problems and stress the 'real' world. When people are artistic, poetic, creative, we say to them; \"get real!\" But let us turn the discussion on its head. It is not real to race around from dawn to dusk and beyond, it is not real to eat junk food, it is not real to be anxious and stressed for long periods of time, it is not real to be stretched all the time in both body and mind. The real world is one where we can be ourselves. ",

It is not divided in levels. And honestly I am writing this with the help of a clear experience. Yeah. We find happiness in little things. Right? So these things can be little but the happiness you feel can exactly be equal with the big one. When we were little and when our parents used to give us money to buy something to eat or anything we were fond of, we used to find big happiness in that itself . Right? And the same thing still happens . So happiness is a feeling, emotion, achievment, a bliss. It is not something you can measure. Just be happy and find happiness in little things and God will give you a big reason to smile. You read my answer and did you guys notice a mistake in my answer. There is a huge mistake.

            "answer_text": "It can be, but primarily through subjective means. I suppose you could measure the levels of different chemicals in the brain, but a less invasive and more common method is asking questions. For example, if I asked a random sample of 1000 people in 2 countries to rate their happiness on a scale of 1 to 10 I would get data I could use to measure individuals perception of happiness. I could then compare them to rate the countries on perceived happiness. (2 people could be equally happy, but one had a great life and so feels less happy, and scores it lower, then the one who had a terrible life) However, if I followed a group of 1000 people and questioned them periodically, I could measure rather accurately how different types of events affects happiness. If the group averaged scoring 4 when they were in high school but 6 when in college, 3 when in the hospital, 8 when getting married, etc. even though some would rate high school higher than college, we could accurately say people tend to be happier in college than high school, weddings than hospital stays. If you score your apparent happiness for that day in a journal, you very likely would see trends between events and outcomes. For example, maybe you discover that taking that vacation (average 6 because travel, tired, lost luggage, no rental car, miss your pet gold fish)for a week really did not make you happier than the time you took a \u2018staycation.\u2019 (average 8 because slept in those extra travel days, dropped off laundry because saving money on no trip, turned off phone, love that little fish.) We don\u2019t always realize what is making us happy or unhappy. (All data is obviously made up out of thin air for example purposes, of course.) ",

            "answer_text": "I have a thinking tool to measure happiness that I call \u201cthe empty room paradox.\u201d This is personal. Many people may not agree, but I find it very powerful. Why is that a paradox? Let\u2019s play this thought experiment for few seconds. Imagine you are closed in a tiny room. There is only a bed and a desk. No computer, smartphone, cigarettes, alcohol, books and so on. Nothing at all! Of course you are fed once a day. And you also have a small window from where the sunlight comes in. My guess is that none would ever want to be in such condition. Right? That is where the paradox kicks in. The empty room paradox states that the longer you are able to live in that circumstances, without freaking out, the happier you are destined to be. Why? If you pass the empty room paradox it means that your happiness in not dependent upon external devices (cigarettes, smartphones, computers, and so on). Also, it implies that you have a creative mind, and know how to use it imaginatively. For instance, nowadays we often tend to emphasize virtual reality and how that will be the future for our species. Yet we also forget that virtual reality is and will be always filtered out and perceived through and within our brain. In other words, our brain itself is a virtual device tool that can be used to generate any kind of virtual reality you want. It is only up to your imagination and creativity. In short, the \u201cempty room paradox\u201d is a thinking tool that can be used to measure the level of mental health and future happiness. ",

Most people find that, with some practice, they can have a reliable, though subjective, 1\u201310 scale, and plot out how happy they are on that scale, using a calendar. Most adults have experienced varying happiness in their life to date. You can make a scale of 0\u201310 (to start with) where 0 is a neutral feeling of neither happy not unhappy and 10 is the happiest you have ever felt in your life so far. You could use negative numbers to indicate unhappiness. You can use this sort of scale to plot your daily happiness\u2026 if you have never done this, the exercise can be revealing. Objective happiness scales are trickier \u2026 and would need a medical definition of \u201chappy\u201d related to, say, bloodwork.

Just like no matter how much people earn and get so rich, they never get satisfied and their thirst for money increases day by day.

For example, happiness can be made up of a number of sub-constructs depending on the definition one is working with - some of these may be: self-efficacy, embeddedness in a community, optimism, a feeling of being appreciated, and many more. The key to measurement is to use psychological/social scales to measure the sub-constructs, and the findings would then give the researcher an overall view of the construct of happiness.

            "answer_text": "You must actually see the other side of the coin. Instead of asking how one can be happy in life, you must ask how the happiness can continue forever. If you take the case of worldly pleasures, the happiness is not continuous and moreover, it ultimately ends in unhappiness alone. Temporary happiness, which finally ends up in sorrow, is not desirable at all! On the other hand, the Gita describes eternal happiness. It says that the happiness which comes after some initial unhappiness during the stage when one makes efforts, alone is eternal (Yattadagre vi\u1e63amiva\u2026). You must not only see your need of happiness in the present but also in the future. Some people give importance to their happiness in their old age. They work hard earn and save enough money for their old age. They also take care of their health through good exercise and food habits. These people accept some discomfort in the present, so that they can be happy during their old age. But it is not enough. It is even more important to make efforts to ensure your happiness after death. Merely focusing on your happiness during the temporary period of this life, is not wise. If you concentrate on God, you will be happy now, you will be happy in your old age and you will be happy even after death. God is the best and only way for getting eternal happiness. His grace can be attained through spiritual knowledge and devotion. You can realize this perfectly once you study spiritual knowledge completely. You must be very careful in choosing the means of getting temporary happiness or the means of getting permanent happiness. It is most important to analyze your own goal very very carefully. You must decide whether you are seeking temporary happiness or permanent happiness. ",

But, to be completely revealing, we must first distinguish between \u201chappiness\u201d and \u201cpleasure\u201d, pleasure being a momentary positive feeling of excitement or elation, compared with true happiness being a long lasting sense of contentment, satisfaction, inner peace, balance, and joy. moreover, true happiness reflects the complete absence of negative thoughts and emotions, like anger, hate, resentment, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, anxiety, and more. When we have expanded our awareness to these dynamics, we can qualitatively determine if we are \u201chappier\u201d, much happier, or completely happy. metta ",

It tries to answer this question in a standardised and scientific way \u2013 so that we can compare our own results over time and see if we get happier or not, and also to compare our score with that of other people. The Guardian has created an interactive version of the questionnaire which you can take here. It consists of 29 simple questions and shouldn't take more than a few minutes to complete.  The lowest possible score you can get is 1, and the highest possible score is 6. The average is around 4.30. If you take the questionnaire now, it will be helpful to note down your score and today's date somewhere. Then you can compare against that at a later point, to see whether you've made any progress in becoming a happier person. There are of course a myriad of other happiness questionnaires, but I found this one helpful. There is also a lot of work when it comes to measuring happiness across a whole population, like in a country. I wrote a blog post about that recently, in case you are interested in what countries have the happiest people[1] and how it is measured. Footnotes[1] The Happiest Countries of the World 2017",

Danes are also known for their extensive use of \"black\" and ironic humor, so when asked about the reason of this discrepancy, they may answer that: \"All the unhappy people have committed suicide.\", and/or explain that: \"If you ask an unhappy dane if he is happy, he will most likely answer: Of course, yeah, yeaaaahh, you simply can't belive how f...... happy I am!!!\"-So a foreign interviewer will score him to be very happy!

This ladder method has, I believe, been used across cultures (c.f. Ed Diener) with some consistency and cross-cultural comparability. Several other measures exist that get at some aspects of happiness, but there is no one easy way to objectively measure happiness at this time. ",

When a child gets good marks in exams he is extremely happy, the amount of happiness he gets after holding the certificate or marksheet with full marks increases his confidence level and makes him work hard and perform better , same happens at every different stages of life , after winning a competition, spending a quality time with spouse or enjoying a healthy meal or food with family and friends and appreciating whatever you have and enjoying it fully creates moments of happiness!!
