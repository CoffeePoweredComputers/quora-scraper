            "answer_text": "Answered from the viewpoint of Theoretical CS. The order in your question is important. Solvability needs Computability needs Decidability. Decidability is: can a machine/process halt? [Remember the Halting problem] Computability is: are machines/functions/ programs/algorithms available to do the task? [Remember computational complexity Theory] Solvability is: does a machine/algorithm/function/program exist to find a fixed point in an equation/program specification. [Remember optimal program construction (originally from The optimal approach to recursive programs by Manna and Shamir (of the RSA encryption algorithm) ), or the Evolution of programs (Dershowitz in the AI journal, or better: his book The Evolution of Programs | DERSHOWITZ | Springer ] There is more to say. See for instance (in level of sophistication) books by: Ann Yasuhara; Lenore Blum er al; Marek Kuczma et al. ",
