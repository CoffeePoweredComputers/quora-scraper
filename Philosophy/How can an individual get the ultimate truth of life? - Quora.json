BUT JUST THEN BOOM . your conscious gives you a gratifying thought . that IT WAS NOT YOU . soon you introspect and realize how close you were to death and may be if it was 2 inches more or less you wouldnt be having this conversation with yourself . so here\u2019s you answer : be grateful each and every day for the sun you see in the morning , your family faces and your friends and relatives . even if you don\u2019t have that career you want or marks your require or the charm you need to woo your crush , dont beat yourself up over little thing in life . you have food , water , you have air in your lungs and healthy body AND mind with no disease , because as you wilL GET the lesson from this film too : EVERY DAY ABOVE EARTH IS A GOOD DAY SO THE ULTIMATE TRUTH IS : you are complete , you are whole you dont need ferrari or million dollars to be happy . it is your default behaviour when you are born but with the challenging situations and circumstances in life , we forget to feel happy and complete as we grow up ! so this is your time, hug yourself ,your mom ,dad even if it feels awkward ,because they , you are atleast alive and dererve it.
