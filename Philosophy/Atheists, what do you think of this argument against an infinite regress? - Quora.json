            "answer_text": "Ugh I hate those empty headed \"arguments\". Not only a waste of time to watch, but that nice-seeming, poor young man is wasting his brain, investing in that claptrap. First, his primary argument is, \"no you can't have that\". He just says it so therefore it's true? There's a difference between saying something and showing something. And like ALL creationists he's doing a lot of saying and zero showing. Second, philosophical and logical arguments never prove anything. Sure they are useful for thinking about a problem, or for designing an experiment. But as evidence? Not at all. So what experiment is that fellow proposing? How is he going to get evidence to demonstrate his thesis? What, he isn't? Then what's your point?? But that's the entire creationist MO: silly word games dressed up in cartoonish, sciency words. That's it. No research, no data, no collaboration, no evidence, no publication - just silly word games. Really, if I wasn't an atheist already but had a minimum knowledge of science and logic, I'd be going \"so THIS is their best argument??\" and likely become an atheist soon after watching. ",

Believers sometimes argue the \u201ccosmological argument,\u201d that everything has a cause, \u201ctherefore God.\u201d If that is true, then every cause has a cause, to infinity \u2014 my choice of sock color having been determined from the formation of the Earth. Believers are thus arguing that criminals are not responsible for their acts, because their acts were caused by something else beyond their control. Atheism is simply the lack of belief in God. There are no beliefs involved. ",
