            "answer_text": "Eternity implies that it will last forever. Mathmatically, forever, or infinity, means it will go on forever. BUT, think of the equation sqrt(x). It starts at zero and continues forever in ONE direction. By this logic, it DOES have a beginning. Thinking about the creation of the univers, it is infinitly expanding in all directions. But what set all this in motion? There had to be a point where everything was at one point, like sqrt(x) but in three dimensions and in all degrees. So that would be the beginning of that infinity. Eternity practically means forever, so yes I believe there was a beginning to eternity, the moment the concept of infinity was created naturally. ",

            "answer_text": "Because man lives in a created order of which time is a part (Hebrews 1:2), we will not understand what it means when one says that eternity means \u2018no beginning, no ending.\u2019 Only God understans eternity fully since He alone is eternal (1 Timothy 1:17). Even the words used in the Bible to speak of eternity come from a world governed by time.. In the real sense, eternity is beyond the scope of human comprehension. Since God is not limited by time, thus sees time differently from the way man sees it (2 Peter 3:8), we should regard eternity simply as \u2018immeasurable time\u2019 or using biblical expressions: from age to age which have been translated as from everlasting to everlasting and for ever and ever (Nehemiah 9:5; Psalm 21:4; Romans 1:25; Ephesians 3:21; Jude 25).
