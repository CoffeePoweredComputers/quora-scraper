            "answer_text": "Debate! \u201cSarcasm\u201d can more or less be regarded as an advanced version of the use of \u201cwit and humor\u201d. And as we know, apart from voice modulation if there is something that makes everything to your side in an speech it is wit and humor,but yes in an argument sarcasm has both pros and cons. Pros-Analogies- In an argument a sarcastic analogy can help you convince your opinon to the other group.Easy- It is hard to have in depth knowledge about all the topics that you can get an argument in, but going for sarcasm is always kind of universal.Timing- If you use sarcasm at the right time, it can even leave the other party speechless and confused.Cons-Controversial- Sarcasm can be rude and include topics of controversy, meaning it can lead to more dispute.Lack of Wisdom- In professional cases at times sarcasm can appear a lack of knowledge and make you appear amateur.Timing- If your timing is wrong, you can end up getting speechless and confused.So, in an argument sarcasm can be taken like salt if used in the right amount at the right time,it can add flavor to your dish, but if used at a wrong time or way, it can end up screwing your entire dish and argument in this case. Now, coming to pseudo-intellect as I have already said. If you are thinking that you can hide your pseudo-intellect just by show of sarcasm,so I will say that it will be utterly stupid as sarcasm can help you but not make you win things.If you want to use sarcasm to reveal someone\u2019s pseudo-intellect then most probably again it can\u2019t suffice on its own as your own knowledge and intellect and various other intellectual points need to be taken care for that.Hope this helps.

            "answer_text": "Sarcasm can win argument depending on the topic which you are arguing. If the argument is general and topic is general daily routine of your life then you can kill the argument with Sarcasm. But, if the argument is Scientific, then Sarcasm is a step down to LOGIC! Even general sarcastic answers are to be Logical, if it is to be convincing to all other people. Pseudo intellects generally try to be more showy and won't convince. Few of them may be sarcastic, but they don't like to hide their own behaviour of showing them selves more intelligent. Pseudo intellectual people may be sarcastic but vice versa is not applicable..
