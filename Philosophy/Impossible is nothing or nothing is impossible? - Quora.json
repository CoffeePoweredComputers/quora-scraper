            "answer_text": "I definitely believe we have to be more clear about what we are trying to get at with this question. I can create impossible situations by imposing enough restrictions on you. Moreover, there are mathematically impossible things. For instance, write a computer program that accepts a numeric sequence as user input and will always tell me, within say ten seconds, where in the decimal expansion of Pi the first occurrence of that subsequence is located. This is an undecidable problem. You could write a program that will locate a substring but there's no guarantee, no matter how \"consistently powerful\" the computer, that the program will terminate in the specified time interval (in this case, ten seconds). As a society, I do believe that we converge toward omnipotence and omniscience thanks to advances in technology. Given enough time, therefore, we may one day be able to do a great many things that we consider impossible today. Is anything truly impossible given enough time? I don't know, but I think it's also an undecidable problem to determine the \"when\". That is to say, the more impossible something seems by today's standards, the harder it is, I believe, to determine exactly when it will become possible. Then there's the issue of the undecidable problem I posed above. You can PROVE that problem is undecidable; however, one can imagine a hypothetical computer system which gets faster and faster and faster the longer it searches and so, like in Zeno's Paradoxes, may be able to determine the answer in a specified time interval. But this would require a magnificent and nearly impossible leap in technology ... a computer whose processing speed knew no bounds. This is why I said \"consistently powerful\". But let's remember what Arthur C. Clarke once said : \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" Maybe one day far in the future, nothing will be impossible, but it's impossible to tell right now. ",
