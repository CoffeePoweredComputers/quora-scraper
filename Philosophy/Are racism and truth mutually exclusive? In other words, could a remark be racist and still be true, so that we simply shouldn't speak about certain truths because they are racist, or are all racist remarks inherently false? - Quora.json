            "answer_text": "It depends on your definition of racism. If something is true it's true no matter if you like it or not. If your primary focus is on race that could be racist. You can use \u201cstatistics\" to try to support something that isn't exactly true by picking and choosing your numbers. For example if you look at a community whose population is mostly race X it most likely would be true that most crimes are committed by members of race X; that statement would be true without being racist. Now if you were to say that members of race X tend to be criminals that statement is probably racist as it is judging primarily on race even though statistics can be used to support that claim. In those examples the truth is a majority of the crimes committed will tend to be committed by whichever group makes up a majority of the population. Now you have those who claim (one way or another) that only whites can be racist or that they can't be racist because they are not white. That is a racist statement as Race is the main factor in claim. In conclusion Racism and truth are not mutually exclusive as I could make a statement about crime in Baltimore city in such a way that while true IS racist in nature. But I could also make a similar statement that is true but not racist in nature. So far as \u201cwe shouldn't speak about certain truths because they are racist\" that to me would seem racist because it implies that one or more races can't handle the truth. For example telling any community that they need to encourage the youth to get an education and stay out of trouble and to not protect criminals by their silence in order improve the community isn't racist. We moved from a large metropolitan area to small town USA which I will use to illustrate my point. In Baltimore murders occur almost daily and go unsolved in many cases, in one case a young child was killed and the victims family along with the rest of the community was uncooperative with the police. In NE Tenn there was one murder 2 months ago and the guy was caught in about 2 weeks because the police were being supplied with lots of information and help. The above is truth and race has nothing to do with that truth but what the two different communities are willing to accept (values) and live with have everything to do it. Now IF I was to focus on the differences in the racial makeup of those communities and use race as the primary factor to explain the differences in values THAT would be racist. ",

            "answer_text": "Racism is a motivation. A statement can be made with a racist intent and still be true. We should be able to speak about anything but of we look at the basic concepts of racist they seem to not make sense. For example: IQ is intelligence and random black man would have statistically lower IQ than a white man => our race is better. Even if you buy all the statements here it still doesn\u2019t make sense. If you care about IQ why don\u2019t you just separate people on this line? Race if anything is a set of genetic traits that differ between groups. You can pick different characteristics and call this \u201crace\u201d. Why we include skin color at all in our equation? What kind of an idiot would care about that? That\u2019s the issue with racists. They are just very violent stupid people who believe that cherry picked data shows a trend when even the basic goal makes no sense. ",

For example, if I say: Blacks are lazyJews are avariciousArabs are violentLatinos are rapistsWhites are Racist\u2026none of those statements are true. The problem is that when you try to make a sweeping statement about an entire racial group (inasmuch as race can actually be said to exist), you inevitably run into exceptions that make the sweeping statement untrue. The only way you can get around that problem is to make a statement that\u2019s so broad as to be practically meaningless, like \u201cBlacks breathe air\u201d or \u201cWhites eat food\u201d. At that point, the statement is true, but it\u2019s no longer racist. ",

            "answer_text": "A judgement made about a person\u2019s internal character because of a superficial appearance is an error of judgement. An error means wrong whether you believe what you believe is true or not. Race is a superficial apearance and an over generalization based mostly on hearsay information. Its ok to speak about truths, as far as you know them, but its not OK to speak falsely and negatively about people who have inherited a particular skin tone or eye color as if that is all you have to go on. It doesnt make a person less or more deserving of respect. Racism is more about right and wrong than truth and lie because racists believe what they say is true. ",
