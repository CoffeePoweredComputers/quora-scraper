            "answer_text": "Luck !!! In my dictionary luck is only have a meaning that is \u201cHARDWORK\u201d. Lucky are those who work hard and achieve there goals.  Wise person believe in hard work but weak & bovine person believe in luck. Luck only exist in our believe in our mind if you believe that you are lucky then you are,if you don't then you aren't. Once an American actor Patrick Duffy told \u201cGood luck happens to people who work hard for it. Sometimes people just fall into the honey pot, but I've consistently strived to create whatever good fortune I can get in my life - and consistently strive just as hard not to screw it up once I have it!\u201d.  Great word Strong people have guts so they work hard and achieve fulfill there dreams,weak people don't have guts so they simply makes excuses and say he or she is very lucky.  So, luck is only matter of hard work. What about hoax!!! I think hoax is not just as luck, but some people use it as the name of luck. Some people makes mischievous trick and played on someone for joke. People usually makes hoax related to bad luck and fool them.  Various posts on Facebook claim that you will suffer bad luck for a specified number of years if you do not click like and type amen. The posts feature images of people with injuries or serious health prosteal.  Along with the \u2018bad luck\u2019 threat, which is apparently taken seriously by a surprisingly large number of people, the messages imply that your \u2018like\u2019 and \u2018amen\u2019 will somehow help the pictured person. Some versions drive home the point by claiming that those who scroll down without participating must be heartless or cruel people who do not care about others.. Of course, these people care not one iota for the welfare of the people whose images they steal and make fun. And some people still believe this. This is so Ridiculous. Image source: google ",

            "answer_text": "In the sense that someone can have something unfortunate happen to them - absolutely. You would be okay to say \"I had some bad luck today\". Or if you have something fortuitous happen then that's good luck. However in the sense that there is some kind of a connection between any two instances of luck i.e to make the generalisation that you are \"an unlucky person\" - the answer is no. It implies that there is something regulating people's luck, other than random chance, which isn't the case. It's true that someone can be born into very unfortunate circumstances, in which case the chances of bad things happening to them are increased - you could say they were unlucky for that.  Also the inverse would be true for someone born into nicer circumstances. But this is still all just chance and probability - with a large enough sample of human beings you are bound to get some people who have more instances of good or bad luck than others. Any time you read into random events like this and draw some kind of conclusion, you are committing what is known as the Texas sharpshooter fallacy. The basic idea is that you are cherry picking examples to fit your conclusion, and ignoring examples which don't fit with that. A common example of this might be that you thought about a friend you hadn't seen in a while, then later on you saw them. Spooky eh? What is really happening here though is that you are ignoring all the many, many (many) instances you thought about someone and didn't see them later that day. All of the focus is on the one instance that did happen, which is basically just probability. Sit there thinking about people often enough and you are bound to see one of them at some point! So when you call yourself an 'unlucky person', it's likely that you are counting instances of bad luck while ignoring instances of good. A person's attitude can have a big influence on their luck. Some people are blamers, they will end up feeling that only bad things happen to them and there is nothing they can do about it. When in actual fact it's either that -  They ignore the positive and focus on the negative aspects of their life, when in reality everyone has good and bad things happen to them.They aren't trying very hard to change their life.They are actually the cause of their own suffering i.e they do not nice things to other people and act all surprised when bad things then happen to them in return.Possibly all three. For example you might think that you are someone who \"never wins competitions\", when actually you don't enter very many - so the chance of you winning is a lot less than someone who tries really hard and enters many different ones. From your perspective you only the see the instance of that person winning, rather than all the times they've tried and failed, and so you might end up thinking \"wow some people get all the luck\". As the saying goes \"you make your own luck\". ",
