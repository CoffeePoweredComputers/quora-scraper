            "answer_text": "Does metaphysical space exist? Thanks for the question. Metaphysics is defined as:\u201dthe branch of philosophy that deals with the first principles of things, including abstract concepts such as being, knowing, identity, time, and space\u201d. First principle of a modern human being is being conscious of your self. This is the first stage of consciousness development from animals,fish,birds,reptiles,plants and insects. We have been developing thru this stage for at least 50,000 years and are ready to move into a new density. We have become aware of knowing,identity,time and space from a three dimensional perspective. The universe and human beings are both multidimensional. We can only experience and understand our own consciousness from the deeper levels of mind within. As we meditate metaphysical space opens to our intelligence,imagination and intuition. The human body is made up of trillions of cells all working at their own pace but together as one for the body to support and relate to the spirit thru the mind. The human being exists but the space between each cell does not. A planet exists but the space between planets does not. From a three dimensional perspective space is what separates objects. From a metaphysical perspective space is full of light and love which both exist. Light to illuminate and support electromagnetic atoms and love to support desire and intelligence. I think metaphysical space can only \u201cexist\u201d within our conscious minds. ",

            "answer_text": "Existence is itself metaphysical. Convention, essence, ideality, and factuality exist between existence itself and appearance. We have four dimensions within. When younger, mystery predominates; fantasy prevails; all is potential. We develop faculties, each corresponds to aspects of existence. So, we develop minds and those differentiate into the faculties of body (being), soul (feeling), self (will), and mind (thinking). These form within personalities (becoming). All of these come from existence, or being. The personality corresponds to appearance, while the body does so to existence. From fantasies, faculties crystallize and become. Finally, personalities form which coordinate these. ",
