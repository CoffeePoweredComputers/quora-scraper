            "answer_text": "PROTEIN CONTENT OF HUMAN MILK VS. COW MILK  Cow milk is not healthy and the idea that cow milk is healthy is sold to us by the dairy industry. The image above shows the protein content of Cow Milk vs. Human Milk. The nutritional profiles are completely different. The casein protein in dairy converts into casomorphins in our bodies, which have effects similar to morphine[1] and are linked to sudden infant death,[1][2] diabetes [1], heart disease, and brain disorders.[3] Apart from casomorphins, actual morphine itself is also present in dairy.[4] These compounds likely play \"an important role in the mother-infant bonding mechanism, because infants may be 'addicted' to their own mother's milk.\"[5] Human milk (the perfect human food - refined over millions of years of evolution) is markedly different from that of other mammals in that it has the lowest protein content. Moreover, human-milk-casein is markedly different from cow-milk-casein in terms of structure.[6] CHANGE IN LEVELS OF SEX HORMONES IN MEN AFTER DRINKING MILK  All animal foods contain naturally-occurring sex hormones & their metabolites [7] like estrogen, progesterone and testosterone,[8][9] which are unavoidable (even with organic items).[7 ][10] Dairy is particularly concerning, because milk comes from pregnant cows when estrogen levels are markedly elevated by a factor of up to 33-fold.[11] Milk was found to increase estrogens in men and lower testosterone (see image above).[12] Contrary to popular belief, milk does not build strong bones. A study of a hundred thousand men and women followed for up to 22 years found that milk-drinking women had higher rates of death, more heart disease, and significantly more cancer for each glass of milk. Three glasses a day was associated with nearly twice the risk of death. And they had significantly more bone and hip fractures too.[13] On a final note, you will find that almost all the research studies that show that dairy is healthy have been funded by the dairy industry. And they use misleading tactics to distort the science. You can learn more about how the dairy industry twists the science here. TRY PLANT-BASED MILKS!  There are over 10 different types of healthy & delicious plant-based milks, like almond milk, soy milk, oat milk, coconut milk, hazelnut milk, macademia milk, cashewnut milk. Give them a try - I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find at least one that you\u2019ll love. My favorite is oat milk ;) SOURCES: [1] Wasilewska, J., Sienkiewicz-Sz\u0142apka, E., Ku\u017abida, E., Jarmo\u0142owska, B., Kaczmarski, M., & Kostyra, E. (2011).

            "answer_text": "As with every other food, the amount and the frequency matters. So does the genetics of the person consuming the food. Cow\u2019s milk from 100% grass fed cows can be healthy if consumed in relatively small amounts, infrequently. (A cup of milk once a week can be good for you). But, only if you have the gene which allows you to digest lactose into adulthood. If you don\u2019t, you shouldn\u2019t drink milk, of course. Frequent consumption of milk has been correlated with osteoporosis in Scandinavian countries. Whether causation is involved is not yet established, so it\u2019s best to play it safe by simply not making milk consumption a daily habit. Milk has long been associated with the opposite \u2014 providing calcium and strengthening bones \u2014 but it should be considered that this may be due to the supplemental vitamin D which is added to it in many places. There are better sources for calcium. Fermented dairy products are a different story entirely, and dairy as a whole shouldn\u2019t be considered in the same light as milk itself. (Fermented dairy products are generally healthy). Also, note that you should try to consume full-fat dairy products. We\u2019ve laid to rest the myth that animal fat is bad for the heart, but a great many people (including physicians) haven\u2019t yet gotten the memo. Full fat dairy products will make you feel full for longer, and you need to consume less of them to satisfy hunger. The type of fat in dairy is pretty healthy; stearic acid in butter is good for you. (The worst fats are hydrogenated oils and several of the vegetable oils). Obviously, watch your total calories, but avoid low-fat foods which can provide poor nutrition and often have added sugar or salt to make up for the lack of flavor caused by removing the fat. (And sugar is very, very bad). ",
