            "answer_text": "In one sense ethics is one of the branches of philosophy along with metaphysics, epistemology, politics, and logic. So just to run through these real quick; metaphysics is the enquiry into the permenant features of reality, epistemology is the study of knowledge, logic is the science of correct reasoning, ethics and politics both ask, how shall we live? While ethics asks how we should live as individuals, politics asks how we should live as a society. Other ones you might include would be aesthetics which is the enquiry into the nature of beauty; phenomenology which seeks to accurately describe reality but only insofar as it presents itself to consciousness, and the philosophy of human nature which is closely related to existentialism, which studies nature of the human mind, its relation to the body, and the meaning of life or lack thereof. I'm sure you can see how many of these overlap. Now, you can divide ethics, also refered to as the study of the good, in a few different ways. The first dichotomy would be rule based vs virtue based. Rule based ethics seeks to lay out specific rules that one can live by for any given situation. These can be further divided into teleological and deontological. The former seeks to create good outcomes that arise out of ones actions. For example, egoism says always do what\u2019s best for you, utilitarianism says always act so that the outcome produces the greatest quality of good for the greatest number, and altruism says always act to benefit others before considering yourself. Of course the problem here is no one knows exactly what the future holds. Thus deontological ethics seeks to find actions that are good in themselves instead of their expected outcomes. The most celebrated example of this is Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative, which basicly says act in ways that you could simultaneously will that act to be a universal law. So do not steal, do not lie, not because it would be bad, but because it wouldn't make sense if everyone always lied or always stole. Then you have Virtue based ethics, which seeks to pinpoint particular values that would create habits that one would live by, like honesty, or courage. The most famous example of this is Aristotle's Ethics. That's pretty much simplified ethics 101. Another view is that of the Italian Historicist Benedetto Croce who seeks to place ethics in its proper relationship to three other modes of historical viewing that together make up the \u201cengine of history\". This quadrant serves as a model that helps us learn from History; what he calls Ethico-Political History. In this model, ethics is secondary to economics, not in importance but in precedence. In other words you have to have good economics before you can have good ethics; thus as a general rule, you can't expect people to be good if a majority of them are without food or other basic necessities. This covers one half of the quadrant, the realm of action. The other half is made up of aesthetics and philosophy, and just as economics precedes ethics Croce believed that aesthetics (ie poetry, painting) precedes philosophy. So we as historical beings naturally frame the world in terms of beauty, passion, and awe before we move onto articulating our surroundings in more technical and compartmentalized ways. This theory is very similar to Martin Heidegger\u2019s views on thought, language, and poetry, only he attempts to go much deeper into that which precedes aesthetics, which he calls \u201cessential thinking\u201d. Anyway, this half of the quadrant is called the realm of thought. Taken together it serves as a dynamic model for looking into the past ethico-historically that one could argue is more sophisticated than the dialectical models of Hegel and Marx. ",

EpistemologyMetaphysicsAxiologyEthics is a category within the category of Axiology. Therefore, ethics is a type of philosophy. E.g., the scientific method is an epistemological theory unified with mathematics to make science. That is, science is 50% philosophy & 50% mathematics. There is no difference or similarity between philosophy and science or mathematics and science. There is no difference or similarity between philosophy and ethics. ",
