            "answer_text": "Briefly, the benefit of the Six Thinking Hats method is to consciously focus thinking about a problem or situation in different ways to generate different alternatives. This figure summarizes the concept:  The technique involves everyone in a group wearing the same \u201chat\u201d at the same time. So, everyone starts out wearing a white hat and thinking in an objective manner, considering only facts and figures, in a questioning approach. Next, everyone puts on their red hat and shifts to an emotional way of thinking, considering feelings, and not requiring any proof or facts to support their thoughts. The entire group goes through all six hats and records the thoughts, decisions, feelings, data, etc. associated with the problem/situation. From those results, focused analysis and decision making can take place. One benefit of this approach is that you avoid the situation where someone is presenting their thoughts in a logical, fact-based way and someone else presents an emotional, feeling-based alternative or counter-argument. Or having one person being positive/optimistic while someone else is thinking gloom and doom. It is difficult to reconcile alternatives when the basis of each is so different. While people may have different ideas and bases for their opinion, if the ideas are generated with the same mindset, disruptive arguments may be avoided. How can it be applied to a start-up? The technique can be used by organizations of all sizes and maturity levels. Start-ups may be comprised of young, opinionated, yet inexperienced team members. This tool can help focus the discussion about problems and help avoid unnecessary disruptive disagreements during the discovery phase of a decision making process. ",
