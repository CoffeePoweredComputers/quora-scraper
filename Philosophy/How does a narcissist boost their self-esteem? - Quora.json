            "answer_text": "A narcissist boost our self esteem by love bombing us. We lack in self esteem and the narc shows up throwing lots of attention on us and making us feel briefly better in ourselves. All fake of course. I can see it so clearly. I lacked big time in self esteem growing up with a malignant narcissist mother who shouted all the time and put me down when suited her. At 17 y. o I looked about 14 an uncle told me. It was true. Then later on my ex narc husband came along and swept me off my feet. I thought he truly loved me. I thought so because deep down i thought I was unlovable, fat, etc. I wasn't fat but these is how my parents bestowed attention on me telling me its for my own good to be told. Haha. So if I was raised in a proper loving family I would have never fell for an older, good for nothing, alcoholic, gambling narcissistic man. And the domino effect from that. I divorced him quick enough but some of the effects of the marriage lasted 18 years because I had a son for him. So yes love bombing us they make us feel better because we were broken when they met us ",

            "answer_text": "Chum. That is your answer. Chum in large quantities at the precise time it is most essential\u2026in the early tipping points moment when initial perceptions arc to common sense results. If the narc were an artist\u2026abstract artist \u2026he or she would be Picasso. Abstract art is highly subjective using the forth dimension of time to construct a reality. Narc\u2019s with their brush in hand, paint a reality they wish you to not just believe but in turn, be willing to suspend with disbelief. You must agree to be fooled. It your choice. To do so comes the chum. Chum creates a chemical reaction opening the floodgates to dopamine and serotonin. Pleasure flows like lies at a political convention. To the tactics and specifically how does the narc execute on this strategy one simply goes to what they discern you are after or what the narc has used previously with positive results\u2026or likely both. Sex\u2026? Its readily available. There awaits a buffet table of delights the narc can and will bring to bear. Narc women will envelope you in carnival acts of sex. They aim to please\u2026immediately\u2026instinctively instantly. Intellectual\u2026? They will readily speak to your bandwidth of knowledge and sacred wisdom. You will be seen as a first cousin of the Greeks and their Socrates and Plato. You are brilliant beyond comprehension. Ascetics\u2026? You are so handsome\u2026a grand array of good looks and style like no other\u2026or anyone every before. Your style is worthy of a new fashion statement where runways are your highway. Empathy\u2026[ triggers the hormone oxytocin\u2026the human connection chemical\u2026a joyful experience dynamic like feeling of love] this is tricky for to discern this fact creates opportunity. Here the narc tosses chum in the dark waters of their past. Why? Simply to see if you will offer flight or kindness\u2026or better\u2026 an emotional connection. If you hang around they toss more chum while stating how genuinely kind and thoughtful you are . More dark if not egregious stories follow. Self esteem is the problem and paradoxically the solution. If the narc is effective they will boost what requires at that moment boosting. The price for the boost is your soul. Sounds difficult if not impossible? It is but it is also true. If your self esteem is intact and requires no immediate boosting the narc will find no traction. No traction in the early moments and the narc is back on the streets. You are saved. If not, and you need a healthy boost the gauntlet awaits. Good luck and safe journey. Eric ",

They also boost their \u201cimage\u201d because they really have low self esteem and many suffer from depression also. My ex was always all over me in public because I have a little status and she wanted everyone to know. At home she turned into a noncaring selfish brat. ",
