            "answer_text": "I was once in a religion class or teaching ceremony to where I heard this story. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to tell it differently but I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll get the point across. Once there was a young boy who eagerly wanted a pet. Something to cherish and love. His mother agreed he could have a fish, so the boy went out and eagerly bought a small fish bowl, beautiful pebbles to adorn the bottom, and a castle that the fish to could swim through. He set it all up, eager for the fish to enjoy.Soon came the day to where the boy could buy the fish. He bought one and eagerly took it home. He put the fish in it\u2019s new tank and eagerly watched it. \u201cGo on,\u201d He told the fish. \u201cSwim through your castle. I bought it for you to enjoy.\u201dThe fish did nothing in response. It only stared back at the boy with empty eyes.The boy frowned, growing upset. \u201cFish, I bought you that castle for you to enjoy. Go play in it.\u201d He urged the fish once again. But still, the fish did nothing. The boy, upset, began to cry and yell at the fish. \u201cI don\u2019t understand! I filled your bowl with beautiful pebbles and I gave you a castle to play in! Why aren\u2019t you enjoying your gifts?\u201d The fish did nothing in response to his outcry. The mother, who overheard her son\u2019s distress, came in and asked her child what was wrong. The child explained how the fish had all of these wonderful gifts, yet wasn\u2019t using them like the boy had wanted him to. The mother very gently soothed her boy and explained.\u201cSon, you have to understand something very important. Just because you gave the fish all of these things, that doesn\u2019t mean he has to use any of it. You can not force the fish to do anything. He has to chose to do what he wants, and what he wants to do may be very different from what you want.\u201d God loves us all very deeply. His wish for us is to return back to him, so we may live in eternal love with him. That is his plan for all of us. But if God wanted all of us to go back to him, then how come some of us never do? God gave us all gifts. He wants us all to use them in a certain way. But just because we have these gifts, it doesn\u2019t mean we have to use them the way he wanted us to. They are gifts to us, and because we all have free will, we do with them as we please. It is our life. God does have a plan for all of us. He does want us all to do certain things and live a certain way. But that doesn\u2019t mean in any way he controls how our lives are lived. God cannot decide how we live our lives. We do. ",

            "answer_text": "From an Islamic point of view the question is easy to answer and hard at the same time. Easy= yes it is. What god has written is going to happen. The ink has dried and the only way to change it is to make prayer to god to change it. Or give to charity. Hard= The portion I wrote above makes no sense right. How has the ink dried if your fate can change. Before I go on I must mention free will. Yes muslims do believe in free will. And yes I and all of you do indeed have free will. Now that doesn\u2019t make sense. How can I chose the outcome of my life if everything that is going to happen has been predestined. You can ask the highest imams and the smartest alims (scholars) of Islam and they won\u2019t be able to give you a clear answer. The prophet was asked about this and he in summary said that do not dwell on matters that concern you not. All will be revealed after death. Indeed this idea of fate and free will is very hard to understand and I\u2019m sure I have and haven\u2019t answered your question. But in Islamic terms there is no answer in this world that can adequately answer your question. All I can say is that if you choose to fall off a building today and you chose that. Then you indeed did chose that. Whatever happens in his life is controlled by god in ways which we will never understand. And yet we try to. God is the all knowing and the all seeing. What you chose to do today is your choice. P.s I got a bit lost towards the end there.  enjoy Quora. ",
