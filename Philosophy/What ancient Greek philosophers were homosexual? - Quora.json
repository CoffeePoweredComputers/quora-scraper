            "answer_text": "The truth is that honosexuality in acient Greece was a condemened practice.Gay men would loose all political rights and were concidered outcasts and condemned.It was also forbidden for them to enter the temples . So no philosopher was homosexual or at least openly homosexual.Pederasty was the practice of mentorship between a juvenile and an older, wise man. It did not include,enforced or encouraged sexual relationships between them.Even if they occured in some cases,they most certainly were concenting and kept private. ",
