            "answer_text": "The standard axioms of mathematics are taken to be the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theeory. But for certain purposes, those axioms seem not to be suffcient: for instance, there are limits on how much such axioms can represent. For example, such axioms cannot allow the set of all sets, because a set of all sets would lead to a logical paradox like the famous Russell paradox (see below for a clarification). The great mathematician Alexander Grothendieck thus created a new axiom that would allow him to use these very large sets of sets of sets while still avoiding a paradox (his \u201cuniverses\u201d). But is it necessary? For what? Apparently, this is not necessary for ordinary mathematics, e.g. for something like Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem, which involves only finite numbers. This, however, is not easy to prove: only in 2010 a proof was given, proving that even less than the axioms of Set Theory suffices to prove Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem: Colin McLarty. What does it take to prove Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem? Grothendieck and the logic of number theory. The Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2010, pp. 359-377. The moral is that there is not a fixed agreemetn on what the axioms of mathematics should be--since there is no fixed agreement on what mathematics really is. ============================ Post-script: Suppose that we could collect all sets into a certain set S whose elements are precisely those sets that do not contain themselves. Does S contain itself? The answer can\u2019t be yes, because then by its own definition S doesn\u2019t contain itself. But the answer can\u2019t be no, either: If S does not contain itself, then it satisfies its own definition, so it does contain itself. So S contains itself if and only if it does not contain itself, a classical. contradiction! ",

            "answer_text": "There is not such a thing as the axioms of mathematics. The average mathematician takes ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel with the axiom of Choice) set theory as their preferred mathematical foundations, so they serve as the de facto axioms of all of mathematics, but these are far from the only axioms we could have used. Also, as mathematics gets more complicated, we may need to add additional axioms to extend ZFC.  ",
