            "answer_text": "It takes COURAGE! The problem with not telling the truth or excluding it is that, it always backfires to the one who committed it. It ties you with the endless feeling of guilt and bind you to a more destructive habit which if not worked through, will remain forever a barrier to your personal growth and development. It\u2019s not only that, it will always reflect in you. Even if you commit it only a few times, you loose or totally diminish your credibility and integrity. Once people lost their trust in you, it is always never get easily back making you a \u201cliar\u201d forever in their views. And that\u2019s what you don\u2019t want to happen. Telling the truth, though it\u2019s hard, due to he consequence you will reap takes courage. As M. Scott Peck said in his book The Road Less Traveled, \u201cCourage is not the absence of fear; it is the making of action in spite of fear, the moving out against the resistance engendered by fear into the unknown and into the future.\u201d Fear of the consequences is what makes us vulnerable in telling lies. Or sometimes, we are just not ready to face the truth and reality. But the more you prolong it, the more it will haunt you. Truth will always prevail and it\u2019s inevitable. So the earlier you tell the truth saves from you a more cruel and painful consequence brought on not only by the truth you have to face and also the lie you already made. How can you stop lying? It\u2019s a personal CHOICE and takes DISCIPLINE. Choice As M. Scott Peck continues in his book, \u201cwe must learn that the entirety of one's adult life is a series of personal choices, decisions. If we can accept this totally, then we become free people.\u201d Everyday we are offered different choices, easy and hard ones. Always telling the truth can be considered as belonging to the most challenging ones that requires a great deal of willpower. If you cansider yourself as a constant \u201cliar\u201d which means lying is almost as natural to you as breathing or walking or talking, then you might face a bigger challenge here. As you make a choice of always sticking to truth, you are not only making yourself use your most powerful asset given to you which is dishtiguishing the right and wrong ones but also can make you a better person morally and ethically. Which can turn, can make you a more reliable and trustworthy person. Discipline Quoting from the same book \u201cA life of total dedication to the truth also means a life of willingness to be personally challenged.\u201d Bad habits like \u201clying\u201d are harder to break but not impossible. For a start, you can start with the small ones. As you wake up everyday, remind your self that you would do everything in your power to always stick to the truth and do the right thing. Being aware of your lying habits, or the reasons and particular instances where you are more likely to lie is also important to be identified. Why do you lie? When do you lie the most? What are the things you always lie about? Who do you always lie to? Addressing your reasons and commiting yourself to stick to the truth can dramatically change and help you. As M.S. Peck suggests: \u201cSo What rules, then, can one follow if one is dedicated to the truth? First, never speak falsehood. Second, bear in mind that the act of withholding the truth is always potentially a lie, and that in each instance in which the truth is withheld a significant moral decision is required.\u201d Thus, by courage of telling the truth, making a choice of sticking to truth, and having the discipline to act on your commitments, can help you break this habit and escape this negative characteristic.

            "answer_text": "When I was in my late 20s, nearly 30 years ago, I came up with an idea that has served me well. At the first sign of feeling tempted to tell a lie, I ask myself why. And there\u2019s two general categories for the answer: either there\u2019s something about myself that I am uncomfortable with and I don\u2019t want other people to know about it, or there\u2019s something about myself that would be fine if it were up to me, but other people would not approve. If it\u2019s the first, then I came to a point where I realized I need to just let it be. I need to be myself, not apologize, not lie, not go out of my way to hurt others, but just be myself and let other people decide whether they like me or not, whether they accept me or not\u2026 in the second case, in which I think I\u2019m OK but the other person doesn\u2019t, then that\u2019s when it became clear to me those people shouldn\u2019t be in my life in the first place. Or if they need to be in my life, they need to start playing a lesser role. And I need to stop warring about what they think, which takes away the motivation to lie. Wanting to lie is the first sign that something is wrong. The question is what. If I truly need to change because I\u2019m on comfortable with who I am, then I should do it. If I\u2019m OK as I am, interpreted in whatever way seems reasonable and honest with myself, and other people simply don\u2019t like me, then I need to just let it go. Let those people be disappointed with me if they must. But be true to myself and be who I am. It requires some soul-searching. It requires accepting ourselves with some degree of compassion and tolerance. but if generally speaking we are living true to ourselves, we should no longer feel the need to lie. We should no longer feel the need to pretend we are someone other than who we really are. And if we find ourselves tempted to be someone else, we need to ask ourselves why. Either it\u2019s a sign we still need to work on ourselves, or it\u2019s a sign that we\u2019re trying to gain something from a relationship that is not necessarily healthy. And when the time comes that we\u2019re tempted to lie, we need to ask ourselves what is it about this other person that is tempting us to lie. Are we trying to pretend we are someone we are not? And what good is that especially in the long run ? The best strategy, in my opinion, is to become the best person we can be, and then let other people decide whether or not they want to be part of our lives as they respond to us for who we really are, not some false self.
