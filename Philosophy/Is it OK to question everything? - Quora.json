            "answer_text": "Yes. As a Pastor of almost 40 years I encourage people in our Church, and in our Community, to do just that. Doubt and questioning is a very normal human value that we too often negate. It begins as a toddler when we continually ask, \u201cWhy?\u201d Some Pastors and people in authority expect people to sit down, shut up, and take notes. I completely disagree. I think people should take a stand, speak out, and give me notes. I relish being questioned, and at times challenged. I\u2019m a better Pastor for those Character Building Moments. Life is too short not to seek out the truths that may allude you at the moment. Embrace the opportunity to question everything. Question the Bible, Question people in authority, question rules, question your doctor, question yourself. One of the greatest gift of God, or for some the human condition, is the freedom to question all things and arrive at a good place. When you do, question that, and see where you will be tomorrow. Blessings, Rev. D. Kent Deubner ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. Actually, it's really all about who and what is questioning and on what subject it's pertaining to. For example, if a 5 year old child is asking, yes it is okay. Why? Because children are like sponges, ready to soak up knowledge any chance they get anytime an adult cares to listen. When it's a partner: this is a yes and no. Yes because the person asking the questions wants to have a peace of mind, in order to build trust. No because if it's pertaining to something obvious, it can create anxiety and doubt that causes the person being asked to wonder why they'd be asking things that never was brought up before. For example, Wife: *about to wash dishes* Husband: \u201care you gonna wash the dishes? Shouldn't you have done that while you were cooking?\u201d ",
