            "answer_text": "The Qur\u2019an is by definition replete with contradictions because of the hermeneutical doctrine of \u201cabrogation\u201d [nasikh wa mansukh] which basically means that Allah gave a revelation to the prophet at one time and then later retracted that revelation and gave a new one - often the opposite of the previous one. This ambiguity allows each and every Muslim to have his own personal \u201cdivine guidance\u201d based on their personal preference. Those who like tolerance or want to present Islam as a tolerant religion can quote parts of the Quran that advocates tolerance, while the hardliners, the fundamentalists and even the terrorists can quote those parts of the Quran that foments hate and killing of the disbelievers. Therefore ironically everyone can find what he is looking for in the Quran! The Islamic scholars identify 2 major periods of revelations known as the Meccan and the Medinan. During the Meccan period when Muhammad was struggling to introduce his religion to the pagans the verses tended to be more peaceful and conciliatory, once he was finally expelled by the Meccans for incitement and migrated to Medina the verses gradually became more violent as his band of followers increased. The following are a sampling of quotes from the Qur\u2019an which illustrate this:\u2013 Mec. 2:256 There is no compulsion in religion Med. 9:123 Oh ye who believe! Kill the disbelievers and let them find harshness in you. Mec. 73:10 Be patient with what they say, and part from them courteously Med. 8:12 I will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers: smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger-tips off. Mec. 109:6 To you be your religion, and to me my religion\" 3:85 Whoso desires another religion than Islam, it shall not be accepted of him; in the next world he shall be among the losers.\" Mec. 20:103 Therefore be patient with what they say, and celebrate (constantly) the praises of thy Lord, Med. 2:191 kill them wherever you find them, and drive them out from wherever they drove you out Mec. 2:83 Speak good to men... Med. 9:5 Slay the idolaters wherever you find them Mec. 10:99 If it had been thy Lord's Will, they would all have believed, all who are on earth! Wilt thou then compel mankind against their will to believe! Med. 2:193 Fight them on until there is no more tumult and religion becomes that of Allah Mec. 50:45 We well know what the infidels say: but you are not to compel them Med. 9:14 Fight them, and Allah will punish them by your hands, cover them with shame, help you (to victory) over them, heal the breasts of Believers Mec. 29:45 Argue with people of the book, other than evil doers, only by means of what are better! and say, we believe in what has been sent down to us and sent down to you. Our God is the same as your God, and we are surrendered to Him Med. 9:29 Fight those who do not believe in God and the last day... and fight People of the Book, who do not accept the religion of truth (Islam) until they pay tribute by hand, being inferior\" Mec. 2:62 Those who believe (in the Qur'an), and those who follow the Jewish (scriptures), and the Christians and the Sabeans,- any who believe in Allah and the Last Day, and work righteousness, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. Med. 9:30 The Jews call 'Uzair a son of Allah, and the Christians call Christ the son of Allah. That is a saying from their mouth; (in this) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. Allah's curse be on them: how they are deluded away from the Truth! Mec. 6:108 and insult not (Revile not) those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest they out of spite revile Allah in their ignorance. Thus we made alluring to each people its own doings. In the end they return to their Lord, and we shall then tell them the truth of all that they did Med. 3:61 If any one disputes in this matter with thee, now after (full) knowledge Hath come to thee, say: \"Come! let us gather together,- our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves: Then let us earnestly pray, and invoke the curse of Allah on those who lie!\" Mec. 43:88,89 O Lord, these are people who do not believe,\u2019 Bear with them and wish them \u2018peace.\u2019 In the end they shall know their folly. Med. 47:4 When you meet the unbelievers, strike off their heads; then when you have made wide slaughter among them, carefully tie up the remaining captives. Mec. 50:45 We know best what they say; and thou art not one to overawe them by force. Med. 8:65, O Prophet! rouse the Believers to the fight. If there are twenty amongst you, patient and persevering, they will vanquish two hundred: if a hundred, they will vanquish a thousand of the Unbelievers Mec. 16:90 Allah commands justice, the doing of good, and liberality to kith and kin, and He forbids all shameful deeds, and injustice and rebellion: He instructs you, that ye may receive admonition. Med. 3:28 Let not the believers take for friends or helpers unbelievers rather than believers: if any do that, in nothing will there be help from Allah. except by way of precaution, that ye may guard yourselves from them. But Allah cautions you (to fear) Himself; for the final goal is to Allah Mec. 45.14 Tell those who believe, to forgive those who do not look forward to the Days of Allah Med. 8:60 Against them make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies, of Allah and your enemies.

            "answer_text": "What contradictions exist within the Quran? There must not be any contradictions in the Quran if you believe that it is from God- the same God Who has created the universe with the laws of precise equations of physics and mathematics. So, He must be equally capable of writing anything free of any contradictions or error. As such, God says in the Quran: \u201cDo they not then consider the Quran carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would surely have found therein much contradictions.\u201d (Al Quran # 4:82) But there are people who feel that there are contradictions in the Quran? In fact, the Quran is not meant for everyone. It is only for those who earnestly seek guidance, and like to change - change their prejudiced views about life, existence, and destiny; like to change their actions as well in accordance with the Quranic commandments. Intelligence is the adaptability to change, Stephen Hawking has said.  Historically, rich and privileged who systematically exploit the poor and vulnerable do not like any change because they make their gain out of the chaos; at any cost they don\u2019t like to come out of the comfort cocoon. Hence, instead of changing themselves, they try to change the Quran; they try to overrule, misinterpret it\u2019s verses. They also say that there are verses in the Quran which are abrogated, whereas none of the Quranic verses that exist in the Quran are ever abrogated. Prophets and messengers have always been persecuted in their hands savagely. One who realizes that goal and fulfillment of life on this earth is to serve God serving humanity - a life lived for others is a life worthwhile, as Einstein has said; the Quran is easy for him, meaningful, and a guidance for him. In Quranic language he is called a Muttaqi. The Quran says it is a guidance only for the Muttaqui: \u201cThis is a perfect Book; there is no doubt in it; it is a guidance for the \u2018MUTTAQUIN\u2019\u201d ( Al Quran# 2:2) So, for the Muttaquin the Quran is a very easy Book to understand, and a reminder; they don\u2019t find any contradiction in it. As such, the Quran says: \u201cAnd We have indeed made the Qur'an Easy to understand and remember: then is there any that will receive admonition?\u201d (Al Quran# 54:17, 54:22, 54:31, 54:40). But for those who are not Muttaquin, the Quran is a difficult book - full of contradictions; for these kind of people God has said that He has locked their hearts. \u201cAllah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment\u201d ( Al Quran # 2:7) And the verse: \u201cIn their hearts is disease, and so God lets their disease increase; and grievous suffering awaits them because of their persistent lying.\u201d ( Al Quran # 2:10) And the verse: \u201cBut as for those in whose hearts is disease, each new message but adds another [element of] disbelief to the disbelief which they already harbour, and they die while [still] refusing to acknowledge the truth.\u201d ( Al Quran# 9:125). These are the people who feel that the Quran is full of contradictions. ",
