            "answer_text": "Write an essay that provides a reasoned, sincere and well-supported argument in response to the essay question, drawing on the case. You may choose to write about truth in general or truth in a specific subject\u2014like mathematics, science, politics or journalism. If you do decide to write about truth in a specific subject, be sure to identify the subject in the opening paragraph of your essay. Your essay should advance reasons to help support your own conclusions about the question. The best essays will not simply summarize arguments put forth by others or make assertions, but will ask questions and make claims based on evidence and considered reflection. Strive to be consistent in your reasoning by testing your position against challenges presented by arguments that oppose your own point of view. For example, if thinking about a particular subject, you might ask: What makes a scientific theory or discovery true?What makes an interpretation of a text true?If one newspaper article says THAT a candidate for office said x, and another NEWSPAPER ARTICLE says that THE SAME candidate never said x, how can we know which is true?We do not require you to cite other sources, though you may. The texts listed below can be a source of information, but they can also be used to spur inquiry. If you decide to quote from the text, be sure to interpret the passage in your own words. Explain what you understand the philosopher to be saying and why what he or she is saying is important for your argument. For example, the philosopher\u2019s position might support, complicate or challenge your own response to the question. ",
