Here every second there are tremendous change .If you want to be live on the earth permanetly we must have to change otherwise we can\u2019t live in this period . We know that if we can\u2019t learn to face situation happily then we couldn\u2019t fix anywhere with root. If our roots are strong then we can do all these things easily . We know that huge trees also have to change with season when spring season comes they have to fall all old leaves & must have to bring new fresh leaves .So change is the rule of nature . ",

            "answer_text": "Multiple realities are part of one world-mind and by world mind, I mean all the thoughts of present and past humans. One must know that what we call consciousness is actually that, memory of the entire human race, so all forms of realities are essentially the same! The real misfortune is that all the realities are linked with the self individualized entity , the I and as long as it is there , the stranglehold of thought also stays!! ",
