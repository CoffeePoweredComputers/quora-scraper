            "answer_text": "Q. Is there such a thing as an \u201cobjective morality?\u201d Objective morality is the idea that at least some moral judgments are not just true according to a person's subjective opinion, but factually true.From https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mo... - -In very short answer, objective morals exist according to Theravada Buddhsim. - -Once, Australia, especially Tasmania, was a place to send convicts from British Colony. An estimated one in five Australians has convict ancestry. In Tasmania, the figure is even higher. In 2009, 74% of Tasmania\u2019s population was estimated to be descended from convicts. A 2001 Victorian parliamentary report on crime in Australia found that Tasmania had the second-lowest crime rate in the nation. (From Stain or badge of honour? Convict heritage inspires mixed feelings June 8, 2015A recent report in Molecular Psychiatry identified a \u201cwarrior gene\u201d connected to criminal behaviour. This inspired renewed speculation that a convict ancestry might make Australians more predisposed to violent crime.This fear of genetic contamination from convict ancestors has existed in Australia since early settlement. Between 1788 and the end of transportation in 1868, around 162,000 convicts were sent to the colonies of New South Wales, Van Diemen\u2019s Land and Western Australia.An estimated one in five Australians has convict ancestry. In Tasmania, the figure is even higher. In 2009, 74% of Tasmania\u2019s population was estimated to be descended from convicts.In 1856, Van Diemen\u2019s Land was renamed Tasmania in an attempt to purge its convict past.And the fear that we might be cursed with a genetic predisposition towards criminal behaviour? A 2001 Victorian parliamentary report on crime in Australia found that, adjusted for population, Tasmania \u2013 with the highest proportion of convict descendants \u2013 had the second-lowest crime rate in the nation.From https://theconversation.com/stai... ) - -Human beings are not blank slate. -If all human beings are inherently good, there is no question for inherently good or inherently bad because everyone will observe all human beings as inherently good since young. -If all human beings are inherently bad, there is no question for inherently good or inherently bad because everyone will observe all human beings as inherently bad since young. -So some human beings are inherently good and some human beings are inherently bad because people observe as such. -So what's the cause of inherently good or bad? -It is not genetic because if it is genetic, science will have discovered by now. -It is not genetic because one can observe that both inherently good parents can have inherently bad children. Likewise, both inherently bad parents can have inherently good children. -It is not environment because even the extremely poor parents with extremely bad environment can have inherently good children. Likewise, even the extremely rich family with extremely good environment can have inherently bad children. -But during the individual growth process (after birth), inherently good children are easier to become bad if they meet bad environment and bad influence. Inherently bad children are not easy to become good even if they meet good environment and good influence. -It is easier to become bad during the growth of children because it does not need much effort to do bad things and it needs much effort to do good. -It is harder to become good during the growth of children because it needs much effort to restrain from doing bad. -According to this philosophy, more and more bad people should appear in the world. Nature favors to appear the bad behaviors. If inherently good and inherently bad behaviors appear randomly, people would see inherently good and bad children in one to one ratio (half and half in population) in their childhood before the influence of environment. Or one should see more inherently bad children than good children in their childhood because nature appears to favor bad behaviors. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism (If one accepts Buddhism as truth, not as a religion), human life is hard to get. Those with good behaviors in past life can return to human life if they are not released from cycles of life because human life is one of good destination and one can work hard to release from cycle of life in human life. Those with bad behaviors in past life rarely come back to human life because human life is one of good destination. So if one who has previous life with good behaviors and the other who has previous life with bad behaviors competes for one human life, one who has previous life with good behaviors has more chance to come back to human life again. If he comes back to human life again, he will be inherently good because of previous habits. So according to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, people will see more inherently good children than inherently bad ones because human life is one of the good destinations. - Reference from Theravada Buddhism \u2026\u2026 Bhikkhus, with the coming together of three things a descent to the womb comes about: Here the mother and father come together. It is not the season of the mother. The one to be born does not attend Then there is no descent to the womb. Here, mother and father come together. It is the season of the mother. The one to be born does not attend. Then there is no descent to the womb. Here mother and father come together. It is the season of the mother and the one to be born attends. Then there is a descent to the womb. That mother protects the womb for nine or ten months with great anxiety and trouble. After nine or ten months that mother gives birth with great anxiety and trouble. She supports the born with her own blood. In the noble ones' dispensation mother's milk is called blood. Bhikkhus, that boy grows and his faculties mature and he plays games that boys play. Such as mock games as taking a bowl, turning somersaults, making toy wind mills with palm leaves, making small carts and bows. Bhikkhus, that boy, grows and his faculties develop and is provided with the five strands of sense pleasures, and he lives enticed by pleasing agreeable forms cognisable by eye consciousness, agreeable sounds cognisable by ear consciousness, agreeable smells cognisable by nose consciousness, agreeable tastes cognisable by tongue consciousness and agreeable touches cognisable by body consciousness.From http://tipitaka.wikia.com/wiki/M... - \u2026\u2026. \"Suppose a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water, and a great crowd of people, gathering & congregating, would pray, praise, & circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart (saying,) 'Rise up, O boulder!

Kamma is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness & refinement.\" \u2026\u2026.From Majjhima Nikaya, Culakammavibhanga Sutta - - -According to Theravada Buddhism, morality is one law of the nature. (Objective morality) -According to Philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, morality is better (less difficult and less troublesome, of greater fruit and of greater advantage) than to become a Buddhist. -In some Suttas from Theravada Buddhism, Gotama Buddha said that undertaking five precepts is less difficult and less troublesome, of greater fruit and of greater advantage than accepting guidance from Buddha (He who with trusting heart takes a Buddha as his guide, and the truth, and the Order). - \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..

And why not? Because at it beating with sticks takes place, and seizing by the throat. But they will go to the former, where such things are not. And therefore are such perpetual gifts above the other sort of sacrifice.''And is there, O Gotama, any other sacrifice less difficult and less troublesome, of greater fruit and of greater advantage than either of these?'\"the putting up of a dwelling place (Vihara) on behalf of the Order in all the four directions.''And is there, O Gotama, any other sacrifice less difficult and less troublesome, of greater fruit and of greater advantage than each and all of these three?'\u2018He who with trusting heart takes a Buddha as his guide, and the truth, and the Order -- that is a sacrifice better than open largesse, better than perpetual alms, better than the gift to a dwelling place.''And is there, O Gotama, any other sacrifice less difficult and less troublesome, of greater fruit and of greater advantage than all these four?''When a man with trusting heart takes upon himself the precepts -- abstinence from destroying life; abstinence from taking what has not been given abstinence from evil; conduct in respect of lusts; abstinence from lying words; abstinence from strong, intoxicating, maddening drinks, the root of carelessness -- that is a sacrifice better than open largesse, better than perpetual alms, better than the gift of dwelling places, better than accepting guidance.'From Digha Nikaya, Silakkhandha-vagga 1.5: Kutadanta Sutta (DN 5) - \u2026\u2026.. \"If one with a confident mind were to go to the Buddha, Dhamma, & Sangha for refuge, that would be more fruitful than...the gift, the great gift, that Velama the brahman gave, and (in addition to that) if one were to feed one person... 100 people consummate in view, and were to feed one once-returner... 100 once-returners, and were to feed one non-returner... 100 non-returners, and were to feed one arahant... 100 arahants, and were to feed one Private Buddha... 100 Private Buddhas, and were to feed a Tathagata(Buddha) \u2014 a worthy one, rightly self-awakened \u2014 and were to feed a community of monks headed by the Buddha, and if one were to have a dwelling built and dedicated to the Community of the four directions.\"If one with a confident mind were to undertake the training rules \u2014 refraining from taking life, refraining from taking what is not given, refraining from illicit sex, refraining from lying, refraining from distilled & fermented drinks that cause heedlessness \u2014 that would be more fruitful than the gift, the great gift, that Velama the brahman gave, and (in addition to that) if one were to feed one person... 100 people consummate in view, and were to feed one once-returner... 100 once-returners, and were to feed one non-returner... 100 non-returners, and were to feed one arahant... 100 arahants, and were to feed one Private Buddha... 100 Private Buddhas, and were to feed a Tathagata(Buddha) \u2014 a worthy one, rightly self-awakened \u2014 and were to feed a community of monks headed by the Buddha, and were to have a dwelling built and dedicated to the Community of the four directions, and if one with a confident mind were to go to the Buddha, Dhamma, & Sangha for refuge.\"If one were to develop even just one whiff of a heart of good will, that would be more fruitful than... if one with a confident mind were to undertake the training rules...\"If one were to develop even for just a finger-snap the perception of inconstancy, that would be more fruitful than the gift, the great gift, that Velama the brahman gave, and (in addition to that) if one were to feed one person... 100 people consummate in view, and were to feed one once-returner... 100 once-returners, and were to feed one non-returner... 100 non-returners, and were to feed one arahant... 100 arahants, and were to feed one Private Buddha... 100 Private Buddhas, and were to feed a Tathagata(Buddha) \u2014 a worthy one, rightly self-awakened \u2014 and were to feed a community of monks headed by the Buddha, and were to have a dwelling built and dedicated to the Community of the four directions, and with a confident mind were to go to the Buddha, Dhamma, & Sangha for refuge, and with a confident mind were to undertake the training rules \u2014 refraining from taking life, refraining from taking what is not given, refraining from illicit sex, refraining from lying, refraining from distilled & fermented drinks that cause heedlessness \u2014 and were to develop even just one whiff of a heart of good will.\"From Anguttara Nikaya, Velama Sutta ",

            "answer_text": "Consider the following. The existence of the soul, when it is finally confirmed by scientists in the laboratory, will be the proof morality is objective and always has been objective. To state it simply: The MORAL thing to do is also the SMART thing to do. Two seconds after some bunch of scientists builds a soul-detector and confirm the existence of eternal souls, they\u2019re going to look at each other and say: \u201cThis is why the concept of \u201cmorality\u201d even appeared in human behavior. What we have been calling \u201cmoral behavior\u201d is simply the rules by which eternal beings get along with each other.\u201d But the existence of eternal souls will have to be proven first. As justification for doing such an experiment, a coldly objective, rigorously rational theory for believing souls exist has to be constructed. This is actually quite an easy thing to do. Watch, and see how easy. The existence of eternal souls can be demonstrated in two ways. One: Directly, with the construction of a soul-detector and observing a soul leaving a dying body. I have reason to suspect the detection principle will be rapid variation in Planck\u2019s Constant. Two: Indirectly, from a purely theoretical analysis. There are two factors to consider. One: Observation of human behavior and Two: The necessity of keeping a Universe\u2019s sentients from blowing their Universe the Hell up. Until some fuzzy-headed scientist gets around to building a soul-detector, let me lay out the theoretical proof, and you can judge for yourself. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s easy. Absurdly simple. And would you like to live in a world where nobody is afraid to die? Where you personally are no longer afraid to die? It\u2019s only a single experiment away. Oh, by the way, the eventual result of the scientific confirmation of the existence of souls will be the complete and total destruction of all evil on Earth. See my story at the end. Life after death is real, the cold-sober scientific truth, the way the Universe works. Life after death is not a fiction or a fantasy. It is real, something vitally necessary in order for the Universe to be stable, mainly to keep the Universe\u2019s sentients from blowing the Universe the Hell up. On this one thing, the existence of the soul, those silly religious woo-woos are ABSOLUTELY right. Those moonbeam-dancing, ley-line-loving, crystal-worshiping, long-haired-hippie-freak woo-woos are totally dead-bang right. I can prove ALL of this---if you are smart enough to understand it. (Although intelligence really isn\u2019t the main problem, but rather the ability to think clearly and objectively. THAT is rare, even among scientists. THIS IS AN EASY PROBLEM TO SOLVE. Considered simply as an exercise in logic, the problem of the existence of the soul is entirely trivial.) I can prove it all by the best, most rigorous method the human race has ever found for finding the truth. The scientific method. Observation, hypothesis, and finally confirmation by testing in the lab. By building a soul-detector and detecting souls in the lab. The detecting principle, I suspect, will be rapid changes in Planck\u2019s Constant. You don\u2019t even have to use people. You can use cats. Why cats? Cat-soul dived through my chest once. Also, soul theory indicates the source of emotion is the soul, not the brain, and therefore any animal that shows emotion, in particular love, is an eternal being and has a soul. The observation and hypothesis parts I have solved. I\u2019d get the third one too, if I had the money. Alas, I don\u2019t. It would take a million bucks just to start. I continue to hope some bad-boy millionaire scientist or engineer will trip over my Quora answers one day. (You hearing this, Elon? Would you like to smash the whole damn world? I can show you how.) Let me give you the short version, then the long version. Rigorously objective analysis of human behavior reveals human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence, on quite a number of levels. Since human bodies are certainly not eternal, human beings MUST contain an eternally existing component, i.e. they must have souls. You might object something as weird as souls could only exist if the Universe had some EXTREMELY powerful need for them. You would be correct. There actually is an extremely powerful need for a Universe\u2019s sentients to ALL be eternal beings who have souls. It inhibits the sentients from destroying their Universe. If a Universe\u2019s sentients are NOT eternal beings, then the Universe logically becomes Hell. Because most sentients\u2019 lives are composed mostly of pain, and unless their existence was without limit, their pain, and their lives, would be completely meaningless. Live in Hell, and then die. Sentients would destroy any such Universe in a cosmic heartbeat. It would be the MORAL thing to do. And oh my, yes, all sentients possess the theoretical capacity to destroy the entire Universe, as one aspect of sentients is knowledge of how the Universe works, as in the ability to write down the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws and then use those laws to change the Universe around them as they see fit. Stephen Hawking embodied the entire situation perfectly. If anybody understood the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws, it was Stephen Hawking. If anybody suffered at the hands of the Universe, it was Stephen Hawking. (Return to us quickly, Stephen. We need your mind.) And waddya know, Stephen Hawking found a way to destroy the whole damn Universe. With a flick of his little finger. He has pointed out the Higgs field exists in an excited state, and that the existence of all the Universe\u2019s particles depend on the Higgs field remaining in that excited state. So, because the Higgs field exists in an excited state, the Universe contains a fundamental instability which can be used to destroy it. If the Higgs field ever drops to its ground state in any particular area, all the Universe\u2019s particles in that area will promptly disintegrate. And from that area the drop in energy (and therefore disintegration) will spread, exactly like dropping a spark into gunpowder. And the entire Universe dissolves back into the Chaos it came from. So all we have to do is build a machine that will catalyze the drop of the Higgs field to its ground state. We will only have to use it once. We punch the button\u2014-and poof, no more Universe, at the speed of light. Remember, if we all are not eternal beings, we all live in Hell, and this is the moral thing to do. The odds are pretty good the human race is NOT the first sentient species to evolve in the Universe, but no sentient species has ever actually done this. The Universe is still there. I hereby conclude this Universe\u2019s sentients are eternal beings, and there is a way to detect souls in the laboratory. That\u2019s the short version. Now the long version. Here is an essay which explores this Universe-destruction thing further. This is the rock-bottom of it all. It\u2019s ALL about keeping the Universe in one piece, man. ON THE SENTIENT CONSTRAINTS OF A SENTIENT-CONTAINING UNIVERSE http://www.theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/02/on-sentient-constraints-of-sentient.html Now an exploration of the various ways human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence. (This is by no means all the ways.) If human beings possess immortal souls, it should be possibly to logically deduce this by objective analysis of their actions. It should be possible to show in your own personal actions. It should be possible to show you ACT like you have a soul, even when you think you don\u2019t. THE MURDER ON A BEACH THOUGHT EXPERIMENT http://theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/12/murder-on-beach-thought-experiment-on.html It should be possible to demonstrate the rule exists in collective action. It should be possible to demonstrate the assumption of eternal existence exists in the foundation rules of the world\u2019s stable societies, although they may not be aware of it. ON EMOTION DRUGS http://www.theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/02/on-emotion-drugs.html The physical purpose of souls is stability. So it should be possible to demonstrate denying or removing the assumption of eternal existence results in extreme personal pain and extremely violent instability. AND NOTHING HEARD MY SCREAM http://theninepointfivetheses.blogspot.com/2007/05/and-nothing-heard-my-scream.html And now one last stinger. This is for the REALLY smart people out there. The existence of souls is currently perceived as mostly an academic debate. Something that won\u2019t make much difference one way or the other. It is not. The confirmation of the existence of souls will cause the most profound change in human behavior there has ever been. This will be a scientific discovery that will cause a change in humanity\u2019s MORAL behavior, as people will finally understand it is impossible to escape the consequences of your actions. Let me illustrate this with a story. A scientist builds a soul-detector, IMMEDIATELY detects souls\u2014-and smashes the entire world. The total and permanent destruction of all evil on Earth begins as the good guys are finally cut loose. Because science has now proven the MORAL thing to do is also the SMART thing to do. AFTER THE AWAKENING https://futurism.media/after-the-awakening This story is the future, what\u2019s about to happen, right around the corner. The Awakening is coming.
