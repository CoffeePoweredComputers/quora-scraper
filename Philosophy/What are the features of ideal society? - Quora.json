            "answer_text": "An ideal society would have me as its king. Crime would be punished in accordance with the \u201ceye for an eye\u201d Old Testament principle. Laws would be passed to ensure free competition in the market and that owners, including shareholders, pay for all harm they do. I would also seek to reduce the global population by limiting reproduction and making reproductive rights contingent on one\u2019s contribution to the society. Own an honest business, get the right to have a child. Break the law by stealing, lose that right. We humans can have an ideal society with far fewer people and reducing the population will provide a number of environmental benefits as well as reduce the scarcity on our world. ",

            "answer_text": "First, this ideal society would have great healthcare for everybody \u2014- at no cost \u2014- or at least at a means-tested sliding scale co-pay that all could afford. France has this, England has something like this, Sweden does, Denmark does, and Finland has reasonable co-pays. Last week, I had to go to a specialist for a endoscopy. My co-pay was $250. I am a 66-year-old retiree on Medicare. I never have that much money left at the end of the month. They took $50 and promised to hold my feet to the fire for the rest. ",
