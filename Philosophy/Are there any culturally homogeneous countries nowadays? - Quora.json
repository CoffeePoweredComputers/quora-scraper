            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think that there ever were totally homogeneous countries, most countries have/had different tribes and trade, which led and leads to wealth, and always gave heterogeneity. It\u2019s really a question of how you define \u201cculture\u201d, remember that nationalities are a concept invented in the 19th century. Japan has been pretty isolated in the past and hasn\u2019t so many inhabitant. However there are Japanese Metal bands, Jazz groups and others, Hayao Miyazaki produced Heidi, THE Swiss cartoon. I\u2019d look into countries with few immigrants, often those are also poor countries, List of sovereign states and dependent territories by immigrant population - Wikipedia those might fit your definition of a homogeneous culture. So North Korea, China or Madagascar might be pretty homogeneous, but if you look at the size and peoples in China you\u2019ll realize that few immigrants is far from guaranteeing a homogeneous culture.
