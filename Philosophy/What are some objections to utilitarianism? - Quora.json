            "answer_text": "There are several forms of utilitarianism, for example rule and act utilitarianism.  But first, let's have a look at utilitarianism itself. According to utilitarianism, we should do whatever creates the largest amount of happiness and avoids the largest amount of pain. This leads to several problems already, is happiness the most important (and only) thing we want? What about other feelings we can have? Should we always try to maximize our happiness at all times of the day? This will lead to a whole other discussion, I suggest we focus on the unethical consequences of following utilitarianism.  Lets look at some examples:If we should only do the acts that lead to the greatest amount of happiness we will find some objections: It can lead to injustice:If there is a criminal on the loose, say a murderer, and people are starting a riot to try and catch this person - it could be the right thing to do to prosecute an innocent person, without their knowing of its innocence, to stop the riots and make these people happy. After all, the amount of happiness increases on balance. It can lead to a lot of dog shit in your own garden:Imagine you live in a street, and each house on that street has a dog. Instead of pooping in your own garden, everyone should poop in just one person's garden. Everyone's happiness counts higher than that one person's unhappiness/pain - and thus is the right thing to do is to shit in someone else's garden instead of your own. It lacks ethical depth:If you can save 2 persons from drowning, your own child or a very important person it could mean, according to utilitarianism, that you should save that important person because you avoid most pain. Even if it means saving your own child, and this seems very unrealistic for most, if not all, people. You would even be questioned your love to your child, and considered being irrational or whatever. It can be too demanding:If it means that if you donate all your money to charity, say Oxfam Novib, leads to the greatest amount of happiness: you should do this. A lot of people find this too demanding. It allows for murdering/torture:If you find yourself in the situation that you could save 10 lives by killing one person, you should do that. The same counts for torture: if you can, by torture, find out where a hidden terrorist bomb is placed - you can save the lives of many people around that bomb by preventing it. This is something considered unethical by many people, but is also viewed as something that could be really the right thing to do. This theory allows such things unlike deontological theories - and they will find this wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "There's a few pretty good arguments for why it's problematic, but some pretty decent rebuttals that the utilitarian can use in response as well. To preface, we will use the definition of utilitarianism that sees the most moral action as the one that produces the greatest good for the greatest number. 1. It doesn't respect rights. Imagine you were a doctor tasked with saving three people in need of transplants; one needs a liver; another needs a heart; and another needs a kidney. In comes a particularly healthy man for a checkup who just so happens to be a match for those three people. A utilitarian response might be to kill the healthy guy, to save the other three. But that doesn't seem right. We might argue that this man has a right to life which is more important to respect than the good his organs might do. Since utilitarianism ignores these rights it must be a wrong (or at least incomplete) theory on what it means to be moral. R1A) The utilitarian might respond that those \"rights\" are as Jeremy Bentham put it, \"nonsense on stilts\". In order for us to accept this argument we need to make an argument for why these rights should be taken seriously in the first place. If we can't say anything other than \"it just seems right\", perhaps Bentham is correct in criticising them. R1B) The utilitarian might also say that those rights are consistent with utilitarian considerations as well. And a foresighted consideration of the consequences would be compatible with both utilitarianism and the idea of rights. For example, you could say that violating the right to life in the example posed in 1 would mean that a culture of suspicion of doctors is created, and people are afraid to get checkups as a result, and thus killing more people. Hence a farsighted utilitarian who wants to maximise happiness in the long run would still respect these rights. This is called Rule Utilitarianism and it's champions include John Stuart Mill. RR1B) These rights are still contingent on their utility. What if they stopped being useful? What if you could kill that healthy man without anybody knowing, and there were no other negative consequences? A rule utilitarian might still hold that these rights will ALWAYS give the better outcome, but how would we justify that? Additionally this goes against our common sense inclinations to think that rights are things that should be respected regardless of the outcome they might produce. 2. It is difficult to differentiate between pleasures and difficult to measure them. Some people like Mozart, others like Nickelback. Some people define others by their net worth, others define them by their contributions. On what basis can we make the argument that certain pleasures are better than others? We might feel inclined to say that the pleasure from intellectual stimulation is better than, say, snorting cocaine, but assuming they both produce the same amount of happiness can we really say that one is better than the other? Then let's take the problem of how much a human life is worth. In monetary terms how would we go about to define the worth of a human life? You could meticulously sum the aggregate of all the pleasure a person produces, and how much pain, and assign it a dollar value, but then we would still have to ask the earlier question on whether all forms of happiness are equal. R2A) Both these questions are formidable challenges to the utilitarian but I don't think it totally undermines it's core ideals if we can find a good way of answering them. Bentham, for example, would've made no differentiarion between \"pushpin or poetry\" pushpin being a child's game, and hence all happiness (of the same intensity) would be equal. And although trying to estimate a person's worth might prove very difficult, it is no less possible to do given enough time. There's even a neat little formula Bentham came up with (search felicific calculus) to calculate the happiness that an action would produce. There are obviously some very difficult challenges to the utilitarian and these questions go much deeper than what's discussed above. But I think it's very important to ask how can we even justify a utilitarian code of ethics to begin with? If somebody told me that the most moral action is the one that maximises pain. How could I say that he's wrong? Of course humans have preferred pleasure over pain for centuries, but perhaps humans have just been wrong for centuries. How do I argue against that? This isnt just a challenge for utilitarianism but for all normative moral theories; to justify how they have arrived at their ideals. But that's a discussion for another day. ",
