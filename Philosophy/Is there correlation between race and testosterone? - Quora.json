            "answer_text": "There are differences but they\u2019re not really substantial. There\u2019s also differences in terms of estrogen. Western Africans tend to have higher levels of testosterone but also have the highest levels of estrogen. Hormones are all about the balance between them, too much of one and not enough of the other can lead to reall issues after all it\u2019s hormones that dictate whether you are male or female. They\u2019re seriously powerful things that people do not consciously think about. I\u2019ve seen another answer here state that black men have the highest levels of testosterone and this is what leads them to having deeper voices and a more muscular physique. This is a very basic understanding of the genetics of it all. For one thing grouping all Africans into the category of \u201cblack\u201d is a really silly thing to do when discussing genetics it drives me insane just as the term \u201cwhite\u201d does. The reason that specifically Western African men appear to have more muscular physiques is due to the fact they\u2019re more likely to have higher numbers of fast twitch muscle fibres as opposed to slow twitch. Fast twitch fibres are larger which is what gives the more muscular appearance and they are used for generating power and speed but they also require more oxygen and tire faster. Slow twitch are the muscles used for endurance. It\u2019s why grouping all Africans into \u201cblack\u201d is stupid, the difference between those of Eastern African origin and Western African origin is drastic and there\u2019s a reason why the best sprinters in the Olympics typically have a Western African origin and the best endurance athletes have an Eastern African one. The difference in the levels of testosterone between each populations seriously not large enough to bring about such drastic changes in physique and appearance it\u2019s far deeper than that. ",
