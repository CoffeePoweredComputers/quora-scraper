If a child believes they are \u2018grown up\u2019 then the only solution is to ask them to live. Another writer mentioned that friends don't risk accommodating disrespectful friends\u2026this is true. My 18 year old son, has of late being so disrespectful, shameless in how he behaves towards me and the 's younger siblings plus he has a bad case of \u2018entitlement\u2019. He can take anyone anything without flinching at any time and expects not to be questioned overy it. Shortly after this behaviour started; we soon realised that worthy items like mobile phones, perfumes, money, lay tops and anything of value has disappeared from the house\u2026.of course he denies knowledge of such, until I was forced to involve the police. All of a sudden, I became a birch, useless evil mom for involvin the cops. He threatened us to no end\u2026items continued disappearing. To cut the longest story short; I had to use the cops to arrest him but I gave him a choice of being arrested or packing and leaving my house under police watch\u2026.he choose to leave the house\u2026. To say I have been so relieved and at peace since he left is an under statement. In as much as I pray that nothing bad happens to him out there; I hope that he reflect's and come to his sense and do something worthy with himself for himself, one day. I know the family friends who are accommodating him but I have told them it will take time for me to heal enough to face him again anytime soon\u2026. He had driven me to near depression cliff\u2026.

            "answer_text": "Build your relationship with that child/young adult by going out with them on parent/child dates. Don\u2019t spend a lot of money as though you\u2019re treating them. Spend a lot of time as though you care about your relationship with them. Teens have so much brain development, hormone instability, worry about college and career, and self-esteem related issues that all that can result in surly behavior within the family. What they need is an investment of attention, respect, empathy, asking for their help, knowing you have their back, and otherwise attentive parenting.  Be ready with the name of a really well vetted, experienced counselor specializing in adolescent psychology and able to do family counseling too. Let them know you miss having a better relationship with them and want to work on it together. Ask them what\u2019s going on. Don\u2019t do this at home, but sitting out in nature in an unrushed situation, over a latte at a park or quiet coffee shop, at the beach, at a cabin where you go for a weekend away, on a long drive where there isn\u2019t much traffic, or on a long walk after dinner or on the weekend. If they express distress or depression, offer them the counseling. If they complain about the family being messed up, offer to get everyone to family counseling to work it out. The way you respond to this issue will be the model you\u2019re giving them for parenting your grandchildren. They\u2019re almost out of the nest, so make it a good model they\u2019ll remember and replicate when the time comes. ",
