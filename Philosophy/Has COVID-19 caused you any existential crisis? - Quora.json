This thing of covid19 now simply waits to die. All of the strength to infect all of humanity. No one truly knows. Young men are beginning to kill themselves off by suicide now. The horror of this is they ignore the calls to wait and even suffer and yearn for death. Life and or death are really very flimsy now. The chance of life must be respected. A world dead of all animals includiung humans is sort of weird to consider. Will the birds die off also. Picking at the dead remains they do have a similar body chemistry. Turtles and whales and even penguins well without the help the penguins will suffer the loss of their own continent as that gets smaller and smaller. Soon enougfh the atlantic ocean will flush over the gulf of mexico to wash away the last barriuer which is similar to panama just to join with the pacific tides. Who is safe no one is safe. Reality and life will leave every single individual\u2019s body at some date. Humans have now become weak and the ability to war is gone and replenishing lost soldiers is also gone and healing the injured who will all be covid19 carriers will be impossible. We spent unfortunatelyu too much time on killing each other off instead of ungrading humanity, we have trashed all of humanity and also your cat dog and bird. Mice and rats do get the last feast. uneventful. they will die also because they were never learned enough to understand that 5 foot 1.8 meter of DNA strand. Time for bed and tomorrow the tomorrow of mine. Explain to reduce most of my helpful medications and see how my own doctor grasps that idea. ",

            "answer_text": "Has COVID-19 caused you any existential crisis? I am aware of the finite nature of life. Seriously, none of us lives forever. This virus has created a situation where I was forced to change some of the things I do to work towards my personal goals. In the process of doing that I am fairly certain I am making a difference in the fear associated with this NOVEL VIRUS. Prior to this virus the US (at least in my lifetime) has had a health crisis reported to us in the way this one has. Personally, I am listening to what the health experts target for \u201cthe expected\u201d is suppose to be. What I am seeing is that we are coming ever closer to those realistic numbers\u2026 Now that we have some data The economic numbers are showing the same trend. When you go from a projection of millions of deaths to the actual number roughly 1/10 the size without therapeutics of vaccines (which is a big fear reliever to many in the US) I would say we are doing fine. Personally I have had very little interaction with the healthcare system (which I term the sick care system) in the US. The reason being is I spend a lot of time learning ways to live life that promote good health naturally. I rarely even take an over the counter pain reliever. When I do get sick ,which is rare, I isolate myself and get better. This virus is unique in the fact that the public health response was everyone must do what I normally do only when I am sick. That is highly unusual and really IMO opinion might make the spread worse. Since we the people are not being allowed to do what we do based on our own medical history. For example, my parents (in their 80\u2019s) are isolating more and we their family are taking extra precautions around them. If everyone is wearing masks in public building people cannot take the precautions to give people space because all the healthy people appear to be sick. That is just a thought, but most of us know the common sense principles of the CDC guidelines for not spreading a virus we may have. We have known that all of our lives and do it in everyday practice. In the end this year is very strange, but we will get through it with some major dings created by the public health response to this virus. I really think that response is getting to the point where the slowing of the spread of this virus has caused issues far greater than the virus itself. ",

            "answer_text": "I find very interesting so many responses saying that the crisis has not affected them. We are not even done with it. I\u2019m positive, I keep myself always busy and motivated; I enjoy every minute (almost), and still, I think I have had serious moments of existential crisis during the pandemic. An existential crisis could be defined as those moments when we question the meaning of our lives, our purpose, or value, and how negatively impacted we could be by, let\u2019s say, the threat of such an insignificant (in terms of size) particle as the Coronavirus. Corona is not even an organism; I wonder if it is a parasite or a predator. Contemplation is the best gift of a crisis, and we have had enough time to contemplate on what the heck we were thinking by living our lives without those considerations. And we still have more time in front of us to keep taking advantage of a crisis. Whether we want to see it as one or not, the world is in crisis. Period! I have not only questioned my value during this time, but I have questioned so many things that I thought were important, just to realize that they are not. I\u2019m not seeing the \u201ccrisis\u201d as a moment of panic or depression or defeat, but as an opportunity to reevaluate life and what matters. Haven\u2019t you? I have been really impressed by how fragile we are, how dependants of others we are, how abusive we have acted towards so many things. How much we take for granted! How amazingly interesting life on earth is, constantly fighting for survival and equilibrium. Are we getting any? it actually seems as if we are losing it, right? Maybe because our expectation of us reigning this planet is in jeopardy. Is the planet really ours? For about 100 years, the scientific community has been changing the definitions of what viruses are. First, they were seen as poisons, then as life-forms, then biological chemicals; now there is an agreement that viruses are a gray area between living and nonliving: we know they cannot replicate on their own and that they need our cell in order to do so, and in that pursue, they affect the behavior of our cells profoundly. They could even kill us in order to reproduce. And they could win the battle. They could eliminate our existence on the planet. But the interesting thing is that even when they are not winning, we are losing!!! And then, we don\u2019t even know who to blame, how to solve it, and if there are suggested ways, there are forces that oppose. Do we really want to live, how we want to live, or do we only need to believe we are \u201csuperior\u201d? So many contradictions, so much pain, so many questions, not enough answers, not enough external or internal resources to solve a viral flu! Isn\u2019t this a good time to stop for a \u201cmoment\u201d to make us think who we really are, and to understand our existence? ",

            "answer_text": "When they first started talking about COVID19 in mid-March. I got sick the next week. I have never been this sick and it was just the beginning of the throat swabs. My doctor scheduled for me to be tested and it came back negative. I still quarantined myself from everyone else, especially my parents. I wasn't getting any better but I wasn't having bad respiratory issues. My breathing was labored but I had a nebulizer. I woke up and I felt fine after a month. I was finally out of my room. Getting my groove back so I thought. A week later I couldn't walk. Every muscle in my body hurt. It was like I lost all my strength and I couldn't eat, I was in quarantine again. I looked awful. So I go for another COVID19 test this time the nose swab and you got the results in 15 minutes. I was half dead in my stepfather\u2019s truck it was a drive up. The the line was unbelievable, It was really hot and you had to have a mask on and the windows rolled up. I felt like crying but I made it through. It was a very unorganized and sketchy testing area. So I had to swab both nostrils as far as I could for 24 seconds. I Waited test came back negative. I was so sick for two and a half months. I was quarantined for 2.5 months. I somehow had strep throat and I was put on antibiotics and after a few days of that, I started feeling better. Well, I have not been the same since I got the?? Sickness. I had to have a hysterectomy because my uterus was growing large fibroids. That in itself was a nightmare. It was results after my procedure. After sleeping do two days I woke up looking like Humpty Dumpty. I have gained about 15lbs in a short period of time. I have GI issues that I have to see a specialist for. So I do believe I had Covid 19. It leaves permanent damage. My eyes are always blurry, fatigued. I experience joint pain mostly in my knees. It's awful. I'm determined to have a good year. It has been seven years. ",

            "answer_text": "Has COVID-19 caused you any existential crisis? Pandemics and disasters could be reminders from God due to our disobedience because the most consistent and the most re-iterated teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam teach blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience. Deuteronomy 11:26-28 \u201cSee, I am setting before you today a blessing and a curse, the blessing if you obey the commands of God that I am giving you today; the curse if you disobey the commands of God and turn from the way that I command you today\u201d. Deuteronomy 32:46-47 \"he said to them, Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law. They are not just idle words for you\u2014they are your life\u201d. Deuteronomy 28:2-6 confirms and reiterates the same message \u201cAll these blessings will come on you and accompany you if you obey God: You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country. The fruit of your womb will be blessed, and the crops of your land and the young of your livestock\u2014the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks. Your basket and your kneading trough will be blessed. You will be blessed when you come in and blessed when you go out\u201d. Deuteronomy 30:15-16 \u201cSee, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and destruction. For I command you today to love God, to walk in obedience to him, and to keep his commands, decrees and laws; then you will live and increase, and God will bless you in the land you are entering to possess\u201d. Deuteronomy 30:19 \u201cThis day I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you that I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now choose life, so that you and your children may live\u201d Deuteronomy 10:12-13 \u201cwhat does God ask of you but to fear God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to observe the LORD's commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good?\u201d. The same consistent teachings are also confirmed in Deuteronomy 7:12-16, Deuteronomy 11:13-15, Deuteronomy 15:5-6, Leviticus 26 Qur\u2019an 7:96 And if only the people of the cities had believed and feared Allah, We would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth; but they denied [the messengers], so We seized them for what they were earning.\" Qur\u2019an 30:41 teaches that Evil and the curses are the results of disobedience. Jesus taught that when we obey God and do good works; we will pass the test of this world and will become qualified to receive God\u2019s rewards in heaven In Matt 5:13-16, Jesus taught that the believers should act as the salt to protect against corruption and as a light to guide others to the truth The same is also written in mark 9:50 and Luke 14:34-35 In Matt 7:13-14, Jesus warned those who follow the majority \u201cEnter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it\u201d. Most people ignore that teachings and say, \u2018As long as I am with the majority, I should be fine\u2019, but they are wrong according to the teachings of Jesus in Luke 13:24-27, Matthew 7:13-14 In Matthew 22:35-40, Jesus confirmed the teachings of the Old Testimony like Deuteronomy 6:5 and Leviticus 18:4-5 Mark 12:33 teaches: And to love one\u2019s neighbor as himself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices What Jesus taught here is not different from the wisdom taught by the old testimony Hosea 6:6 \u201cFor I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings\u201d. Luke 12:16-21 is a parable to warn most people who treasure for tomorrow while turning a blind eye to the hungry people we see everyday. John 12:25 warns those who like to \"live it up\" urging them to prepare for the eternal life. The same is also confirmed in Matthew 10:39 and Matthew 16:25 The same is also mentioned in Luke 9:23-25, Mark 8:34-35 Matthew 13:44 teaches us to give everything to obey so that we get God\u2019s rewards for the righteous James 4:1-5 also warns those who compete to enjoy the pleasures of this life Luke 6:27-36 and Matthew 5:38-42 set the high standard for wise dealing with others; such teachings would replace hatred by compassion and would transform earth into a paradise. Matthew 7:12 reminds us of the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d, the common ground wisdom taught by all wise teachers and prophets. Matthew 6:24 urges us to shift from the material life into a spiritual life. Matthew 12:50 teaches that the real family of the prophet are the obedient believers. \u201cFor whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother\u201d. Luke 6:46-48 teaches that solid faith foundations are based on obedience to the teachings. The same is also taught in John 14:15 and John 14:21 \u201cIf you love me, you will keep my commandments\u201d. John 14:21 \u201cThey who have my commandments and keep them are those who love me; and those who love me will be loved by my Father, and I will love them and reveal myself to them\u201d In Matthew 25:31-45 Jesus described the final judgment as being based on good works; he clarified that those who obey the law will be saved.

Sometimes I would go to a party or do something to numb my mind from the big scary questions, the fear, and the entirely empty feeling I had. At the time, I was relatively popular, surrounded constantly by friends, and yet I felt completely and utterly alone. Especially in those middle of the night moments. At one of the most despairing points of my life, in my second year of college 8 years ago, an ex friend randomly called me. We had stopped hanging out a year prior because she had gotten a new boyfriend who was addicted to drugs and she had basically turned crazy. But this one day, she called me, and reluctantly I answered. She began by crying and apologizing for everything bad she had ever done since middle school. She told me about her life. She sounded happy. I was, for a moment, jealous that she was so happy. Why did she deserve happiness? After we both talked for a while, I mustered up the courage to ask what had changed in her life. She mentioned she had joined a church. That word made me recoil, that was the last thing I was interested in. She invited me to hear her speak at a baptism. I didn't want to go, but part of me felt guilty and like I owed it to her because she had supported me all throughout middle school and high school at games I cheered at, and at plays I had acted in. She was there for everything. So, reluctantly, I agreed to go. I went and arrived there early, with the intention of not talking to anyone, not even making eye contact. I was too intelligent for a church, I didn't need to be part of a church, or any kind of organized religion of people I thought to be brainwashed. However, as I sat in what was a mostly plain room, alone, I felt a strong almost forceful feeling of peace that I could not find through any yoga session or trance music or anything else the world had to offer me. And as people filtered in, I saw happy families. I saw couples that treated each other with love, and children that (though still fidgety) were respectful and had love in their hearts for one another. I saw happiness. Not the happiness that's faked on the red carpet. Not the happiness that is advertised in a magazine. Real. Happiness. And I craved it, and I needed it. I learned more about this church, I was taught by its missionaries. I prayed for the first time and asked God if he was even real or if he cared about me. Immediately, I felt a love stronger than I had ever feel, surge through me like electricity. The thing I had been avoiding most of my life was the actual cure for all my ailments and holes in my being. I felt Heavenly Father/God. I realized that he had been there all along and had loved me all along. He did not appear in a cloud, he did not strike lightning, but he sent me a feeling of love and happiness that was stronger than anything I had ever felt. Even in serious romantic relationships. God's love is truly the strongest love. The highest high. And I have to tell you; praying to him and later being baptized was the best thing I ever did. Never, for a moment, do I worry or wonder where I come from or where I am going. I know. And this knowledge is worth more than anything else. I feel full. I feel satisfied. In a crazy and uncertain world, I have a strong peaceful feeling. I don't need more and more of anything like I did before. Except maybe more of God's love. Because that was the only thing that I was missing before. A knowledge of God and a knowledge of how much He loves me. 8 years ago, I could've never imagined being in this happy place I am. But I can't now imagine being anywhere else. I wish you the best, from someone who had their fair share of highs and lows and existential crises. Heavenly Father might be the last thing you think you need in your life, but He's the thing you really need most. Especially now. ",

            "answer_text": "Not really. In fact under my set of circumstances it has proven to be a blessing in disguise. I am newly married and migrated to the United States of America to live together with my husband. New land, new culture, new start of life, everything new. My husband went to office for two weeks and then the lockdown began. That was awesome for us! We got so much time together to develop a good understanding, to get familiar with each others choices, likes and dislikes. We enjoyed home cooked food throughout and spent weekends talking with our families, friends and chilling home without much hustle. On some weekends we drove through Pacific Coast and enjoyed the drive. I actually got lucky to have such a smooth transition to my new life. Gradually got familiar with the States and it's culture and day to day life. But of course, after few months it was starting to suck being locked home always. Parents would be so worried if we go out even to buy groceries! Also, getting used to wearing mask was something I didn't like but ya who likes anyway! After sometime I started to feel the need to meet people and have some chit chat. This was bit obvious as we didn't meet anyone in 4 months here! No friend or acquaintance! Moreover we were putting on weight always sitting home and doing no work out. So we started to go for walking with masks on! We started to play badminton in nearby park and were happy again! And know what! We joined badminton club where easily I burn over 900 calories every time I go for playing. So thankfully health is back on track. But of course the news about Covid19 are sad and disheartening. Hearing about people who lost their lives and situation of doctors and nurses and other emergency services made us feel guilty for no reason (I was wondering why some people got so unlucky:( but of course I was grateful for being so lucky). It's something I cannot put in words. Can just say, I do feel for those who were severely affected by this pandemic. In the end I can say that following the guidelines issued by the government such as wearing mask, social distancing and lockdown of popular public places really proved helpful in fighting the pandemic at personal level while contributing to mass level control mechanism. We were really surprised watching news about some stubborn people who refused to follow the Covid 19 prevention measures and who were fighting at grocery stores and other public places for no great reason. I think people must try to ignore little issues like getting used to wearing mask and social distancing and delays in grooming services and must appreciate the efforts the government and fellow people are talking to combat this pandemic situation. For sure this pandemic and lockdown brought families together and taught us the importance of living beings in our lives. We should be grateful for thi opportunity and must adapt ourselves to the current situation with a hope that soon all this will be over and things will fall in place. So far we all did a great job and we should feel happy about it. Praying to God for strengthening our immune system and effective vaccine which is yet to come \ud83d\ude4f. ",

            "answer_text": "No, it has not caused me an existential crises. It has created difficulties in my life but none that I can\u2019t handle so far. Perhaps this is due to my study of Buddhism which in essence says \u201cshit happens\u201d. So I have had to let go and take things one day at a time. I have never questioned the purpose of life or my part in it during this pandemic. Again, thanks to Buddhist teachings. I had made some long term plans but was delayed by unforeseen circumstances. Then as countries began to shut down, I did have a temporary crises. I began to panic as the window for my plans to move back to the States began to close. I had to finally let go, accept that I would not be able to return to the States until things cooled down and countries began to reopen once again. But now, even though the country I am living in is having an exponential increase in cases with little plans on how to deal with this virus, I think I am better off staying here. It appears that there are a lot of angry, violent even, people who refuse to wear masks while shopping. At least here everyone is complying with mask wearing when entering businesses that require masks. No one is trying to beat up others who insist that masks be worn. Most here believe and accept that this is a deadly virus. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The start of covid caused us to move out of a home where people worked both with sick people and in close contact with the public. My son is high risk and before this has been hospitalized for breathing issues more than once. In order for us to stay away from people, we had to move away fron people we love. The second thing it did was cost me my business. I have worked for over 15 years self employed. I take off garbage, clean, haul scrap, anything that someone feels is too gross of a job, call Me. Need help moving? I can do that. Someone died n need their house cleaned out n put in storage. I'm your girl. This has provided for my kids for years. My kids help and work too. Waiting for this to pass and abiding by the rules the govt set, cost me my job. Others stepped in and took my customer base. People without kids who dont have the high risk my son and I do. Thirdly we are now homeschooling so while i used to be able to do work while they were in school, I do not have that anymore. Lack of childcare is a definite hardship as far as being able to work doing what I do. Im now forced to try to find new employment, in a town where the only employment is a sewing factory, gas stations, or dollar General. None of which pay enough to pay my gas back and forth, food on the table, and a babysitter for the time im there. They pay $7 something an hour. Babysitter charges $10. ",

I also think I\u2019ll resume my Sacred Wisdom collection from the UK\u2019s Watson Publishing.  Also trying to do my own powder nails, if not with exactly stellar results so far. LOL  The salon makes them look like this:  All in all I\u2019m taking it easy having recently come off a three-year illness\u2014a strange combo of toxic mold and environmental heavy metal poisoning that to me makes COVD look like a wimp. Doctors were flummoxed. In the end, this is what saved my life: Heavy Metal Detox Smoothie So I\u2019m not having a crisis. Just glad to be alive and able to do things again, however gradually. I do, however believe the world is in transition in a way that\u2019s hard to grasp while we\u2019re still in the middle. I try to stay positive (meditation helps a lot, also NetFlix standup comedy and mint chocolate chip ice cream \ud83d\ude01). FWIW, hubby and I rely mainly on horseradish to combat any worrisome symptoms that show up. It\u2019s a powerful antiviral, anti-bacterial, etc., etc. We just have to make sure to take it with food so our stomachs don\u2019t burn. It comes in pill form or we\u2019ve used the fresh root to make a tea. So far so good. Keep safe and as happy as you possibly can. ",

It can strengthen you to be more focused in developing discipline, determination, tenacity and resilience, and achieving better results. It can also soften you to understand and empathize with other people\u2019s angst, anxiety and anguish. This will help you to become a more approachable, amiable and amicable person. Just as importantly, the pandemic can enlighten you to pursue a higher calling and serve a worthier cause. Life is not just about pursuing profits, possessions, power, positions, pleasures, prestige and privileges. At the end of the day, finding lasting fulfillment is about making a positive impact on the people and environment around you. The more you pursue such a noble cause, the less you focus on existential threats of the pandemic. You\u2019ll live at a higher plane of life. ",

I was questioning why I was working in healthcare and what I would do if I left the field. Then the pandemic hit hard. I volunteered to be part of the COVID team and work all my shifts in the COVID ICU. What a stressful and gratifying experience. While most of our patients over 65 years old died we did have a handful of younger ones that defied the odds and made it out of the ICU. Like went through hell and back and still survived. Even those who didn\u2019t make it we made sure to put up a good fight and provide the best care to their families and loved ones. Alot of the care was driven by the nurses because the poor doctors were absolutely slammed juggling 4\u20135x more patients than usual. Plus the teamwork was phenomenal. Everyone on the team accepted the situation for what it was and jumped right in. I\u2019ve been a nurse for ten years and I haven\u2019t experienced teamwork like that in probably 7 or 8 years. It was beyond refreshing to see driven caring intelligent people coming together to do what was best for our patients. No one complaining about the protective gear, the assignments, or how something wasn\u2019t their responsibility. No emails about BS surveys and reminders to document mundane things. I have faith that people can put aside their differences and work together in super chaotic stressful situations such as surviving a pandemic. It actually brought together many different types of nurses and doctors outside of the realm of pulmonary ICU care. I worked with cardiac ICU nurses, neuroscience ICU nurses, surgical trauma ICU nurses, medical/surgical ICU nurses, step up nurses from all different backgrounds, NPs, CRNAs, pulmonologists, cardiologists, anesthesiologists, nephrologists, ENT doctors, infectious disease doctors, palliative care teams, pharmacists and their teams, maintenance teams, ancillary staff, you name it. And everyone was coming together to do the best they could for the patients. I am relieved the numbers of COVID cases are decreasing. It was hard seeing all those people die. But I am thankful for the experience. It allowed us to step away from being a money making institution to just helping people survive. I didn\u2019t become a nurse for the paycheck. I became a nurse to help people live their best lives. Surprisingly the pandemic gave me a sense of purpose. ",

            "answer_text": "No, Covid-19 has not caused an existential crisis for me because I have had many of them throughout my life; three illnesses which each almost killed me, two wars I\u2019ve been in or on the margin of, a car accident, the loss of dear loved ones and more. You see, most people spend their lives thinking, feeling and believing that surviving school, work, the climb up the pay ladder, the good/bad relationships and more are reality. Each is part of reality, absolutely, but they are not the reality that humankind has spent its entire history combatting. The reality of humankind is seeing firsthand, feeling the deep bone cuts, and an over-all experience of the realization that life could/may/can and probably will kill you soon or even now, and not only you, but all your loved ones, children, neighbors, entire cities of populations. THIS is what humankind has fought since the beginning of time. It\u2019s not some personal battle, or some solo challenge we face alone - we ALL face it as a living species. So, if you are having an existential crisis right now because of this or more things regarding your life, I say \u201cgood,\u201d and I hope you have many more in your lifetime. There is nothing more of a wakeup call, a searing of the brainpan, the widening of awareness, the lessons of what it really means to be alive than the threats we face individually and collectively.

If anything, Covid-19 put a strong focus on caring for those around me, especially my loved ones. It gave me a strong sense of purpose - to make sure everyone I love and care about make it out of the Covid-19 alive and well. I had to make sure I could maintain my job to so I could put food on the table and a roof over my head. We tried to make sure our elderly neighbors were able to get food. We tried our best to reach out to our single and lonely friends to keep their spirits up. We tried to help those in need and volunteered where we could (physically distanced, of course). We tried to mentor new parents who happened to have their first babies while under lockdown. And I was thrilled to see that everyone else around me was also trying the same thing, doing the best they could. I think our neighbors have gotten closer to each other through this time. Sure, there were some dark times. We struggled, trying to handle the ever-changing stress of the unknown. We are an Asian family in a western country, so we knew we also had to handle the uncertainty of whether a complete stranger would be friendly, or outright hostile. But we're now 5 months into the lockdown, and we were able to adjust. Now it's our responsibility to continue to help those who are still struggling. So no, I count myself fortunate not to have experienced an existential crisis. In fact, we experienced the complete opposite. ",

Worried about my Dad and Grand Dad because they are of age. But also worried of Covid, the fires, the election, global warming! I've been walking up at night, at least 4times a night. I've also have a pica problem and also have Trichotillomania, which I've also been doing more. As of anything else, I've been trying to stay away from the news lol I also have an appt with my med guy and therapy, so I know I'll get better soon. I do however see less people getting sick and only 1 person died according to San Diego news. Thank u for ur concern. Reach out if needed. ",

Before COVID-19 I was a volunteer tutor at an elementary school and I worked on charitable projects with seniors, and we\u2019d go out to lunch together. My volunteer work is on hold. I used to do a lot of swimming in the summer. This year I had only one swim for reasons due to COVID-19 restrictions. My daughter had been visiting twice a year\u2014now it\u2019s almost a year since we\u2019ve seen one another. We do have amazingly long telephone conversations\u20145 l/2 hours is our record. Three years ago I lost my faith so I no longer believe in an afterlife. So I feel that this is the life I get. I\u2019m left to wonder what my life is going to look like in the next few years. Will I be interested in returning to my former activities when I\u2019m finally free to do so? Every day I exercise, write, do crossword puzzles, read, and do chores and occasional errands. Somehow it\u2019s easier to see the end of the road when your wings have been clipped somewhat. So far I don\u2019t have an overwhelming fear of dying from COVID-19, but I\u2019m not as nonchalant as I was in the very beginning. I\u2019m fairly cautious. I\u2019m not ready to die at 73. ",

A distant cousin in Texas, from my grandmother\u2019s father side of the family. Told a tale about our great, great, great grandfather making wagons. His neighbor raised donkeys. Once a year they took them off to sell. And then ook a couple of days to walk home. I had never met this woman, but I knew that story, too. Imagine if my great great great grandfather had known that 2 of his great, great, great grandchildren, 600 miles apart and never knowing each other, would tell the same tale about him. So I say that to say this. I have contributed two more generations to his story. His genes still stand on earth today. I have never had an existential crisis. I don\u2019t expect to. I hope no one else does. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Devin. I gave this question some thought. My first reax was \u201cNo, most of my life has been an existential crisis of one sort or another; this is just a variation on the theme, one that is shared.\u201dThen I thought about my habits: I\u2019m not walking nearly as much as I usually do in summer \u2013 jet lag from the initial Stay at Home directive and now an actual problem. I haven\u2019t gotten my hair-cut since March. The woman who cuts my hair is probably not going to reopen. I like her and that made me sad. It\u2019s not like me to let my hair get to the point where I look like Grandpa from the Munsters in the morning. Regular eating habits have not been so regular with a heavy intake of sugary stuff. Smoking! While I picked up cigars a year or so ago, just on a whim, I gradually downgraded to mini-cigars, which were making me ill, then upscale cigarettes. I was a reformed smoker and the habit is now firmly retrenched. Lack of live in-person AA meetings: The Zoom meetings are a good bandaid, but I definitely feel the lack of human contact on that level. It\u2019s a major issue for myself and many others.Motivational Dip: Yep, like a lotta folks these days, I don\u2019t work (Nothing new, I\u2019m disabled and live on a fixed income). Being a creative type, I haven\u2019t been as active or excited until recently, about writing, photography and music. On the upside: I don\u2019t feel the generalized despair and craziness my news-junkie friends are experiencing. I don\u2019t pay attention to Tweet-Journalism and I maybe take one or two hours a week to catch-up on what\u2019s going from sources that I trust and not corporate media. I do not watch TV, but that\u2019s nothing new. These days, it turns out to be a healthy choice. Many friends, especially those with kids, are having bouts of anhedonia: Zero sense of pleasure and their sense of humor is wasted. That hasn\u2019t happened to me, partly because I\u2019ve created my own belief system, am 62, don\u2019t have kids, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of heavy shit in my life and outlived it. I do not know if I will outlive this, but hey, I could die by accident any day of the year, pandemic or not. I keep that foremost in my mind. Keeps my days fresh and I\u2019m thankful for being alive. I do think it is age dependent how much of an existential crisis any individual is experiencing. My sweetheart is a caretaker for two elderly clients in an upscale residential retirement/nursing home. The Draconian measures taken to ensure there are no C-19 cases on their premises has had a terrible effect on many of these older people: They cannot see family, they cannot even socialize with friends in the place and are cut-off from 85% of their social contacts. There is scant good news on how this is effecting residents, especially those on the nursing floor. They are deteriorating quickly. That really upsets me, but I\u2019m at a remove from it: Killing people slowly with isolation is not my idea of high quality care-taking.Since I live with severe depression and anxiety I\u2019ve had some dark moments during this time. I\u2019ve learned to manage these episodes which definitely threaten my stability and can lead to a sense of panic and dread. Add the pandemic to it, and a feller can go down a rabbit hole. I stay out of those holes as best I can. If I get stuck, I call for help. Thanks for your question. It\u2019s a good one and gave me pause to think. Usually by the end of every day, I\u2019m grateful and thankful to be alive. All best to you. ",

But i am aware that the physical body has its limitations. So i followed suggestions from the authority as regard doing or practicing health protocols. Although i had been watching my physical body as regard health habits, this time around when covid 19 appeared before us citizens of the world, i still need to follow strictly the rules to avoid getting infected. washing of hands regularly, wearing facemasks and now faceshield, practice social distancing, and stay at home are everybody\u2019s regular rules i am aware of, that i followed them,also. I rarely go out of the house since i had been painting for many months since last year. I and my husband also drink hot water everyday. Existentially, we need to follow these things if we wanted to avoid any of the bad effects of contacting a virus everybody avoids. Except for minor reactions to us of the reality about covid effects on people, we simply do what needs to be done. Because we cannot avoid that sometimes we had to go out of the house and where we have to mingle with people, we watched ourselves like we quarantined for two weeks to see if there are minor symptoms of getting infected. As of the present, we live a life as normal as it could get, except for changes in interacting with people. That is social distancing. credits : GMA  ",

And my health is already more precarious than a certain COVID-19 exposure would be, so that doesn\u2019t have me too concerned, either. A very modest adjustment as compared to what most people are experiencing, and not something having me radically revise my personal narrative. The state of the world itself is somewhat of a different story, but things were never great and, much less Great Again \u2014 yeah, I\u2019m in Trumpland, to boot. The world is changing in light of the crisis, in some ways for the long-term. But, there are upsides and downsides to this. Also, the older you get, the more you see how relentlessly impermanent everything is. People, places, even foods\u2026it is all transient.

With other factors included, I developed mental disorders, and often wondered why does everything even exist, why was I born to suffer, what is the damn point?! Not going to go into my theories on the answers as to not give people crazy ideas that turn into rediculous conspiracy theories like one I recently heard. The virus existed long before the public knew about it and accidents happen, how you deal with it is what matters and this poor display of government is sad in America. ",

I said the government will convince you that the threat is real, and they have definitely achieved that. I said the government will close schools, hospitals, and public places of interest, and suppress us by forcing us to wear face masks in public, and forcing social distancing to keep us controlled. The coronavirus is a weapon used by the elite to spread fear into the hearts of the people, and they have successfully executed that. ",

I get an anti-flu shot every fall and another inoculation or two. To me it is all the same old thing. I just try to enjoy one day at a time. ",

TBH we haven\u2019t been affected COVID in any significant way other than than the 222 million in the country, so far came out unscathed. Also, we do not know anyone personally who has a bout with Covid. My Son-in-law had an encounter with a class mate of his at an out of town wedding. The classmate had a colleague who was tested positive. The class mate learned of his colleague only aftre he got back. He immediately informed everyone. My son in law immediately went into self-isolation for 2 weeks+. This was all mid March. He was not at all affected. SO there was 4 degrees of separation and about 2000miles. I know distance doesn\u2019t matter. So far I would say there has been no existential threat to me or my immediate family. MY heart does ache for the 7.5 million in this country and the 35 million worldwide. Except for a few dozens in this country and a couple of them in Brazil. If Duterte got affected then he would go into the exception pile too. ",

If you understand why nature behaves the way it does, what do we do to invite such reactions from nature and how to invite the best possible reaction from nature, you\u2019d be excited about the opportunity that this pandemic represents. If you look at it logically, it makes no sense. More people die from many other causes yet the world hasn\u2019t stopped for that. That\u2019s because this pandemic is an expression of a breakage in our relationships, which in turn has created a very unsatisfying world for so many people. Although as humans we resist change because of our aversion for spending energy, Nature is now compelling us to change. the pandemic has simply allowed everyone to stop doing what they were all but forced to do for so long and take a deeper look at life and its meaning. It\u2019s not a crisis of health but an existential crisis. It begs us to isolate ourselves from one another, to review our attitude toward one another and that reality that this attitude begets. If we are wise, we will use this opportunity to change our relationships and consequently our reality. If we are not wise about it, we\u2019ll make superhuman efforts to go back to the old world we knew only to invite a worse pandemic that will force us to change. As humans, we can and we must, exercise our free choice and our conscious mind to aspire to a better world, to pull ourselves as it were toward a higher state. If we don\u2019t, nature is forced to push us through extreme suffering. The plan of our evolution is set. Our only choice is in how fast and how smoothly will we get to our destination. ",
