            "answer_text": "Research shows that most people complain once a minute during a typical conversation. Complaining is tempting because it feels good, but like many other things that are enjoyable\u2014such as smoking or eating a pound of bacon for breakfast\u2014complaining isn\u2019t good for you. Your brain loves efficiency and doesn\u2019t like to work any harder than it has to. When you repeat a behavior, such as complaining, your neurons branch out to each other to ease the flow of information. This makes it much easier to repeat that behavior in the future\u2014so easy, in fact, that you might not even realize you\u2019re doing it. You can\u2019t blame your brain. Who\u2019d want to build a temporary bridge every time you need to cross a river? It makes a lot more sense to construct a permanent bridge. So, your neurons grow closer together, and the connections between them become more permanent. Scientists like to describe this process as, \u201cNeurons that fire together, wire together.\u201d Repeated complaining rewires your brain to make future complaining more likely. Over time, you find it\u2019s easier to be negative than to be positive, regardless of what\u2019s happening around you. Complaining becomes your default behavior, which changes how people perceive you. And here\u2019s the kicker: complaining damages other areas of your brain as well. Research from Stanford University has shown that complaining shrinks the hippocampus\u2014an area of the brain that\u2019s critical to problem solving and intelligent thought. Damage to the hippocampus is scary, especially when you consider that it\u2019s one of the primary brain areas destroyed by Alzheimer\u2019s. Complaining Is Bad for Your Health While it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that complaining leads to brain damage, it doesn\u2019t stop there. When you complain, your body releases the stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol shifts you into fight-or-flight mode, directing oxygen, blood, and energy away from everything but the systems that are essential to immediate survival. One effect of cortisol, for example, is to raise your blood pressure and blood sugar so that you\u2019ll be prepared to either escape or defend yourself. All the extra cortisol released by frequent complaining impairs your immune system and makes you more susceptible to high cholesterol, diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. It even makes the brain more vulnerable to strokes. You can read my answer on how to stop complaining here.  To learn more from me, check out my award-winning book that\u2019s a #1 best seller. ",

            "answer_text": "Complaining? That\u2019s one way to call it. I think that particular word has a negative connotation to it. I would call it \u201cExpressing frustration at X\u201d. Complaints almost always carry negative emotion. People can usually tell whether you are just whining, or seriously stressed out, by how you complain about something. This is one of the reason why complaining is often seen as a negative thing, because you are essentially projecting your frustration at someone. As a result, it usually requires a certain level of commitment from the person hearing you out. So, I guess you could say that it is not only the substance, but also the delivery of the complaint that determines whether it is going to be seen as good or bad. Here are some examples: If you complain about the same thing over and over to the same person, it can be annoying, let alone received well - even if the listener is patient and understanding. But if you complain about the same thing over and over again, to everyone - and it happens to be about a grave issue that\u2019s relevant to others? You could seem like an advocate. Likewise, if you complain about something that seems unimportant or trivial to the listener - or they\u2019ve never cared about it before - there is a chance that they would brush it off, or ignore it completely. But if you are able to express your frustration clearly in a manner that is understandable or relatable to the listener, then the response could be totally different. The bottom line is that complaining as an act isn\u2019t what makes it good or bad. In fact, in a lot of situations, complaining is very important. Protests are essentially organized complaining by the mass. When you call your representative to \u201clet them know how you feel\u201d you are basically complaining about an issue. In our civil society, you can file a complaint when you are a victim of unjust treatment. Don\u2019t forget though, it\u2019s important that you DO complain, regardless of whether it\u2019s good or bad. This is why having support from friends and family is really important. If you can\u2019t complain about anything at all, it will fester within you, and the stress of the building frustration can be very unhealthy for you. A bit of positive attitude and patience can also go a long way, since it can often help you be more understanding or tolerant towards whatever it is that was frustrating. ",
