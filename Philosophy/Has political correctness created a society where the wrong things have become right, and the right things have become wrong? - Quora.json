            "answer_text": "(1) Thanks for the A2A. (2) Short answer: NoIrrelevant.There is a deeper malaise.Understand the roots of Political Correctness.In the beginning, there was discrimination, say, racial discrimination.Discrimination was primarily in 2 forms.Institutionalized e.g. discriminatory laws such as the US Jim Crow laws.Day-to-day soft interactional, transactional discrimination.Then, society moved forward some. Institutionalized discrimination which is very visible, objective and transparent in the form of discriminatory laws were taken down over time.But, racism is softwired in minds. It doesn\u2019t go away just because bad laws are eliminated. The take down of institutionalized discriminatory laws emboldened racists. There is now legally, officially no racism. They ratcheted up on hard-to-detect soft racism. There are all kinds of societal problems, economic, social, poverty, inequality, injustice, etc, but there are no racism problems because there is no institutionalized racism. Pressing issues pertinent to specific minorities such as African-Americans are glossed over as broad societal problems. \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d. Oh well, but don\u2019t \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d too?Over time, the discriminated swathes of people find that they are no better off. Racism has taken cover under other realms. African-Americans have grave challenges getting bank loans to start businesses. \u201dOh but, these are financial markets commercial issues, nothing to do with race.\u201dTo solve a problem, you have to define the \u201cProblem Statement\u201d. In the above situation, discrimination no longer exists legally, the problems defy definition. What exactly is the problem? No Problem Statement, so, no problem.Political Correctness is the frustrated response, the reaction, the outlet, to the above simmering issues. In these emotional reactions, we cannot expect very rational constructs. But, the cry of underlying frustration is real.Whether a particular Politically Correct \u201cwrong\u201d item should be deemed \u201cright\u201d, or vice versa, is a mere inconvenient symptom of a deeper malaise.Political Correctness will not go away anytime soon, because the above mentioned issues are trending towards worsening. E.g. the lot of African-Americans are worsening as we speak.",

Where speech originally designed to denigrate \u201cthe other\u201d (but which has largely been bastardised) is challenged, and we are being made to rethink the words we use. As for your actual question\u2026where the wrong things have become right and the right have become wrong. I\u2019m unsure what your meaning is here, it\u2019s open for interpretation. Do you think you should be able to use sexist language and go unchallenged? Or do you think that, if you were to use sexist language, you should quite rightly be challenged? Honestly you can interpret this question either way, so clarification would be good. ",
