            "answer_text": "Question Answered: \u201cDoes quantum mechanics undermine hard determinism?\u201d Quantum Mechanics does not undermine, much less falsify, Causal Determinism. I begin by acknowledging that there is no single universally accepted definition of Causal Determinism and that there are multiple interpretations of Quantum Mechanics. Accordingly, before explaining my conclusion, it is necessary to set out some definitions and explanations. Causal Determinism Defined As I understand it, Causal Determinism is a metaphysical paradigm that posits that all activity in the universe is both (i) the effect of [all] antecedent activity, and (ii) the only activity that can occur given the antecedent activity. That is what is meant by saying that everything is \u201cdetermined\u201d \u2014 it is the inexorable consequence of activity that preceded it. This determined (or predetermined) activity of the universe necessarily includes all human action, including all human cognition. A great number of discussions of Causal Determinism explicitly or implicitly assume that a combination of perfect information about the past and perfect information about the present instant would, necessarily, permit a perfect prediction of the future if the universe is truly and entirely deterministic. Personally, I reject that predictability is an aspect of Causal Determinism. As I understand it, Causal Determinism posits only that everything has a cause and cannot occur in any manner other than how it does occur \u2014 without regard to the ability to predict or replicate that activity. Causal Determinism does not posit that the factors that have caused, are causing, or will cause any particular activity can be known or understood, or that any specific future activity can be predicted with any degree of certainty. As Karl Popper has explained: \u201cThe metaphysical doctrine of determinism simply asserts that all events in this world are fixed, or unalterable, or predetermined. It does not assert that they are known to anybody, or predictable by scientific means. But it asserts that the future is as little changeable as is the past. Everybody knows what we mean when we say that the past cannot be changed. It is in precisely the same sense that the future cannot be changed, according to metaphysical determinism.\u201d Quantum Indeterminacy I begin by confessing that my understanding of Quantum Mechanics is extremely limited. I certainly do not understand the math underlying the science. Nonetheless, I believe that I have read enough about Quantum Mechanics to understand the debate over the import, if any, of Quantum Mechanics to Causal Determinism. I also believe that I have read enough to appreciate that most discussions of the relationship between Quantum Mechanics and Causal Determinism are written mainly, if not entirely, from the perspective of a scientist or mathematician, and not from a philosophical or metaphysical perspective. I further believe that most comparisons of Quantum Mechanics with Causal Determinism actually are comparisons of Quantum Mechanics with Newtonian Determinism, which is a scientific principle that is similar but not identical to the metaphysical paradigm of Causal Determinism. As I understand the concept of Quantum Indeterminacy, it stems from Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty (or Indeterminacy) Principle, which posits that it is impossible to measure or calculate with scientific certainty the precise location and velocity of a particle at the same instant. Although the math underlying the Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle escapes me, I am willing to accept the principle as sound. I further understand that Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle is used to posit that it is literally \u201cimpossible\u201d to identify with scientific certainty the precise cause(s) of all activity in the universe and/or to predict with scientific certainty all future activity. Moreover, if I understand it correctly, Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle posits that the impossible nature of these endeavors is not simply the result of a lack of sufficient information or inadequacy of computational power. By way of an example about which I have repeatedly read, quantum indeterminacy posits that two identical radioactive particles, subjected to entirely identical causes, may, nonetheless, behave somewhat differently, and that it is theoretically impossible to perfectly predict specific the behavior of a specific radioactive particle. Quantum Indeterminacy Does Not Undermine, Much Less Falsify, Causal Determinism There are a number of people within the scientific community who claim that Quantum Indeterminacy establishes the existence of \u201crandom\u201d activity, which is not entirely caused by prior activity. People who believe that Quantum Indeterminacy establishes the existence of truly random activity also claim that Quantum Indeterminacy undermines or falsifies Causal Determinism. Based on my understanding of Causal Determinism, I agree that the existence of truly random activity in the universe (even if only at the quantum level) would be incompatible with pure Causal Determinism. Although it is theoretically possible that there are truly random actions in the universe, it is my humble opinion that Quantum Indeterminacy does not necessarily or conclusively support that theory, and that it is equally possible that Quantum Indeterminacy (if true) establishes only the existence of certain caused activity that cannot be predicted with scientific certainty notwithstanding theoretically perfect knowledge of all prior activity and its causes. This alternative interpretation of Quantum Indeterminacy (which also finds support within the scientific community) does not falsify Causal Determinism. Separate and apart from the fact that Quantum Indeterminacy does not falsify Causal Determinism, I believe that it is \u201cimpossible\u201d for any scientific endeavor to do so for no less than four reasons. First, within modern science, there are the combined limitations of Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle, itself, as well as Godel\u2019s Incompleteness Theorems, the observer effect, and other human and inherent limitations of empirical observation, which acknowledge the theoretical impossibility of obtaining a certain, complete, and precise understanding of the universe \u2014 at least from within the universe. If the universe cannot perfectly be understood through modern science, then science can never perfectly prove or falsify anything. Second, leaving the specific scientific principles that limit the ultimate reaches of modern science (at this time), within the paradigm of science, the \u201claws\u201d and \u201cprinciples\u201d of science are subject to being revisited and even falsified with greater information, better technology, or a new paradigm that is more comprehensive and robust \u2014 especially since science is built on inductive reasoning (as contrasted with deductive reasoning) and can, therefore, never produce a certain result that necessarily will withstand the test of time and further knowledge. Thus, it is always possible for something that is thought to be scientifically sound one day will later be thought to be falsified through science another day. In essence, science can never prove anything with absolute certainty. Like any other paradigm, science can only provide a robust story to explain the universe until a hole in the story is discovered and a new, more robust, story is written. Third, science (like Causal Determinism) is, itself, a metaphysical paradigm, which is built in the premise that there is an ultimate reality that is capable of being discerned through the empirical method. As explained at a somewhat high level in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, metaphysical propositions about ultimate reality (including propositions that there is no ultimate reality) cannot be proved or falsified by science and may well be beyond the capacity of human beings to prove or falsify. As a metaphysical proposition about ultimate reality, science (like Causal Determinism) can only be tested for validity or invalidity (as opposed to truth or falsehood) based on its internal consistency \u2014 and even that depends upon assuming that there is an ultimate reality and that the rules of logic are consistent with that reality. Yet another way to consider the issue is through the mystical eyes of Swami Vivekananda, who wrote that \u201c[e]very attempt to solve the laws of causation, time, and space would be futile, because the very attempt would have to be made by taking for granted the existence of these three.\u201d Plainly, science cannot pull itself up by its own bootstraps. Nor can science pull out its bootstraps and trip up Causal Determinism. Fourth, if Causal Determinism were true (which we cannot know for many of the same reasons that Causal Determinism cannot be falsified), any putative proof to the contrary would be nothing more (or less) than the natural consequence of prior activity that has the illusory appearance of being correct and/or reliable \u2014 such as science, itself. If Causal Determinism were true, we could not trust our thoughts to be representative of reality, because our thoughts simply would be the necessary effects of prior activity in the universe, and would be the only thoughts we could have. If Causal Determinism were true, and our thoughts did correlate with reality, it would be purely by happenstance. If Causal Determinism were true, our thoughts \u2014 including our belief in and reliance upon science \u2014 simply would be meaningless noise in the universe. If Causal Determinism were true, I would writing this answer because of things that occurred a billion years ago (to the extent there is such a thing as the passage of time), and I could not possibly be doing anything differently at this moment. Moreover, Causal Determinism does not posit whether an intelligent being wrote the script that led to me writing this post, or whether the path that inexorably led to my doing so was randomly generated. But, Causal Determinism does posit that this path has been fixed from the beginning of time, and that it is impossible to stray from that path. In this regard, I have read that Albert Einstein observed that \u201cHuman beings in their thinking, feeling and acting are not free but are as causally bound as the stars in their motions.\u201d In a world governed by science, we do not think of a speck of dust blowing in the wind as having any control over its actions. The dust does not decide which way it will be blown, and it does not question the wind that blows it or other things into which it comes into contact as it is blown from place-to-place. If Causal Determinism were true, then human beings, as well as their thoughts and conventions (including science), would be no more than dust in the wind \u2014 incapable of providing proof of anything. Quantum Indeterminacy Is Consistent With Causal Determinism As previously noted, Causal Determinism posits only that everything has a cause and cannot occur in any manner other than how it does occur \u2014 without regard to the ability to predict or replicate that activity. Causal Determinism does not posit the details of what specifically causes any particular activity, and Causal Determinism does not posit that the factors that have caused, are causing, or will cause any particular activity can be known or understood, or that any specific future activity can be predicted with any degree of certainty. Not only is predictability not an aspect of Causal Determinism as I see it, but it is arguable that the tenets of Causal Determinism, when taken to their logical conclusion, make it impossible to predict \u201cany\u201d future event with certainty \u2014 not simply activity at the quantum level. Among other reasons, this lack of certain predictability within Causal Determinism stems from the fact that it is impossible to know how the totality of all prior activity of the universe will interact to cause the next occurrence of activity, because the totality of all prior activity has never before coalesced. Yet another way to account for the inherent lack of certain predictability within Causal Determinism is to consider the fact that it is impossible to know whether (i) the entirety of the rules that govern causation within a fully deterministic universe are a closed or open set, (ii) the continuum of causation is infinite or has a certain end point, or (iii) all of the rules of causation in a closed set have yet played out. Now, consider the assertion within Quantum Physics that \u201cidentical\u201d radioactive particles behave differently notwithstanding identical circumstances. As I see it, the definition of \u201cidentical\u201d within Quantum Physics is not the same as the definition of \u201cidentical\u201d within Causal Determinism \u2014 which gives rise to the mistaken conclusion that Quantum Indeterminacy falsifies Causal Determinism. As I understand the term \u201cidentical\u201d as used in Quantum Physics, it means sufficiently similar to be expected to behave the same way from a statistical perspective. As I see it, the degree of similarity accepted as sufficient to be considered \u201cidentical\u201d in Quantum Physics is insufficient for purposes of Causal Determinism. While I expect that there are quantum physicists who would disagree with me, I tend to believe that no two particles can exist in precisely the same place at precisely the same time. Thus, even if two \u201ctwin\u201d radioactive particles were to emerge seemingly simultaneously, they would be ever-so-slightly (possibly immeasurably) different from one another in some infinitesimally small manner, as they would emerge in slightly different locations and thereafter follow slightly different trajectories. Viewed through the lens of Causal Determinism, another way to look at this phenomenon might be to say that no two particles are ever truly \u201cidentical\u201d because every particle is \u201cunique\u201d in that, at a bare minimum, its existence and activity is the effect of a different causal chain of events than the existence and activity of any other radioactive particle. As Heraclitus somewhat cryptically observed well over 2000 years ago, \u201cNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.\u201d Post Script: Causal Determinism Can No More Be Supported or Proved True Than It Can be Undermined or Falsified Notwithstanding the inability of science (or any other human endeavor) to falsify Causal Determinism, I openly acknowledge that it is equally impossible to prove the truth of Causal Determinism \u2014 for all of the same reasons. Separate and apart from the generic reasons that logically consistent metaphysical propositions are beyond proof or falsification, if Causal Determinism were true, it would follow by necessity that there could never be proof of that fact, much less scientific proof. \u201cIf\u201d Causal Determinism were true, human beings would lack the ability to think in a manner that is not 100% caused by prior activity that is outside of their control, and human thoughts and ideas simply would be meaningless noise in the universe. As such, if Causal Determinism were true, any claim that something evidences or proves the deterministic nature of the universe would be an internally inconsistent and/or self-contradictory claim \u2014 because the claimant would have to admit that the assertion of the claim, itself, is nothing more than an (unintentionally) predetermined effect of prior causes going back to the beginning of time (to the extent there is such a thing as time). Stated somewhat differently, if Causal Determinism were true, anyone who claims to have evidence or proof of the nature of the universe simply would be following his or her programming \u2014 much like a computer that is programmed one day 1 to spit out a particular assertion in day 100, and to also spit out \u201creasons\u201d for the assertion, and even to purport to perform \u201cexperiments\u201d on days 80 through 99 that the computer is programmed to \u201cfind\u201d to support the conclusion that the computer is programmed to assert on day 100. That is not proof of anything. By the same token, if Causal Determinism were false, it plainly could not be proved to be true \u2014 at least not by any correct means. * * * As a metaphysical proposition about ultimate reality, Causal Determinism can be accepted or rejected only on faith. The same is true of science and religion, which are alternative metaphysical propositions. [For a further discussion of the limitations of humans to prove or disprove the truth or falsity of metaphysical propositions, see generally Metaphysics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)] I hope this makes sense to someone who reads it, and I welcome comments and criticism.

On a biological point of view, free will is a state machine that eventually induce the brain to pick something and maintain that choice despite any new information that would favorise a different choice. This system is very old on the evolution history, it is shared by all vertebrates. As many old automatism, it rely on chemistry instead of architecture. The free will mechanism uses dopamine in a specific brain location : that same location that affect parkinson. Dopamine is normally indicating \u201cunexpected reward\u201d. It induces a pleasurable emotion, encouraging memory fixation in hope to learn how to reproduce the steps that produced that reward. Free will is not random, at least with rational people. Modern education main goal is to train people to question everything including our very own decision making. We are supposed to ask ourself what are our real motivation and avoid as many bias as possible. Once a decision is made though, our biology make us irrational. Another popular philosophical idea in called \u201cmany worlds\u201d or michio Kaku prefer the name \u201cmultiverse\u201d. This is equivalent to the religious groups which claim that all religion are equally good. It is also similar to the people who claim to be \u201cagnostic\u201d. In a ridiculous attempt to save the Shrodinger cat, they claim that an entire universe is duplicated at each branch of divergent event. It should be obvious that multiverse is an absolute contradiction against science. It deny the fundamental prediction power of conservation of matter and energy, which allowed to reject magical thought. ",

            "answer_text": "Not in the least. First of all, quantum mechanics is a mathematical model not reality. There's a huge difference between math (the map) and reality (the territory). Randomness is merely an assumption within the mathematical model. It is assumed to be true. It seems likely that quantum physicists are committing the sin of mistaking the math for the reality. Bell\u2019s famous inequality test does not disprove determinism. At best, it questions Einstein\u2019s idea of locality. Many mathematical concepts do not exist in the real world. Don't get me wrong. Math is a fantastic tool, however useful, it is never the reality. For example the idea of infinity is used greatly in math and physics, but it's actual existence remains suspect. Both randomness and infinity are unfalsifiable. That should be a big red flag. Popper would be skeptical. No one can possibly tell the difference between a lack of knowledge which makes things seem random (psuedo-randomness) and objective randomness. This would seem impossible. How could anyone possibly know the difference? Isn't the success of quantum mechanics proof that underlying reality is fundamentally random? Nope. Psuedo-randomness will work just fine in the mathematical model called Quantum Mechanics. Determinism remains untouched This is just how things seem to me. ",

            "answer_text": "The famous paradox: If the Universe is deterministic, then there is no such thing as free will. If the Universe is non-deterministic, then there is still no such thing as free will. Example: Dinner or a movie? If you flip a \u201cperfectly random\u201d coin to make the choice, you did not exercise free will \u2014 the outcome was then perfectly random, not a \u201cchoice\u201d. If you recognize that there is no such thing as a perfectly random coin, that the coin followed the laws of physics from before the flip all the way through to landing heads or tails, then the outcome was determined by the laws of physics and is not the result of free will either. For what it is worth (and to answer the specific question), the laws of quantum physics, correctly expressed, are just as deterministic as the laws of classical physics. The wave function or probability density function for any closed system evolves in time in an entirely deterministic way \u2014 any \u201crandomness\u201d occurs only in the act of measurement, and to properly treat measurement in an OPEN quantum system one has to learn about the Generalized Master Equation and e.g. the Nakajima-Zwanzig theory, which makes it clear that the randomness in measurement and/or the time evolution of an open quantum system \u2014 the only kind we can measure in the first place with a measurement apparatus that is not part of the system and whose quantum state is not known) is mere entropy, reflecting a lack of knowledge of the state of \u201ceverything else\u201d that isn\u2019t the open system, and not true randomness. The theory of chaos doesn\u2019t allege that the forward integration in time of a chaotic dynamical system is non-deterministic \u2014 it alleges that it is not computable because (again) one cannot specify initial state with infinite precision and because the dynamical flow of the system causes initial states that differ infinitesimally to diverge from one another in time (and we have at best discrete, very finite precision computational instruments at our disposal that cannot approach the density/distribution of the rational numbers, let alone the irrational numbers to precisely represent the real number line for any real number valued variable used in the computation). The implication of these two observations is that \u2014 so far as we can tell \u2014 there is no such thing as \u201ctrue randomness\u201d, only entropy, a lack of knowledge of state, that results in nearly all processes being (at some level) unpredictable without actually being random! This is the entire basis of statistical mechanics in physics \u2014 when treating a system with many moving parts, we are forced to average over our ignorance, in a manner of speaking, to determine what is most likely to happen to large systems, keeping only the macroscopic variables that are relevant after doing the averaging. The Universe, needless to say, has many parts. So do our Selves. Our brains are a marvel of evolution, with two hemispheres connected with a communications network, many layers added by evolution at major stages along the way to sentience, and a complicated system of hormonal and enzymatic drivers that reach all the way down into our guts, literally, so that part of our thinking is done with parts of the body other than the brain, and only present to our awake consciousness after being filtered through many of those layers up from the inside. This brain is interfaced with the outside world through a complicated system of senses that take in data and present it to the brain in such a way that the brain systematizes them and develops internal feedback loops and a representation of an external world inferred on the basis of the regularities in the data. We literally learn to build an internal map that reflects the external world well enough to navigate it both literally (move around knowing where we are and where we are going, at least on a local basis) and metaphorically (perform actions that result in keeping our metabolism stoked, our species continued, and our physical selves protected from damage that we are evolved to interpret as \u201cpain\u201d). However, at best our internal map of the outside world is pitifully incomplete. Our immediate knowledge extends to the limits of our sensory apparatus, and is fuzzy and imperfect even there. I cannot see bacteria and viruses, atoms or molecules. With my naked eyes, on the clearest of nights I can see only a few thousand stars (and arguably some fuzzy spots that aren\u2019t actually stars and are much farther away than the stars I can see, but the parallax capabilities of my eyes can\u2019t resolve the distance even to the moon, let alone to the stars). I cannot see through walls, to the dark side of the moon, or the details of the roots of all of the grasses and weeds in my yard. Even with the augmentation of human senses brought about by the Enlightenment and the subsequent scientific revolution and all of the inferences of structure and dynamical function in the theory of physics developed (so far) as the underpinning of the scientific worldview, almost all of the time evolution of the world around me is beyond my knowledge or control. Indeed, the invention of information theory made it clear that I cannot know the precise state of my own brain using only the storage capacity of my own brain. So among other things, I cannot know the microscopic basis of my own decision making, even in principle, to the extent that it depends over time on a complete knowledge of the state of my entire brain, and because it is all internally coupled and sensitive to the smallest of perturbations, it always depends on this vast unknown internal state. So here\u2019s where we are with all of that. I cannot know the state of the outside world well enough to make decisions on the basis of it behaving on anything more than a very limited deterministic basis. I have learned that things like the law of gravity are pretty reliable, but no such laws exist to predict precisely what traffic I\u2019m going to encounter on the drive into work or whether or not one of the drivers of the cars I encounter is going to be drunk and smash into my car along the way. I cannot know my own internal \u201cmental\u201d state well enough to predict or \u201cunderstand\u201d the basis for my own decisions. \u201cMy\u201d decisions appear to well up into my conscious, interior monologue self-aware mind from some dark spring over which I have no control. Even these letters and words that I\u2019m typing \u2014 \u201cwho\u201d is typing them? I see my fingers typing them, the words appear in my mind (pursuing and expressing a theme as the do so), but where were they before they appeared, already formed, in my mind? Obviously somewhere ELSE in my mind, but that nonverbal place is a place outside of \u201cmy\u201d own control, the \u201cI\u201d of my self-awareness is an observer, not usually the active agent, of even my own decisions. The conclusion is that free will is the result of a shell game made possible by the complexity of our own brains, specifically that part of the complexity that makes much, probably most, of what we think and what we do come from a part of ourselves that is not verbal, that is not sitting there and rationally, reasonably, logically, analyzing things according to strict rules and making choices on that basis. If you like, we have not just a pair of dice in our brains, but rather in some sense our brains are a small mountain of dice, all frantically inserting tiny changes that add up, eventually, to our choices of action. Those dice are not random \u2014 there is no such thing as random \u2014 but they are unpredictable! Even to me. Certainly to anyone else. As a consequence, my actions are themselves deeply unpredictable while at the same time exhibiting a lot of coherence and structure and sometimes even a verbally reasoned, logically and symbolically articulated structure besides, masquerading perfectly as \u201cfree\u201d will without ever really being free. This does not \u201cfree\u201d me from the responsibilities that guide many, but not all, of my \u201cchoices\u201d. The facts laid out above may absolve me from ultimate, cosmic responsibility for my actions \u2014 my actions may well be laid out deterministically so that I have no shred of truly free will. But the simulacrum that I\u2019m left with feels like free will, and there is nobody else with more control over my actions than the dynamical construct that is \u201cI\u201d, the running Master Equation that is my self. And if I do \u201cchoose\u201d to hold others equally responsible for their own actions, whether or not they are truly free, well, I\u2019m obviously not free to do anything else, am I? In the end, moral responsibility is a social construct that, like my perfectly reasonable belief in a law of gravitation and the laws of electrodynamics, works to maximize the congruence of my internal world and the external world, to guide my decision making in ways that can help avoid the biologically programmed experience of pain and fear of death of self and maximize my equally biologically programmed experiences of pleasure and contentment when I\u2019m in the \u201csweet spot\u201d of having safety, companionship, shelter, food, sexual gratification, and security (the anticipation of the fairly reliable continuation of this desirable state of affairs as long as possible in my future life). The social constructs of ethical rules and moral responsibilities and actual duties in life have themselves evolved memetically as humans themselves are simultaneously the union of the many individual cells that make up each human, and are a part of the social union with all other humans and indeed, with the entire Earthly ecosystem. The main thing that differentiates humans and human choices from the \u201cchoices\u201d of trees and rabbits is that we have long since developed a collective worldview that is capable of predicting the outcomes of our actions well into the future built on top of a system of symbolic reasoning that we have made fairly rigorous in many ways and contexts. A rabbit may not be capable of understanding that it is destroying an entire ecology when it is introduced into a countryside without rabbits and with many other animals and plants that are vulnerable to its depredations, but a human member of modern civilization is perfectly capable of understanding the risk associated with deliberately introducing rabbits into that countryside, and can be held morally responsible for pursuing his or her own short term self-interest at the expense of all of the humans, animals, and plants that are destroyed when the rabbits predictably eat and breed more rabbits without constraint. Sure, the person who made the poor decision is just (at some deep level) a mechanical robot who had no choice but to make that poor decision. But that is not really an excuse, just as we need no excuse to impose sanctions upon that person to try to prevent future people from making equally poor decisions out of our own equally mechanical robotic choices, choices that our minds interpret as being completely free, made by only ourselves, because they certainly aren\u2019t made by anyone else!

            "answer_text": "Quantum physics says nothing about determinism. Some interpretations of quantum physics attempt to say something about determinism. But, what all of these fail to do is to establish how supposedly random occurrences in subatomic particles results in freedom for an experiencing individual. No one even tries to explain how determining forces of atomic, chemical, cellular, biological, psychological, sociological, cultural, and individual life experience might be mitigated by the tiniest actions which we have barely begun to understand. All they can say is, look, something weird happened at the tiniest level of reality*. Until we understand these tiny movements we are simply not justified, if we ever will be, in claiming that these tiny actions result in any difference at such a larger macro level as human experience. Many physicists argue that quantum weirdness is not in fact random, just that we do not yet understand it, let alone the connection between quantum physics and neuroscience. Besides that, how would randomness at the quantum level not simply be another kind of determinism for human experience and action? We cannot control quantum weirdness, we cannot find ourselves in need of the decision granting powers of quantum weirdness and await a truly strange, deterministic forces defying event in order to be able to escape from all the myriad of determining forces in the world. No, it is an utterly meaningless proposition, at least until the science matures significantly, and it is one that cannot possibly, at this point, address the actual concerns of a real person who might wonder one day: Am I free, or are all of my actions determined? No, see, you are free because tiny particles sometimes behave weirdly! Ok, but what about the determinism of having a brain, growing up in a culture, being a human being, having experienced truly traumatic things? Oh, it's cool, our instruments that we invented register a bleep, you see a bloop would mean that you are determined, but a bleep means that you are not. Poppycock! ",

            "answer_text": "Many top scientists agree \"God does not play dice\".  Schrodinger remarked that his equation was deterministic on its very face.  Since both deterministic and indeterminate interpretations work, it cannot be determined to be deterministic or not but agrees with it being both deterministic and not in contradiction to the law of the excluded middle.  By Godel, to be both consistent and complete, paradox would have to be embraced. Quantum mechanics throws a monkey wrench in the Platonic notion that knowing the present you can know the future because it is not agreed which is past and which is present.  Our clocks are independent according to distance.  From the left, it may be seen in one ordering, from the right, the opposite, and simultaneous from the front.  There is no preferred time ordering.  This leaves the past ill defined such that discriminating what is past is impossible, so knowing the future by knowing the past becomes impossible. Rather than conflict, quantum mechanics may be considered to reflect the natural nature of determinism.  Quantum mechanical causation suggests an information model where how things are determined, defines both determination and indeterminism according to what is the relevant interpretation depending on perspective  distinguishing logical orderings that are of this world from those of all possible worlds. Quantum determinism is by least action, delayed choice, and first opportunity.  It is least action since there is only equal and opposite action adding to zero, delayed choice because things have many causes and it is always the last cause that determines what ultimately happens, and first opportunity because anything that can logically happen, given complete information available locally, by equal and opposite logical action of two participants, always does happen. We can say that for each participant the local ordering is consistent and ask if in their private world knowing their past they can know their future.  Usually this is impossible because most quantum systems are not isolated.  Isolated frequencies, as in a quantum computation, are error free and free from any influence from the outside world, and unconstrained universal general purpose logical expression.  Given a chaotic environment no possible logical system can be excluded and all possible worlds must be considered, every algorithm, all computer programs and all languages up to some complexity can be expected to have been exhibited.  Complete isolation is impossible, as unlikely as it is a gamma photon can change the memory in your computer of disrupt a quantum computation.  What persists in the information ecology is resilient in recovery from the occasional gamma photon. Smolin and others suggest that even the laws of physics evolve, and what exists is persists by memetic frequency what becomes prevalent is determined by our participation in a comprehensible realm where cause and effect ordering is largely agreed upon such as from a big bang time perspective.  Disordering in time ordering exhibit space relatively while there is an environment of common local time ordering agreement to with sufficiently high precision within some radius.   I must agree with Smolin that there are not all possible worlds, there are many observers, or extant perspectives each with its own world of unique and limited information. We can start with no information, or maximum entropy, all probabilities ar .5, chaos but there are dependencies among the possibilities, each dependency is a bit of potential information but has two time perspectives and is in a superposition of states of this way or that way depending on who is looking.  Typically one perspective is lost at light speed into space without any possibility of local effect for a long long time and the other time direction of ordering is a bit of information agreed to by all local participants. Local determinism is most often seen as effects from equal and opposite elastic momentum exchanges exhibited as photons in the quantum.  What determines a quantum event is unrestricted in complexity but ultimately equal and opposite logical action between participants in an event.   In matrix mechanics this is the coincidence of the Hermitian complex conjugate of the state vector of the description of the system.  Together the state vector and its conjugate would canal to be nothing, equal and opposite action with no direction in time and no effect.  However if by distorted relative perspective on nothingness one, the other or both perspectives are exhibited independently in an environment effects in that environment will be determined to have happened. We can say that what happens is determined by how the system evolves and what might evolve might be guessed, encouraged or suppressed by our interaction in the information ecology.  While we might say what will evolve is determined in that nature repeats itself, as in so far as the simplest solution will evolve again and again, such as wings for flying.  But generally changes in an environment have unexpected consequences because we can never consider all perspectives.  And given the possibility of arbitrary independent logical mechanisms free from global influence in a local perspective such as me sitting in my chair which cannot be determined externally combined with logical mechanisms occurring locally caused by environmental effects determinism would require consideration of all possible future worlds not just the one that will be realized. Quantum logical descriptions of a system are the simplest description of themselves.  We can say that in the case of global determinism it would require a system with more states than the universe itself to determine the future, or that the future is determined only by the system itself and cannot be constrained by any other system any thus is free.

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you mean by quantum physics. My favorite theory is Quantum Field Theory as formulated by Julian Schwinger. (I was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time and so I learned it from Schwinger himself.) Unfortunately this version of QFT is not well-known. Schwinger\u2019s QFT describes a world made only of fields and field quanta. These quanta \u201cfly around\u201d interacting with each other deterministically, as per the field equations, but occasionally a quantum collapses into another quantum and transfers energy to it. These collapses are very important, because nothing can happen without energy transfer. The problem is, we don\u2019t have a theory to describe it; all we have are probabilities. Does this mean determinism is dead? The answer is found in my favorite passage in my book, that describes an imaginary visit between Albert Einstein and Julian Schwinger, as follows: The year is 1954, the year Schwinger published the final installment of his \u201cTheory of Quantized Fields\u201d papers. The 36-year-old Schwinger comes to Princeton to meet the 75-year-old Einstein, who is to die the next year. \u201cProf. Einstein,\u201d he begins, in his calm but self-assured manner, \u201cI want to show you a theory that unites all the known forces, as well as matter, into a field theory that incorporates both the principle of relativity as you have formulated it and the quantum principle that you helped introduce. It is a theory that is philosophi\u00adcally satisfying and, more importantly, has produced agreement with experiment to an undreamed of precision.\u201d \u201cWell, go ahead then,\u201d says Einstein, and Schwinger proceeds to expound his theory in Einstein\u2019s Princeton study. The sessions are intensive, with Einstein asking many probing questions along the way. Finally Einstein says, \u201cThis is indeed a beautiful theory, but it seems there are six separate fields \u2013 four force fields and two matter fields. [The Higgs field was not known at the time.] As you know, my hope was to find a single field that comprises all forces and matter. This theory of yours does not meet that objective.\u201d \u201cTrue,\u201d says Schwinger, \u201cbut may I remind you what your friend Pauli once said: \u2018What God hath put asunder, let no man join together.\u2019 If the God you often refer to chose to have six fields, it is not for us to second-guess Him. Yes, there are six different fields, each with its own properties and equations, but this is the way the universe seems to be made. As Niels Bohr once said to you, \u201cIt is not for us to tell God what to do.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d says Einstein, \u201cI can accept the six fields, but there is a further problem that is more troubling to me, and that is the probabilistic nature of your theory. I have never been able to believe that God would play dice with the universe.\u201d \u201cI understand,\u201d says Schwinger, \u201cand I admit that QFT has not solved the causality problem. But at least it has localized the probability aspect to a single event called quantum collapse \u2013 an event that is not covered by the equations of QFT. That is to say [Schwinger\u2019s favorite expression], QFT itself is causal, but it only takes us so far. At some point a discontinuous event takes place that is not covered by the theory. It is possible that at some time a theory will be developed for quantum collapse and it may turn out to be causal after all. On the other hand, it may be that it is a truly probabilistic process, and perhaps God does play dice with the universe. Either way, it doesn\u2019t detract from what QFT has accomplished.\u201d Einstein gives in. He is captivated by Schwinger\u2019s elegance and the soundness, both conceptual and mathematical, of his theory. He recognizes that QFT meets his desires for a field theory without \u201cputting together what God hath torn asunder\u201d. He appreciates the explanation that QFT provides for his two theories of relativity. He then announces to the world that QFT is the theory he has been looking for all his life. Of course this turns the tide and QFT becomes accepted throughout the physics and public communities, restoring the popular appreciation and understanding of science that once existed in the time of Newton and Maxwell. But that didn\u2019t happen ",

            "answer_text": "Ray Trent and Gerard Bassols touch on this. I want to add emphasis on the contrast with free will. Many people are interested about determinism not out of theoretical interest in the exact implications of physics, but in the personal, day-to-day reality of our apparent ability to make choices. If \u201cdeterminism\u201d is true, than our ability to choose from different possibilities seems like it must be illusory. There are many layers to the determinism vs. free will conundrum, but if we are down there at the fundamental particle layer, one of three things must be happening with regard to cause and effect when we \u201cmake a choice.\u201d Determinist action of particle physics is following a mechanical course of cause-and-effect, with particles giving rise to the phenomena of choosing, and particles in perfect causal and individually predictable ways also giving rise to the phenomena that appear to tbe results of choice. In this scenario, our choosing is an illusion.Probabilistic action of quantum physics is following a statistically predictable course of cause-and-effect, with some outliers due to random (unpredictable, unknowable) action. The particles are still giving rise to the phenomena of choice and consequence, with the only difference being that subatomic randomness is determining the outcomes, rather than perfect mechanical predictability. In this scenario, our choosing is still an illusion.Consciousness itself is not an \u201ceffect\u201d \u2014 it is not the result of or reducible to the action of fundamental particles in the universe. Not only that, but it must able to have an effect *on* those particles, in order for our conscious choices to have consequences. While we are understanding neurology and mental activity in greater and greater depth\u2014the fundamental nature of consciousness itself is still elusive. Accordingly, this seems like an attractive option\u2026 but only if you believe in magic. Because this is magic, miracle, or some sufficiently advanced operation of physics that is utterly beyond ANY theory, data, or evidence we have to date.The long and short of it is, unless you are relying on an unceasing stream of miracles, from the perspective of scientific understanding of cause and effect, free will \u2014 MUST be an illusion. As I mentioned, there are other layers to this; the macroscopic is not quite so clearly reducible to subatomic particles as it seems\u2014in a philosophical sense, at any rate. And there is a fourth possibility as well, which is that all the notions of \u201ctime,\u201d \u201ccause,\u201d and \u201ceffect\u201d are already macroscopic-level cognitive constructs, and the concepts of \u201cfree will\u201d or \u201cdeterminism\u201d are merely other concepts built on top of this cognitive hill of sand. It is possible that the entire business of questioning determinism and free will is already completely disengaged with the actuality of reality, launching us into a fool\u2019s errand of philosophical debate built on nothing but clouds of illusion, confusion, and miscommunication.

            "answer_text": "The answer is most probably no. I say probably because quantum mechanics works only on the quantum level and on a level above that, material is distributed probabilistically. Probabilistic doesn't mean loss of information or annihilation of hard determinism. If hard determinism proponents were to take a fresher look at quantum mechanics, then in its lack of determinism is consistently therefore determinate. That is, quantum mechanics applies to  objects on its scale. Now if you connect the possible outcomes of every experiment with their next higher level phenomenon, you'll discover that the system is consistently deterministic. For example, does the photon go through the left or right slit. Quantum mechanics says it's a coin toss. End of story at the quantum level. On the next level, you have to have a distribution and one photon is just one photon. But when you have enough photons, you'll discover that their distribution is probabilistic. I understand that I'm simplifying the problem but in order to tie hard determinism to quantum mechanics, you have to look at every universe at its own scale. Even if quantum phenomenon have effects observable on a macroscopic level as in brain functions, the nature of their outcome is deterministic. Thinking and creativity may seem increasingly random and possibly chaotic but it's too early to attribute these effects to quantum mechanics. ",

Similarly, the fact that some effects are random does not mean the physics are not determined. An example is Brownian motion, which is quite random, but it is totally causal. The underlying motion of molecules in a fluid will follow Newtonian physics - it is just that they are uncontrollable. Just because it is uncontrollable does not mean it is not deterministic, but equally being uncontrollable means neither you nor anything else can determine what it will do. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is completely deterministic; if you know \u03c8 under any given conditions, you know it for any other set of conditions, assuming you can solve the equations. (Your inability has nothing to do with the nature of physics.) Similarly, arguments re the Uncertainty Principle are usually wrong - you may not know the exact position and momentum of something, but at least for a stationary state you know the precise value of the action, i.e. their product or integral over a period. Similarly, to claim free will does not mean you abandon strict causality; it means that someone else cannot control the causes at our disposal. ",

Classical physics which describes determinism is an approximation of Quantum physics the same way Newton\u2019s laws of Physics are an approximation of Einstein\u2019s laws of relativity. This is how I explain what I have just stated. It will not be clear if we don\u2019t go through some simple mathematical derivations of laws that we can use with what is already known. On October 22nd of 2018, I published a mathematical law to prove that time is a moving wave. I did this by combining Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle and the de Broglie matter wave equation. This is how I did it:  This derivation can be continued by dropping the subscripts and the same way we do when calculating tunneling time. Since we know that the moving particle has momentum the change in energy must be kinetic energy. Substituting them in leads us to the equation: tv = \u028e/2\u03c0 In this equation (t) is time, (\u028e) is wavelength and (v) is velocity.Now the right hand side is a constant. This implies an increase in (v) which must last some time (\u2206t) such that:\u2206v/\u2206t = acceleration.But such an acceleration implies expansion of space. A decrease in (v) can also result in contraction of space. This way we may now view the change in (v) in this equation as a form of indirect expansion or contraction of space. In fact due to this reason I decided to call it the equation of co-existence of space and time.This is because an increase in (v) in the equation below results in a decrease in (t) in order for the right hand side to remain constant. A decrease in (v) results in an increase in (t). tv = \u028e/2\u03c0 This equation does not allow (t) or (v) to become zero or infinity that is why I called it the equation of co-existence of space and time without which nothing exists. This equation says if time is zero then velocity, and by extension space, is infinite and vice versa. We already know from relativity that infinite velocity in an inertial frame of reference is impossible because the limiting velocity is the speed of light. But of course in practical sense there is no uniform velocity without acceleration since every movement must start with a change in velocity from rest position. One can see from this equation that space (which is indirectly implied by a change in (v)) is also a wave by making (v) the subject of the equation. Both space and time are therefore waves. Every object or particle in nature must occupy space and must exist in time however short or long. Space and time cannot therefore be localised as we are about to see. Every particle or object has a natural frequency of vibration so it has a wave nature. In fact Young\u2019s double slit experiment is a good example of the demonstration of the non-locality of a particle like an electron. Due to its wave nature, it goes through both slits because it cannot be localised to one slit. Since every object or particle has a natural frequency and it is a wave in nature, the particle is a wave spread over an infinite space and time too is a wave spread in infinite time. The equation we derived shows space is a wave and time too is a wave. There is no particle which is not made of space or time (we mean no particle occupies zero space and does not exist in time. Everything is a wave and wave has no limit in extension. A wave is infinite in extension. Humans did not previously know that objects are waves with no limit in extension. I am researching further for details to explain the phenomenon of Quantum mechanics and how classical mechanics is an approximation of Quantum mechanics. ",

            "answer_text": "Quantum mechanics is very much in conflict with determinism from a phenomenological perspective. That is, given initial data, I cannot even in principle determine exactly what the outcomes of future experiments (phenomena) are going to be. From this point of view the occurrence of \u201cevents\u201d in nature is an entirely random process! This is in stark contrast to classical mechanics wherein, even though the practicalities of making exact predictions of complex systems is extremely hard (the weather, economies, for instance!), one could in principle predict exactly the results of future experiments if one had complete information about what a system is doing at a given instant of time (along with the relevant evolution equations!) Now quantum mechanics is not entirely in-deterministic, there is still an exactly predictable facet of the theory, but it\u2019s no longer phenomenological, as above. In quantum mechanics, the time-evolution of quantum states of some quantum mechanical system can be predicted exactly. In other words, whilst one can\u2019t uniquely predict what\u2019s going to happen at later times, one can determine exactly what the probabilities of various outcomes will be! ",

Bell's theorem - Wikipedia states that we cannot predict outcomes by knowing the state of something. Our ability to predict quantum phenomena is not down to lack of knowledge, or theoretical model. If this interpretation is true, that means this universe is not deterministic in the classical sense. Einstein was wrong, and god does indeed play dice with the universe.

I notice that the question is tagged \u201cfree will\u201d and I suspect that the someone is hatching a flawed argument. This flawed argument would go something like this. A deterministic universe means free will is impossible. therefore, a non-deterministic universe restores free will! We are all saved! This is not the case. If human actions are forced by non-caused, non-predictable, random quantum coin tosses, that is not freedom. It\u2019s merely unpredictability. An action forced in this way is not free. And it certainly is not willed. ",

So in that sense HUP is meaningless in terms of randomizing event and making them unpredictable.

Things like the aluminum ion clock experiments showing shifts in the rate of a clock set moving at a few m/s, or raised by a foot, measure relativistic shifts of a few parts in 10 exponent>16.

He has very little free will, as his choices only exist within certain bounds. Determinism is a product of the enlightenment rooted in the Calvinist idea of predestination and the new math and physical principles discovered by people like Kepler and Newton. Although the math behind determinism started to unravel in the early 20th century, determinism is a core assumption in socialism, communism, and contemporary leftism. A lot of intellectual schools like modern psychology, economics, political science also rely on determinism to support various theories and assumptions. As computers developed, scientists began to apply them to start building models of the universe. When scientists started trying to do calculations regarding how many different ways a relatively simple system like a break in a game of billiards could go, or how many chess games could be played, they began to realize that these systems are far too complex to reasonably be able to model for a prolonged period of time. When trying to model these kinds of systems, mathematicians have stumbled across the largest numbers used to date like, Graham\u2019s Number and Tree 3. In short, we seem to live in a world that has infinite possibilities. The upshot of this math from a practical perspective is that there is undeniable that we have an element of free will. There is certainly enough chaos in the universe to suggest that a person can influence the universe through his free will. There is no question that the choices that we consciously make will affect the circumstances of our lives, our emotions, and the people around us. People do have an element of control over their lives. However, there is debate over to what extent a person\u2019s free will is bounded. The Christians hold that when God endowed man with dignity he gave him free will. With the gift of free will, God endowed man with infinite potential when guided by God\u2019s love. Humans are the only species after all, that can move mountains. While a beaver might be able to move a few branches to build a damn, man can build nuclear reactors and space ships. We have access to all of these metaphysical faculties like the ability to do math, apply logic, speak in a language, etc. that are totally to all other animals. Christianity holds that man can accomplish infinite good in the world using these faculties in concert with their free will, guided by God\u2019s love. ",

Hard determinism is no more than taking the basis for reality as the four dimensional space-time in which effect must follow cause. In such a reality, there is no room for free choice\u2014in every instance an underlying cause must invariably drive whatever choice is made.

Subjectively, the view of the world is one in which there is a past, a present and a future. The past is unchangeable and unavailable for direct access.

The future is absolutely unknowable, The subject\u2019s self lives entirely in the present.

            "answer_text": "Quantum Physics doesn't disprove determinism. What Quantum Physics does do is significantly complicate the task of arguing for determinism. Put in the simplest possible terms, the Uncertainty Principle indicates that: 1) our observation of an event has a significant effect on the event, and 2) it is impossible for a single observation to observe all relevant properties of an event. This means that any argument for determinism can no longer have simple recourse to the notion of observation. So, when you say: My belief of determinism is generally that if you knew every single variable that existed as a factor at the very beginning and birth of the universe, you could correctly determine all properties of any individual particle at any point in time. You instantly run into trouble, because we can't know every single variable that existed as a factor at any point in time (including the initial state) through any type of observation. ",

I mean, if you have enough neurons in one place, coupled together strongly enough, what do you expect to emerge? It\u2019s just silly to try to decide if you really have free will or only seem to. What functional difference does it make?\u201d That quantum physics, always the kidder! ",

According to the standard theory of quantum mechanics, which has been experimentally verified countless times, the outcome of a measurement of a system is determined only probabilistically.* Thus, the outcome of experiments can not be determined by their initial conditions, i.e. the theory is not deterministic. There have been attempts to modify quantum mechanics to preserve determinism using so called \"hidden variables.\" Although, these theories must violate the principle of locality (see Bell inequalities). *(As long as you are not measuring a system already in an eigenstate of your measurement operator) ",

            "answer_text": "First you need to clarify what do you mean by deterministic. There are 2 sorts of chaos, stochastic chaos and deterministic chaos. Stochastic chaos arises from truly random processes and it is really unpredictable. Deterministic chaos arises from perfectly deterministic laws, it\u2019s just that the sensitivity to the initial conditions is such that in practice it becomes impossible to predict the precise outcome, but we can still make probabilistic predictions (which become less and less accurate the more we let the system evolve). Quantum mechanics is not random as some people sometimes seem to imply. Not at all, it is probabilistic. For many down-to-earth questions we can make incredibly reliable predictions using quantum mechanics, so it is very very close to being totally deterministic. It is only when we try to use the theory to predict the outcome of very fine details that we hit its probabilistic nature and we become unable to predict the precise outcome but only a probabilistic one. However, the biggest problem we hit in such questions comes from our supposed freewill. Science is done by human scientists, and inevitably they become part of the experiments they perform. It is completely unclear whether human freewill exists or not. If it does not, the outcome of the experiments will be deterministic although possibly only in a probabilistic sense of the term. But if the human freewill is true, then the outcomes of experiments done by humans become genuinely unpredictable. ",

            "answer_text": "A slightly different slant on this. Might I suggest that neither is responsible, or otherwise, for uncertainty in the world. Uncertainty is ordained by nature by the simple expediency of allowing two valid answers to the square root of one; plus & minus one. By this simple trick, nothing is certain. Yes, in the universe we experience, our senses register that if we have a cabbage and acquire another we have two cabbages but i suggest this doesn\u2019t necessarily hold in all cases. It gets worse because there are four, fourth roots of one, adding more complexity, diversity to life. see chart below  For all integers (including zero), the powers of one give a single, solitary solution. +1. Compare with the complexity afforded by the roots of one. doesn\u2019t this better depict life as we observe it? This makes it impossible to know for certain the outcome of any cause, made worse by the knowledge that the future never exists. Predictions are only ever that; predictions. Schrodinger\u2019s cat is an example of nature\u2019s delicious paradox. The unopened box allows the mortality of the cat to be expressed not by any quantum effect but by nature\u2019s rule that there are always two solutions, plus one (alive) or minus one (dead).

Quantum mechanics, especially Bell\u2019s inequalities, show that it is impossible to predict the outcome of some event based on the information that is available to you. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the outcome of these events isn\u2019t predetermined in a philosophical sense. Some rather popular interpretations of Quantum Mechanics, like Bohmian Mechanics and Everet\u2019s Many World Theory, maintain determinism, and even the Copenhagen interpretation can be viewed in a deterministic light. The reason it is so difficult to answer the question of philosophical determinism, is that it doesn\u2019t make a difference to our lives (If it did then we could simply observe its impact). ",

Randomness can be a part of causation, but randomness that is time-dependent is not randomness. In processes we have x-bar and R charts to tell us when something has caused a process to deviate from a random-process so that corrective actions can be implemented. The root-cause of the change is always deterministic. x\u0305 and R chart - Wikipedia A full understanding of the universe requires degrees-of-freedom that I don\u2019t think we have in the deterministic sense. If you take the leap that our senses are an illusion, then the reliability of our analysis is also illusory. In addition there can be multiple-causes that act simultaneously to produce an effect and they may or may not be inter-related. They become joint-causes. Going back in time with full knowledge of the present \u2014 breaks some laws of the universe as we know them, hence I don\u2019t see this deterministic argument as buying that much. It\u2019s like saying: What-if I can break the laws of the universe to prove that the universe obeys them and I\u2019m part of the universe? I must step out of myself and the universe where my body resides. Even if I could do that, I can\u2019t trust my senses to understand what I see in a deterministic view. When I step out of my deterministic universe that controls everything I think and do \u2014 my mind works differently or it stops functioning altogether \u2014 otherwise my mind was not controlled by a deterministic universe to start with. I can\u2019t have my cake and eat it too. Apparently it would take free-will and/or some alternate reference point outside our universe in order to fully understand the universe we live in. ",

However, the only thing we know for sure is that QM limits our knowledge, and the collapse can simply be interpreted as gaining knowledge about some quantities (and losing knowledge about others as we perturb the system). In the no-collapse approach of Everett, the state keeps evolving deterministically even during measurement. (This does not have to imply \u201cmany worlds\u201d). So as humans being made of quantum objects we can never fully determine the future. Some have the opinion this implies nature itself is not deterministic, but that\u2019s an opinion. ",

It would seem to preclude what we intuitively mean by free will. However, it can be modeled as a deterministic system with a (nonlocal) hidden variable, so we will regard it that way for our convenience. In other words, we can lump randomness together with determinism. A hidden variable implies a mapping from a space of hard determinism to the space of our existence. The space of our existence has fewer dimensions than the deterministic space. Although free will is impossible in the deterministic space, I can find no such limitation in the smaller space. The smaller space is our universe. Therefore it is not proved that free will is impossible in our universe. ",

Still, some aspects can be cleared up and some wrong contentions rejected. One is the assumption that conscious decisions of a human mind were the causal result of material processes, be they deterministic, chaotic or random. This does not contradict the fact that decisions sometimes can be influenced by material means, like drugs. But they are not caused by material processes. Instead, from what we can observe, the whole realm of will, consciousness, perception etc. is organized and only understandable as teleological, whereas causality, which is an opposite principle, with its subfeatures randomness, determinism or chaos applies only to matter. Nobody is able to explain the realm of consciousness as a causal product of material processes. It is just an assertion that materialists make, that there has to be such a connection. But this is only owed to the metaphysical assumption that the world consists only of matter and its physical laws, and all the rest including life and consciousness are only emergent effects of it.

This definition is quite sufficient to understand all religious and moral usage of the term. Random and chaotic processes may play several roles: They make it impossible for you to reason accurately about how things will turn out, so you may make decisions that you thought were OK, but that have bad results. To some extent you can learn to account for this, but not completely.Random and chaotic processes may, in a machine, help to give the illusion of free will (I.e. of memory, which the machine may have, and a human reasoning process, which so far they do not, and their plans are overly simple without the random inputs).Random and chaotic processes may play a role in shaping how humans think and behave, through both their experiences (the memory part), and their genetic and cultural basis. Microbes have been observed developing new genes in response to hostile environments. It is likely all life forms do. There is an extremely elaborate system for reshuffling the genes humans have, to find adaptive combinations (meiosis, basically). Functional free will, as I have defined it, in almost any measure would be useful in at least some circumstances. It is particularly useful in forming cooperative relationships in which hostility is not automatic. This was (perhaps formerly, given the way things are going the last few decades) a strong point of our species, as well as a principle tenet of our moral and ethical systems which first coined the term \u201cfree will.\u201dDeterminism is in evidence when you find your friends can predict what you will say and what you will do. Obviously when that happens, it is not random. However, if you wish to change it in the future, your memory of the episode can alert you to recurrence, and enable a different choice. ",

The most probable future is an energetic complete picture of a probable future, what is ready to unfold in a present moment, when the sequential time of placement has arrived. Every smallest time frame, last 1 to the -43 second. This frame is static, the next frame has a little change, created by thoughts. For the awarenesses, these frames observed sequentially, life start to become dynamic and can be observed through the filter on the awareness of the Soul. This filter create our senses, and the illusion of energy into material, objects, pictures, sounds, feelings, etc. When people choose in the meantime new thoughts, this will cause a wrinkle or a butter fly effect into the most probable future, it will change as long as it has not been unfolded into a present moment. That is the reason why prophets and psychics are allowed to see this most probable future, so they can advice people to change their thoughts, or not. Depending on a pure positive outcome in the future, or a negative outcome in the future. When we change as awarenesses our thoughts directive, we can decide what future we would like to experience. Still there is only one future in our apparently material dimension, created by the thoughts of all awarenesses connected to earth. Only when the most probable future unfolds into the present moment, it becomes \u201creality\u201d.  Look what Einstein said, and please do realize that imagination, visualization and fantasy are also thoughts. So he could have stated: All thoughts is everything, because it is who we are as a conscious Soul. Thoughts we have is the preview, of life\u2019s coming attractions, as a future that will unfold in the present moment. The future is just a result of choices of thoughts humans and other awarenesses embrace aware or unaware. Choose well. With best regards, Thomas Francisco Pelgero ",

Chaos theory belongs to non-linear complexity physics. Quantum indeterminacy (not randomness)arises from wave-particle duality whose observable significance is related to the smallness of Planck\u2019s constant, and therefore becomes crucial only in microcosmic physics. Freewill is related to the hypercomplex domain human psychology, and has not yet been reduced to any physical laws. [And may nver be, but one cannot predict the future.] 20 Aug 17 ",
