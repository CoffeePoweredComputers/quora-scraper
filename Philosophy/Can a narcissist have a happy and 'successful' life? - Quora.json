            "answer_text": "Lots and lots of answers here, all respectable, and yet, it would seem, all from, shall we say, outsiders. I\u2019d like to share a perspective \u201cfrom the inside\u201d. It\u2019s a small data set, but it\u2019s accurate for what it represents. (And of course it is not an exhaustive explanation.) The answer from this \u201cinsider\u201d is yes, and yes, with some important caveats. Many of the answers below describe narcissism pretty well, but incompletely. I will try to share some salient points that may have been missing in others\u2019 answers. Again, from an insider\u2019s perspective. A narcissist doesn\u2019t really know he\u2019s a narcissist. And he has no idea he\u2019s insecure. And he has no idea why people don\u2019t understand that he\u2019s right. This perplexing problem arises from very low-level code running in the consciousness of a narcissist. And that program is: \u201cThe world is as I say it is. Anything in my experience that conflicts with my perceptions of how things are/should be is an error in reality that must be understood, accounted for, and mitigated or corrected through my clever machinations.\u201d The behavior that results - or rather, the motivation for that behavior - is not selfishness as we commonly understand it. It is not manipulation by a con man. That kind of behavior is code running way above the narcissism layer. Those people are not mentally ill. They\u2019re just dicks. What it is, instead, is an ardent striving to make the world behave as it should. This lens is the reason we see narcissists treating everything, including people, as objects to be manipulated. It\u2019s all about making lived experience match the internal projection (not the other way around, as most of us have learned). Read that again. What you perceive as selfishness and manipulation is actually an attempt to \u201cfix\u201d a world that is not operating as it should. What are some of those machinations? PersuasionFlatteryCompelling story-telling (which you might at times experience as gaslighting)Shapeshifting (which you might at times experience as lack of authenticity).Let\u2019s focus on the last one, because it\u2019s illuminating to the inner world of the narcissist. The narcissist has no idea that he\u2019s insecure. He\u2019s so insecure, at such a deep level, that his ego is actually covering up every indication of insecurity by projecting dysfunction onto the external world. From his frame of reference, he\u2019s not insecure. - he\u2019s right - 99.99% of the time - and you just can\u2019t see it yet. So his job is to make you see it, so that yet another error in reality can be corrected. To that end, he will shape-shift - he will be whoever, whatever, he needs to be to get you to see what he sees. For example, to get you to see how good a person he is, so that You will not be disappointed, so that you will not be hurt. So that you will be able to enjoy a perfected reality, and,You will like him, and perform for him, and inject the pleasure into his life that he perceives should be there, if the world were operating correctly.This is not an act of cruelty. It\u2019s an act of service, and to some extent, an effort at enlightenment. Until you fail to become enlightened. And eventually the process of shapeshifting becomes exhausting, and he has to, out of self-preservation, abandon his attempt to enlighten you. And then you become intolerable - an intimate, and therefore intolerable, error in reality - and he needs to escape from you. But it\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t care about you. He does. Often deeply. But you\u2019re broken, and therefor toxic, and so he can only hang out with you while you\u2019re able to see clearly. And when you can\u2019t, it\u2019s too painful. The common perception is that the narcissist feels threatened. But that\u2019s not his perception. His perception is that you\u2019re just wrong, and maybe a bit pitiful for being unable to see and grow and understand the truth. And, sadly, irritating for that. Does this sound like a cult leader? Yes? Good. You\u2019re catching on. It\u2019s a mistake to presume that a narcissist has mal-intent. I think, honestly, that it\u2019s the opposite. But because the a priori position of a narcissist is that his view is the correct one, the only way he can help you is to help you to see as he sees. Perhaps that\u2019s enough preamble. So can a narcissist be happy and successful? My limited data-set says that there is a slim chance that a narcissist can discover and admit that he is a narcissist, and through deep internal work, can relinquish the notion that he\u2019s always right, can see the error in the programming, and can begin to embrace the world as it is, without needing to bend it to his perception. And then, the narcissist can begin to learn to be truly successful and truly happy. As many have pointed out, a run-of-the-mill narcissist can find material success. Perhaps more easily than many others. The \u201creality distortion field\u201d a narcissist emits often magnetically harnesses the efforts of others to create fantastic material changes in the world. One might experience this skill-set and describe it as \u201cleadership\u201d, or \u201cvision\u201d. In fact, many of our most \u201csuccessful\u201d members of society have deep narcissistic tendencies, and the more successful they are, the more likely they have, at varying levels of intensity, \u201cbent reality\u201d to their will, for good or ill, and to the benefit or detriment to those around them. Happiness\u2026 and the more ephemeral, spiritual, humane success? That\u2019s the hard part. The neural programming of a narcissist is very deep, and can catch the energy of even the most conscious narcissist unawares, dropping him back into old patterns. It helps to have someone close able to call him out, and remind him of his tendencies (tough, because even a recovering narcissist can keep hiding his true self, making real inter-personal intimacy very rare). And then, if we\u2019re lucky, over time, the possibility exists that all the amazing skills that a narcissist has developed over the years to \u201cfix\u201d reality can be turned. Towards service. Serving the needs of others, and the broader agenda of lovingkindness, from a place of humility - that\u2019s the winning slot. A tough transition for a narcissist. But if he can get there, he can be both happy and successful. Fulfilled even. It\u2019s a long shot. But sometimes it happens. Think of \u201cHow the Grinch Stole Christmas\u201d. A happy ending. Think of Apple Computers. A blessing in many ways. Think of Donald Trump, and Mitch McConnell. Like I said. It\u2019s a long shot. Meanwhile, be prepared for unrelenting assumptions that the external world is clearly wrong, and the narcissist is clearly right. If he can break that mind-set, there\u2019s a chance. If he can\u2019t \u2026 well \u2026 as someone else suggested, enjoy the parts of the ride that are fun, but don\u2019t get attached. One last thought: Narcissism runs rampant in White-Male-Western-European/American-Patriarchy. It\u2019s not a bug - it\u2019s a feature. It\u2019s \u201cworked\u201d phenomenally well for centuries. We have reshaped the world, bent it to our will. Made reality to be as we have envisioned it. Have we been successful?Are we happy? ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Chris, thanks for the ask. I guess it depends on how one defines success. My ex narc has a beautiful home, almost paid off and he's getting ready to install a pool, he has exotic cars and wads of cash in his pocket most of the time. He can do anything and go anywhere he wants, any time he wants. He built his business here in the valley from the ground up and was the pioneer in his field in the beginning, and now the one that his competitors try to imitate. He has women falling all over him all the time and wanting to be a permanent part of his life. He is well known, (at least his surface self) in the community and at the local Catholic church, to which he donated several hundred thousand dollars to help pay for he construction years ago. So I guess you could say he has success. Happiness? Absolutely not. He has 6 children, only two of them really talk to him. The youngest, because she is still a minor and lives with him half the time. And the second youngest because he works for his dad's company and they talk about work. The second oldest talks to him but doesn't come around much, doesn't confide in him and generally keeps him at an arms length. The oldest hasn\u2019t talked to him in over 4 years. The other two come around on Thanksgiving or Christmas and call on his birthday that's about it. He doesn't have any friends and his family (8 living siblings plus the in-laws) have a very difficult time hiding their disdain for him. So they've just given up and are pretty out in the open about it. It's easier than trying to hide it. His neices and nephews can't stand him except for one or two he is close with. The only reason he makes the 10 hour trip back home is to see his parents. But once they are gone I doubt he'll go there much. He tried for a long time to marry me and I loved him but I knew he didn't really love me. It was very difficult because I genuinely did love him. So success, yes I guess. If success is all the material things. Happiness will be elusive to him until the day he dies. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. My former NPD had an excellent job in the computer/IT technology field. It certainly is a lucrative paying job. He seems to have some problems finding or maintaining work in the field for awhile. He had some issues a few years back with a on-site office version of his job with other employees. They were apparently finding him threatening, loud and rude. Some truly feared him. I\u2019d imagine that was likely true, considering his behavior around myself and my family. His boss and HR department sent him to work remotely from home for about a year, while the complaints and allegations were sorted out. He was eventually terminated of course. He seemed to really enjoy working remotely, as he didn\u2019t have to really work much without any supervision, and made sure to only accomplish the bare minimum to keep future expectations low, and could abuse drugs freely all day. He only pursues remote jobs now, which all considered is probably a good fit. He doesn\u2019t seem to be able to maintain employment for very long though, due to contracts not being refilled for him. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s just due to the nature of the field, a potentially unstable hostile personality or setting the bar just too low to appear accomplished in his work. When he does work, he makes excellent money though. As far as happiness, I\u2019m not sure. How happy can someone really be when they have to blame a specific target for all their problems and issues in their life? When they continually cause conflicts for purposes of getting attention, making \u201cinteresting\u201d topics of conversation for pity ploys. It seems like a dark existence to me to live like that, always avoiding any accountability by hurting those closest to you, in order to feel \u201cpopular\u201d in a contrived world for everyone around you. Like some performer on a stage. Watching your partners leave you one by one\u2026 your children leave you\u2026 all those you hurt leave, wanting no contact ever again because of the scope of the abuses. Always having to create a character for yourself to make people like you. So many lies to have to keep straight in your head. I guess just make up a story for each potential obstacle and stick with it, but it has to get challenging to remember it all after awhile. And are they actually so delusional that they start to believe it and really live it, or do they just rationalize it as a necessary action caused by the other person\u2018s perceived slights each time? Hell, I get a little stressed just trying to wrap my head around it, can\u2019t imagine actually living like that. It just doesn\u2019t seem like that would really be a genuinely happy life\u2026 But they certainly seem to be able to find some joy through showing off nice possessions, acquisitions, financial accomplishments, and other nice things that they have that other people might envy, so maybe that really is enough for them? Maybe that feeling of superiority that they possess and crave really is all they need to feel fulfilled. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, like master kenobi said, that depends greatly your own point of view. If by happy and successful you mean, a complete 180 from where the narcissist is now, no more devaluing and discarding, no more smear campaigning and the rest, yes I think they can. Can, being the operative word here. They absolutely can. Anybody can. Will they, probably not. Firstly it would take tremendous amounts of work, and we all know the narcissist isn't going to make that effort. Secondly, they won't believe anyone who tells them there's something wrong with them in the first place. So it will never get to the putting in work stage. Now, if we're looking from the narcissists point of view, where they find someone who checks every one of their boxes, financially, emotionally, psychologically, and esthetically, whom obeys without question and hops too when prompted, and will never let the narcissist down, then the answer here is also yes. It, like all things is absolutely possible. Is it very probable, no. The narcissist, will always find something wrong and or get bored with their current SO, because thats all they received from their caregivers, during their devaluation. And yes, it was a devaluation, just like yours and mine. Their caregivers always found something wrong with the narcissists efforts. No matter how hard they tried, and how proud of themselves they may have been. And if they didn't find fault, they showed no interest, or what appeared to be boredom instead. To be perfectly honest, the narcissist never had a chance at a happy and normal life. They can achieve one, but the nature of their disorder won't allow it. Or very rarely anyway. I find that terribly terribly sad. They know exactly what they want, which is the same thing as all of us, but they themselves won't allow themselves to achieve it. Their disorder has them constantly chasing down Perfection, while simultaneously shooting down every candidate and their efforts. As a personal aside, I sincerely hope my narcissist either puts in the effort and finally, fully heals, or if not, finds the unicorn. That person I spoke of earlier that checks all of their boxes. Everyone, even our narcissists deserve a happy ending. I hope this answer helps. B ",

            "answer_text": "To the outside world, my pwNPD probably looked like he had a happy and successful life. Nothing could be further from the truth. He liked it to look that way. He was a controller. He wanted to control everything. This attitude made him into an organiser. So his controlling personality honed organising skills, all helped along with manipulative tactics, gave him the ability to get what he wanted. The drive behind all this was a penchant for showing off. He had to have the best cars. The best everything actually, but particularly cars. There was a time when he arranged a mortgage against his house to buy a new Mercedes Benz. He couldn\u2019t afford the model with the 500 V8 engine and had to be content with the smaller and cheaper 6 cylinder model. But not being one to miss an opportunity to show off, he went to the parts department and bought the badge for the 500V8 and stuck it on the back of the car to fool everyone! But I digress. The reality of this mans life was that he never did do anything. It was all done by his minions, those he controlled, manipulated and used. He was like an orchestra conductor, standing in the middle, waving his arms about as he directed all the things he wanted done. When anything was finally complete, he stood proud, accepting the accolades that then came to him. He probably looked happy while he posed with his car, or successful when he took a bow in front of the admiring crowd after some \u201cachievement\u201d, but those of us who were close knew different. There\u2019s no real happiness behind that mask, and the only success he can really lay claim to is his ability to dupe others into carrying out his work and projects. ",

Do you believe that? Her friends told her \u201chey your boyfriends getting married tonight.\u201d That\u2019s how bad my ex was. after our marriage he still spoke to her for hours on some days and discarded her on his desired days. I asked why she would talk to him after he played with her like that? The answer was because she thought she could break his marriage. How delusional she was. After 7 years into our marriage she contacted him again, she was married with 2 kids he married to me with 2 also. He used to talk to her for hours telling her how much he hates me. later on because of a misunderstanding I created between them, they stopped talking to each other. She told me I would have to worry about the other women he was cheating on me with. I never believed her then. Today, I realized I was on a hella rollercoaster. That man went from being a normal cheater to a psychopath narcissist, personality disorder traits, bipolar tendencies, and delusional behaviors. He dropped down and became a complete mental mess. He divorced me blamed me for abusing him when I learned to be silent. He did so much to me and my children I can\u2019t write here. conclusion, we are divorced. Is he headed towards success? He\u2019s 45 old and ugly. He lost weight by his own free will thinking being skinny will make him look like a young man when he looks like he has a disease instead. He wears some weird turquoise ring which makes his hands look like witch hands. His eyes look like frog eyes because his skin is sagging. He\u2019s looking for a new start to his new life by changing his physical look, dressing style and new supplies. He has teenagers kids. I don\u2019t think he can find success at that age knowing he wronged as all by his oppression. how can anyone who oppressed any human or animal have any success? It is as if they are under a mountain which is about to fall on them any moment based on their own choices. It\u2019s only a matter of time they get crushed by their negative choices and oppression they bought upon innocent people who were only hopeful for their love. ",

            "answer_text": "Usually, Narcs have more than one maladies\u2026 depends on what they struggle with\u2026 I will copy this note, but I don\u2019t like these long winded responses: When we have a conscious over something, we experience emotion and sometimes pain. When people feel emotional pain, the same areas of the brain get activated as when people feel physical pain in the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex. These regions are activated when people experienced a social rejection from peers. The same regions are activated when people who had recently broken up with romantic partners viewed pictures of the former partner. There is a power we have in relationships and it is not limited to domination and submission. That power is understood to be the respective abilities of each person in the connection to influence each other and direct the relationship. This is a very complex element in romantic partnerships when the elitist in the relationship takes control of those complex elements. Having power means to have a sense of control, to exercise choices and the ability to influence our environment and others. It's a natural and healthy instinct to exert our power to get our wants and needs met. Many relationships have power imbalances. If we\u2019ve denied our power and don\u2019t express ourselves for any of the above reasons, it\u2019s natural for someone else to fill the vacuum. Often in codependent relationships, one partner may be an addict, narcissist, or abuser assumes to wield power over the other. Usually the submissive partner attempts to exert influence in indirect or passive-aggressive ways, such as withholding. Chronic lack of power can lead to depression, anxiety and other physical symptoms. Psychologically speaking, narcissism is a personality trait that every person possesses to some degree. Like any personal characteristic, it exists on a spectrum. Everyone falls somewhere along the narcissism continuum. Certain amounts of self-centeredness are healthy. It contributes to confidence, resilience, and ambition and certain agencies search out individuals with these traits. Nevertheless, any personality trait taken to an extreme can become pathological. A person who is excessively high in narcissism is said to have NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder), which is a diagnosable mental illness. The typical Narc is not oblivious to their condition, they have been conditioned, they are not Zombies. Love and friendship is something that most humans want and their intellect tells them to do these strange feats in that quest. They have developed unusual defense mechanisms similar to fight or flight. Some function quite well, some are monogamous, some are great providers because that\u2019s what drives them\u2026 then some really need God\u2019s help ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience in knowing two narcissists, I would say unlikely to be successful and not happy. While a narc could make a lot of money, the two I know spend money to fill the void and show everyone how successful they are. They spend beyond their means because they never have enough \u201cstuff.\u201d So making tons of money but sitting in debt and unable to pay charge cards means they have undermined their success by pissing it all away. This material crap is not investments but rather buying ugly, out of style expensive clothing. Buying rounds of drinks and dining out at fancy restaurants to show off. All things that don\u2019t hold value. Narcs often exaggerate their careers, credentials, income or success. Again, people get wise to these lies. Happy? Sadly no. They enjoy hurting other people to make themselves feel better. If you are not in the room, you are being talked about in a negative way. It\u2019s called splitting. Nice to your face and then talk behind your back. When you live life like this is creates paranoia. So how can someone be happy when they are constantly worried the people they are \u201csplitting\u201d will compare notes? Narcs lie but lie so often they can\u2019t keep it all straight. They usually tell the same story to the same people but the facts change each time. People eventually sense something is wrong. Then they distance themselves from the Narc. For this reason the Narc is burning through friends and significant others. Once his/her cover is blown he/she has to find a new victim/supply. People who are not Narcs define happiness differently. Constantly living with all these secrets and scams just waiting to get caught in a lie or cheating on the spouse again. It sounds like a lot of work and constantly cycling through people leaves the people I know in fear of being alone. They can\u2019t stand to be alone. How is that happiness? ",

            "answer_text": "Can a narcissist have a happy and \u201csuccessful\u201d life? What a good question and thank you for the A2A I believe a narcissist can have a \u201csuccessful\u201d life. If successful is a term used superficially, a person can appear to be very successful to others. So what is our definition of success? Lots of money? Lots of material things? Yes, I believe a narcissist can attain those. Is this life an empty one? I KNOW it would be for me. I have had \u201cthe material goods\u201d at times in my life. But this is not the way of happiness. However, can a narcissist have a successful life in terms of relationships with others? My opinion is no or not likely. Let\u2019s picture someone with a solid personal life\u2026a home life. If our goal is to NURTURE love with a spouse and have normally developed children, then sadly, I believe a narcissist would fall short. Then let\u2019s look at happiness\u2026I read that in some opinion polls conducted, narcissists are happier than most people! How about that! They are able to pick up relationships and drop them off at will. Maybe that makes for \u201chappy\u201d people, I don\u2019t know? When people get everything they want I believe they are usually unhappy. And the reason I believe that is because the thrill of the chase is what we go for. I\u2019m referring to the chase as being setting a goal and going after that goal. If we suppose a guy meets a girl and all she wants out of life is to have a large house\u2026she gets that from him but she doesn\u2019t particularly have feelings for him. Is he going to be happy? So it depends on what you want. The point here is that a narcissist does not have the CHOICE of a life with more interesting, multi-faceted people. The narcissist\u2019s choices are entirely different. They are based on different needs. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. I\u2019ll explain why. Why yes: Like non-narcissists (neuro typicals) narcissists have varying degrees of financial and professional success. They can reach the top echelons of their profession. Other narcissists sponge off of others their entire life. Some develop substance abuse. But, yes, certain narcissists can have a successful life. And, yes, they can have moments of happiness. Why no: From my research, I\u2019ve understood that the vast majority if not all narcissists suffered terrible childhood abuse and/or neglect. They developed by 2 or 3 years old a defense mechanism to ensure their survival: narcissism. And you are certain to endure serious emotional abuse/trauma if you spend large amounts of time with them. It is a \u201cme first\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t trust anyone\u201d con man personality that involves a life of deception, lies, non accountability, gaslighting, triangulating etc. Yes, they might have moments of happiness but deep seated peace and joy? Very doubtful. The most insightful comment said by a Narcissist I dated for several years was this: \u201cI wish I had your sense of calm and happiness. I am almost jealous of the happiness I see in your eyes.\u201d He then proceeded to try and stamp out the happiness he saw within me with every emotional manipulation he possessed. He succeeded. For a time. It was hard to regain\u2014-but, sadly, he will never have deep happiness. ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is YES! I could not go inside him to feel how he felt while he was with me but he confessed me many times, how happy he was and how proud he was for having me and our child. He was not telling lies because he proudly told some of his relatives sometimes how I was a respectable person and our child was a special one. But his feelings are inconsistent. He told these relatives as well how bad I and my child was. So there are times he must be happy. Interestingly, when he was unhappy, his NPD was gone temporarily and he was quiet, nice and polite. For example, when he was told he would have a big operation transplanting his aorta, he was unhappy and worried about his health and then he was so nice to me for about two weeks while waiting for his operation days. In my experience, whenever he was unhappy with health issues or something like car accident or receiving complaints to his business , etc, he treated us OK. He was more likely to be a trouble maker to us when he had no issues or problems bothering him. I think the people with NPD could be a complete happy person and they are happy with what they are doing to the others making them unhappy. They could be successful because a narcissism is need to be successful and they are perfectionist wanting a perfect and successful life. And its even easier for the ones with NPD to be successful because they use the others (including their other half) to climb the stairs to get to the stage. My case is a good example. He lied and manipulated me for years using me in his business making his business successful by my help day and night! ",

            "answer_text": "The ex narcissist I was with was 49yrs old when it ended. From what I see now that the fog has cleared is that they don\u2019t change. What I mean is they do not seem to grow or evolve, quite the opposite actually. More importantly he did not want to change, he knew what he was and liked it. What I saw was a middle aged man who learned to lie, deceive and manipulate with more skill then when he was doing it at 20yrs old. He also seemed to be at ease with causing pain and a deep sense of entitlement to take or live life however he wanted and was responsible to no one. You and I can plainly see a downside to lying, deceiving, using people and so on\u2026.The Narc can not. They feel a deep sense of victimization to their life. So again, you and i can plainly see a downside to being paralyzed in feeling like a victim to your own life but again the narc can not. Nor do they care to fix it or change. Remember they do not grow or evolve at all. They are paralyzed. So to answer your question, in my opinion the answer is no. The narcissist wants what you and I can easily do which is to grow and evolve which generates connections and relationships which pushes us to build on our love and compassion and empathy. We flourish while the narc destroys because he is paralyzed and unable or unwilling to grow in any way. It simply is not possible to have a truly happy life without this or at least the desire for it. we all define our own happiness but first you must be able to grow so you can discover you aren't happy. Any \u201crelationship\u201d with a narc for any amount of time will drain you of your happiness because they do not posses it and cannot generate it themselves. They will never change so happiness is never achieved. Its very sad. Regardless, get away as fast as possible and cut them out of your life. Grow and evolve = happiness. ",

            "answer_text": "Careful about that \u201cnarcissist\u201d diagnosis, since I doubt a professional diagnosis has been made there. You may be asking about some person who has some narcissistic TENDENCIES, and many of us do, so I\u2019d say \u201cyes\u201d, a narcissist can have a happy and successful life. But, I also want you to think about your definition of \u201csuccess\u201d here. Is it financial success that you\u2019re thinking of? I suspect it is, since that\u2019s what many of us mean when we say \u201csuccess\u201d, and it\u2019s FAR from the only, or the best, definition of success. A person with narcissistic tendencies CAN make changes to their personalities, whereas those who have a real personality disorder (the TRUE diagnosis) will be less able to make changes, and MUCH less inclined to do so. Real narcissists can be quite successful financially, as their particular disorder suits the accumulation of wealth and power most easily. And, they are less bothered by any considerations of what all this does to people along the way who they have stepped on or hurt or disadvantaged in their climb to wealth/power. Trump is a true narcissist of the most extreme kind. And we probably all know people who have those TENDENCIES, but are not as lethal or as profoundly self-centered as Trump. And, as for the \u201chappiness\u201d part of our question, I believe that the more closely one approaches a true and undiluted narcissism, the less possibility they would be truly happy people. Human happiness largely relies on human relationships, closeness, warmth of concern, mutual support and guidance, and the real narcissist will have little of that in his life - not much need for it and little desire for any of that complication. They may want APPLAUSE, but no closeness. They may want FOLLOWERS, but no real partners. ",

And if it is true in part they are seeking intimate trustworthy companionship they have the sad polar opposite of pushing that away at all chance. therefore it would be like the Narcissis story of olden days, perennial curse of unrequited love (of self or others). they are On the one hand considered to have no conscience or moral compass, devoid of all empathy (except logical inference called cognitive empathy which has nothing to do with care and concern but rather is a tool for manipulation ) and then on the other hand considered tragically thwarted at interpersonal cooperation. it just sucks. When they slowed my narcissist down enough to not be so damned anxious that someone was out to get him so by God he was going to get them all first, and handily so (sigh),by giving him citalopram Wellbutrin and three times a day low-dose Clonopin he actually could communicate and it was quite interesting. and calm. no he did not stay on it because it felt unusual to him. Certainly it would because he\u2019s so used to all the high adrenaline drama, and no one talked him through potentially weaning himself off that addiction. (drats). There is a wide spectrum perhaps they can in their own mind believe they are succeeding. and happy. I think a lot of people do not share their idea of \u201csuccess\u201d. or \u201chappy\u201d. I can only wish that my narcissist stays safe and out of trouble doesn\u2019t wreak terrifying havoc on the world and somehow has some semblance of a peaceful last third of his life.he is presently 62. i am blissfully zero full-on no contact i now remember who i really am. i like me. we can recover.

            "answer_text": "I have been in contact with many narcissists and other people with various forms of personality disorders, and this is what I found. The narcissists is only happy for a short while in their lives, this often happens when they are in the role of manipulating / controlling someone to obtain the attention from that person. While in a relationship the narcissist will feel a boost to their ego when they are being admired/ praised and full attention is all on them. But then as we know, a relationship will not last long with a narcissist. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are married or single, their happiness will fade, and they are wanting someone new to put that spark of ego boost back into their lives. As for being successful, well that depends on various levels you are referring to. Maybe they might be financially wealthy, or have a good home etc, but the real successful life for a narcissist is from within themselves. But the money wouldn\u2019t really make them happy if they were alone and full of discontent with the fact that they are so insecure and cannot ever be the same as other people . They lack various emotions that they cannot truly display, confidence / love/ empathy etc. They are always very jealous of others who have these qualities and will try to break that person down in order to make the narcissist look more superior. I hope that this has answered your question, that a narcissist cannot ever really feel successful - unless they know that they can keep hurting others and get away with it . ",

They take liberties with using the titles that other people have achieved through years of education and experience. They are a hollow shell. Underneath there is a child who experienced something traumatic in their upbringing. How they describe that trauma may or may not be accurate, but they want your sympathy. How they solve that trauma is horrendous and hurts vulnerable people. I\u2019m certainly not better than anyone else, but I have some skills that help me succeed in helping others. Those skills do not harm other people, diminish them, or justify being unethical. After so many years working in HR I have always tried to treat others fairly and equitably. I have read baloney posted on quara from a nrc (self proclaimed) that is pure baloney. They are only happy manipulating people, winning, and gaining control. They may be very smart, but nothing justifies their need to win at the expense of others. Being a nrc is nothing to be proud about. My sympathy is not wasted on them. they need to man up and seek professional help with someone who knows their tricks. Not my problem to solve until I get my PhD. ",

But my answer is purely speculative. I would wager that for diagnosed NPDs, the majority are not happy most of the time. For all the reasons we talk about here - the emptiness, the self-loathing, the inevitable narcissistic injury. But I\u2019d guess that a minority that could be relatively happy and successful in life and career, exist. And that they either are 1) very aware of their NPD and have learned to manage it - or 2) those that are so immune to negative feelings because they are so deluded by their own sense of self-grandiosity and have managed to convince others to follow them. I have observed the latter camp in the workplace in large corporate environments. In their private thoughts though - I am sure that the vast majority of narcissists experience stretches of profound depression. On the whole though - the disorder remains a confounding mystery to me, and it\u2019s anathema to my very essence as a person. All I know for sure is that the approximately 6% of the population that are estimated as true narcissists, account for an inordinate majority of the suffering for the rest of us. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes they can if they are alone and able to live out their delusional false self. That means they are happy because no one is challenging them or threatening their wounded inner child. They can protect that ego and be pretty content on their own. Or they can be with an extremely empathetic and loving person who is willing to give up their own happiness by continuing to cater to the narcissist for life. They of course are never truly happy but rather they have moments where their grandiose ego is fulfilled which makes them feel happy. Or they can destroy an opponent in a game and that gives them some temporary happiness. Their happiness is artificial and always based on power, money, fame, status, recognition, being right etc. So as long as their able to keep their false self alive then that does make a narcissist happy in a nontraditional manner. They also can be very successful in business, politics, or any other high level profession where their grandiose sense of self is rewarded. So yes they can be happy and successful but for them happiness and success is a much different definition than the person who does not suffer from NPD. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that initially,should a narcissist meet someone they believe is special,they are very,very happy. In the first flush of love,they worship their paragon of virtue,elevating them to a lofty pedestal where they can be admired. The narcissist of course,is admired at the same time,for ensnaring such a catch. However,in no time at all,s/he realises their partner isn't perfect. S/he is only human and makes mistakes. This is a reflection on the narcissist,which is intolerable. Love and happiness go out of the window. S/he starts searching for another suitable supply. When the old supply has been devalued and discarded,the same process is repeated with the new one. But happiness is harder to find as the narcissist gets older. The career may be on the wane and material success on the way out too. It may cost more financially to keep children of the discards. A narcissist will always put on a good \u201c show\u201d,so many people may at first glance,believe them to have a happy and successful life. I doubt that towards the end of their life,a narcissist left with no-body,would agree. ",

            "answer_text": "Narcissistic tendencies can improve with support from a compassionate, trained therapist. If you choose to remain in a relationship someone dealing with these issues, it\u2019s essential to work with your own therapist to establish healthy boundaries and develop resilience. Therapy does require a significant commitment and effort. Even during and after therapy, your partner may never respond in the way you hope. They may struggle with vulnerability throughout life and continue to find empathy challenging. If they have interest in the process and stick with it, though, small improvements in their behavior and emotional outlook may lead to greater, lasting change. No I can't say that someone with NPD can most certainly have a happy and successful life. That I also do not believe that the majority of people without any kind of mental illness have a happy and successful life and I apologize if this is not an answer that you were really looking for but to me is reality unfortunately.

            "answer_text": "If i may so many questions about npds and cluster b types in various incarnations lets just step back and look at it in a different lens 1 they are toxic, disordered folks who write their own rules and have their own playbook - i lump all the nastiness such as the silent treatment, gas lighting, lies, manipulation, future faking, stone walling, the substance abuse and affairs all of it under the category i call cluster b bullshittery So after we interface or encounter a pwnpd we become confused sad deppressed angry lonely and full anxiety fill in your experiences here_____ So we through our lens have our mind and hearts eviscerated by the cluster b bullshittery blender and once we have experienced this many quite normal and very relavent questions pop up. We are almost manic trying to figure out life past the dine n dash or hit n run that phase does smooth over time but then we become side tracked to make all of the dots connect and puzzle pieces to fit nicely into a frame of reference we can understand. Again all normal in the healing process let me be clear the abuse is not normal. A break up with an npd is not normal or comparable. Getting abused by a boss or a step father is not normal. Having a co worker act like cruella de ville is not normal. Realizing your partner is a 180 degree turn away from the person you initially met and so called fell in love with is not normal. They have secrets , they say they Love you but devine intuition over time , whispers in your ear that things are \u201coff\u201d none of this is normal so my advice is research cluster b\u2019s get it all out of your system next \u2026\u2026turn that energy into your recovery and healing go full sustained no contact wall up from flying monkeys and social media connections trash their pictures and phone numbers block everything understand they cannot be healed or fixed and most importantly it is not your job to now knowing the cycles of value devalue dis card and throw in a hoover and understanding that love bombs are not love its infatuation and control \u2026 you start to see what they are made of. (trauma bonds and cognitive dissonance are like tar trying to get away from that shit) once you understand your definition of success is not in any shape of form what yours is and they are treating the next supply exactly how they treated you can you at the end of the day call that a success? dear heart they have stds, they are pilfering somones bank account right now, they are renting hookers, they are spending thousands of dollars on fake tits and trainers to mold them into creatures that only mimic beauty. They are delving into criminality, substance abuse, they are causing chaos and drama, they are lying to your face, they marinate in rage and anger, they are doing everything they can to suppress the beast inside and sustain the mask. They enjoy confusing you in cul de sac areguments to deflect from their carnage and cluster b smoke n mirrors they lack empathy, they cant self regulate emotions, they have no empathy, they are walking robot vampires, they are the obnoxious overts being the center of attention at every party, or the stealhy covert that feigns victimhood or are the awkward quiet types that are a bit off but use that projection to suck you right in. They are the malignants that boast that beating a horse into submission is how you control and concor. They are presidents that laughably try to convince you they are a stable geniousses ok so before i write a book see the big picture? How can you compare any of that to your goals, your virtues, your spiritual beliefs, your light, your love, your lens, your morals. again how can you compare what they deem as successful and how to obtain that success to your way and ideals of success. Im certain once you rip the onion of cluster b\u2019s apart in its entirety, you will almost giggle like a school boy or girl when you rip that curtain off the wall and you dont find the all powerful wizard of oz but a small goofy pathetic trickster pulling levers and using all his tricks to fool you. Grab those red funky shoes called (your authentic glorious self) and walk in the other direction. Let them whistle past the grave doing all the cluster b bullshittery and let them go your success is you now know what a toxic person is you have a snapshot of how going down that road will only lead to heartache and disappointment. Are they happier? More successful? More loving? Giving? Joyful? Do they contribute or take away? Are they sorry they hurt you or sorry they got caught? Does your heart of hearts tell you something stinks ? Again refocus on you and the rest of these questions truly do become white noise in the back ground because those that know better do better ",

Some sit back and wait for everything to be handed to them\u2026but believe it or not, some are quite ambitious. Not because they want to give back to the greater good and certainly not to give to anyone else. (Not just charity but this is all for themselves. ) if it is a position of status this is where they thrive. Not necessarily thrive in the workplace, but very much get off on how they are perceived. The more important others think they are the more it fules their ego and sense of importance and entitlement. It doesn't last. They will never truly go above and beyond and really put in the work, but for a time they might actually have most of us fooled thinking they were above just about all of us simply based on their position but it is never long lasting and they are forever looking for that status that more than likely won't ever happen again because very wise people catch on to the truth. No one can keep up that facade forever\u2026. ",

They will have no problem plowing down anyone in front of them to get whatever it is they want. You are disepensible but will be used and bled dry as a means to feed their ego and inability to be happy and feel alive. They seek out empaths to feed off their healthy energy and zest for life. They leave a trail of devastation and chaos in their wake. They will never be fulfilled because they do not feel anything. But they crave adoration and love for themselves because the emptiness is so deep. Until a narcissist can heal from whatever broke them, they will never feel true happiness or joy. They are empty. And I've not yet heard of the miracle case of a narcissist coming to terms with their Narc condition, seeing the light, and suddenly have a return of emotions and foresight. Narcissists can be very successful. They are known to step on anyone to get to the top. Even the dying and the dead. They don't care. But that will never make them happy. Nothing will. ",

They r masters at making money but at home n with the wife n maybe kids they r slightly different.

So why they don\u2019t make this easy peasy change? Because they are extremely happy with their life style and they don\u2019t want it changed. About successful: I can speak only for my own experience. He was extremely successful as he was damn intelligent and also put as much time as he wanted on his job which was his addiction. He did not ever do a single chore as he had enslaved a woman who had to serve him 24/7. He did not even take care of his own sick mom and made her do it. So, how could he not be successful in his career?! However, to a normal person, none of the above are considered as success or happiness. But to them, damn they are! Let me give you an example. Just imagine Adolf Hitler. Of course to him, killing people is considered success and he loves it and enjoys every second of it! But how a normal person sees it? ",

Without the capacity of introspection, a contemplation of self, an achievement means little. When you really think about it, what a hellish existence that must be. Nothing has any real \u201csignificance,\u201d and threat is around every bend. They are constantly acting and reacting to ill-perceived and imagined slights. I have seen a Narcissist express happiness in a way. It was based on other people fawning over them, admiring and gushing over them with fake flattery. It was the one moment I really thought showed a capacity for happiness, even if the reason was jaundiced and jaded. ",

            "answer_text": "What do you mean by \u2018successfull\u2019? For me, to be successful is to become the best human being I can be.And under that definition, a narcissist can\u2019t be successful. But if for you \u2018to have a successful life\u2019 means \u2018having a miserable life\u2019\u2026 the narcissist has the most successful one! First, the full version of Narcissus's tale (people forget the ending):Narcissus was a beautiful boy who went to admire himself at the lake.One day he fell and drowned.The forest nymphs went to talk to the lake:\"Too bad Narcissus drowned!\"And the lake replied:\"It's true, because when he came to admire himself I saw myself reflected in him.\" A narcissist is someone who has a deep inner emptiness and tries to fill it by absorbing others. But that void is never filled, because nothing from the outside can fill an inner void. So when the narcissist feels empty again \u2014 that is, quickly \u2014 he leaves his absorbed and looks for another with the useless hope that it will fill him/her. But there is another type of person \u2014which I call a meta-narcissist\u2014 who also has a deep inner emptiness but tries to fill it by allowing himself / herself to be absorbed by another \u2014the narcissist\u2014. But when the narcissist finds that he/she does not fill his/her void, he/she abandons him/her and the meta-narcissist becomes depressed and feels abandoned. (The dumped person often hides under the name \u2018victim.\u2019) ",

Where was I before this,where will I be going,I think these are just a few of the questions I'm suprised nobody seems to ask,I know I did and I'm undecided wether I'm a narcissist or not,I don't think so cause it took me a long time to figure out how stupid I was. I started searching at about 17 till I was probably about 27 or so I thought I was pretty smart,read a lot of people,to many to list,two of the best Jesus,and Buddha,then I can into a gentleman out in Oregon who turned me onto the best Meher Baba,after being introduced to his works,is really when I realised how stupid I was.If you start searching do one thing for yourself,find the answer within,as Baba said look deep inside yourself and you will find God.Most of us are to hung up on the transient desires of the mind. (All illusion comes and goes,but the soul remains unchanged.What is meant by God-realization is to actually experience this important thing-that the soul is eternal.)Meher Baba Now the reason I tell you all this, is not to start a cult or make money,God knows many people have told me I could do either,my only goal doing this is to help other people feel as great as I do,God strike small dead,and I don't use those words lightly,you see we're all one in reality,so i tell you this for.All of the world.

What is a successful life? That is to be defined per individual and can have a variety of meanings. With a narcissist they are a bottomless pit of nothing but darkness. Doesn\u2019t seem like happiness nor success would apply to are narcissist. Of course that is my opinion as I view success and happiness with my own perception and definition.

When the malignant I dated dropped our relationship when my child was hospitalized, and the night after a fabulous evening\u2026so he said\u2026it was over for good. That\u2019s again, what he said. He said there were always a lot of problems. Yet on a daily basis, when he wasn\u2019t silencing me, he\u2019d express how happy he was. The histronic I was married to, was so happy until the day I told him I wanted the divorce, and that\u2019s when all changed. I become all bad. Consolation prize: They are never happy for long. The new supply: A new supply elevates them. A new girl to exploit. A new girl to learn and toy with and be a challenge of how far he can push her boundaries. The more she gives in, the more superior he must be, in his mind. The more she is willing to accept his \u201cstupidities\u201d the more elevated his ego becomes. So, you may think he\u2019s happy with his new supply, and the new supply may think she is happy for a few weeks, Or months, and may even tolerate for years, but then the tides change. And then things happen: She settles, but she is miserable being silenced, her children are belittled in comparison to his, and he plays with her emotions. She is told the same lies, and hopes, for the same misrepresented dreams. Hebwants to have a long and happy life with her, have her move in to his home, and marry her. Maybe even start a family with her while dating to secure the deal to happen. She chases what she had for a short period of time, in hopes to resurface her \u201csoulmate\u201d that he sold himself to be when they first met. She\u2019s officially on the hamster spinning wheel. She, too, will learn from the masters of it all, what a conman really looks like up close and personal. Life resumes for the narc: He ups his \u201cresume\u201d on the online dating websites. He breaks up with her and hoovers back to you to see if you forgot and are not having to discuss his escape. He redefines himself to be what the next person Or what you wants. He pulls out his handy dandy notes on you to secure the deal and remember who you were. And the he hoovers back a few more times. It\u2019s never over. It\u2019s like they have amnesia and expect you to, also. But\u2026.you are different now\u2026 You educated yourself. You\u2019ve realized it was him and his childhood experiences that helped to make him who he is and who will never ever change. You\u2019ve realized that your chaos had been removed with him removed from your life. And although you read to understand for a while, you realize that his every move was calculated, and malicious. Even to you. The one he \u201cloved\u201d. And you\u2019ve now realized that your definition of love is very different than his. This is your exit cue. One less puppet for him to control. You are strong. And wise. And expect more for yourself and more of others that you allow into your life. Life is good\u2026.now\u2026.and happily ever after is just around the corner for you.",

Even if they\u2019re happy with someone for the time being (while idealizing them) I\u2019ve never seen a narcissist idealize someone forever. But interestingly, I find that narcissists are often much happier than their partners in relationships. The narcissist will portray the image of having a happy and successful relationship while the partner is either miserable or in denial so deep that they seem disconnected from reality. Same applies to narcissists in familial relationships. The narcissist will present the image of the perfect, happy family while everyone else in the family is depressed, anxious, or completely checked out mentally. ",

Most CEO\u2019s and individuals in high paid positions are narcissists and it shouldn\u2019t be surprising. Happy, however, is another story\u2026 for a narcissist is rarely content given its personality disorder.

As long as they get what they want, when they want, they can be very happy. It is one way they measure success. But their idea of happiness and success is far different than your idea or mine. I have never wanted the biggest or the best. I only wanted to be comfortable. To me there is more to life than getting \u201cthere\u201d. The joy has always been in the journey. A narc doesn\u2019t see it like that. To them getting \u201cthere\u201d is all that is important. They know exactly what they want, and do not care who they hurt along the way. As long as they get what they want, that is all that matters. To them, a journey is just an inconvenient part of getting there. ",

I\u2019ve tried my best to share what helped me in the past with a couple of Narcs that I had dated. I truly wish that I had this resource when I was struggling. But there is a certain point where the Narc/ex or whomever isn\u2019t the issue. It\u2019s us. Asking the same question isn\u2019t going to yield anything new about someone else\u2019s life, narc or otherwise. So much of the Narc questions (like 10\u201320%) are written by the same people and, if you peruse their history, they\u2019ve been asking these question for too damn long. How did a Narc abuse us? Because there was something in us that was vulnerable, messed up, unhealed. Asking Narc questions ironically means you are still under their sway. the more you ask, the more your life and preoccupation is about someone else. Can a Narc have a successful and happy life? I don\u2019t know about them, Can you answer the same question for yourself? ",

I suspect a lot do. If you mean can they have a warm, loving, nurturing, emotionally fulfilling , committed relationship? No. By definition a narcissist has low empathy and an inability to form lasting pair bonds. If you mean can a narcissist have children and appear normal to the world, Yes. However, they never really form emotional attachments with their children so sooner or later the kids will become objectified and neglected. ",

Successful depends because success is a measure of what they need. For example if a narc meets a person who stays with them yet knows what they are allows themselves to be used , tortured and cheated on well then that is success. If the narc is with a person who self sacrifices and provides support mostly financial then again thats success. So No they will never truly be happy but they can find success. ",

Here\u2019s the problem though, putting so much value into the material world means they put a lot of value in things that will eventually fade; things break, become dull, stale, die, move on, grow apart etc etc. and for the narcissist they\u2019re all too familiar with this because get bored easily but they still will seek out surface level experiences and relationships. When they move on they don\u2019t want to say goodbye completely, they want to know the things they\u2019ve moved on from are still on the shelf for when they come back to it. When they realize people won\u2019t accept that sort of behavior and cut ties then this causes a massive injury to the Narcs ego. So as long as they continue to have their high paying job, network of friends that elevates them into a higher social status, their youthful looks, money, etc etc then they will continue to be surface level happy. But we all know that never lasts very long. They\u2019re like vampires in search of food. It\u2019s tough to satiate their sort of hunger for success.

According to definition, success is an accomplishment of an aim or goal. Sometimes prosperity is included in that. If narcs feel they\u2019ve won at bringing pain, self doubt, insecurity,etc to their targets then yes they consider that a successful goal achieved. Personally, I think it helps alleviate the self loathing, anger and regret they feel and try to project onto others. As far as happiness, in their life, it\u2019s only transient and usually superficial in nature. I don\u2019t have much personal experience with narcs with the exception of a few Drs I have worked with. The one I had most experience with seemed angry and moody most of the time. He seemed to depend on my company, alcohol and cigarettes to be in a better mood. I doubt they ever experience true happiness, in traditional forms we do \u262e\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f ",
