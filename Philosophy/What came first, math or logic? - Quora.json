            "answer_text": "Question originally answered : What came first, math or logic?  Having read the answers here, I was quite amazed at the certainty with which most of the answers claimed that obviously logic was first. However, asking which came first, somehow ignores the nature of both logic and math. Logic and math are not so much things in and of themselves as they are activities that are done by agents. One does mathematics and one does logic. It is arguable whether logic and mathematics can be considered independent entities that exist independent of the people doing them. And if one does consider logic and mathematics as independent entities, that would still exist even if there were no-one alive to practice them, then it might even be the case that they existed before humans ever existed, perhaps even they have existed eternally, in which case the question would be meaningless.  So let\u2019s assume that we are indeed talking of logic and mathematics as an activity done by people. Your question then asks which activity was done first. But arguably mathematics and logic are one and the same thing. This is very clearly demonstrated by the fact that we use mathematics to study logic and logic to study mathematics. Both activities are essentially pattern recognizing activities and as such essentially empirical in nature, the result of experience. They both involve a process of discovery of underlying structure, in the case of logic, the structure underlying propositions and truth conditions, and in the case of mathematics more general objects. This pattern recognition activity, which lies at the heart of both mathematics and logic, has arguably always been a necessary component of human behaviour in order to survive. So, I personally would say that neither came before the other, but rather that they are two instances of a more fundamental mechanism or process, or if you will, two sides of the same coin. ",

            "answer_text": "Strange that none of the answers refers to mere history. For 2 millenniums, Babylonians and Egyptians were doing math (arithmetic and geometry) using repeated observations to establish rules of thumbs. The Greek Thales and Pythagoras, in the 5th century BC, started to used deductive reasoning, that is logic to derive conclusions from definitions and axioms. It took 200 years before Euclid was able to develop the complete picture both in arithmetic and geometry based only on deduction. At about the same time (it is probably not a coincidence), Aristotle invents logic by applying the deductive method of mathematics to other fields. Then the two discipline separates. Mathematics and logic evolves in China, India, Middle East, and Europe without many influence of one on the other. It was in the 19th century, with the discoveries of non-euclidean geometries by Lobachevski and Riemann and the limit of arithmetic/calculus are explored by Galois and Abel. These are extrapolation of logic reasoning in the field of the mathematical reality. When Cantor started to do the same with the numbers and Russel with logic (as a mathematical discipline), there were a huge crisis in the foundation of mathematics which were defined by Hilbert: with his axiomatic method math is part of logic (and not the reverse as it was before) The crisis was resolved by Bourbaki, with the axiomatisation of whole today\u2019s mathematics. It\u2019s a lot of books and not easy to read, but it shows that all the math we know is a matter of logic deduction and theorem proving. ",
