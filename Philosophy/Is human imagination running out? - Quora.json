            "answer_text": "Human imagination is nowhere NEAR \"running out.\" In fact, we are at an exciting time in history in which we can seriously imagine things which are utterly amazing. First, we are only now at a point where some of the imagined possibilities of the science fiction of the past are beginning to be attainable.  We have surpassed the science fiction of Jules Verne in many ways... we have submarines, electric lights, mechanization, travel around the world in considerably less than 80 days etc. That's awesome, isn't it? But there are a lot of ideas of \"classic\" science fiction still unrealized... we are not yet at a point where we can colonize other planets, create machine intelligences, spend time in cyberspaces or metaverses, construct space elevators and so on.  But we are close enough to such things that they are no longer wild speculations, either. Meanwhile our wild speculations have gotten really, really wild. Societies based on crowdsourcing and augmented reality (Read Daniel Suarez novels \"Daemon\" and \"Freedom\") or Spider Robinson's mindblowingly audacious idea for cheating death by using time travel to record all human experience as Turing images which are eventually recovered and loaded up into a computer based afterlife of mankinds own making.  In all probability such a thing is utterly impossible, but wow, that's pretty damn imaginative. We are at a point in time where humanity can imagine more possibilities than ever, and our speculations have gone from \"submarines and electric lights\" to speculation on the complete transformation of humanity itself. Welcome to the era of imagination! ",

It still isAs someone once said\"The leading edge of discovery is no different from magic\" Of course, imagination is not limited to scienceThere was a time when science fiction dealt with space travelbut now it deals with dreamsWe imagined Frankenstein monsters, where now we think of avatarsWe imagined time machines, where now we consider being cloned Our imagination has moved from the possible to the probableWhat was once the realm of the circus is now a common pastime Imagination is fueled by what we want and what is conceivable We want peace and stabilityWe will create the deadliest of weapons to get it We want enjoyment and comfortWe will destroy the atmosphere to get it Imagination will create the problems and answersIt is the intellectual arms race stoked by our motivation to pursue the possible and the desirable Far from running outImagination isas they saybeyond imagination ",
