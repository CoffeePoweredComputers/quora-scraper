            "answer_text": "Wow\u2026heavy question. The first question that should be asked though is, \u201cWhat is reality?\u201d Reality can be loosely defined as anything that has substance, or the quality of existence. The problems arise when you start getting into the worlds of substance and existence. For example, let\u2019s talk about the screen upon which you are viewing this answer. At first glance it appears to have substance, a solid form. But we know that the screen is made up of molecules, which are made up of atoms, which are made up of protons, neutrons and electrons, which in turn are made up of quarks, and so on. In the final analysis, we discover that matter is not solid at all. The odd truth is, there is no such thing as solid matter, so the screen is actually an illusion in a way. The universe actually consists of 99.9999999etc% \u201cnothingness\u201d. At this point, no actual \u201csolid\u201d material form has ever been discovered, so its existence is purely hypothetical. So is the screen \u201creal\u201d? The fact that YOU see it makes it real in your world. It may not exist in someone else\u2019s world, however. For you, since you think, your thought does in fact exist\u2026in that context. But does your thought exist for someone else? You can tell someone else what you are thinking by describing the thought, but does that cause the thought to then exist in that someone\u2019s world? Your description of the thought now exists in his/her world, but does the thought itself? Descartes once said, \u201cI think\u2026therefore I am.\u201d If you want to get down to the real fundamental definition of reality, your thoughts ARE YOUR REALITY! Without thought, your reality would cease to exist. At least in this current reality. Your thoughts form the basis of how you see \u201creality\u201d, how you interact with \u201creality\u201d, how you define your own existence. So, does a thought exist in reality? Only those of us who think can truly answer that question. ",

            "answer_text": "Thought consists upon electromagnetic energy and has form, pseudo image which grows and developes into matter under universal law of attraction, \u201clike attracts like\u201d. Electromagnetic energy of thought attracts atoms and subatomic forces to pile into objects that exist in space or events that exist in time. Pseudo image, then gets thickness slowly in time and becomes materialised and transforms into the shape according to the original Thought.Thoughts erupt out of the memories, perception and emotions stored in brain in images and from thought forms, perceived through senses, coming from other human brains and living beings around telepathically as messages. Thought exists in reality and inherits energy, wisdom and creative force in itself with keen inclination and tendency to become solid and alive manifestation as materialised physical experience or object. That is why, therefore, we must be careful about each moment of our life what we think and believe because that will be our reality and experience to face. We must examine our each conscious thought and belief before we accept it to own in our mind for materialization. ",
