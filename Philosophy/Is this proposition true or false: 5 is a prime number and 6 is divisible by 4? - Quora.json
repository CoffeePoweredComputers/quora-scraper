            "answer_text": "Here is the proposition we are asked to determine the truth-value of: 5 is a prime number and 6 is divisible by 4 Note the truth-functional connective \u201cand\u201d that I placed in bold. This proposition is a conjunction that joins two other propositions. I have assigned a symbol for these two propositions: [math]P[/math] : 5 is a prime number[math]Q[/math] : 6 is divisible by 4Since there is no other truth-functional connective in these propositions they are atomic. What I am asked to determine the truth value of can be written as [math]P\\land Q[/math]. For this to be true, both [math]P[/math] and [math]Q[/math] have to be true. So I have to check each one. However, I note an ambiguity I need to clear up. I need to specify the domain of the numbers [math]4[/math], [math]5[/math] and [math]6[/math]. Since the first proposition references \u201cprime numbers\u201d I will assume these three numbers are natural numbers. The first proposition is true because [math]5[/math] is a prime. This is because [math]2[/math], [math]3[/math] and [math]4[/math] do not divide [math]5[/math] evenly. They have non-zero remainders. The only factors of [math]5[/math] are [math]1[/math] and [math]5[/math]. The second proposition is false because [math]\\mod(6,4)= 2 \\ne 0[/math]. Since both [math]P[/math] and [math]Q[/math] have to be true for [math]P\\land Q[/math] to be true, and this is not the case, I can say that \u201c5 is a prime number and 6 is divisible by 4\u201d is false.
