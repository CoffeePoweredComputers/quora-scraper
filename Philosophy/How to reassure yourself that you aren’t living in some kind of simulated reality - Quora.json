            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know for sure that I am not living in a simulated reality. I don\u2019t seem to be worried about whether I am or not. It\u2019s a passing curiosity to consider the possibility. If it really is the truth, how can I escape or alter my circumstances? There is probably nothing I can do to change the reality with which I am presented. Perhaps I could escape or transcend it by a mystical experience \u2013 somehow spiritually get beyond the simulation, if that is possible? But even that exalted state may be part of the program somehow, and there really is no escape but to be simulated forever until you are deleted permanently. Your fate is in the hands of the creators of the simulation. Basically, to you they are God. I don\u2019t know that it is a simulated reality and I may never know. If it\u2019s something I may never know then why break my head over a thing like that? It\u2019s unreasonable. To keep on obsessing about whether it\u2019s a simulated reality or not is possibly even dangerous for your mental health. Whether it\u2019s a simulated reality or not, going crazy means you\u2019ll get confined to a lunatic asylum. I\u2019d rather avoid that fate. If it is a simulation, then \u2018the universe is unfolding as it should.\u2019 ",

I know, because I rebooted you about five minutes ago. Don\u2019t worry, I restored you from backup, so you\u2019ll never know. Just keeping going about your life like normal. It really doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re simulated or not; \u201cany difference which makes no difference is no difference.\u201d Ok, but seriously: I mean, you don\u2019t know now, so you might be, you might not. I\u2019d keep going as if you weren\u2019t; if you ARE, then you\u2019re saved. If you AREN\u2019T, then trying to stop the simulation would be catastrophic. ",

Second, I don\u2019t suffer from digitalcentrism, which in short means that I\u2019m not easily impressed by computer based technology and solutions and remember and have learned from technology at a time when the term wasn\u2019t synonymous with \u201ccomputer\u201d. Third, I wrote the most authoritative report on why the hype about being in a simulated universe is just that - hype based on bad cyber fantasies and ignorance about how technology actually is developed and what is actually on the horizon that could disrupt the projections of Musk, Bank of America and Eliot Edge.
