            "answer_text": "We have to understand clearly that all the concepts born out of the human intellect are like a sign board that points to a truth that is beyond itself. Awareness and consciousness are just concepts that may point to shades of different truths depending on the context. Only your own \u201cconsciousness\u201d can interpret the meaning that appeals to itself in any given context. Language is a means of communication of thought and it is inherently imperfect. It has terrible limitations and your current confusion is a direct evidence. So without going into the context, it is impossible to answer your question. Who has used these two words that you have heard about and in what context and what did the speaker of those words really intended are all unknown. Can you define clearly these two words namely awareness and consciousness? ",

            "answer_text": "Is awareness prior to consciousness? Thanks for the question. Consciousness is a fundamental medium of the universe. When a new star is to begin in a galaxy a consciousness connection is within every molecule and atom in that sphere of space. At such a basic stage there is no awareness but there is an attraction or repulsion instinct that is happening from an energy \u201cthought\u201d. As an arbitrary example imagine the Sun,solar system and Earth began about 4,500,000,000 years ago in a particular space within the Milky way galaxy. Mind is the luminous,all pervasive,reflective force acting on all matter within this sphere of consciousness that is the solar system. 90,000 years ago humans had formed a dense enough consciousness to become self aware. We are at a stage of raising our consciousness into a higher density where love becomes our learning and developing desire. There are still many densities to develop thru before becoming a conscious part of the mysterious intelligent creator of love,light and the universe. Awareness always is the dawn of a higher level of thinking if you are consciously desiring to do good for the whole. If your intent is selfish then your awareness takes you further into the darker realms of consciousness. You can only progress to places where control and slavery maintain a \u201cdog eat dog\u201d environment. ",
