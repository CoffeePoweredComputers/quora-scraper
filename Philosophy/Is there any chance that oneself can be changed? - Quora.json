            "answer_text": "It is my opinion that we can't help but be changed. Every time we change our opinion, values, or friends we become slightly different. Most of us don't really know who we are. We are a bit different with every person we are around. If you want to be a certain way, but that isn't really who you are, what would you accomplish? I gather you believe you would be more content if you could change your values, and you try to do this, but without much success. Maybe you would be more content, and maybe not. However, if you want to changed your values I believe you can, but you have to do it yourself. It seems to me the easiest way to change is when you have a new situation, like move to a new job, and you don't have to take any baggage with you. When people stay with their old friends they know who their friends expect them to be like, and it is not easy to break away. As we get older I expect being who people expect us to be gets questioned in many peoples' minds and we \"change\". We start being less of a chameleon and what other people think isn't quite so important to us. Still, I am pretty old and still feel I am different around different friends. I do believe I have gone through a lot of changes, many for the better. As you practice giving up your old values for ones you admire more I believe you will make slow but sure progress, so eventually you shift your values from what they are now to what you want them to be. Probably never 100%, but closer and closer according to how much effort you put into it. Anyway I hope it works out for you.  Jim ",

            "answer_text": "Some things in your question and details 'bother' me:  You say you're narcissist, materialist, superficial, ... but this seems to bother you.A real narcissist, materialist, superficial person, ... doesn't realize he/she is narcissist, ... so it doesn't really bother them. The fact that you seem to worry contradicts what you're saying about yourself.When you think about the future, you see a successful person, and you want to get rid of that way of thinking.Why would you? Because you think it makes you shallow? materialistic? It doesn't really. We all have ideas of what our ideal future would be and it always involves success, money, possessions, ... There's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't make you overly materialistic.Envy is a completely normal feeling. The feeling is OK, but you shouldn't always act upon it.Bottom line, you seem OK the way you are.You shouldn't try to change yourself; the only thing you need to realize is that feelings are (always) OK. You shouldn't condemn yourself for having certain feelings. You can't control your feelings. But you should be aware you shouldn't always act according to those feelings. Nobody does. Only when you accept yourself the way you are, maybe you'll be able to very gradually, very slowly change (maybe a better way to call it is \"to discover some aspects of your personality you didn't think you had....\") Good luck!
