            "answer_text": "Is Daniel Dennett \"Consciousness Explained\" outdated or disproved? It was never proven in the first place. It is a theory of consciousness (or perhaps lack thereof.) If anything, it was proven otherwise hundreds of years before Dennett wrote his book. Descartes wrote, Cogito ergo sum. I think, therefore I exist. Here's what John Searle said about Dennett's book: \"To put it as clearly as I can: in his book, Consciousness Explained, Dennett denies the existence of consciousness. He continues to use the word, but he means something different by it. For him, it refers only to third-person phenomena, not to the first-person conscious feelings and experiences we all have. For Dennett there is no difference between us humans and complex zombies who lack any inner feelings, because we are all just complex zombies. ...I regard his view as self-refuting because it denies the existence of the data which a theory of consciousness is supposed to explain...Here is the paradox of this exchange: I am a conscious reviewer consciously answering the objections of an author who gives every indication of being consciously and puzzlingly angry. I do this for a readership that I assume is conscious. How then can I take seriously his claim that consciousness does not really exist?\" Someone always seems to come up with a brilliant answer of no, none, or nothing, even when it is quite obvious to the rest of us that there clearly is something. We see null answers come up about reality, knowledge, consciousness, God, the meaning of life \u2013 everything. To some, everything is nothing. Aren\u2019t they clever? ",

            "answer_text": "Neither. It covers the topic of consciousness and our beliefs about consciousness in great depth, and demolishes common ideas about the nature of conscious experience. Dennett shows how the universal belief in the \u2018Cartesian theatre\u2019 fails tests of evidence and logic. He shows that our conscious experience is a very poor source of evidence for what consciousness actually is. Dennett describes some extremely useful approaches to understanding consciousness, such as heterophenomenology: that we can investigate consciousness by looking into the reasons why people make certain claims and statements about their inner lives. Dennett\u2019s book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand what science and philosophy have to say about the nature of consciousness. ",
