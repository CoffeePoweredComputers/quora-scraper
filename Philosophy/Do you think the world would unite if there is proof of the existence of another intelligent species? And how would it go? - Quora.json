            "answer_text": "It all depends on the nature of that alien species and how we detect them. In Ursula K Le Guin\u2019s \u201cThe Lathe of Heaven\u201d, a psychiatrist would hypnotize a guy whose dreams would become real. Under hypnosis, he would tell the guy what to dream, but the dreams have a \u201cMonkey\u2019s paw\u201d effect. He told him to dream of \u201cPeace on Earth\u201d. That resulted in an alien invasion, which caused all the nations of the world to unite together to fight the invaders. So, aliens invading the earth would unite all of us together, sure. ",

People of the country A are likely to get united if people of the neighboring country B attack them and there is a leader to guide them towards unification. The same logic may apply to Earthly human beings versus alien beasts from outside the Earth. ",
