            "answer_text": "Applications. Most obviously, it facilitates consideration of ethical questions--to assess moral problems clearly and critically. A lot of analytic philosophy that gets done is ethics. More generally, doing analytic philosophy sharpens intellectual tools: the ability to think an organized, structured way, to argue effectively, to sort out one's life issues and live well--and to be an 800 pound gorilla in conversation (which is what the Sophists here hired to teach people to be). Serious study of any academic discipline does that too, but analytic philosophy is the royal road: studying analytic philosophy does it faster, more efficiently, and better. Not conclusive admittedly but suggestive: philosophy majors consistently get the best LSAT scores, and in the GREs score highest in the verbal and analytical parts and 5th highest in the math section--about the same as biology majors and much better than any other humanities majors. I do analytic metaphysics of the most wildly irrelevant sort that even most analytic philosophers can't stand. But to me, who in my past life was preparing to be a professional musician, doing it is like practicing etudes and technique. I loved doing that, learning and practicing pure acrobatics. It's not music and it sounds terrible (have you ever listened to a violinist practicing scales and arpeggios in double stops?) Only a very few people, like me, really, really enjoy technique as an end in itself. But technique gives you the ability to play music. And analytic philosophy gives you that kind of facility to do other things. This is a wonderful question: thank you for asking! ",
