            "answer_text": "Q. Aside from intelligence or wisdom, what\u2019s more important for a better world? -According to Theravada Buddhism, morality is as important as wisdom (intelligence) for a better world. There are a lot of intelligent people with immoral behaviors making the world to go backward. - For example 1. The Marshmallow Test The Stanford marshmallow experiment was a series of studies on delayed gratification in the late 1960s and early 1970s led by psychologist Walter Mischel, then a professor at Stanford University. In these studies, a child was offered a choice between one small reward provided immediately or two small rewards if they waited for a short period, approximately 15 minutes, during which the tester left the room and then returned. (The reward was sometimes a marshmallow, but often a cookie or a pretzel.) In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were able to wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better life outcomes, as measured by SAT scores, educational attainment, body mass index (BMI), and other life measures.From https://en.wikipedia.org/wi\u2026/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment - 2. The Marshmallow Test Roberto When we designed the experiment in the 1960s we did not film the children. But twenty years later, to record the Marshmallow Test procedure and to illustrate the diverse strategies children use as they try to wait for their treats, my former postdoc Monica L. Rodriguez filmed five- to six-year-olds with a hidden camera in a public school in Chile. Monica followed the same procedure we had used in the original experiments.Monica gave the same instructions to \u201cRoberto,\u201d a neatly dressed six-year-old with a beige school jacket, dark necktie on his white shirt, and perfectly combed hair. As soon as she left the room he cast a quick look at the door to be sure it was tightly shut. He then rapidly surveyed the cookie tray, licked his lips, and grabbed the closest treat. He cautiously opened the cookie to expose the white cream filling in its middle, and, with bent head and busy tongue, he began to lick the cream meticulously, pausing for only a second to smilingly approve his work. After licking the cookie clean, he skillfully put the two sides back together with even more obvious delight and carefully returned the filling-free cookie to the tray. He then hurried at top speed to give the remaining two cookies the identical treatment. After devouring their insides, Roberto arranged the remaining pieces on the tray to restore them to their exact original positions, and checked the scene around him, scanning the door to be sure that all was well. Like a skilled method actor, he then slowly sank his head to place his tilted chin and cheek on the open palm of his right hand, elbow resting on the desktop. He transformed his face into a look of utter innocence, his wide, trusting eyes staring expectantly at the door in childlike innocent wonder.Roberto\u2019s performance invariably gets the most cheers and the loudest laughter and applause from every audience, including, once, a congratulatory shout from the esteemed provost of one of America\u2019s top private universities to \u201cget him a scholarship when he\u2019s ready to come here!\u201d I don\u2019t think he was joking.Excerpt from The Marshmallow Test: Mastering Self-Control by Walter Mischel - 3. The Marshmallow Test: Roberto? Robert Charles Gallo (born March 23, 1937) is an American biomedical researcher. He is best known for his role in the discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the infectious agent responsible for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and in the development of the HIV blood test, and he has been a major contributor to subsequent HIV research.From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ro... In 1989, the investigative journalist John Crewdson suggested that Gallo's lab might have misappropriated a sample of HIV isolated at the Pasteur Institute by Montagnier's group.They concluded that the virus used in Gallo's lab had come from Montagnier's lab; it was a virus from a patient that had contaminated a virus sample from another patient. On request, Montagnier's group had sent a sample of this culture to Gallo, not knowing it contained two viruses. The sample then contaminated the pooled culture on which Gallo was working. On 12 December 1985 the Institut Pasteur filed suit to challenge a patent for an HIV test that had been granted on 28 May 1985 to the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In 1987, the two governments agreed to split equally the proceeds from the patent, naming Montagnier and Gallo co-discoverers. Montagnier and Gallo resumed collaborating with each other again for a chronology that appeared in Nature in 1987.In 2008, Montagnier and his colleague Fran\u00e7oise Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi from the Institut Pasteur were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the discovery of HIV. Harald zur Hausen also shared the Prize for his discovery that human papilloma viruses lead to cervical cancer,[35] but Gallo was left out. From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gallo- -Gallo Admits French Discovered Aids Virus May 30, 1991|By John Crewdson, Chicago Tribune. WASHINGTON \u2014 A controversial piece of scientific history will be officially rewritten this week, with the publication of an acknowledgment by Dr. Robert C. Gallo that the AIDS virus he claimed to have discovered in 1984 was in reality a virus sent to him from France the year before.The letter, which associates said was written at the urging of Gallo`s senior colleagues, appears to put an end to a six-year effort by Gallo and his employer, the National Institutes of Health, to claim the AIDS virus as an independent discovery.By invoking a variety of alternative explanations, Gallo had struggled to persuade the scientific community that his AIDS virus, known as HTLV-3B, was derived from an American AIDS patient and not from a virus sample sent to NIH by Pasteur scientists.Whether Gallo`s cultures became contaminated with the French virus by accident-or, as the French suggested in court, on purpose-ultimately may be resolved by the NIH investigation of his laboratory`s AIDS research.From http://articles.chicagotribune.com/\u2026/9102180196_1_gallo-lab\u2026 - 4. The Marshmallow Test: Roberto? Lance Edward Armstrong (born September 18, 1971) is an American former professional road racing cyclist. He is the 1993 Elite Men's Road Race World Champion, and he had won the Tour de France seven consecutive times from 1999 to 2005, but was stripped of his Tour de France victories in 2012 after a protracted doping scandal.Armstrong had been the subject of doping allegations ever since winning the 1999 Tour de France. In 2012, a United States Anti-Doping Agency investigation concluded that Armstrong had used performance-enhancing drugs over the course of his career and named him as the ringleader of \"the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen.\" Armstrong chose not to contest the charges, citing the potential toll on his family. As a result, he received a lifetime ban from competing in all sports that follow the World Anti-Doping Agency code\u2014effectively ending his athletic career. He was also stripped of all of his achievements after 1998, including his seven Tour de France titles.In the aftermath of his fall from grace, a CNN article wrote that \"The epic downfall of cycling's star, once an idolized icon of millions around the globe, stands out in the history of professional sports.\" From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La...http://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/21065539 - 5. The Marshmallow Test: Roberto? DNA was first isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869. Its molecular structure was identified by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by X-ray diffraction data acquired by Rosalind Franklin.In 1962, after Franklin's death, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins jointly received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Nobel Prizes are awarded only to living recipients. A debate continues about who should receive credit for the discovery. From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA- It was generally believed that Franklin was never aware that her work had been used during construction of the model, but Gosling asserted in his 2013 interview that, \"Yes. Oh, she did know about that.\"There is no doubt that Franklin's experimental data were used by Crick and Watson to build their model of DNA in 1953.It should be noted that in their original paper, Watson and Crick do not cite the X-ray diffraction work of both Wilkins and Franklin. However, they admit their having \"been stimulated by a knowledge of the general nature of the unpublished experimental results and ideas of Dr. M. H. F. Wilkins, Dr. R. E. Franklin and their co-workers at King's College, London.\" Watson and Crick had no experimental data to support their model. It was Franklin and Gosling's own publication in the same issue of Nature with the X-ray image of DNA, which served as the main evidence; in which they concluded:Thus our general ideas are not inconsistent with the model proposed by Watson and Crick in the preceding communication.From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin - She never learned the full extent to which Watson and Crick had relied on her data to make their model; if she suspected, she did not express any bitterness or frustration, and in subsequent years she became very friendly with Crick and his wife, Odile.It is clear that, had Franklin lived, the Nobel prize committee ought to have awarded her a Nobel prize, too \u2013 her conceptual understanding of the structure of the DNA molecule and its significance was on a par with that of Watson and Crick, while her crystallographic data were as good as, if not better, than those of Wilkins.From https://www.theguardian.com/\u2026/sexism-in-science-did-watson-\u2026 - In summary, Watson and Crick had three sources for Franklin's unpublished data: 1) her 1951 seminar, attended by Watson,[72] 2) discussions with Wilkins,[73] who worked in the same laboratory with Franklin, 3) a research progress report that was intended to promote coordination of Medical Research Council-supported laboratories.Watson's portrayal of Franklin in The Double Helix (written after Franklin's death when libel laws did not apply anymore) was negative and gave the appearance that she was Wilkins' assistant and was unable to interpret her own DNA data. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Crick#Controversy\u00b7 \"Rosalind Franklin was a very intelligent woman, but she really had no reason for believing that DNA was particularly important. She was trained in physical chemistry. I don't think she'd ever spent any length of time with people who thought DNA was important. And she certainly didn't talk to Maurice [Wilkins] or to John Randall, then the professor at Kings.\" Quoted by James Watson. Nature, 302: 653. April 1983.From http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/\u2026/rosalind_franklin.ht\u2026 - 6. The Marshmallow Test: Roberto? -Ghost composer A ghostwriter is a writer who writes books, manuscripts, screenplays, scripts, articles, blog posts, stories, reports, whitepapers, or other texts that are officially credited to another person. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter- Mamoru Samuragochi (\u4f50\u6751\u6cb3\u5185 \u5b88, born 21 September 1963) is a Japanese composer from Hiroshima Prefecture who falsely claimed to be totally deaf. He was the name credited for the video games Resident Evil: Dual Shock Ver. and Onimusha: Warlords. He claimed throughout his career to be deaf which led to foreign media dubbing him a \"digital-age Beethoven\". In February 2014, it was revealed that most of the work attributed to him over the previous 18 years had been written by Takashi Niigaki. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamoru_Samuragochi- Takashi Niigaki (\u65b0\u57a3 \u9686, born 1 September 1970) is a Japanese composer and music teacher who served as the ghostwriter for Mamoru Samuragochi for 18 years, composing musical works that included the soundtracks for Resident Evil: Dual Shock Ver. and Onimusha: Warlords. He also composed \"Hiroshima Symphony No 1\", previously credited to Samuragochi until February 2014 when Niigaki publicly revealed that he was the real composer. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takashi_Niigaki- In 2012, after the \u201cHiroshima\u201d symphony became a surprise hit, Samuragochi told Niigaki that the national network NHK would be shooting a documentary about him. Samuragochi was to compose a new piece for the victims of the tsunami in northern Japan, and the filmmakers would document his creative process. Samuragochi imposed one ground rule: He would not let them film him writing music. \u201cThe process is sacred,\u201d he told the director.Since Samuragochi would have a camera crew trailing him 24/7, he asked Niigaki to send the sheet music to his house by courier using a fake name. He reminded Niigaki to use generic, unidentifiable notations and to include blank sheets of music paper, for the \u201cbefore\u201d shots. Samuragochi wrote in a text message: \u201cIt\u2019s an important piece that is going to be played at the end of the NHK special, showing that the genius composer went through hell to compose a song for the victims.\u201dMeanwhile, Samuragochi was pretending to go through hell. During the filming, he \u201cmet\u201d a young girl named Minami\u2014she was pre-screened by the producers\u2014whose mother died in the tsunami, and dedicated the requiem to her. For inspiration, he sat alone on the beach where the girl\u2019s mother disappeared, \u201cso that the spirits of the victims come down to him,\u201d according to the film\u2019s narrator. Later, back at his house, he writhed in bed, groaned from the supposed pain of his tinnitus, swallowed dozens of white pills, and crawled around on the floor, apparently too weak to stand. Finally, Samuragochi stumbled into the living room. \u201cIt\u2019s finished,\u201d he said. He then disappeared into his study. Twelve hours later, he emerged with the complete score. The camera lingered over the perfectly shaped notes.From http://www.newrepublic.com/\u2026/japans-deaf-composer-wasnt-wha\u2026 - 7. The Marshmallow Test: Roberto? Elizabeth Anne Holmes is an American entrepreneur and the founder and former CEO of Theranos, a now defunct company known for its unlikely claims to have revolutionized blood testing using surprisingly small volumes of blood such as from a fingerprick. In 2015, Forbes named Holmes the youngest and wealthiest self-made female billionaire in America on the basis of a $9 billion valuation of Theranos. By the next year, following revelations of potential fraud, Forbes revised her net worth to zero dollars, and Fortune named Holmes one of the \"World's Most Disappointing Leaders\".From Elizabeth Holmes - Wikipedia - -So only intelligence or wisdom is not enough; It also needs morality to have a better world. - \"The Kshatriya is the best of those among this folk who put their trust in lineage. But he who is perfect in wisdom and righteousness, he is the best among gods and men.\"'From Digha Nikaya, Silakkhandha-vagga 1.3: Ambattha Sutta (DN 3) - 21. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 `But of these two things, oh Brahman, is it possible to leave one out, and to declare the man who has the other to be a Brahman, to be one who can rightly, and without falling into falsehood, claim to be a, Brahman?'Not that, Gotama! For wisdom, oh Gotama, is purified by uprightness, and uprightness is purified by wisdom. Where there is uprightness, wisdom is there, and where there is wisdom, uprightness is there. To the upright there is wisdom, to the wise there is uprightness, and wisdom and goodness are declared to be the best thing in the world. Just, oh Gotama, as one might wash hand with hand, or foot with foot, just even so, oh Gotama, is wisdom purified by uprightness, and uprightness is purified by wisdom. Where there is uprightness, wisdom is there, and where there is wisdom, uprightness is there. To the upright, there is wisdom, to the wise there is uprightness, and wisdom and goodness are declared to be the best thing in the world.'22. `That is just so, oh Brahman. And I, too, say the same. \u2026\u2026..From Digha Nikaya, Silakkhandha-vagga 1.4: Sonadanda Sutta (DN 4) - - For example, For every authoritarian country that has managed to grow rapidly, there are several that have floundered. For every Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, there are many like Mobutu Sese Seko of the Congo.From http://www.hks.harvard.edu/\u2026/rodrik-commentary-project-synd\u2026 - -As the above excerpt said, most of the leaders want to bring their nations to prosperity. But in authoritarian countries, there are many Congo-like nations for one Singapore-like nation. -If one can ask each and every leader of all authoritarian countries whether he would like his country to be like Singapore or Congo, almost all the leaders will reply \u2018Singapore\u2019, I believe. -So what are the differences between the leaders of Singapore-like nation and Congo-like nation? - -There are only two fundamental differences among those leaders; -The leaders of Singapore-like nation are both wise and good. -The leaders of Congo-like nation may be good but not wise, may be wise but not good, or may be both not-wise and not-good. -Most of the leaders of the nations are not bad guys. If they are bad guys, they will not be leaders, mostly. Have you ever met a leader who wants to make his nation to become a failed state intentionally since he becomes a leader? -Each and every leader wants to leave a good name after he leaves the office, but only few of them achieve the intention. -It is not easy for a person to become a wise and good person. It is more difficult to be a good and wise leader. The leader has to make effort all the time to be wise and not to be bad. If not, he can become unwise and bad anytime during his life. It is very easy to be unwise and bad. There\u2019s no need to make any effort. -So for one leader to bring prosperity to the nation, he must try to be wise and good all the time. -If a leader is good but not wise, he will not know what is good and what is bad in most of the complex affairs. Therefore, there\u2019s a chance to make bad decision most of the time although he doesn\u2019t mean it. -If a leader is wise but not good, there is always a chance to make for his own good rather than nation\u2019s good in each and every minute of his office time. If he cannot control himself, he can always find loophole in his nation\u2019s law to make for his own good. -If a leader is not good and not wise, ........... then anyone can imagine what\u2019s the result. - -There are only a few leaders who are not good and not wise. -There are some leaders who are wise but not good. -There are more leaders who are good but not wise enough. -There are only a small amount of leaders who are both wise and good because it is too difficult. -So it is the reason that \u2026\u2026\u2026. For every authoritarian country that has managed to grow rapidly, there are several that have floundered. For every Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, there are many like Mobutu Sese Seko of the Congo.- \u2026. So Wisdom is purified by morality, and morality is purified by wisdom: where one is, the other is, the moral man has wisdom and the wise man has morality, and the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world.",

            "answer_text": "Having a most thankful heart. I will share one of my experiences with a Chaplain in the US Army. I had been going through a rough time. One morning, I went to my book shelf and reached out to read one of my many books. I luv reading and I luv books. As a matter of fact, when I went out with friends in the city, they would avoid going on streets with bookstores, as I would plead \u2018only ten minutes pleeease'! I promise. That never happened, it always ended in an hour or more, and they looking at books that interested them. I saw this little worn out, well read yellow covered book named Power In Praise and wondered, why I hadn't looked at this before. I had gotten it for one dollar at a sale of some kind. I am always curious and inquisitive about human behavior. I began leafing through this book. Initially, I was upset at the Author for writing such a book. However I continued as his words were those from the bible. I have seen these words the better part of most of my life. I never really took them to mean anything more than what they were, just good manners, I imagine. None the less, I had the God given right to be angry, upset, and rebellious in it's context, because it just did not fit the norm. If, I don't continue with the core of the intention of my answer, I will end up writing a book here. These are the Miraculous Words\u2026IN EVERYTHING GIVE THANKS AND GOD WILL TURN IT AROUND FOR GOOD. Oh! Really!!! This Book became the Foundation Of My Life for My Daily Living. I had to develop and grow some very strange new Faith Muscles. Ones, that would become the solution for everything in my life. I have seen so many diseases heal, so many miracles, so much joy. Get the book and experience it yourself. I am almost certain, your behavior and reaction will be akin to mine. It's life changing and forever beneficial reading his books. Namely from Prison to Praise and the Power in Praise (this one sold over 20,000,000 copies). This is the one, next to my bible and it's an easy read (I must have read it over a hundred time and luv it more and more each time). However, not easy to accept because the human mind has been taught and trained from a very tender age, that we need to work hard to achieve great success. NEVER, would anyone say work easy and you will have great success and less stress.) As for a better world, Forgiveness at the core and should be done daily on an individual basis. This will prevent a lot of dis-eases in the body, therefore also prevent a lot of illnesses in Humanity. Thus, a Better, Healthier and Happier World. Here's a little Meditation Prayer from Hawaii: I Am Sorry, Please Forgive Me, Thank You, I Luv You. Start your morning and End your day with this. Meditate and say this for a few before falling asleep and first thing in the morning. And you will see\u2026thx you. Second, in Everything Give God Thanks And God Will Turn The Situation Around For Good. I am not at that level to understand or know how it works, it just does. I now just accept it, that it's so. In conclusion, what I believe is that God Owns Everything, even our very lives. God decides who will wake up tomorrow and who won't. The one thing God does NOT OWN is our Thanks Giving in any situation, unless we choose to give to give it to him. And when we do, then trust that God will indeed by his divine nature and word, will work it out for our good. But, please keep in mind, when you choose to do this, do it because of who God is and not just as a bargaining tool to get what we want. When we do this as a global community, my tiny mind can't fathom what a Glorious world we can become. And so we begin this journey on an individual basis and see. I tell you\u2026you would be amazed. Please don't take my word for it, please test it and see for yourself. Thank you. I know this is a rather long answer, please forgive me. Much thanks for your time, luv/blessingsmo ",
