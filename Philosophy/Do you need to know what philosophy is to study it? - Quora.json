            "answer_text": "I suggest that whenever you reflect on a choice you have to make, you are doing philosophy. Simply defined from the Greek words \"philo\" and \"sophia,\" meaning \"love of wisdom\" is the word \"philosophy.\" Parsing the word offers an opportunity to consider more deeply what it means. All should know what \"love\" means even if it does not lend itself to a very precise definition or sometimes expression. The words \"want, need, and care\" are rolled up with a passion for defining love. The more interesting word in this context is \"wisdom.\" What does it mean to be wise? Almost any definition of wisdom tells us it is about making good, right or true choices, decisions, or judgments. For this argument, the word \"choices\" is used in the sense of choosing between good and bad, right and wrong, beautiful and ugly, true and false, natural and supernatural, scientific and pseudoscientific, etc. Thus, philosophy \"loves\" to study how we make \"choices\" in life. Consistent with this position, the Oxford English Dictionary defines \"philosophy\" in an etymological context as \"the love, study, or pursuit of wisdom, truth, or knowledge.\" philosophy, n. [Def. 1]. OED Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved August 27, 2019, from www.oed.com/view/Entry/142505. Making intentional choices is quintessentially human. Our daily lives are nothing if not about making choices. Many of them are mundane to be sure, but now and then a choice arises that requires thinking in a certain way. In this view, anyone that reflects on making a choice is a philosopher, if they reflect on the choice they have to make or have made. By thinking about how choices are made in life shows that thinking is not a monolithic undertaking as if there were but one way of thinking, but there are ways (plural) of knowing and thinking. For example, one might make a choice solely based on passion, upon which later reflection might suggest another and more rational choice may have been better. Thus, philosophy helps to sort out how best to think about and reflect on experiences in order to make better choices in life. Broad categories of philosophy include metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, logic, ethics, politics, and aesthetics. It will do well to assess definitions of these categories of philosophical study because, in one way or another, they describe what is at the very foundation of how we think and thus make choices.
