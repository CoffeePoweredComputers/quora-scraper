            "answer_text": "Time does depend on position in space-time. This is from general relativity. If you\u2019re on Earth, the time is different than at the Sun, or Pluto. This seems obvious since one planet takes more time to orbit than another. But that\u2019s not the reason. A better example is on Earth. There are good examples considering satellites and the International Space Station. But you asked on Quora for a reason. Let\u2019s consider Mt. Everest. The time on Mt. Everest, at the peak, is different than below, at the base of the mountain. The time zone is the same, so doesn't complicate things too much. You might ask why it would be different, even though we\u2019re in the same time zone. The reason is that of gravity. There is less gravity at the peak than at the base. Closer to the center of the Earth, means you will go through more gravity than a person at the peak. There is gravity that the mountain has on its own, and will change the effects slightly. I\u2019ll give you another example, the most famous of them all. The light box experiment from Einstein. This is actually a poor example because when Einstein tried to disprove quantum mechanics (actually he tried to state there was a better theory underlying quantum mechanics), he used the light box experiment. Technically, the answer for the experiment was not general relativity, but it does a play a role in the experiment. General relativity would change to times between a clock outside the box and the one inside the box. This is called time dilation. Einstein could have won his argument by stating quantum entanglement, but fortunately, he didn\u2019t. So basically, general relativity, gravity, affects time, and make time in one place different than another. My pencil next to my PC would give me a different time than that of my PC if they had internal clocks. For this reason, satellites were made so a time dilation would exist. Without it, GPSes would be absolutely wrong. Gravity affects time, so time will depend on your place within space-time. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Time isn't always the same. Imagine that you got a spaceship and you came close to the Event Horizon of a Black Hole. The gravitational field of the Black Hole would make it so that for you time would run normally, but to the rest of the universe outside of the gravitational field of the Black Hole time would go by much faster. What would be hours for you it would be several years here on the Earth. So, no. Time isn't the same all throughout the universe. Celestial bodies with a great gravitational field make it so the passage of time changes for the person in comparison to those in lower gravitational fields. Even if we could for example create some structure on the surface of the Sun and spend time there. If we were to communicate with the Earth you would notice that the divergence in terms of passage of time was greater than the distance the communications needed to travel. That divergence would be due to the Sun greater gravitational field. A difference in time. We have even proven this on the Earth using atomic clocks. Where two perfectly synced atomic clocks were split. One remained on the Earth and the other was sent to the ISS. When the clock came back to the Earth, there was a very slight humanly imperceivable different. But the clocks were no longer perfectly synced. So even something as living here on the Earth and living in space would have a difference in terms of passage of time. ",
