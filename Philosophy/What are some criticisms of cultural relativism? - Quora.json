            "answer_text": "There are arguments, to say that they are \"objective\" would mean, at least, that they are not debated right now and that would be wrong. Nevertheless, here are some. BROAD DEFINITION OF CULTURAL RELATIVISM Hypothesis : cultural relativism is a set of ideas roughly saying that depending on cultures and their metaphysics/their way of phrasing and understanding things, makes truth itself relative. viz. \"truth\" is relative to your langage/cultural background.  Main problematic consequences : 1. most social behaviors must be understood in their cultural frame and, therefore, can be justified as \"legitimate in their own culture\". Then, it becomes easy to justify a personal behavior as a \"traditional\" one in countries that recognize such relativism.  2. Truth being relative, so does justice, and many practices must be tolerated as \"culturally different\", although they hurt one's sense of justice and/or one's cultural and legal culture. ex. Many companies have authorized Sikhs to carry their ritual knife in planes because their are not supposed to separate from their knife. ARGUMENTS AGAINST CULTURAL RELATIVISM A. Their are some common concepts to every human on Earth.  As Philip Descola said in \"Beyond Nature and Culture\", although their are many different cultures, they can be classified in 4 categories, depending on their relation to the \"exterior\" and the \"interior\" (google him for a far more complexe conceptual distinction). Consequently, their are some basic structures common to every culture. Among them : the concepts of \"exterior\" and \"interior\", the absolute law to not kill outside of any legal/moral rules and incest, although the concept of family vary largely. B. Sciences may be challenged, but not contradicted.  Their are many things that western sciences cannot explains. MANY. But Sciences' results have proven efficient in many cases. ex. western medecin cured a lot of things that other medecins did not...but fails on many diseases that are inexplicably cured by \"traditional medecins\". The frontier between a scientific certainty and a scientific hypothesis is always blurry, but sciences results are there. And, as Bergson puts it : Science is no more about truth, it is about efficacy. (a thesis that can be discussed, of course, but is very relevant from a pragmatical point of view on cultural relativism.) C. Cultural relativism does not mean Moral relativism On that note, see Levi-Strauss's \"Race and History\" (which is a pure and methodic anihilation of racism). To be open to other cultures does not mean that one has to surrender his/her moral opinions. It only means that his/her moral opinions are challenged, have to be discussed, argued and potentially surrendered if proven that they cannot be argued properly. Here, the kantian categorical imperative prove to be a universal tool (see wikipedia for that). NB : to contradict cultural relativism is very often an easy way to get straight to racism and ethno-centrism. I tried here to speak with care but it is very easy to misinterpret what I said so as to think that one can impose his/her beliefs on someone else. Just to be clear : cultural relativism was born during the Enlightments' century to  prevent ethno-centrism and raise tolerance and clear-mindedness about our own cultural biases (see Diderot, Kant or Rousseau, even Montaigne, one century before). It is very important to keep in mind that argument \"C\" in my presentation does not allow one to abruptly condemn any behavior (except from some basics like \"killing outisde of law\") abruptly. ",

            "answer_text": " Some anthropologists argue strongly against cultural relativism. For example, Elizabeth Zechenter says that cultural relativists claim there are no universal principles of morality but insist on tolerance for all cultures. If tolerance is one universal principle, why shouldn\u2019t there be others? In addition, she points out that the concept of cultural relativism is often used to justify traditions desired by the dominant and powerful in a society. She points to a case in 1996, in Algeria, where two teenage girls were raped and murdered because they violated the fundamentalist edict against attending school. Are those girls any less a part of the culture than the fundamentalists? Would it make any difference if most Algerian women supported the murders? Would that make it right? Zechenter does not believe that international treaties, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, impose uniformity among diverse cultures. Rather, they seek to create a floor below which no society is supposed to fall. Cultural relativism promotes the idea that one countries cultural ideas should apply to the rest of the word. If we do that, it may not be possible to create a universal standard of human rights. ",
