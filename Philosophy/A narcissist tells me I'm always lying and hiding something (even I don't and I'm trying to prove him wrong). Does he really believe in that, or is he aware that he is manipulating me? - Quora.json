            "answer_text": "Actually it\u2019s both, together and at the same time. Victims/survivors often make the incredible mistake to think \u201cfrom their own mind\u201d of perspective. (call projection, you project your qualities on the narcissist) Here is an example. A survivor could think: \u201cIf I would say such a thing, I would either be in complete denial of what I am doing and not aware of it \u201cOR\u201d totally 100% percent aware. Nobody could do both, because I can\u2019t.\u201d This is a ENOURMOUS OUTRAGEOUS mistake, because if you could think like a narcissist, YOU WOULD BE A NARCISSIST. In finding the truth, or getting familiar with the way narcissist really thinks you have to COMPLETELY ABANDON THE WAY \u201cYOU\u201d THINK and turn it of for a while and than start using your imagination and invent something new you are not familiar with and could not imagine ever existed. Using your imagination, you will be able to conceive their fucked up way of thinking. The reality is that the narcissist does both together. He/She indeed does really believe in the lies they spat out AND are aware they are manipulating you AND do it with malice. All those 3 things together. ALL together ALL at the same time, or with few seconds/minutes aparts. Narcissist's are very good at attacking you knowingly, and 60 seconds later, convincing themselves they where the victims and where defending themselves. Since 60 seconds is kind of short, I say they do both together. ",

            "answer_text": "NEVER justify or explain yourself to a narcissist\u2026.. why should you? You\u2019ve done nothing wrong. It\u2019s their paranoia and projection which has them believe you\u2019re some negative person you\u2019re not. No apology is needed from you for THEIR unwarranted projection techniques/tricks and paranoia. They\u2019re trying to offload their own guilt/shame/confusion by these accusations as they don\u2019t want to own them and work on sorting them out. You learn over time that often the accusations which come from a narcissist are a description of themselves and what they\u2019re up to. That\u2019s how they give themselves away. Rather than justify yourself or apologise to the narcissist reflect their behaviour back to them. It\u2019s like a negative energy ball they\u2019ve thrown at you. It\u2019s not yours so throw it back to them. It starves them of supply, gives them nothing to hang on to and rag around. I did this once to someone and it left her speechless. I posted narc-articles on my facebook page. I\u2019d blocked her but she has a fake profile that she uses in case people block her. She came on the phone in a very accusing manner after \u2018WILL YOU STOP POSTING WHAT YOUR\u2019E POSTING, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT\u2019S ABOUT ME. I KNOW what you\u2019re up to behind the scenes\u2026. you\u2019re plotting and planning behind my back\u2019. I just responded \u2018No Amanda, they\u2019re your tactics you\u2019ve just described, don\u2019t offload on to me what\u2019s not mine, you need to own it.\u2019. She\u2019s not called since. LOL I knew I wasn\u2019t plotting and planning behind the scenes that\u2019s not how I operate, I\u2019m above board\u2026\u2026. so what was she talking about? I was only too happy to have escaped her nonsense, but I did find a lot of justification and stress relief in posting the narc articles on my page. Everyone needs an outlet. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right but she brought it on herself as she shouldn\u2019t have been snooping on my facebook page when I\u2019d blocked her. It had the desired effect regardless. ",

Hence how they can become so powerful over you. This way their manipulation appears to be pure and heartfelt when in reality its all a load of crap. If you do not fall into their trap, then the lie disassembles and the truth comes out eventually exposing the actual game they were wanting to play with you. If it were the truth to begin with then their would be explanations behind it showing reason. Thats why when the narc manipulates you and you ask them for explanations, they can't give you any because it was never the truth to begin with. This generalizarion helped me figure out when I was being manipulated. Which was constantly. ",

As we were divorcing, my ex suddenly started babbling every manipulation secret she\u2019d ever held from me. One trick was \u201cmake a false accusation and let the other person defend themselves, it\u2019s a great way to get people to open up\u201d. (And give her details to gossip about or use as leverage.) Or he could just be poking at you to see if he can get a negative emotional response because he\u2019s looking for amusement. Example. My ex spent much of the last few years together accusing me of being angry every morning over and over again. She would repeat the accusation until I\u2019d finally lose my cool. She would then say \u201csee, I told you that you were angry\u201d. Our marriage ended three months after I stopped losing my cool. That\u2019s all I can think of.

If that is the case I would say he is trying to shift the focus away from himself and onto you by accusing you of something he is probably doing. If you did not accuse him first he may actually believe this. It is common for us to be paranoid and untrusting of others and all it takes is an off putting feeling one day for no apparent reason to send us down this path of sabotage in the relationship.

When a person is prone to gaslighting people then they will be also manipulating themselves. This person is angry that you are arguing with them about what they know and believe to be true about you. When you are doing this then you are the one that should have kept your mouth shut. You are not allowed to talk unless you are spoken to and you had better have something that this person wants to hear and this will range from how it is your fault and you made them do this to you. This type of person will not have any of your shit. You are to do as you are told and sit. ",

And of course, he knows this, so your trying to prove him wrong is getting him attention and energy from you. Narcissists project their behaviours and faults onto other people. It gives them a sense of relief from it. But they will never acknowledge it, their fragile ego and sense of self won\u2019t allow them to take responsibility for anything or admit any fault. I hope that this helps you, Clare x ",
