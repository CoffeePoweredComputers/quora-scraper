            "answer_text": "Human beings do have free will but we do not use its power until we are consciously developed enough to be able to. Will power is a profound power of love. It will take us the next million years of consciousness development in the fourth density of love so that we have the ability to work with its immense power. The reason for the atheists view on determinism is because they have been conditioned by negative science since 1901. This was purposely done to keep humanity retarded in consciousness and thus limit their ability to use their free will when they choose their path of consciousness development. This year, 2020 is a year of choice. There is still around 9 years left of the unique cosmic energy that is pervading us all, to take advantage of it in relationship to becoming aware of our own unique consciousness. We need to be thinking of the children born around 2012, as their DNA has been upgraded and we are here to prepare the systems for them. This year will see the beginning of the end of the old corrupt systems and it is our job to fill the void with new, ethical ones. This is why understanding free will is so important. ",

            "answer_text": "If free will is defined as the existence of the possibility to consciously choose one out of many options, do human beings have free will? If you define free will as choice-making, then yes, clearly we all make choices. The problems arise out of what people mean by \u2018free\u2019. In the correct sense of the word, freedom implies the ability to make choices without coercion, and in that sense, also, yes, our choices are mostly free. However, our choice-making can never be truly free of influence. The choices we make reflect the sum total of all the influences that have formed us into what we are at the moment of making a choice. We cannot be free of that, because that is what we are. To be truly free of influence, would be to make random choices. ",
