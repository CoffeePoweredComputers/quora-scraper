All you can do is pick an object up and look at it. That\u2019s about it. The universe is just a big room filled with macroscale objects. Earth is just a warehouse. Meanwhile there\u2019s fucking politics. They don\u2019t even see the truth. Move paper x from desk y to desk z. That\u2019s all there is. ",

It is the mind that makes assessments on the value of things for an egoist use [to the mind\u2019s \u2018my and mine\u2019]. The mind is an appearance in existence, coming and going- it has no existence by itself. I, the perceiver of mind\u2019s transitory nature, am not the mind. ",
