            "answer_text": "Justification in epistemology is how you know something. A very traditional definition of knowledge that is often used as an educational tool is knowledge is true justified belief: for a thing to be known it must satisfy all 3 criteria. Different theories demand a different level of justification in knowledge, and often, in my opinion, these theories become practically skepticism as they posit practically unrealizable levels of justification. Although, it must be noted that not all epistemological theories rely, exactly, on justification, but something similar but different takes its place. Anyway, for any statement that you \u201cknow\u201d we can ask, well how do you know that? Sometimes this is relatively simple, I know that the sky is blue, how, because I looked at it. Other pieces of knowledge require more complex justification, a fact learned in school may ultimately rest upon the justification that I now my teacher went to school and learned stuff, well how do you know that, because she was teaching at a school district with certain requirements for teachers, well how do you know that, because there are rules and checks and balances in such a system, well how do you know that\u2026 We actually did this exercise in a class on epistemology, and the conclusion we came to is that ultimately, on the bottom, nothing is really justified, instead, its elephants all the way down. And, at the same time, it has to be noted that in the West, perhaps because of our history of ideas, we are trained from a young age in providing justifications for knowledge. The professor from the epistemology class cited studies done in other cultures where they were not trained for this sort of justificatory chain of reasoning, and the question, how do you know this? was simply met with curiosity, what do you mean how do I know? It would seem then that the focus on justification being a critical part of knowledge creates a bit of a feedback loop where we teach justification, and then we look for justification, and should we be surprised to find what we are looking for when we have already put it there?
