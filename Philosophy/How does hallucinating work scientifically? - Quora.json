            "answer_text": "Hallucinations are basically representational distortions in the perceptual organization machinery of the brain. The nature of the hallucination is a side-effect of which perceptual area of the brain is affected and the type of representational distortion occurring. The common meaning of hallucination is \"seeing or hearing something that isn't there.\" This would be an object-level or conceptual-level hallucination that might be a breakdown of the separation of perception and imagination. For example, vision and mental imagery use the same brain areas to represent what is seen vs. imagined. The brain keeps these activities separated from each other, but if interference between the representations occurs, what might otherwise be imagined would be seen. Many hallucinations are simply perceptual distortions, like seeing objects when looking at the clouds, or hearing \"ringing in the ears\", or objects that appear smaller or larger than they should. Seeing objects in the clouds is the brain's object-seeking machinery at work without much to work with. Ringing in the ears is a signal feedback loop in the auditory cortex that is not well understood. Objects appearing too larger or too small (macroscopia and microscopia) would be self-reinforcing distortions in the neural mechainery that represent object size. Michael Soso has some great answers on the neurological nature of visual hallucinations:What is the cause of closed-eye visual hallucinations?Why is it that people see geometric shapes while on certain drugs?Is it normal to see television snow when looking at a white wall?
