            "answer_text": "Yes, people can be emotionally smart. In 1983 an American developmental psychologist Howard Gardener described 9 types of intelligence: \u2022\tNaturalist (nature smart) \u2022\tMusical (sound smart) \u2022\tLogical-mathematical (number/reasoning smart) \u2022\tExistential (life smart) \u2022\tInterpersonal (people smart) \u2022\tBodily-kinesthetic (body smart) \u2022\tLinguistic (word smart) \u2022\tIntra-personal (self smart) \u2022\tSpatial (picture smart)  What other scientists thought were just soft-skills, such as interpersonal skills, Gardener realized were types of intelligence. It makes sense. Just as being a math whiz gives you the ability to understand the world, so does being \u201cpeople smart\u201d give you the same ability, just from a different perspective. So, as per the above classification, \u2018emotionally smart\u2019 people can be described as \u2018Intra-personal\u2019 and \u2018Interpersonal\u2019 Intelligent. The 9 Types of Intelligence 1. Naturalist Intelligence Naturalist intelligence designates the human ability to discriminate among living things (plants, animals) as well as sensitivity to other features of the natural world (clouds, rock configurations). This ability was clearly of value in our evolutionary past as hunters, gatherers, and farmers; it continues to be central in such roles as botanist or chef. It is also speculated that much of our consumer society exploits the naturalist intelligences, which can be mobilized in the discrimination among cars, sneakers, kinds of makeup, and the like. 2. Musical Intelligence Musical intelligence is the capacity to discern pitch, rhythm, timbre, and tone. This intelligence enables us to recognize, create, reproduce, and reflect on music, as demonstrated by composers, conductors, musicians, vocalist, and sensitive listeners. Interestingly, there is often a connection between music and the emotions; and mathematical and musical intelligence may share common thinking processes. Young adults with this kind of intelligence are usually singing or drumming to themselves. 3. Logical-Mathematical Intelligence Logical-mathematical intelligence is the ability to calculate, quantify, consider propositions and hypotheses, and carry out complete mathematical operations. It enables us to perceive relationships and connections and to use abstract, symbolic thought; sequential reasoning skills; and inductive and deductive thinking patterns. Logical intelligence is usually well developed in mathematicians, scientists, and detectives. Young adults with lots of logical intelligence are interested in patterns, categories, and relationships. They are drawn to arithmetic problems, strategy games and experiments. 4. Existential Intelligence Sensitivity and capacity to tackle deep questions about human existence, such as the meaning of life, why we die, and how did we get here. 5. Interpersonal Intelligence Interpersonal intelligence is the ability to understand and interact effectively with others. It involves ffective verbal and nonverbal communication, the ability to note distinctions among others, sensitivity to the moods and temperaments of others, and the ability to entertain multiple perspectives. Teachers, social workers, actors and politicians, all exhibit interpersonal intelligence. Young adults with this kind of intelligence are leaders among their peers, are good at communicating, and seem to understand others\u2019 feelings and motives. 6. Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence Bodily kinesthetic intelligence is the capacity to manipulate objects and use a variety of physical skills. This intelligence also involves a sense of timing and the perfection of skills through mind\u2013body union. Athletes, dancers, surgeons, and crafts people exhibit well-developed bodily kinesthetic intelligence. 7. Linguistic Intelligence Linguistic intelligence is the ability to think in words and to use language to express and appreciate complex meanings. Linguistic intelligence allows us to understand the order and meaning of words and to apply meta-linguistic skills to reflect on our use of language. Linguistic intelligence is the most widely shared human competence and is evident in poets, novelists, journalists, and effective public speakers. Young adults with this kind of intelligence enjoy writing, reading, telling stories or doing crossword puzzles. 8. Intra-personal Intelligence Intra-personal intelligence is the capacity to understand oneself and one\u2019s thoughts and feelings, and to use such knowledge in planning one\u2019s life. Intra-personal intelligence involves not only an appreciation of the self, but also of the human condition. It is evident in psychologist and spiritual leaders. These young adults may be shy. They are very aware of their own feelings and are self-motivated. 9. Spatial Intelligence Spatial intelligence is the ability to think in three dimensions. Core capacities include mental imagery, spatial reasoning, image manipulation, graphic and artistic skills, and an active imagination. Sailors, sculptors, painters, and architects all exhibit spatial intelligence. Young adults with this kind of intelligence may be fascinated with mazes or jigsaw puzzles, or spend free time drawing.

Machine learning and AI have the ability to improve outcomes and lower cost\u200a\u2014\u200aso don\u2019t fight the robots. Welcome the change in your industry and work to make it fruitful and complementary.Examine your own capabilities interacting with, motivating, and assessing people. Recognize your strengths and weaknesses when it comes to emotional intelligence.Invest in developing your emotional intelligence. The simplest way is to change your mental model about what is important in your role, and begin focusing on how you can better manage, influence, and relate to others. Or, take it a step further by seeking out training and stretch opportunities.What is Emotional Intelligence? According to Stanford GSB lecturer Lela Djakovic of EQED Emotional intelligence (EQ) is a set of five skills, namely Self Awareness, Self Regulation, Motivation, Social Skills and Empathy. These skills enable leaders and teams to access high performance and enhance results. Each of these skill areas corresponds to a set of behaviors that can be observed, practiced and learned. Ultimately, EQ is the ability to influence and get things done with and through other people.  Photo courtesy of EQED How can you learn emotional intelligence? Ironically, EQ cannot be learned by just reading about it. It needs to be experienced. Imagine trying to learn to ride a bicycle by reading about momentum, leverage, and rolling resistance. It wouldn\u2019t do you any good. Learning to ride a bicycle can only be learned by trying, failing, and trying again. Your brain needs to experience and remember the lessons of emotional intelligence. According to leadership trainer Ashley Zahabian, \u201cthe best way to be more emotionally intelligent is to stop and question your feelings before you act. Think about why you really want something you\u2019re craving. Is it actually something that\u2019s good for you, or are you just giving into your immediate gratification addiction? If you\u2019re considering doing something that will only feel good right now, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t do it. The long route\u200a\u2014\u200athe route that takes time and effort\u200a\u2014\u200ais always the better route.\u201d How important is learning emotional intelligence? According to Zahabian\u2019s interview in Forbes, \u201cStatistics from Harvard, Stanford, and Carnegie Foundation show that 85\u201387% of our success accounts from soft skills, emotional intelligence, and personal skills, yet we only pay attention to them 10% of the time.\u201d In order to tackle emotional intelligence, managers are realizing they have to more than recommend a few good books to their employees. Companies need to organize group workshops that address empathy and emotional intelligence training. These are the critical skills that will drive success. ",
