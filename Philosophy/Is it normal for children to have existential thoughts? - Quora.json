            "answer_text": "As Marietta McCarty points out in her book Little Big Minds, kids enjoy thinking about and talking about big philosophical questions. Unfortunately, it\u2019s often adults who shy away from these questions and assume that they are not appropriate for kids. In fact, there are quite a few resources geared towards young kids who take an interest in such questions. Here are a few you might find interesting and a good start to further learning about philosophy: Philosophy for Kids by David White The Examined Life by David White Philosophy for Teens by Sharon Kaye More Philosophy for Teens by Sharon Kaye Each of these books is divided by subject and each subject contains a number of questions each of which is addressed from the perspective of a relevant philosopher.

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. I used to have existential thoughts as a child. At the age of around 4 to 6, I remember myself suddenly asking myself \u201cWhat am I doing here having this experience? What reason?\u201d. Curious to find out the answer, I was drawn to astronomy, and physics as a child. My interest in astronomy and physics soon faded in my high school years as I realized science can\u2019t answer all questions. Fast forward 20 years later, and I am now an avid reader of philosophical works. But I do have a depressive personality, as I find less reason and meaning in many things in life. Meditation has helped me immensely however. ",
