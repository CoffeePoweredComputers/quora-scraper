            "answer_text": "Hello my name is Eli Rivera and I've lied my whole life. It's a habit that the whole world has. I\u2019m only 13 years old and I have a very big list of questions and here's one of them. Do you get the same result for lying and telling the truth? The reason I have this question is because most children are taught that lying is bad and telling the truth is better. Which is true. But I see lying and telling the truth the same thing. Here's why. I\u2019ve recently wanted to continue this experiment with my Dad. I'm in the 7th grade and right now we have to do homework online. So I wanted to see what reaction my Dad would have of me not doing my homework. So there were 2 things I did in this experiment. One, I lied and said I did the Homework. Then when he found out I didn\u2019t he yelled at me. And two, I straight up told him \u201cNo I didn\u2019t do the homework.\u201d And he was outraged. Of Course I still did the Homework last minute. But I didn\u2019t care about how mad my dad was about me not doing the Homework. I cared about how I got the same result for lying and telling the truth. So in my opinion, Lying and telling the truth doesn't matter because at the end of both you\u2019ll still get the same result.
