            "answer_text": "Let's assume omniscience exists. To be a curse, there must be no mechanisms for dealing with some overwhelmingly bad aspects of omniscience. This doesn't seem plausible since even beings with limited understanding have coping mechanisms for disruptive knowledge. Using tricks such as compartmentalization, thought stopping, wishful thinking, and things known only to the omniscient, I'm guessing an omniscient being can deal with the issue. So is omniscience a gift? I think this will depend on the personality of the omniscient being. If they have something akin to an optimistic or joyous outlook on life, it could be. Otherwise, it might be just another thing to cope with. ",

            "answer_text": "Would it be a curse? Suppose some being Z were omniscient. Would Z get bored by life, and restless about all problems and mysteries? Z would as it were already know how to not be restless, even with all knowledge. Would it be a gift, because Z knew how to never experience a negative like curse? But to always experience positive, would that not keep omniscience and actual experience separate: all knowledge but no corresponding experience to actualize it? Who knows whether omniscience is gift or curse? ",
