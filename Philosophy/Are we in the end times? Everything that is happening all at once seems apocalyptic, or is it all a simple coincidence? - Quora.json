            "answer_text": "Most will reject this but here is what the bible said would tell us we are in the \u201clast days\u201d. Bible signs of the \u201clast days\u201d and Jesus's return fulfilled in our time: Mathew 24:7 New King James Bible 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of sorrows. WAR: For the first time in the history of the world we have had World Wars embroiling all the worlds major and even minor nations. Since the beginning of WWI in 1914 there has NOT been even one day where a conflict has not been happening somewhere. There are around 40 such armed conflicts occurring in the world today. It is estimated that 388,700,000 persons have died due to war since the beginning of WWI in 1914. List of wars by death toll - Wikipedia FAMINE: One in every 6 people on earth go to bed hungry every night. It is stated that over 9,000,000 people die of starvation annually. As reported by UNESCO. PESTILENCE, DISEASE: The 1918 Flu epidemic killed over 50,000,000 persons world wide. We have new diseases appearing AIDS, West Nile Fever, Ebola, Lyme Disease, etc. Old diseases such as Malaria, Tuberculosis. Gonorrhea and Syphilis have re-arisen and are becoming resistant to current treatment. More and more common bacterial infections are becoming resistant to antibiotics every year. We are yet to see what impact COVID-19 will have world wide. EARTHQUAKES: \u201cAt any one moment in time, an earthquake is taking place somewhere in the world, just as around 40 volcanoes or so are erupting . It\u2019s one thing to say it; it\u2019s another, far more impactful thing entirely to see it. So do yourself a favour: watch these quakes rock the planet, and you might just come away with a new appreciation of how unbelievably active our planet is. \u201c Watch 100 Years Of Earthquakes Rock The World In This Incredible Animation Proliferation of false religion: Mathew 24:23-25: \u201cThen if anyone says to you, \u2018Look, here is the Christ!\u2019 or \u2018There!\u2019 do not believe it. 24 For false Christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. There are thousands of different \u201cChristian\u201d denominations world wide today all claiming \u201chere is the Christ\u201d. World Christian Encyclopedia (2001, 2nd edition) Most will ridicule and/or ignore the warnings in scripture: 2 Peter 3:4-7 NKJB 3 knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts, 4 and saying, \u201cWhere is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.\u201d Luke 17:26-30 NKJB 26 And as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man: 27 They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all. 28 Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot: They ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built; 29 but on the day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all. 30 Even so will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed. Very few have any concern over this and are taking appropriate action. The world goes on with its politics, wars, oppression of people, etc. and does not realize or care that the world is at the threshold of the Great Tribulation as stated by Jesus and recorded in scripture, ignoring the warnings just as the people did in Noah\u2019s day. When God told Noah that HE was going to bring the world to an end, he stated that from the time HE declared it to Noah it would be 120 years until in happened. This gave Noah time to build the ark and gather all the animals while warning the world that the end was coming. God never takes action against man without providing a thorough warning and a way to salvation. While some may argue rightly that these things have always occurred, true but not all in the same era. That said, Jesus also stated a major sign that would be apparent to all the world, one that has never occurred until our time: Mathew 24:14 NIV 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. Officially since 1922 the Jehovah's Witness organization has been proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and warning that we are in the \u201clast days\u201d and this way of life is soon to come to and end as it did in Noah's day. Currently there are over 8,700,000 witnesses worldwide doing this work. There has not been the remotest place on the earth in any of over 900 languages that have not been told of the Gospel and what it means for them. Like Noah, (What is that crazy old fool doing? Building a boat in the middle of dry land and telling everyone God is going to make it rain and flood the earth?). So too they have been ridiculed as religious fanatics, a cult, a sect, heretics, false prophets, etc. They have been banned and persecuted by governments (including the USA) and rejected by main line churches who tell their members that the \u201clast days\u201d are long in the future, if ever, not to worry about such things and whatever don't listen to any of those \u201ccultist\u201d Jehovah's Witnesses. I have cited scripture and other verifiable information to support this comment as objectively as possible. My comments provide information for consideration and are not intended as a challenge to anyone's personal beliefs. I tell no one what to believe. ",

            "answer_text": "My grandmother, rather dryly I might add, had the following grain of wisdom when my father and some of his brothers visited her a few months ago, complaining about the current state of things (I will paraphrase, first and foremost because she isn\u2019t, nor can she speak, English): \u201cIt\u2019s been but a few months. You have your health, you have food on your tables, and most of you even have your jobs. The war lasted for five years.\u201d Those were five years where young men were sent to the fronts to die (or the back to starve in trenches). Several years of food shortages, of enemies infiltrating the homeland, of prisoners of war, of having to hide fugitives and bury your radio because it was the only means of information from abroad. No netflix, no internet, our royal family had fled the country, our government was but a puppet ran by a traitor. Our youths ran around in the forests dying for a fatherland that may be eternally lost. If you want to see bad, come back at me in 2025 and tell me it lasted that long. Sure, we don\u2019t know how long this one will last, but I know we aren\u2019t currently eating the bark off trees, making flour from nuts because there\u2019s hardly anything to go around in the harsher winter months. It\u2019s bad, yes. It can get worse, yes. But these are yet to be the worst times humanity has faced. Even the Second World war wasn\u2019t the worst (but very bad in its own right). And we\u2019re not even a year in - yet the world of scientists is more or less collectively working towards a vaccine and other alternative treatments, not due in 2025, but perhaps as soon as next year. Oh, will we reel from the impact of 2020 for years to come, mentally, physically, financially. But the end times? We feel it because we\u2019ve been connected so tightly as a world as of late. We\u2019ve been more isolated, in more dire straits, more ignorant, more aggressive towards our neighbour. These aren\u2019t the end times. These are a silent and boorish time spent speculating far too much whether the end times are upon us. ",

But climate trends of global warming have been more and more clear that we face mass extinction as a result of global warming and the dozens of positive feedback loops we\u2019re seeing. The much-reviled Dr. Guy McPherson has been warning that we\u2019re facing mass extinction by or before 2030, but at this point, 2030 seems optimistic. This year is showing loss of Arctic Ice sufficient to create a \u2018blue ocean event\u2019 in the North Pole.This would accelerate warming to the point where we would be unable to grow staple crops such as corn and soybeans. That is not the only threat we\u2019re facing\u2014in 2018 I created a post for Quora on the issues, and it\u2019s here. Our path to the end. The good Dr\u2019s latest peer reviewed paper indicates that COVID19 and the industrial shutdown it started might be enough to lead to mass extinction. https://opastonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/will-covid-19-trigger-extinction-of-all-life-on-earth-eesrr-20-.pdf.

For hundreds of years, people in some sort of crisis (or series of crises) have thought they were living in end times. It\u2019s a very common parochial attitude. In the middle ages, the Plague killed 25 million people, a third of the population of Europe. The Nazis murdered six-million Jews in death camps. I\u2019m betting a lot of them thought they were living in end times, even though capita-E, capital-T End Times is a Christian idea. The citizens of Hiroshima\u2014the ones who survived\u2014probably thought the same thing. As did the citizens of Pompeii. Throughout History, entire populations have been wiped out. There have been invasions, diseases, famines, floods \u2026 Sometimes multiple disasters happened at once. In the 20th Century, there was a World War, followed by pandemic, followed by a world-wide economic depression, followed by another World War, which concluded with two cities being destroyed by nuclear weapons.

There are unique combinations of energy coming from each constellation which inform humanity\u2019s ideals, thoughtforms and institutions, already the effects of the energies of the new Age are being seen world wide with people demanding justice, inclusion and equality.It is the end of the old times and beginning of the new. Always a Teacher comes at the start of an Age who embodies and demonstrates to humanity the highest ideals of the new energies. Jesus was such a one and through Him his teacher, the Christ.This time round it is Maitreya and with Him 40 other Masters of Wisdom. Humanity has reached a cusp of the next great step in evolution, spiritual evolution. We have lived attached to matter long enough and with the help of the Masters and Maitreya we will take our next steps toward Heaven on Earth. ",
