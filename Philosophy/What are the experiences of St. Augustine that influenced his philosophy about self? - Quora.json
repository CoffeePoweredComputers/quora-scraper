            "answer_text": "That is, unfortunately, too long of a story for this forum. And, it doesn\u2019t lend itself to a short and succinct summary. However, Saint Augustine himself told us all about that in great detail in his short and easy to read book Confessions. Since you are obviously interested in him, I suggest you find a copy of that book in a library or book store and read it. It is inexpensive and widely available. Plus, it is well worth your time to read it \u2014 especially if you are Roman Catholic as I am. ",
