Breaking it down a little, these come to mind. we are born to die2. learning by experience ( sometimes a very painful way of learning ) 3. the possible wisdom that comes with growing old ( often too late to enjoy fully ) 4. having to obtain a degree to perform work that often has nothing to do with the degree 5. obtaining what one wants and feeling miserable The last 3 are a variation of learning by experience so I will stop here.

            "answer_text": "No one experiences paradoxes in reality, common or otherwise. Every so-called paradox is a matter of someone mis-perceiving reality\u2014which does not contradict itself. Some people like to deliberately create paradoxes by saying things that are cleverly absurd\u2014as mere word games\u2014or as a show of intellect.  Notice: paradox : something (such as a situation) that is made up of two opposite things and that seems impossible but is actually true or possible : someone who does two things that seem to be opposite to each other or who has qualities that are opposite : a statement that seems to say two opposite things but that may be true Source: merriam-webster.com In every case, the \u201cparadox\u201d occurs in the observer\u2019s mind\u2014the contradiction is a matter of limited or inaccurate perception. That\u2019s all it is, folks. Nothing to get excited about.  ",
