            "answer_text": "If the universe is a simulation, does the simulator live in another simulated universe? I can\u2019t see how you can ever have a \u2018simulated\u2019 universe. I take the Carl Sagan approach by discarding confusing terms like \u2018our universe\u2019 or \u2018multiverse\u2019 & even \u2018simulation\u2019. Sagan made things much simpler by starting off all his Cosmos programs by saying \u2018The cosmos is all there is or was or will ever be\u2019 & left it at that. What a brilliant stroke! Now all we have to ask is \u2018Are there good reasons to believe claims that \u2018X\u2019 is likely to be part of the cosmos?\u2019 That means that if there are no good reasons to believe that there are any mermaids under the sea on Earth (rather than mermaid like aliens elsewhere) mermaids can be dismissed as something likely to be part of the cosmos which may I remind you is \u2018All there is or was or will ever be\u2019 i.e. Seen or unseen. From that perspective we can stop worrying about whether something is merely simulated because that\u2019s of no major consequence if that\u2019s all that can be said in much the same way as you wouldn\u2019t be too happy receiving wages in simulated coins or simulated bills. What matters is what ISN\u2019T simulated. If there are no compelling reasons to believe claims that the cosmos (rather than \u2018universe\u2019) is merely simulated (as I\u2019d say is the case) there\u2019s no good reason to believe that it is. If I\u2019m wrong how can simulation claims be tested in such a way that could potentially fail if they did happen to be wrong? Can anyone say? I don\u2019t think that anyone can in which case why believe such claims? ",

            "answer_text": "If the universe is a simulation, does the simulator live in another simulated universe? Well, I suppose it could be possible. Realize that the simulator never lives in his own simulation. By the definition of simulation: (computing) the technique of representing the real world by a computer programRepresentation of something (sometimes on a smaller scale)you can see that a simulation represents something else. The question is, to whom. Well, the external simulator. ",

            "answer_text": "The idea of living in a simulated universe has a strange fascination and I\u2019m not sure why. Although I\u2019m not immune to this fascination, it\u2019s painfully obvious that in our present state of development we have no way to know whether or not we are all simulacra. Nor, let\u2019s say, if we knew we were a simulation, how this could make any difference in our day-to-day existence. That said, There is no reason\u2014no logical reason\u2014to think that if we are a simulation, whomever is running our simulation can\u2019t be the result of a higher order simulation. In fact, by the same reasoning, why can\u2019t there be many layers of simulations? Perhaps infinite layers. . .infinity is always creeping into our equations to such an extent that I, for one, believe that infinity\u2014of existence, of universes and everything else is the case. And if that is so, then there are infinitely more simulations than say \u2018real\u2019or starter worlds which (by statistical inference) would mean the odds are vanishingly small that we are NOT a simulation. But, here again. . .crops must be sown and harvested, the tide comes in, the tide goes out and, as always. . . bills must be paid. T. ",
