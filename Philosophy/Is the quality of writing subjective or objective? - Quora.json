            "answer_text": "I think it is both. Everything in the whole world is subjective. As the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote: The ether was filled with electromagnetic waves but all was dark until man opened his seeing eye. I think LW was being entirely too generous there anent what there is apart of human subjectivity, in which Being itself comes to be, along with all beings). On the other hand, there is \u201csubjectivity\u201d in the fool\u2019s sense or maybe nonsense, and there is \u201cobjectivity, again in the fool\u2019s sense or maybe nonsense. \u201cSubjectivity\u201d in the sense of not grounding one\u2019s ideation in the most rigorous critical and self-critical investigations, is bad news: call it prejudices, at best. \u201cObjectivity\u201d in the sense that human persons\u2019 living experience is less-than-thought to be just more lumps of matter in motion in the lumpenverse does not distinguish objects from the human faculty of intending objects as experienced things [Edmund Husserl\u2019s noemata and noesis]. Quality is writing is even more complicated. Dreck is dreck. But a person who knowingly chooses to make use of linguistic \u201cnorms\u201d as raw material for their discourse, rather than just following orders, surely is more honorable than a prig teacher who has the arrogance to garade children as if they were slabs of USDA, and then adds insult to injury by noting the kid spelled a word \u201cwrong\u201d, maybe even teach\u2019s name, God forbid? I would say, if you are writing a dissertation or for a peer reviewed journal, do due diligence. If you are writing for fun, all symbols in the whole history of humankind, from elementary particles of various persons\u2019 G-d\u2019s, is ore for you to mine and do your alchemy/chemistry on. Have fun when it is safe to do so! ",

            "answer_text": "There is a point where it is a mere matter of preference, but a lot of it is objective. Poor grammar, bad spelling, unorganized structure and the like just make one\u2019s idea hard to grasp. It is not just a matter of not following established norms for writing : the problem is that a poorly written text is sometimes nearly impossible to understand. I have corrected papers at many levels and trust me, you can clearly see the difference between poor writing and good writing. Simple examples can illustrate this. Imagine you had a bad day and you want to make it sound like it was awful. Conveying that feeling will be much more effective if you start by telling the less annoying things that happened to you and then follow with the really bad stuff than if you do the opposite. Or if you want to make an argument that has a simple structure, like \u201cIf p, then q, and p, therefore q\u201d, it will be more convincing to first state that \u201cIf p, then q\u201d and then state that \u201cp\u201d than if you do the opposite. Why? Simply because if you start by stating \u201cp\u201d with the intention of stating \u201cIf p, then q\u201d afterwards, there is no context that makes us understand why you are stating \u201cp\u201d in the first place. Stating the conditional statement first provides context for the subsequent statement of \u201cp\u201d. There are obviously countless other examples. The point is these are all things that makes a story more interesting or an argument more effective in an objective sense, and not merely because we prefer one option over the other. ",
