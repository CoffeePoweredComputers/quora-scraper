            "answer_text": "A response that is not based on how big a world socially is: At this level of simplicity towards complexity society go along through the motions of peaceful fairness, by endless manners to do business/negotiate but the fact remains: enduring peace can not be established by inducing others the necessary mutual respect that enable actions devoid of antagonism. So enduring peace can\u2019t be established. Consequently societies are permanently in strife/conflict by the elemental factor that actions devoid of hostility/antagonism can\u2019t be enforced/induce. They are self-taught by the human individual by an act of free will. Does it help? ",
