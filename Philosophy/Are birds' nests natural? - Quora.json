            "answer_text": "What do you mean, are they \u2018natural\u2019? The birds build them in many ways; depends on the species. They are natural in that each type of bird has its own way. Using twigs and string in a major one. The string is made by humans, but the birds find pieces. The making of the nest is natural to the bird, but it will use anything that it can find that is useful, including string and other things that might be human-made items. Other types of nest can include other bits of man-made stuff. Or things like animal hair, moss, anything! Shiny things can end up in nests, too. ",
