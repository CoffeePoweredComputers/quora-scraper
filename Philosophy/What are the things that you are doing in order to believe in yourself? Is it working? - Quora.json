            "answer_text": "Hello Himanshu , hope you are doing well ! I have been quite on this platform for a long time and I\u2019ve been asked this question in right time as your question and the actions i took up recently and have been following now to answer your question are in parallel. Mostly, i would remain quiet or would pass this question like many other Q\u2019s instead of answering or tend to remain the same who i was for the past few months. Many times, we tend to get stuck in some situations where we would be hit with multiple options for a one path way. Right from many small things in our routine like choosing a dish from a menu card to choosing a big way in order to create huge impact upon our decision making, we sometimes get this question of believing our own self. We may sometimes feel sorry for the dish we choose over some least preferred. Also, we would feel bad and sometimes curse ourselves as an aftermath of our stupid decisions. Altogether, this might be the biggest reason to stop pushing ourselves forward despite being tired of trying over and over. We need not be a perfectionist in making decisions after all huge success started with more or less small or huge failures. I\u2019m not answering here the way we need to follow or not going to construct a predefined path constructed by someone that had thrown that someone inshore from storms. I will try to make the reader here to run through my experience that boosts the damn morale that makes someone \u201dmade or broke\u201d. Why am i talking about the morale here.. Well first things first.. > Building without bricks/wood? > Eating without food? > Breathing without air? > Pushing without Morale? I hope you got it by now. There are lot many ways in building that morale.. My way here is simple based on a fact. Let us continue by welcoming the fact that you have consumed your 1-2 minutes of your valuable life till now after you\u2019ve started reading this answer by some stranger. Let us embrace to another fact that these minutes are gone forever and really makes one sick if you script this fact on the epitaph of your brain. We are knowingly or unknowingly, consciously or unconsciously, letting this time to pass. In other words, we are letting our valuable life\u2019s to melt as a second passes away. The moment you read this sentence, a second or two of that precious life is gone. Think and read it again. A bigg AGHAST! No. A very BIG aghast!! :-( Knowing the importance of time trigger the ripples followed by knowing the value of self. TIME is everything. We know that. Time once gone is gone forever. So is the life. HEY !! we know this as well. If its too long to read and interpret ( I don\u2019t feel/think so), here\u2019s my answer  Take a paper and jot 1 to 30 down. These represent the days of a month. Let us consider it a PHASE for the namesake. Day 1 is the day, where You enter as How you are then. Note down, if not, record how you are, how your feelings are, how your actions are, how your Habits are. Focus on that one particular thing of what you are compelling on for so long to change that one thing. These are the days that are going to Beat the hell out of you. Just be prepared before you start this process. Day 1 is your day. Stay as if you used to be as you were. Let the things flow around you. Day 2 >> Congrats , your mind now consciously knows that a day has passed and looks for any difference in you. Let the day 2 pass. Day 3 >> Again ! You are where you are. Day 4 >> Knowingly, Something has started in you. Hasn\u2019t yet? What is that something. \u201cOh boy! 3 damn days were passed. What am I doing with these numbers? If this is what your inner baby shouts, wait! you are on track. If not this, and day 4 seems like every normal day, congrats, this answer is not for you. Some alter ego or god can help you. I\u2019m not your alter Ego! Most of the population falls under the former category. Thanks for being human. Now as my fingers while typing mentioned earlier, every second counts if you deep think, because your life is melting with every sunrise! Sun rises, so makes the date and day change. You are getting a day closer to your Birthday. (If today is your B\u2019day, My B\u2019day Wishes to you) Which means you are getting older. Which means you are getting a day nearer to the other edge of birth. This is the thought process, that\u2019s it. You are into the game called \u201cPHASE\u201d Day 5>> You by default start thinking \u201cPassed 4 good days in THINKING of changing that focus point. Is this going to be the same way on coming days?\u201d All you did is Thinking. Just thinking. Day 6>> Start comparing from day 1 to day 6. You have literally tested (wasted) 6 valuable days. Day 7>> A week from day 1, You are not who you used to be. By now, you should implement what you think because, you have started thinking and what you are doing is THINKING and COUNTING and SEEING the days passed. Days are getting passed and what about you? Letting the days passed. I may tell you to run from the day 1 to see the different you by the end of 31. Nope, one knows the value of something when its lost forever and if one knows the value of it. Here, the one you lost is the time, your life is getting decreased day by day in this GAME. Remember! Put things into practice. \u201cDidn\u2019t you get bored of counting 7 damn days you faggot!\u201d This is how I talk to my SELF. Day 8>> You are now a bud which is about to blossom. Don\u2019t try to blossom in a day. Water(Feed) the plant(soul) with good water(thoughts) so that the flower(actions) spreads its fragrance(result of thoughts) in all directions. Strike off each day as it passes by.. Day 9, Feed and Act . Day 11, Frustrated ? Exhausted? Look back and you have been doing this for 10 big days of your life... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ...... Day 19 Feed and Act.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..Day 29 Feed and Act .. . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . ..Day 30\u2026\u2026A big Gift !! (Unlike on the earliest days in the process, the first step to \u201cstop thinking and start doing\u201d may occur on the any given day in the span of 30 days..But but, try to implement as early as possible because Trying early and failing early is always a better take away than Trying late as the time had already passed and we never stop growing old. Start by thinking of it for a second, and increase it slowly but surely so that I becomes your habit in no span of time) Now, take a deep breath . Just compare who you used to be on the Day 1. Are you the same. NO! Not in terms of the way you think. Even if you tend to get lost and go back to the day 1 in this process, remember Why you have started and the things you are going to achieve post implementation. Get to know the prominence of time and Life. Once gone, its gone for ever. Is this working? A big Yes for ME! Is this helpful? Please let me know after you\u2019ve finished trying. Now, are you believing in yourself? Yes I'm #FEEL_THE_DIFFERENCE Love&Peace. ",

            "answer_text": "It is definitely working. I set up 40 goals to be completed in a month divided into 4 sections including Personal, Office, Spiritual and Skill with 10 goals each. I work on accomplishing them. It helps me to stay focused, giving a sense that I am going in right direction. I just transform simple tasks into Goals. For example, if I want to finish a book but it also stresses me as to how I will go about doing it. I just say, create a 3-chapter goal. Seeing only 3-chapter to be completed seems easily achievable and it makes the going easier. In such chunks I get my big task completed. Its not only about reading, this trick is associated with other activities as well which I find daunting but want to do it. There was a time wherein I did not have any such system in place. I did whatever and whenever I wanted. Problem with this was - I used to start things and work until I was motivated. After that, somehow, I could not continue it either considering the thing to be too tough or not feeling like exerting effort. With this approach, with clear deadline and clear achievable-goals defined, I have clear picture of where I am going and what I will achieve reaching there. Completing one thing motivates to get going with rest of the things. More than anything, this really makes me happy as I am investing my time in things I want and not just merely letting each day to pass without achieving anything. ",
