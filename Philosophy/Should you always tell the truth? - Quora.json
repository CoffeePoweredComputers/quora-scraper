            "answer_text": "Truth is an accurate description of reality (or something in it). We can make false statements by accident, because we made a mistake about reality. But a lie is when we make try to describe reality (or something in it) in an inaccurate way on purpose. Knowledge of reality is generally a good thing to have, so if there\u2019s no significant reason to lie, it\u2019s obvious that you should tell the truth, and not lie. Also in many cases, you may give people a different truth than what they asked for, or not give them all the truth they asked for. That is, you can circumvent telling people things which you don\u2019t want to. So a lot of the time you can avoid lying. But there are times when you will need to chose between showing a truth which you don\u2019t want to, and lying. So should we always tell the truth? First answer me this: How important is the truth to you? If the truth is not important to you, there are some things you should know. Firstly, polygraphs usually pick up when you lie. I know a man who passed a polygraph, and told a lie to shield his friend. The lie was not detected. But I have never heard of someone telling lies about themselves and passing a polygraph - not unless they had practiced the lies so much that they believed them. Polygraphs detect stress. It looks like from a physiological perspective that telling lies is not as easy on you, on very basic level, as telling the truth. And the man who hid his lie was only able to do it because on that basic level, shielding his friend was more important. So even if you convince yourself otherwise, lying might not be a healthy thing to do. Secondly, there is a huge number of lies that are discovered eventually. And the discovery of a lie is almost universally worse than if the truth were given in the first place. In summary: if you don\u2019t care about the truth you can lie, but you should first ask yourself if it\u2019s worth the stress, and if the lie could ever be discovered. If it could be discovered, better to take the hit now. After all, whom are you speaking to, and what are you afraid of? If a friend doesn\u2019t like you because you told them the truth when they demanded it from you, do they like you, or are they friends because of illusions? Many people lie because they have \u2018friends\u2019 who will only be friendly while their sometimes ridiculous expectations can be met. These \u2018friends\u2019 are not people you should hang around. They are snobs. I am not saying do not lie ever. I am saying: lie, while being fulling aware of the consequences. But maybe the truth is important to you. It\u2019s important to me. I belong to an awesome cult of folks called the Roman Catholic Church. A lot of this church\u2019s bishops and non-church goers treat being a catholic as a sort of cultural or business thing. And right now, that\u2019s finally coming back to bite some of them. (Sadly, there\u2019s also been a fair amount of believers paying for the failures of obvious hypocrites.) But if you\u2019re actually serious about being catholic, truth is one of the things God does, and lying is acting against him. But you don\u2019t have to be religious to have the truth be important to you. There are a lot of scientists/philosophers/gurus/people like that who make consider being truthful extremely important. So if the truth is important to you, ask yourself how important and why. Then you\u2019ll know at what times it\u2019s appropriate to lie. You\u2019ll always be inclined to lie because it\u2019s the easiest thing to do at the moment. Similarly, it\u2019s always easiest to grab that milkshake, or not go to the gym. But you should figure out when (if ever) you should lie beforehand, and stick to that. You\u2019ll probably fail. I know people who rarely lie. I know people who just plain don\u2019t lie. But I lied somewhere around December 4th, which was about three weeks ago. So long as I believe in the christian god, I shouldn\u2019t be lying. So I made note of it. I make notes when I mess up, so I can keep track of my improvement. If I\u2019m not improving, I take steps to make sure I do. If I have trouble with lying I talk to someone about the problem to get advice, or take action to counter-act the problem. For instance, if you tell a friend about your lie, why you did it, and why it\u2019s bothering you; the fact that you\u2019ve exposed you own lie tends to make you less inclined to lie in the future.

The elephant trainer notices that and thinks, 'This royal elephant has not given up its life to the king.' But when the royal elephant... having gone into battle, uses its forefeet & hindfeet, its forequarters & hindquarters, its head & ears & tusks & tail & his trunk, the trainer notices that and thinks, 'This royal elephant has given up its life to the king. There is nothing it will not do.'\"In the same way, Rahula, when anyone feels no shame in telling a deliberate lie, there is no evil, I tell you, he will not do.
