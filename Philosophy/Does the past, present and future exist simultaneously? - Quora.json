            "answer_text": "This is the common concept of time travel, but that nobody of note has checked for its logical consistency. From some nobody you can find a very detailed analysis of the contradictions, physical improbabilities and procedural impossibilities of a simultaneous existence of past, present and future can be found on the page Zeitreisen Unm\u00f6glich Endg\u00fcltiger Beweis, unfortunately only in German. The site will be closed in the next months. A jpg in German will be sent to you. One big problem is the origin of that One of the core problems of assuming the existence of a past is the origin of matter. Materia would have to form anew with each layer of the past, i.e. divide or copy from nothing, which is extremely improbable. Furthermore, it would not be possible to measure time in the past. However, science can still measure time down to one attosecond, so the formation of the past would have to occur in even shorter intervals. This in turn means that in one second 1 trillion (=1 attosecond) past universes with the entire mass of the universe would have to be formed. This is extremely improbable. Then there is a structural paradox with the assumption that the three time layers would exist simultaneously. For one thing, there is a space-time layer in which everything has already happened, neither past - present nor future. There is no level from which one can look at these layers of time from above, they all exist simultaneously. LEdiglich a relative difference between two concrete points in time as sooner or later is determinable. But there would be no present, because everything would be present. Logically and conceptually, the simultaneous existence of past, present and future is not possible. But the basic paradox is the lack of a real present. Such a real present would have no future, because on this real present level reality is created in the first place. Without a real present level, a space-time model cannot explain its own creation, which makes it rather implausible. You can't claim to exist, but at the same time exclude the creation of your own existence. This is a structural paradox. If you would insert a real present into this model, you would have only one past and one real present. Within the past there would only be relative past and relative future and a subjective perceived present. The advantage of a lack of a real present is that you must not think of such questions as: How does a present copy itself into a past and how often? Where does the matter for the whole past come from ? because simply everything is already there. The core problem with the assumption of a real present, however, is that the reader's present could be the real present, which, with the absence of any reference to existing pasts or futures, in conjunction with the aforementioned extreme improbable physical facts, makes the probability assumption that there are no materially existing pasts and futures.

            "answer_text": "The past, present and future are all happening simultaneously because there is only one moment in time that exists, has ever existed or will ever exist.The name we have collectively agreed upon to give to that single moment is...\"NOW\".It is literally the only moment in history. That moment is history itself.The only thing that shifts is our perspective of that single moment. We just view it in different ways.As our perspective shifts, we observe that single moment from different vantage points. And, in our physical reality, we interpret that movement through our perspectives as a serially-based concept we call \"time\" because our physical vantage point is only capable of interpreting that movement in a linear one-perspective-at-a-time fashion.It's a bit like having a series of static photos to look through. Many people like to live in dreams about their future)But as for me I try to enjoy every moment) And I think that to remember your past is much more important than you think)So, unfortunately, I don't remember many moments from my childhood, but I'm sure that these moments have had some effect on my life) So, I want my kids will have a chance to know almost everithing about themselves when they are adults) so I keep a small diary on http://lifetile.me ",

            "answer_text": "Well, future and past simply don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s just the present which has meaning and existence.  How? Let\u2019s call a moment in time as T. The time before T, which is called past, has passed and there\u2019s no means to access, alter or live in it. Because if we somehow access it or start living in it, it becomes the present. Hence, the past ceases to exist.  Our past was future once, thus non-existent. Then it became present and started to exist. But a moment later, a new moment from future became present and the former one had to leave into non-existence. Though you can still capture the pastin your memories or in your hard drive. Similarly, future doesn\u2019t exist until T reaches to a particular point in time. When that particular point in time is reached, the future becomes the present and starts to exist. A moment later, it becomes the past, and thus again ceases to exist.  Hence, there\u2019s only present which exists, all time before or after that doesn\u2019t exist, i.e, neither past nor future. We can just make assumptions for the future or could remember our past. They used to exist, when they were present at a particular point in time, but now they are not. Cheers! ",

Each clock has a means for either displaying the count or keeping a record of it. The ongoing count of these rotations is mistakenly given the title of time, which has no singular rational form of meaning. Thus the time is oxymoronic. A time is displayed by the display means. So there is no single thing which can be labeled time. The best one can do is observe these times on clocks. There is one equation in physics which insures Mother Nature is always consistent in operating a clock. It is E=hv which insures energy is transferred in fundamental processes with consistency. That equation is responsible for, at least, a minimal uncertainty of all observations. Existence assumes someone has an operating clock or there would be no means for keeping track of the rotations. Certainly the light we observe has come from somewhere in the past and there is no clock means possible for observing something that has not happened. So, everything we observe happened in the past. If the observed event is close you will not have to wait long to observe it. But, you will never observe it before it happens, because scientific method would be violated and Mother Nature would have violated cause then effect Only mathematicians are allowed to do that! ",

One can imagine an eternal realm where God sits and all past future and parallel timelines are all part of the one eternal thing. Eternal topology objects such as inertiagons can be imagined or projected onto lower dimensional views we can see. just as we  can show 3D objects on a 2D TV so we can show 4D objects in 2D or 3D.  BUT from our perspective the past is gone and the future is able to be influenced. ",

Now try to capture that \u2018now\u2019 by the means of the measure units associated with the concept of time- can you? This \u2018now\u2019 that you try to seize is already gone and so is the next \u2018now\u2019 and all to follow. You can\u2019t capture it because \u2018now\u2019 is not of time but eternal. It is only because of the concept of cause-effect, and the reliance on the wealth of concepts stored in memory that you are yanked out of the \u2018now\u2019 into the illusory realm of time and space that are the basis of the conceptual world in which you believe to exist.
