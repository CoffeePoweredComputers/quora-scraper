            "answer_text": "Mind-Body Dualism seems, on the surface, similar to the concept that the physical world is an illusion of the senses, that the mind can conceive and perceive things that do not physically exist. However after more reading it becomes clear that Mind-Body Dualism is a rather more abstract idea. Where the concept of sensory data being illusory is, somewhat, supported by the manner in which the brain functions, Mind-Body Dualism states that the mind, or consciousness, is a non-physical entity, that the processes and functions by which we experience consciousness belong to a wholly non-physical entity, Plato described multiple \u201cSouls\u201d that process and experience different stimuli. But this concept simply doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny. We know how the brain performs sensory processes, we can watch it in action, we can track the physical processes that lead to thought and experience which, ultimately, proves Mind-Body Dualism false as if you can see a physical thought, then the mind cannot be a non-physical entity.
