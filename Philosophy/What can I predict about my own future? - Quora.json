            "answer_text": "Here is my serious and worrisome prediction. Somewhere during the next few months, Trump will hold a press conference. He will inform all American citizens about his decision to postpone the elections, because of the corona virus. He will explain that it is too dangerous for people to flock together into the small space of a polling station and that your children may die if you get infected at the polling station. Of course, he will not give you a specific date, when the elections will be held. \u201cWhen the danger of the corona virus has subsided\u201d he will say. But that can be a damned long wait! This will provoke a very serious constitutional crisis. Although this act is illegal and a blatant violation of the Constitution, nobody will have the guts and the authority to stop him. William Barr is a hypocrite and a bootlicker, who will support Trump all the way. The GOP, the Gutless Ostriches Party, will definitely not intervene, because they have a vested interest in expanding Trump\u2019s tenure. The FBI will not enter the oval office to force the elections to proceed, because the AG, William Barr, will prevent them from doing so. And the army does not have the authority to send tanks to surround the White House, because of the Posse Commitatus Act. This will give rise to the biggest constitutional crises in US history and the country will be teetering on the edge of a civil war. Even if governors and mayors will hold the elections regardless, this will result in total warfare between state and local authorities on the one hand ant the White House on the other hand. And of course there is the possibility that some governors may support Trump. Let\u2019s all hope and pray that I am wrong! Greetings, Robert. ",

            "answer_text": "If you could predict the future, what would it be? What prediction of the future would I make? I\u2019ve already made who\u2019s who writing a career out of books about prophecy and the future \u2014 so already have done it with a high degree of accuracy (such as predicting the 2016 Republican landslide in 2014) in \"Death Over Life: A Prophecy of America's Destruction\" {Amazon, March 2014} That was a test of the Revelation interpretation in \"Biblical Prophecy: Are we in the Revelation Era\" {AMAZON, March 2014} The destruction of NYC skyscrapers in the 200\u20132001 was in 1978\u2019s The Prophecy Notebook \u2014 where I looked at Nostradamus and others and pointed out the 1999 prophecy had to be wrong, because the calendar system was changed, so the conversion he used changed by 1 or 2 years (the month also changed when system changed). Now I\u2019m just matching known events and cycles to the predicted sequences \u2014 and showing the correlation remains intact because people reject the patterns of behavior and so repeat them. Future Prediction per economic cycle K-wave, Deep Recession or Depression starts 11 October 2027. Republican Right-wing is working very hard to ensure the accuracy of that prediction. ",
