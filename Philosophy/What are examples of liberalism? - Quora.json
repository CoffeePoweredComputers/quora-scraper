Off the top of my head: LibertarianismPolitical correctness CapitalismFeminismSocialismRationalismAnti-liberal: MonarchismAuthoritarianismTotalitarianismFundamentalismNeither liberal nor anti-liberal ConservatismProgressivismRegressivismThe current confusion over this in the US is the source of a lot of misunderstanding (willful and otherwise). The US has been an historically liberal society since its inception. The enlightenment values of liberty, freedom, equality, and individual rights are written into our founding documents. So to be conservative in the US actually means to be profoundly liberal in an historical context. To be conservative in Saudi Arabia is obviously something quite different.  The current chaos in the Republican Party is an excellent example of all of these ideologies at odds with each other.  There are conservative republicans who like things just as they are and prefer to keep them that way. These folks are mostly happy with those in power (themselves mostly) and generally comfortable with America's liberal traditions. Of course many of these folks have been keeping quiet or leaving the party lately.  Then there are the progressive libertarians who want to see changes to promote greater individual freedom and reduction of restrictive regulations. And then there are the regressive authoritarians who seem to variously want to return to the ways of patriarchy, religious dominionism, and even slavery.  ",

            "answer_text": "Liberalism means to be open minded and to be willing to forsake poorer traditional values for the sake of something better. I would say Martin Luther King Jr. was probably the best example. If you read the letters from Birmingham prison, you can see clearly that there is a necessity for change in society, and yet he vigorously demands the maintain of values and principles which are the fundamentals of our society. His call for change was mostly successful due to his simultaneous call for peace. His pacifism in the face of racism showed our country what true virtue truly is. This is liberalism. If you abandon all of our principles and moral values in society simply because you want change, you're just a progressive. But if you can maintain the honorable teachings of our society while also calling for change, that is what makes you a liberal. ",
