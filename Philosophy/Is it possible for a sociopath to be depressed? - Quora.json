            "answer_text": "YES. Sociopaths are made through depression, neglect, or a hostile environment. Many sociopaths and most secondary psychopaths have battled depression for years before actually dissociating their emotions and becoming selfless. They can still become mildly depressed while they become sociopaths, but not as much as they did before turning into one. Even mild forms of autism,aspergers, can manifest with psychopathic tendencies because their brains are actually capable of producing a neurological psychopath once they become mature adults. The depression actually triggers the neurological basis behind sociopathy and secondary psychopathy as a form of compensation. Once the brain is rewired to compensate, you become a sociopath/psychopath. This is why the beginnings of sociopathy and secondary psychopathy can start in the teens and fully manifests by your mid 20s to your early 30s, depending on when your problems spiraled out of control., some in childhood, some in teens, some in 20s. That is why many \u201csuccessful\u201d people have gone through a tough upbringing, many are literally sociopaths or secondary psychopaths with a mask, I can assure you. I had very early behavior and extremely manipulative behavior as a 4 year old! I feel as if I was smarter then than now. My behavioral issues were always notified to my parents from the teachers. Nothing was done. I was emotionally neglected by my parents, though they provided me with a decent life. I was alienated from most of my peers in school. Ive been to MANY different schools, over ten. I was a minority, which began to change my perception of the world at a young age. I wasnt that uncomfortable with it, then again I dont know how much I would have liked having many friends. I began to dissociate emotions. I wanted to be a good kid in middle school. It worked, but my problems came again in high school. Engaged in drinking,stealing, threats, fraud, and other criminal activites I dont want to talk about. Though I was only arrested once in 12th grade. My grades started dropping. My life started going downhill, and in first year of college hooked to every hard drug with needles. I was wreckless, hung out with the wrong people. Quit drugs now, but my personality has evolved to something, different. Given a casual diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder in rehab. I don\u2019t even know if I ever had empathy, I can only empathize with myself I believe. My emotions are starting to dampen. Im in my early 20s, and I know my brain will start shutting off fear,anxiety, and emotion, as its already in the works somehow. I believe it will help me rise from the dark hole I was in for a long time. ",

            "answer_text": "First, let's define what a sociopath is: A sociopath is a person who does not feel remorse or guilt, and who has no conscience. They can lie, cheat, manipulate and steal and simply do not care about the consequences. They can also manipulate other people for their benefit because they lack empathy. Sociopathy is a serious personality disorder. It is a term that has been replaced with an antisocial personality disorder. The number of sociopaths is higher than we think. This personality disorder is more common in men than in women. Approximately 3-5% of the general population in America are sociopaths. This number is much higher in the prison population. As the name of the condition suggests, they have little respect for social norms and tend to cause pain without facing remorse or guilt. In short, they are considered capable of killing without any problem - this, arguably turning them into the most dangerous people on the planet. Causes and risk factors: The causes of the disorder are unknown, but genetic factors and childhood abuse are thought to contribute to the development of this condition. People with an antisocial or alcoholic parent are at increased risk. Men are more affected than women. Pyromania and cruelty towards animals during childhood are related to the development of antisocial personality. Risk factors: Personality development is affected by genetic trends as well as by environmental factors such as childhood experiences. Most risk factors for the development of this disorder are associated with the abusive environment or where the child is neglected: - childhood abuse - deprivation and affective neglect in childhood - an antisocial, alcoholic parent - involvement in a group that exhibits antisocial behaviour - attention deficit disorder - reading disorder. Is it possible for a sociopath to be depressed? YES. People with antisocial disorder often suffer from associated conditions such as anxiety, depression and substance addiction. Doctors may prescribe antidepressant or antipsychotic medications to help improve these conditions. The link is simple: Specialists have found that traumatic events in childhood are a major cause of depression - here we can mention a parent's death, abuse, abandonment, violence or divorce. Childhood abuse is also thought to contribute to the development of sociopaths.  If you found this answer helpful, please leave an upvote. ",
