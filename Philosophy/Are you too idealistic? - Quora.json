            "answer_text": "No \u2014 in fact, I\u2019ve been roundly called too pragmatic. I do have my ideals \u2014 but I\u2019m not an idealist, and I\u2019ve never been seen by anyone as \u201cidealistic.\u201d I know lots of stuff about the ideal ways to doing things or ways of living \u2014 because my generation of people (the 50-somethings and older) mostly happen to know them too. Yet I\u2019m a out-and-out pragmatist. You know you have a diehard pragmatist in your midst when:\u2014 You ask a hypothetical question and almost upfront and early you get told (and told off in a diplomatic way) to restructure your question in a more realistic way, such as:\u2014How do you use three pigs to test for poison in one bucket out of 100 buckets of water/feed? \u2014 The idealist spins up into working out various mathematical and probabilistic solutions. The pragmatist tells you to stop using expensive ASSETS like livestock to test for poison and use a poison-testing kit, which is standard equipment on farms anyway. That\u2019s one helluva way of telling you off, isn\u2019t it?A query about language usage is met with a usage answer and followed up with a grammar explanation \u2014 instead of grammar first with idealists.Any pragmatist is driven mostly by inductive reasoning rather than deductive reasoning \u2014 the difference between Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe (inductive) vs. Sherlock Holmes (deductive).A pragmatist is unlikely to quibble about particular points and take things at face value (\u201cas-is\u201d) until something better comes along. Something is presumed to be the \u2018truth\u2019 until it isn\u2019t.I can hold my own in intellectual discussions, but I\u2019m not an intellectual and no one regards me as one \u2014 in case anyone is wondering about that too.

            "answer_text": "Are you too idealistic? Not on the outside. Most people wouldn\u2019t have a clue what goes on in my head and they\u2019d probably not understand most of it. lol :) I\u2019m not sure why \u201cidealistic\u201d has negativity attached to it. Having ideas and dreams about a better world doesn\u2019t mean a person is disregarding reality. The reason I\u2019m idealistic within my thoughts is because I\u2019ve accepted that reality is a harsh and violent existence. And I\u2019d truly prefer that the planet I lived on was a safer and healthier environment for everyone. It isn\u2019t. I love being idealistic. It is one of my favorite states of being. I\u2019ll gladly spend my entire life daydreaming about all the different ways this planet can be safer for humans. :p Maybe the question you should be asking is \u201cAre humans not idealistic enough?\u201d <3 \u2014Related questionsWhat happens when an INFP becomes a realist?As an INFP, why is it so difficult for us to face reality as it truly is?Why do you think they call INFP \u201cthe idealists\u201d?How can an INFP overcome their idealized view of the world and start to see the flaws in those around them?INFPs: What would your ideal world be like?INFPs, what is your opinion about wealth?What are the downsides to a person being a realist?
