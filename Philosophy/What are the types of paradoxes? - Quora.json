            "answer_text": "There are ten types of paradoxes. They are all the same, because together they are what define types by separating similarities into differences. Here is the first paradox: it is not a paradox, but it is made to be a paradox by the paradoxes that follow. This paradox is called \u2018Zero\u2019. It is a thing that shows that there are no things. Here is the second paradox. It is a paradox because it can only be known by the first paradox. This paradox is a thing that is known to be a thing because of the thing that is known to mean that there are no things. This paradox is called \u2018One\u2019, but as we can see it is actually the second one because the first one must come first but it doesn\u2019t really unless the second one is there already. Now, here comes the third paradox (called Two), which is similar to the second paradox but also completely different. It is actually caused by the second paradox being grouped together with itself, but in a way that means itself is actually different to itself. As Leibniz\u2019s law shows, any two things with completely identical properties are actually not two things at all but rather one, yet this third paradox consists of a thing that is itself also being a thing that is not itself and those things being combined to make something bigger. Fourth comes third, and so on, because (of course) what really matters is that these paradoxes show us how many identities there are in some group, and the number of them in their own group is always one more than there appears to be - because the first one that the second one depends upon is actually not there in any sense that is evident. In this way, all eleven of the paradoxes are actually successive multiples of the first paradox, which when multiplied by any of them (including itself) produces Zero. To cap it all off, the eleventh paradox reversed the order of the first paradox (which produces the potential for ordering in itself) and puts One before Zero when the definition of One is that it comes after Zero. There you go: ten successive paradoxes caused by each of their precedents that really amount to eleven, especially given that the first isn\u2019t.  ",

            "answer_text": "Three types of paradoxes? Well, leaving aside the scientific paradoxes (i.e. those raised by Eistein's relativity on the one hand, and by quantum mechanics on the other) I think these three can be taken into account: 1) Logical paradoxes. I would distinguish between weak logical paradoxes (which is to say paradoxes that are such for common sense, but that are not so problematic for formal logic and mathematical reasoning) and strong logical paradoxes (i.e. problematic conceptual situations that require a drastic solution to allow logical thinking to keep on functioning). Among the weak logical paradoxes I can mention the intuitive concept of mathematical integral that troubled Berkeley so much (the integral is the sum of the areas of rectangles whose base decreases at will, therefore of rectangles whose base is practically zero; yet the integral is not null), or the strange assertion according to which, if you can define the class of all classes, then that class is both the container and the content of itself. Similarly, the concept of \"concept\" is in turn a concept. As in a Klein bottle, the inside is also the outside and vice versa. A strong logical paradox is instead the antinomy of the liar, cited by Russell regarding the consequences of Frege's logical refoundation of maths through the class concept. If there are no limits to how to define a class, then you can think of the class of all classes that are NOT elements of themselves. BY DFINITION, if this class does not belong to itself, then it belongs to itself, but if it belongs to itself, then it cannot belong to itself! This tangled logical knot only melts by cutting it with the \"type theory\" or other similar solututions.   2) Mystical paradoxes. They can be found, for example, in the works of Plotinus and Meister Eckhart. Suppose that the Supreme is beyond logical and linguistic thinking. Let's also assume that we want to explain the Supreme to the others. If we succeed, then we are not doing it. And if the others say \"Understood!\", Then they don't really understand. A similar scheme characterizes many koans typical of Zen thought.  3) Existential paradoxes. Nietzsche, for example, invites us to become who we are. Come on, become what you are! Of course, this weird statement is not so strange if referred to Nietzsche's acknowledgment of nihilism with the consequential stress on the Will of Power and the creative dimension of human non-being. But the most interesting case is probably that of Sartre's existentialism based on a materialistic interpretation of Kierkegaard's AUT-AUT. Existence is nothing but choice. But every choice is responsibility. And responsibility is not fun... What if you decide not to choose? Then you DO choose anyway: you chose an inauthentic life, you chose not to choose.  ",
