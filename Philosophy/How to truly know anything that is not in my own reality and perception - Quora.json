            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s what people don\u2019t get. The truth is not determine by our perspective. It is determine by facts. Honestly, if the truth is really determine by our perspective, we\u2019d all be billionaires. We'd all be immortal and omnipotent. All we have to do is alter the truth with our perspective to make us those things. But as you can see, we can\u2019t do that. Why? Because the truth is base on the facts in this world that can\u2019t be alter with perspective. Once you understand this truth, you\u2019ll come to regard everything subjective to be exactly what it is\u2026 an opinion. Honestly, words like \u201csubjective truth\u201d and \u201cpersonal reality\u201d is nothing more than fancy ways to say opinion. And the only people who use those words are people who don\u2019t understand the difference between a fact and an opinion. The truth is not something that we created with our mind. The truth is something that is already in existence. Which is why we don\u2019t create the truth. We only discover the truth. Now, to answer your question, how can you know anything outside of your own mind? The answer to that is that you can\u2019t. The thing about people is that they are stupid. They aren\u2019t capable of knowing what they don\u2019t know. Which is why they often form opinion. Guess and speculation that assume a situation so they can make sense of the situation. But because they don\u2019t really know and is just guessing, they often make mistakes. They fail and they struggle which cause them to learn and grow. And that is how they learn the truth. Honestly, if we are capable of knowing what we don\u2019t know, opinion wouldn\u2019t exist. Why? Because we would already know the truth and wouldn\u2019t have to formulate any assumptions to make sense of things. Now, if you\u2019re asking if what you see is true or not, that is a different question. Cause you\u2019re not asking about what you don\u2019t know. You\u2019re asking about things that you do know. The answer to that question is quite simple really. All you have to do is rely on the facts. Why? Because the facts is what dictates the truth. Take for example, the flat earth theory. A few centuries ago, people used to think that the earth is flat. That\u2019s because they rely on their perspective and not the facts. And the fact is that they really don\u2019t know. Why? Because they haven\u2019t gone to the ends of earth to see if it is actually flat. But because they make an assumption, they ran the risk of being wrong. If you rely on the facts, you can never go wrong. Cause you can prove the things you say to be true and admit that you don\u2019t know when you really don\u2019t. But if you assume, all you\u2019re doing is pretending to know when you actually don\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "In the Yoga Sutras if Patanjali it is written that there are only five activities or \u201c modifications\u201d of the mind: Pramana (right knowledge), viparyaya (wrong knowledge), vikalpa (fancy / imagination), nidra (sleep), and smrtayah (memory). I have spent years considering these categories and have not been able to find a single thought that will not fit one of these. Pramana /right knowledge has two sub divisions: Direct perception and reliable report. Direct perception is recognized data coming through our senses. Direct perception is best if kept simple\u2026 the sun rose in the east; the temperature is 80 degrees; the bowl is on the table; the girl went up the stairs at 8:00. Reliable report is report of someone else\u2019s recognition of data perceived through their senses and reported as accurately as possible\u2026 sorta feeding you their memory \u2026without their analysis or emotional response. One of the greatest errors we tend to make is to accept as \u201creliable report \u201c knowledge tainted with someone else\u2019s opinions, biases and interpretations. We should all be careful whose reports we accept as reliable. ( I particularly avoid exaggerating, name calling bullies\u2026 you know to whom I refer!) I more and more believe that there is nothing to know that is not a part of our reality and perceivable either directly or indirectly. And I suspect at the deepest, most basic level it is all very simple. The complications, I find, are usually in the semantics trying to explain a simple but very subtle observation or concept. ",
