Just like you would an old friend that you had an argument with and you really want to convince them to be your friend again, that you do love and like them. Give them time to notice and see you really mean it! You must mean it! They will open your heart door it will flow back again. We have to do our part and Christ will jump in with both feet. Just talk freely to God and Christ about anything-just start. ",
