So, therefore, they will question even though I am making things easiest for these people to just recite in the best way of Mahamantra that I have so many years of my hard work found the Mahamantra,as given by Sri Krishna himself,\u2026.ahh. Yes,now, they're not after Bhakti but trying to declare my path as wrong by finding faults as this word should be here,that word shouldn't be here but in last place. \u2026..Arre,I have seen the Gaudiya Vaishnavite Vrindavan traditional dharam much beforehand all of you newcomers, So,why don't you trust your Guru ,who is just like a birth giver biological father\u2026. See,now,you try to become in shoes of your father and then criticize that his shoes are not fitting but unfit for your use,as they're bigger ,so bad\u2026.A hhh. So, if you had that thing or Bikata vikaar,very doubting sinning attitudes,Ahhh\u2026.then how can you expected to get maximum benefits from the ways that your Guru or Father or friends or guidelines your guide has shown you\u2026. Hare Krishna. Do you doubt your biological mother's actions,and biological father says many things,which you may not like,yet you followed that,in the course of your mind body growing up process\u2026. similarly,w hen any good Guru,shows you a path or the ways that he has travelled,and found out to be perfected and easiest ,then why You should Question it,just follow it,meaning if you don't want this Gaudiya Bhakti Dharma marga,then simply why are you wasting your precious time and energies in finding out which alphabet, syllable,sound,words come first or last? \u201cMudha mati nahi naam sankirtan, nahi hoibe lekhon udhdhara.\u201dPurports that, in a constantly doubting and misdirected mindset,we cannot attain the Bhakti Rasa shakti so experienced by Lord Gouranga, Nitai-Nimai,Sri Krishna Chaitanya Prabhu Nityananda. Hare Krishna prabhuji. ",

Shri Rama avatar is prior to that of Shri Krishna in the chronological order. If you argue that both are one and the same avatars of Vishnu, then you can chant any way you like. There is no harm in that. In the above mantra, Shri Krishna was introduced in the first line and Shri Rama was pushed to the second line, by Iskcon, since they give preference to Shri Krishna over all the other gods and consider him to be the Supreme godhead. As per tradition and chronology, Shri Rama occupies the first line and Shri Krishna comes next. The mantra is effective whichever you chant it. ",

Many suggest that like all mantras mahamantra also had certain rules and regulations for chanting such as cleanliness of place , purity of pronounciation etc. And Chaitanya dev wanted to introduce the musical chanting or Kirtan form so that people could invest time in chanting Harinaam instead of just keeping busy in exterior cleanliness etc..so he just reversed the mantra in order to shift the focus of people from \u201cchanting with fear\u201d to \u201cchanting with love and ecstasy\u201d and thankfully he succeeded in doing it beyond doubt.
