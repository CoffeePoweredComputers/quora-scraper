            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll have a try at this. The conceptual difficulty of the relations between logic and set theory comes from the following fact : we use logical concepts when we axiomatize the concept of set because we choose a logical language in which we will express the axioms, for instance the language of first-order logic with the membership symbol. (We should by the way note that there is not a unique set theory : there is second-order set theory, set theory with or without such and such axiom, constructive set theory, etc.) But we also use set-theoretic concepts when we define the basic tools of logic : for example, when we study propositional calculus, we give ourselves a denumerable set of propositional variables, and when we study first-order logic, we study properties of theories defined by a finite or denumerable number of axioms. There is no way around it : there is no \u201cabsolutely\u201d fundamental theory in mathematics, in the sense of a theory such that the validity of all mathematics depends on it, and that it depends only on itself. The word \u201cfoundation\u201d carries with itself a very misleading metaphor which influences us (whether we are conscious or not) : the metaphor of mathematics as a sort of tower, or cathedral, or monument whose foundations were set theory and/or logic. In fact any mathematical theory can in principle be applied to prove theorems in any other domain of mathematics. It is surprising at first to see, for example, that there is a proof of the compactness of propositional calculus (\u201cIf a set of formulas is inconsistent, it is possible to extract from it a finite set of formulae that is inconsistent.\u201d) that uses topological reasoning and Tychonoff\u2019s theorem (which is equivalent to the axiom of choice). The compactness of propositional calculus can even be viewed as a consequence of the Stone duality, which is the assertion that there exists a certain (categorical) relation between certain types of Boolean algebras, and certain types of topological spaces. Even if the proof of compactness (which is incidentally really a topological notion) can be proved by more elementary means, the proofs that I have mentioned are admitted by standard mathematicians, in the sense of any mathematician who isn\u2019t a finitist or an intuitionist/constructivist. Now does it mean that topology and category theory are \u201cmore foundational\u201d than logic, since we use them to prove theorems about logic ? I suppose everyone will agree that the answer is no. The idea that any mathematical theory can in principle be used to demonstrate theorems in any other area of mathematics is surprising indeed, because it seems to imply that there is a circularity in mathematics ; but a circle in reasoning is exactly what mathematicians try at all cost to avoid ! Nevertheless, the practice of mathematics shows us that it\u2019s true. We can even make an extreme thought experiment and imagine that we could prove some theorem of logic or set theory with complex analysis. It\u2019s unlikely, but we can imagine it for the sake of the argument. Then if this proof was acknowledged as correct by reliable mathematicians, we would have to admit it. I have seen several times discussions among maths teachers about something similar, although it does not involve logic or set theory : the proof of the Pythagorean theorem. If we demonstrate the theorem with the tools that the Greeks had (we call that synthetic geometry), the proof is not particularly easy. But the theorem is trivial in a finite-dimensional real vector space, because it is a direct consequence of the definition of a scalar product. Now we know that the euclidean plane is an affine space of dimension 2, that can be canonically identified (modulo the choice of an origin point) with a (\u201cthe\u201d) 2 dimensional vector space with an inner product over the real numbers. Once we have said that, the theorem is obtained in a trivial way. But is this proof a \u201creal\u201d proof ? Isn\u2019t the proof of synthetic geometry more \u201cnatural\u201d ? More \u201cfundamental\u201d ? Some people in the discussion thought that it was not a real proof, because the first one was the most \u201cnatural\u201d one. But then what about the other proofs ? There are a lot of proofs of the Pythagorean theorem, Leonardo da Vinci and Einstein came up with new ones, and there is even one by a President of the United States, James Garfield. Which one is the \u201cnatural\u201d, \u201cfundamental\u201d one ? Arguably, no one proof is \u201cmore natural\u201d than the others. Even the trivial one relies upon a fact (that the euclidean plane is an affine space) that seems now to be evident, but that was not available to people for quite a long time. So the proof is not as trivial as it seems, and I think it\u2019s a legitimate one. So it is possible to use the theory of vector spaces (a.k.a. linear algebra) to prove theorems about euclidean geometry, which seems much more \u201cfundamental\u201d ? It is certainly surprising, but I don\u2019t see any valid reason to reject this proof. The bottom of this is : the quest for an absolute foundation of mathematics is an avatar of the quest for the absolute foundation of knowledge, which started with Descartes, and failed, continued with Kant, and failed, reappeared with Frege and Brouwer (both kantians in many ways), and failed (in the philosophical sense, even though their endeavours left a lot of good mathematics behind it, and in fact gave birth to mathematical logic). Therefore neither logic nor set theory is foundational in the absolute sense. From a structuralist point of view, mathematical logic is the study of mathematical structures that arise from the mathematical study of language, such as Boolean algebras, and their relations to other mathematical structures. But then mathematics has no foundations ? It is arbitrary ? No. To say that the quest for absolute foundations will never be fulfilled, is not the same as asserting the relativity of knowledge, and the indistinction between science and pseudoscience, for example. Mathematics is arbitrary in the sense that mathematicians have the choice to define or not certain structures and to study them or not. The application of these structures to phenomena of experience is applied mathematics (of which physics is a part), and it has been successful for thousands of years in certain areas (even though we sometimes discover that such and such physical phenomenon would be better modelled by this structure rather than that one, as in the case of physical space with euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds with a curvature). Applied mathematics has been successful in the sense that it has helped humans make good predictions about physical phenomena for thousands of years, even if none of the theories that physicists can come up with will ever be able to be called an absolutely true description of the physical universe. It has helped humans get around in the world that they are in, invent techniques and tools which have profoundly modified and improved their initial way of living. Mathematical structures are tools, fictional entities that we apply on reality to make predictions, and therefore a scientific theory, in particular a physical theory, can never be said to be true. It only allows good predictions, or not. There is still a question that stays after all this : if mathematics is not a hierarchical construction with foundations and upper levels, but the process of humans defining and studying structures for their application, nevertheless they use the mathematical language to define these structures axiomatically, and they use logic to study the properties of these structures. Isn\u2019t there a circularity even in this explanation ? A short answer : there are two different things : logic as a tool that we use to deduce consequences of a set of axioms (sometimes, or often, using analogies and imagination to guide us in the pursuit of the interesting ones), and mathematical logic as a mathematical study (therefore allowing itself to use and apply all known mathematical structures and the relations between them) of the structures that arise when we study logic in the first sense. And of course we use logic in the first sense when doing mathematical logic. So what ? A tool can sometimes apply to itself. As Wittgenstein wrote : \u201cWhen we learn spelling, we learn the spelling of the word \u2018spelling\u2019, but we do not call that \u2018spelling of the second order\u2019.\u201d It\u2019s a similar situation here, which is why talking about \u201cmetamathematics\u201d as if it were distinct from mathematics is also misleading : \u201cmetamathematics\u201d which is most of the time equated with mathematical logic and \u201cfoundations of mathematics\u201d, is not a \u201cmathematics of the second order\u201d that founds it, it is a part of mathematics. And many mathematical achievements could be called metamathematical, which are not considered usually part of logic. Any time that a link is discovered between different mathematical structures, like between the Euclidean plane and R^2 by Descartes, or between the poset of subvarieties of an algebraic variety and the poset of the ideals of a ring, this could in fact be called a metamathematical fact. So all things that are called metamathematical are mathematical, and many things that are not called \u201cmetamathematical\u201d, are\u2026 so that metamathematics pervades the whole of mathematics\u2026 That probably explains why the term itself died the death. So logic in the first sense can be thought of as \u201cfundamental\u201d, insofar as it is used permanently by mathematicians to deduce theorems. Mathematical logic isn\u2019t fundamental, insofar as it is just another area of the study of structures like any other one. Set theory is arguably a part of mathematical logic, and it studies models of ZF, or ZFC. In that sense set theory is not \u201cfundamental\u201d. All in all, the term \u201cfundamental\u201d is very misleading and should be ditched. ",

            "answer_text": "Both are equally foundational, and they\u2019re intertwined. In logic we are concerned with analyzing the justification of a statement by studying it\u2019s structure, which is composed of premises and a conclusion. There are rules to follow that make an argument valid and therefore logical. One such important rule is that there may be several premises, but only one conclusion, and there must be a relation between the premises and the conclusion. Since set theory is the study of relations, it is very convenient to use set theory and logic together. Logic gives rules about how to arrive to the answer while set theory provides the base language which comes in handy later on, since sets can get very abstract (and even more abstract/weirder is category theory). Logic gives us the concepts of contrapositive, conditional, biconditional, connective, and quantifiers. Suppose you have the conditional statement [math]P \\Rightarrow Q[/math]. This statement gives us the rule that if [math]P[/math] is true, then [math]Q [/math] must be true. It is invalid to have a false conclusion if you have a true premise. However, if [math]P[/math] is false, then [math]Q[/math] can be either true or false. Now, using sets and relations, consider this: [math]A \\setminus B \\subseteq C \\cap D[/math] and [math]x \\in A[/math]. Prove that if [math]x \\notin D [/math] then [math]x \\in B[/math]. Let\u2019s use the rule of the conditional statement to show the proof: if [math]x \\notin D[/math] then [math] x \\in B[/math] is a conditional statement in the form of [math]P \\Rightarrow Q [/math]. So, because it\u2019s a conditional statement, we will assume that [math]P[/math] is true and then we\u2019ll prove that [math]Q[/math] must be true. In the above problem you are given premises and the conclusion is that if [math] x \\notin D[/math] then [math]x \\in B[/math] but since we are assuming that [math]x \\notin D[/math] is true, we can add that to our list of hypotheses. So here it goes: Suppose [math] x \\in A. [/math]Suppose also that [math]x \\notin D[/math]. Then, since [math]A \\setminus B[/math] is a subset of [math]D[/math] and [math]C[/math], [math]x \\notin A[/math], because [math]x[/math] cannot be in [math] A[/math] if it is not an element of [math]D[/math]. Thus, [math]x \\in B[/math] if [math]x \\notin D[/math]. QED. You can also prove this using the contrapositive logic law, in which the rule is: [math]\\lnot Q \\Rightarrow \\lnot P[/math]. In this case, suppose that [math]Q[/math] is false, add [math]\\lnot Q[/math] to your premises, and prove [math]\\lnot P.[/math] Proof of contrapositive: Suppose [math]x \\in A[/math] and [math]x \\notin B[/math]. This implies that [math] x \\in (C \\cap D)[/math] since [math]A \\subset (C \\cap D).[/math] Thus it follows that [math]x \\in D[/math]. QED. Without the conditional rule and the contrapositive rule we would not have a strategy of how to prove this problem.  Image source: Set Theory and Foundations of Mathematics ",
