            "answer_text": "First of all there are two vacuums: physical vacuum and metaphysical vacuum (idea of a vacuum) Hume's method is to find out the nature of everything from its metaphysical roots, because his system is metaphysical mentality creating physical reality. This is opposite of all other systems of Descartes, Spinoza, and Aristotle who give importance on the external universe first. To discover the nature of physical space (perception), he goes to the idea of metaphysical space by thinking about metaphysical space that is absolutely empty. He concludes that the true nature of both space and time is that they are empty or does not exist. In other words, space only exists if you put something in it. Time only exists if you put an event in it. Time and space depend on your will. You can see this in how time flies fast when you\u2019re having fun (your will is at maximum), and slow when you\u2019re bored (your will is zero). For example: Can you think of the idea of the time of December 7, 1941, 7:48:05am? Your would answer no because that time itself only gets existence if it contains an event which you knew by memory.You would only answer yes if you knew that that time was the start of the Pearl Harbor attack and you had a clear perception of that eventIf you answered yes but your mind just came up with the numbers 12/7/41 7:48:05, then that's wrong because those are just numbers that represent the time, and not the idea of the time itself.Likewise, can you think of the time of March 15, 2050 8:47:02am? The answer would be no because you have no impression of it.You could imagine an event, for time to exist metaphysically, but not in reality.Likewise, space is also empty: Can you think of the space called W51? No, because you don't know that it's an area 17k light years away from Earth A giant molecular cloud floating in spacePeople think that below is a vacuum. But to Hume, that\u2019s just darkness, which is a different idea and impression from a vacuum. The real vacuum is the white part on the right of the darkness \u2014 which is the same as existence of Quora, implying the real vacuum is nothing.  Hume\u2019s idea of the metaphysical vacuum is really metaphysical absolute nothingness which does not exist in Western Philosophy, but exists in Eastern Philosophy as Sunya. \u015a\u016bnyat\u0101 - Wikipedia So metaphysically, Hume is ultimately negating Sunyata which is the tradition of Zen (Mahayana), Vipassana (Theraveda), and Vedanta-Descartes (Illusion). He instead favors the real and experience-based Yoga (union of objects), Bhakta (feeling-based), and Tantra (dynamism). Rather, he is saying that the latter are more natural and easier.  So what is the utility or practical use of Hume\u2019s nothingness of spacetime? Hume strongly denounced the infinite divisibility of space and points. Instead, he said space and points are ultimately finite. The finite points are now known as electrons. The electrons are essential in quantum entanglement which negate space by making the entangled electrons respond instantly, because the electrons know that space is nothing and so they act as if they were never separated by space.Einstein is wrong because it's not spooky action at a distance. Since distance is empty, then it's really just action. Spooky is the quality of the scared vulgar physicist who doesn't know the nature of distance.Since time and space depend on the will, then people can change their location in spacetime (teleport) by quantum-entangling themselves. This is how UFOs cross galaxies instantly. Some physicists stick to the infinite divisibility of points. These now are the physicists who keep on smashing atoms for no practical purpose, similar to a mathematician who keeps on dividing a number infinitely. They think that by smashing atoms they can eventually discover something profound, when in reality they are just smashing atoms.

            "answer_text": "Question: How does David Hume deny the idea of a vaccum? Quite simple for Hume, actually. First, let us get some context: David Hume lived in a time period that was immensely ignorant of science. It wasn\u2019t until the concept of a vacuum of space was conceived until long after his death. As such, Hume wouldn\u2019t even begin to know of the concept of a vacuum in space. But let us assume, for the sake of argument, that he could know of the concept of a vacuum. He would then simply ask Can we experience this vacuum? By that, he would mean as to whether or not the vacuum is observable, measurable, or otherwise capable to be felt by our senses. If it\u2019s not, then we have no reason to believe it exists as a thing. Rather, Hume would probably suggest that the vacuum of space was a lack of something, in this case elemental compounds, and instead was made up of dark matter. As such, we would probably reject the vacuum of space as a thing, and simply see it as a lack of something. But this last bit is just speculation, as I cannot (sadly) read the mind of Hume himself.

            "answer_text": "We must establish first what kind of vacuum (in what ontological layer?) was he talking about. There are meta-theological, hyper-metaphysical, metaphysical and representative (perceptive-sensual/physical) vacuum. Hume was talking about the possibility of representative (perceptive-sensual/physical) one, because he did not know about or did not recognise the other layers of being (he was an empiricist). His theory was that space is a mosaic of coloured extensionless indivisibles, so there can not be absolutely empty space (devoid of any sensible entity). In other words, the units of space are some sort of \u201cluminescent monads\u201d, so there can be no empty space (it is filled with \u201clight\u201d quanta -EMW, i. e. a sensible substance). ",
