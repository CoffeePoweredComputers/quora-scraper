            "answer_text": "You betcha! That won\u2019t stop some people from saying they know intelligence, talent and creativity, and what we just saw is anything but. Notice, though, that people who make judgments like this are looking for validation for their judgments. If enough people agree, then they can claim their opinion is objective. That\u2019s not true. There\u2019s no such thing as objectivity. But that doesn\u2019t stop people from making the claim of objectivity. It\u2019s a way people gain power. If they can convince others they represent an objective point of view, they will get others to follow their lead and do as they suggest, and that gives them power. I think it makes most sense to treat everyone\u2019s opinion as subjective and to reject the notion that objectivity is possible. It\u2019s an illusion and a power grab and I resist every notion that objectivity is possible. Having said that, I do think there is power in replicating experience by repeatedly setting up the same initial conditions, then engaging in the same action, in order to see if you get the same results. However, even if the same thing happens a billion times, I think it is important to remain aware that does not mean the same thing will always happen. Although, as a practical matter, I do assume that the same thing will happen and predict that it will happen and act as if it is going to happen. It makes sense to me to make such assumptions. But that\u2019s as close to objectivity as I think it is possible to get. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, it is mostly subjective. Perhaps certain levels of intelligence are codified, but even that is based on criteria of the times and subject to changing parameters. Talent and creativity though? 100% subjective. The other aspect to subjectivity is a difference between internal and external judgment. Does one claim to be able to assess one\u2019s own talent or creativity? And how emotionally involved in assessing someone else\u2019s work is one to be if one attempts to place a ruling on that other person\u2019s abilities? Isn\u2019t it all relative to how good you think you are at that same thing? If I understand nothing about Formula 1 racing, I might think it easy, while in fact the minute differences between the world\u2019s best can be debated by professionals and enthusiasts for hours and hours. How often have you heard someone comment about a Rothko or a Pollack - or perhaps even better, one of Bruce Naumann\u2019s performative video works: \u201cI could do that.\u201d It\u2019s easy to say that after you\u2019ve seen a simple idea, well executed. The fact is this: you didn\u2019t do it, they did. The truth is that some simple ideas come from years of training and more years of exploring complex ideas until a clarity pares away the \u201cnoise\u201d from the purity. If you and I talk about the color of something you saw and you say it was purple, and you try to get me to understand the way is was purple and how special that was, how can you be sure I am picturing the color you decribe?
