            "answer_text": "No, however it might be reasonable to say Romans are Greek. If you want to follow myth, Romans are the remnants of Troy (or infants raised by a wolf, take your pick). Romans aped Greek culture, architecture, and relgion. One has only to look at Roman buildings to see the resemblance. Knowing that the major Roman gods are analogous to the major Greek gods is also an indication: Zeus=Jupiter, Aphrodite=Venus, Mercury=Hermes, Artemis=Diana, Hephestus=Vulcan, Hera=Juno, Athena=Minerva, Chronos=Saturn, Ares=Mars and so on. Oddly Apollo and Gia remain \u201cApollo and Gaea\u201d in Roman myth as he was in Greek myth. Romans (and most western civilization) took Greek law,philosophy, and scientific understanding. They excelled even beyond the Greeks in Architecture and Engineering but the mathematics came from Greece (who gained much of it from the Kets but that's another story). ",

The first recorded Olympic Games took place before Rome was even founded. Greece was conquered by the Roman Empire. Roman culture, art, religion and architecture was influenced and adopted from Hellenism All educated Romans were required to speak Greek. Greeks worshiped the 12 Gods. When Christianity spread to Greece and the Eastern Roman Empire, around 350AD, it became punishable by death to practice the ancient religion. Hence to avoided persecution Greeks stopped calling themselves \u201cHellenes\u201d as it had pagan connotations and began using the term Romanoi (citizens of the (Byzantine/Roman Empire). The Greek Orthodox Church continued to reject the word Hellene and fear the legacy of ancient Greece until the 1700 \ufffdv ",

For nearly 1700 years the Greeks were Roman in some way. They were ruled by the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire, and the Eastern Roman Empire. Up until 1700 some Greeks still referred to themselves as Roman. It was until the 1700s that Greece reclaimed the title of \u2018Greek.\u2019 Rome idolized Greece. They emulated them, built like them, fought like them. When Rome was sacked, it was the Greeks that held the Roman Empire together in the East. It was the Roman Greeks who fought to take it back for years afterward. For 1700 years the Greeks were as Roman as Rome themselves. It took them that long to even be \u2018Greek' again. At one point the Greeks were as Roman as anyone, but those days are long gone. ",

Everyone else, whether located in Greece, Anatolia, Balkans, Gaul, Spain, Africa, or a few kilometres south of Rome was not a Roman in the same original sense. Even almost all of Italy did not contain any Romans, especially the southern half was full of Greeks at the time and until 1071AD. Now, if we are talking Roman citizenship, then yes, Greeks and all other ethnic groups that fell within the Roman empire's borders WERE Romans. This extends to 1453AD when the Roman empire finally collapsed completely. Greeks identify even to this day as Romans, although the actual term they use is \u201c\u03a1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03af\u201d (\u201cRhomioi\u201d).
