            "answer_text": "it depends really - if you are asking a stranger the directions to the train station or asking someone whether they had breakfast last night or anything else that is purely practical which requires step by step instructions then questions are necessary. Questions to existential problems like why am I here or why am I who I am are generally pointless as the answers themselves do not satisfy ones inherent dissatisfaction with what they perceive to be their meagre existence. Solutions to existential problems aren't found in questions or step by step instructions or explanations of quantum fields or how your brain works. The reason why questions seem pointless from this perspective is because the answers themselves offer nothing substantial in fixing the underlying problem of ones experience or existence. ",

This is a technique of getting to the root cause of a problem by asking, \"Why?\" at a deeper and deeper level, until you find the base. Questions are science. Always asking, \"why?\"  is how to discover the universe.And when you think you have the answer, ask it again. ",
