            "answer_text": "He waits about 15 years and hopes the child is a good physics student, then. More serious: Quantum physics is a modern branch of physics. It dives deep into details, into physics of subatomic particles for example, and the name quantum in it indicates, what classical physics didn't explain until experiments arrived at such detail level. Anything comes in quanta and isn't continuous. So when Ernie keeps on cutting the licorice stick of Bert into halves, this will have an end somewhere, when the halves become as tiny as licorice atoms :) The main surprise is, that the quanta in the sense of elementary particles can do things you wouldn't expect for macroscopic amounts of matter, eg tunnel where they would bounce in the classical understanding. Especially this - the tunnel effect - has a major consequence in electronics and made computers possible, for example. So quantum physics isn't just a hard to understand theory, it has its applications in technology. Also in solar panels and other modern technology. ",

Good. Now, I am replacing this ball with a coin. I have a coin now. I will not throw this coin but you know, there is a different world where there is something that travels multiple paths. Yes, paths are different but it follows all. How? Now, I know you are a good girl because you do good deeds. Before any of those deeds, I can assume you both good and bad. Yes, this is possible. You are actually both, before you do any random deed that defines what you actually are! In the same way, this coin in my hands can be considered as such thing in the different world and then, this coin will travel both paths until we look for it. That's how things happen in that world. Maybe, one day we will travel that world for sure. ",

Your parents, friends, your school, your colorbook and your favourite ball or doll is made of the same dots. Even the stars and planets are made of same dots. These dots cannot be seen by your eyes or mine, but they are real. And they are funny dots. For example, I even if I cannot see you, I know if you're making a ruckus in the next room. That is how we find the dots, by their ruckus in the next room. These dots love each other, just like we love you. It takes a lot of work to separate to dots, because they are the best friends. And when two dots come together to become friends, everyone enjoys their friendship because their friendship is noticed by everyone (attempting to explain energy release during fusion and atomic bonding) [Moving into confusing territory now. Not sure if this is kids safe] Also funny thing is that, sometimes these dots look like waves in water. You love throwing stones in water, and it creates waves, similarly these dots can be waves sometimes. PS. I have no idea how to go about now to topics like the uncertainty principle, tunneling etc. This was a challenge, not sure if my answer works. ",

I might tell him or her that everything, even the most \u201csolid\u201d object is really made of tiny pieces that we call atoms. Then, when the child is maybe 8 or 10, I might tell him/her that these atoms are made of protons, neutrons and electrons and show him a picture of the Rutherford model. It\u2019s only when the child is around high school age that I would explain the field concept and and tell her/him that these \u201cparticles\u201d are not really particles but are units of field called quanta, as in Quantum Field Theory. In fact I would do that even in a junior high school science class. And in high school I would show the child how QFT resolves the paradoxes of Quantum Mechanics, as explained in my book \u201cFields of Color\u201dwhich was written for the lay reader.

Any more detailed answer really depends on what it is about quantum theory that the 5 year old is supposed to understand; lots of issues arising from quantum theory aren\u2019t understood by anyone anywhere.

We need not understand engines, transmission or suspension to know a car as a thing that carries stuff and moves on surfaces at various speed, and that it consumes some sort of energy to do it. Then we can get him to see the world in terms of models, as it is appropriate for the reason of the seeing. Physics is just a model of reality. ",
