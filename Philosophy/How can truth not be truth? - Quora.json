            "answer_text": "The truth is such, that it completely and in all possible manners, and all possible ways, corresponds completely with what in fact is - and how/why that is - is. All that is manipulated, altered, given a different angle to suite some kind of agenda/purpose (personal or for a group/ suiting beliefs or other thoughts systems) that a human might have or want to have when presenting the facts in a slightly (or completely) different way from what was, is and will be separated from the Truth of the matter and is therefor a lie. The intentional lie is always a manipulation of the reality with the intent to suit someone, group or some cause/gain, or even the fact that a person might be held responsible for something they have in fact done/said or even thought or failed to do when having the chance to do it - and therefor should have done. Then there is the lie that is based on a misconception of reality - and this is very very very common in todays world. The misconception that all that exists and is real is only what a human - with the poor eyesight that we have being a species among others that have a far better eyesight than we do have - can see (this is the only way we have to confirm the fact of something that occurs), hear or taste, touch, smell (in other words our senses). This very very childish way of viewing and understanding reality is today common sense - and by those that belive in that sort of \u201creality\u201d seen as \u201cvery advanced and secure knowledge\u201d, that often even is mistaken for the foundations of science. This latter very childish way of thinking about reality and what does exist is also extended into politics and some of the \u201csoft sciences\u201d - where people actually believe that (for instance) gender is a social construction and that sex therefor is what a person \u201cfeels\u201d to be - and not a biological fact. And they believe in these lies firmly even\u2026 without even having the slightest knowledge of the fact that a cow does not \u201cfeel\u201d like a bull - but simply is what it is without lots of medication for \u201cfeeling badly about its gender\u201d. When these sort of lies are made into \u201ccommon \u201cknowledge\u201d\u201d and given at universities - these will gain some sort of status of \u201ctruth\u201d or even \u201creality\u201d as a majority of humans will not understand that the foundations of these thoughts are not actually based on reality - but on a political agenda in regard to reality (how to alter reality) - and therefor a coherence with other thoughts in regard without any kind of basis in what is a fact. Therefor these lies are not - in any way - to be criticizes or questioned without very deer consequences for the person that does that (loosing jobs, becoming a persona non grata in society etc). Because if and when they are examined scientifically and criticized they will become revealed as not being in correspondence with the facts of reality. And those that defend such \u201ctheories\u201d do know all this - as these lies are part of a political agenda - and will therefor stay as long as people are afraid to question them on the basis of truth because of the personal repercussions that will be the effect of such a critique. Mankind has never ever - in such a large extent - been subjected to anything like this on such a large scale. We have had political lies that have drowned entire countries like: the former Sovjet and all its satellite states, Germany during the WWII, China, North Corea, Italy etc \u2014- but never ever have we seen this being propagated thru out what was considered the \u201cfree world\u201d ever before. As many of the lies, in regard to human nature and the content of reality and what is feasible within it, are given thru universities, media and schools the \u201cbuilding up\u201d of the lies have become a huge \u201csandcastle\u201d of one lie leading to another. And while this \u201cconstruction\u201d is allowed to go on without critique or even deconstruction of these lies - they will become \u201cknowledge\u201d that is completely and utterly untrue but accepted by a majority and within this creating some sort of consensus in regard to what a human is and what reality is - and what the truth in regard is. This is one of the most severe blows to mankind ever\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Easily. Truth is a word. Like any symbol in any logic that word can itself have a truth value, and that value may be false. This paradigm of perspective whereby one object has multiple representations such that none of those representations characterise the object completely is one of the pillars of postmodernism. The now-infamous quote is itself completely dependent upon punctuation: \u201c \u2018truth\u2019 isn\u2019t truth\u201d means something quite different to \u201ctruth isn\u2019t truth\u201d.  It depends on your orientation. You may need screen lock to stop your device pandering to your perspective. Context is everything - that\u2019s what quotation marks are all about - they denote attribution. \u2018Truth\u2019 isn\u2019t truth because attribution of the quality \u2018truth\u2019 is not identical to the quantifying value \u2018truth\u2019 as it is used in a logical truth-table.  Therefore, we can imagine a scenario whereby p or q is named \u2018truth\u2019. An example might be \u2018I told the truth\u2019. However, immediately, we see that this is not necessarily valid because of the presence of self-referentiality - truth is being told by the teller. How do we know the teller is telling the truth when the truth is what the teller tells? This is how truth can not be truth. Because \u2018truth\u2019 may be indistinguishable from the teller, depending on the tell that the audience takes to be truthful. Rhetoric is magic. Only some know the tricks of the trade. The point is always \u2018how you\u2019re looking determines what you see\u2019. People can be made to do that\u2026using only mere punctuation sometimes. Spelling it out is no fun. The fact is that information has always been a battlefield. My advice is to pay attention to silence. The real action is usually taking place where the words are not. Ignore the big loud guy - he\u2019s the misdirection. Trust me.  ",

IF a person sees an event from a different place it is possible that they might draw an incorrect conclusion. They believe their conclusion to be the truth and will tell it. This isn\u2019t a lie it is simply a mistake. They might also believe a story told to them by someone because they trust that person, if that story is wrong but they repeat it they will think they are telling the truth. It isn\u2019t the truth they were deceived. A LOT of that about at the moment. ",
