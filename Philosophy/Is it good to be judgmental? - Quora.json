            "answer_text": "I think that there are three reasons why humans are judgmental. One of them is a good and healthy reason, and the other two are self-destructive. 1) Utilitarian: If I need to get a task done, I will judge whether the person I\u2019m interacting with is up to it or not based on the conversation, background etc. This is essential to get any collaborative task done efficiently. Here, I'm judging whether the other person is useful to me or not (worth my time?). This types of judgmental thinking allows the world to function relatively smoothly. 2) Insecurity: Examples of this would be those who say \"Academics have no real world experience\", or \"PhDs have no common sense\", \u201cHe got lucky\u201d, \u201cHe\u2019s a moron but got ahead because he\u2019s an ass-kisser\u201d, \u201cThat model has better genes than me, so he doesn\u2019t need to exercise as much\u201d etc. Note how in every one of the examples, the thinker of these ideas is trying to convince himself that\u2019s he\u2019s as good as (maybe even better than?) everyone else, but success always eludes him due to circumstances outside his control. This hypothetical person refuses to take responsibility for themselves. The excuses he makes may or may not be true, but the fact is that his mind cannot catch the false excuses. The critical thinking filter simply isn\u2019t there. Emotions have taken over. In this case, judgment is used a defense mechanism for one's own ego. This enables self-deception (to protect the ego) and makes the person bitter, cynical and hateful. 3) Definition of self-worth: This perhaps ties in to point (2), but I think it warrants its own bullet point. Some people live their lives obsessing over the lives of others. They derive their very reason for existence from comparing themselves to others. They are consumed by envy, and engage in things like one-upmanship, obsession over material things etc. They chase prestige rather than wisdom. Judging others is used as a way for these people to feel they are making progress in their lives (eg. Jane was ahead of me last year, but now I\u2019ve gone past her). They lack the ability to compare themselves to their own potential. They need external validation, and being judgemental of others enables this. I personally believe one should only aim to maximize the realization of one\u2019s own potential. Introspection can help one understand their own strengths and weaknesses, and work on leveraging the former. But if one only compares one\u2019s self to others, then there is no motivation to introspect and know what it is that YOU (not society, not family etc) want. ",

            "answer_text": "I think being judgmental is in our nature, be it good or bad. However, it is bad to hold on to those judgments. Humans tend to form an impression of something/someone on first observation and base their consequent opinions or judgments on all the additional information they get. However, more often than not, humans give importance to only that part of the new info that supports their pre-existing opinions. This is also called a Confirmation Bias. Not only does it impair our ability to correctly judge something/somebody but it also leads to us losing out on something/someone special. Having opinions and forming judgments is imperative in our fast-paced lives today. However, holding onto something and blocking the full view to make life easier or prove yourselves \u201ctechnically correct\u201d retrospectively doesn\u2019t help. My teacher used to say, \u201cIf I hold onto something you did years ago and judge you for it today, disregarding your growth in all this time, then it shows poorly on me and can only lead to my own loss\u201d ",
