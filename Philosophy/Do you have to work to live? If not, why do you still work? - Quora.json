            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t really think I would have to. I do still have to work to go on vacations, but after a few more years my expected income will be high enough that I don\u2019t. I have a lot of passive income streams, but I got into my profession to help people. My brother growing up was a special needs child and he was cycled through medication after medication slowly gaining more and more symptoms (side effects). His pills were originally for his seizures, but by the time he was in high school he had been told he had ADHD, restless legs, schizophrenia, dyslexia, and depression. When I was in college I took a look at his medications and they were all side effects of the pills he was taking. I looked for alternative treatments and through chiropractic care he dropped about half his meds in a month. By the end of the year he was only on meds for schizo. That\u2019s when the chiropractor talked about nutrition changes like eating more fats and cutting out gluten. Once my brother did that he finally was medication free. That\u2019s when I completely changed my career choice from dentist to chiropractor! I have helped so many people like my brother through the power of working with the spine and nervous system. I don\u2019t think I would ever give it up even if I made millions of dollars a year. I truly do this job because it has built me an awesome network of friends and several patients that are even as close as family. Obviously my answer is quite different then most people here would say, but I cannot stress the importance of Doing a job you truly love! It will bring you so much happiness and success! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes I do have to work to live. If I did not have to, I would never work again ever unless it was a job I would enjoy such as running a sanctuary for rescued animals or something fun and nice to that degree, maybe even make a candy shop with hard candies and taffy and ice cream. But alas I was born into a poor family in one of the worst parts of the United states (the dreaded south) and I must work manual labor just to pay the bill's and get food. But someday I hope for life to drop some of that well deserved money my way so I can begin to live life instead of just surviving. ",
