            "answer_text": "Quite a difficult !!! Simplicity comes when you live up to your terms without flaunting but we all are busy in chasing up around. Competition should be of learning ,better vision towards you not the perspective about car ,house ,designer brands,foreign trips etc(countless things that we do to show the world). These days ,it\u2019s being in trend to have pre & post wedding shoot -Do you really think to lead happy life with your partner ,you must have it.Well ,no doubt many people could afford it & they should have for their exclusive memories but REALLY ? We are doing almost everything to prove ,not sure exactly what. I had asked someone what exactly you get after posting every thing as a status - I got a casual reply \u201cRandom Happiness when people like and to tell people i am enjoying but not by saying them deliberately\u201d. You will certainly feel that you won\u2019t enjoy the simple life as you would be deprived of many acts but that\u2019s not the case. We believe only monks live this kind if life where we are absolutely wrong . To live a simple life ,we just need to do what we love not to show we love what we are doing. ",
