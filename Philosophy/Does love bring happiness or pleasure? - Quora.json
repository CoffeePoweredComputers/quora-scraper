            "answer_text": "Love is a feeling space rather than a cerebral concept. It is therefore an experience rather than an intellectualization. Love is the word we use to represent feeling states, attitudes, pleasures, or strong affections felt for any number of things from romantic attachments to sexual attachments to platonic attachments.

It is the profound feeling space of total and complete oneness.  Happiness/pleasure/pain that may be associated by a person with love are just by-products of internal relationship with himself/herself. ",
