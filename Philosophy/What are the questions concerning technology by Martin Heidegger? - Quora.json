            "answer_text": "French philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy offers both support and corrections for Heidegger\u2019s philosophy. In place of Heidegger\u2019s analysis of technology, Nancy offers his own concept of ecotechnics. Following is Illan Wall\u2019s description of ecotechnics is The Nancy Dictionary, pp. 74-5. \u201cNancy coins the term \u2018ecotechnics\u2019 to describe the current global politico-economic conjuncture (see general equivalence, globalisation). As J. Hillis Miller explains, \u2018\u201cEco\u201d comes from the Greek word oikos, the house or home. The prefix \u201ceco-\u201d is used more broadly now to refer to the total environment within which one or another \u201cliving\u201d creature \u201cdwells\u201d\u2018 (Hillis Miller 2012: 66). Thus, at stake in the term is the manner in which the \u2018eco\u2019 is technologically determined and enframed. For Nancy, ecotechnics is closely associated with globalisation, which he suggests should be analysed as a double phenomenon, that is, as the ecotechnological enframing of the world in global capitalism, and the mondialisation or world-formation that \u2018maintains the reference to the world\u2019s horizon, as a space of human relations, as a space of meaning held in common\u2019 (Raffoul and Pettigrew 2007: 2). In this sense, ecotechnics is an aspect of the critique of globalisation. It implies a triple division of the world: \u2018the division of the rich from the poor; the division of the integrated from the excluded; and the division of North from the South\u2019 (BSP, 135). It is a \u2018political-economic\u2019 constellation that can be distinguished from sovereignty: ecotechnics \u2018damages, weakens and upsets the functioning of all sovereignties, except for those that in reality coincide with ecotechnical power\u2019 (BSP, 135-6). \u201cA point of comparison can be made with \u2018biopolitics\u2019. Where biopolitics emphasises the association between life (bios/zo\u0113) and politics, ecotechnics puts its emphasis on the manner in which the world is technologically enframed. Instead of the politics of life with its originary fracture (zo\u0113/bios), Nancy suggests that \u2018it is ... a destinal figure (\u201crace\u201d or \u201cthe human worker\u201d) that comes to substitute for the classical figures of sovereignty\u2019 (CW, 94). The destinal figures of \u2018race\u2019 or \u2018the human worker\u2019 become realigned as \u2018natural life\u2019, yet they no longer coincide with some form of simple \u2018life\u2019. Rather, it is clear that so-called \u2018natural life\u2019, from its production to its conservation, its needs and its representations, whether human, animal, vegetal or viral, is henceforth inseparable from a set of conditions that are referred to as \u2018technological\u2019, and which constitute what must rather be named ecotechnology where any kind of \u2018nature\u2019 develops for us (and by us) (CW, 94). \u201cMost importantly for Nancy, biopolitics forms a world that is becoming un-world (immonde). \u2018A world is precisely that in which there is room for everyone: but a genuine place, one in which things can genuinely take place\u2019 (CW, 42). Biopolitics names the process of the management of life, wherein it is reduced to \u2018bare life\u2019 and denied a genuine \u2018taking place\u2019. The space of the camp very clearly demonstrates this attempt to negate \u2018world-forming\u2019 (see Agamben 1998, 1999b, 2005). Nancy suggests that \u2018[t]he \u201cworld\u201d in these conditions, or \u201cworld-forming,\u201d is only the precise form of [biopolitics]\u2019 (CW, 95). In this sense, he redirects the analysis of biopolitics to the question of \u2018world-forming\u2019 and, more specifically, ecotechnics.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The primary question that Heidegger concerned himself with in his essays on technology is actually an incredibly abstract one: In our current historical era how does the being (existence) of beings (entities, anything) appear to (or for) Dasein (human beings)? Answer: Everything appears as raw material for human use and manipulation. It\u2019s important to understand that Heidegger is not saying that everything here on planet earth (water, trees, the winds, mountains, animals) is encountered and perceived by us and then we decide to treat it as a source of energy or a food\u2014human beings have been coming across natural stuff \u201cout there\u201d in the world for many thousands of years and using such stuff to make tools, build shelters, invent weapons, etc. So this can hardly be what makes our current era \u201ca time of need\u201d (or a \u201ctechnological age\u201d). Heidegger\u2019s point is that today we cannot experience anything other than as \u201cstock\u201d or \u201cprovision\u201d. This is not about something that human beings do (and could just decide to stop doing). This is about the very way in which anything is manifested in our world today. ",
