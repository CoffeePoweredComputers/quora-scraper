            "answer_text": " 4\u20135 months old babies hardly know any vocabulary, but lack of vocabulary doesn't stop them from thinking or imagining. For example, when you show a flashlight to a baby, he/she will still try to hold it, observe it. They get lost into their own world of imagination and curiosity and thus, many ideas are created in their minds. They like to observe everything and everyone around them, and different ideas come to their mind.  Primitive humans used sounds only for gestures.They didn't have any vocabulary or language, but it doesn't mean, ideas didn't use to come to their minds. They had ideas, that's why, they made weapons using stones and they were able to discover fire. Therefore, Idea comes first. Sorry, if I gave any wrong information and if my answer had grammatical mistakes. Thanks for reading. ",
