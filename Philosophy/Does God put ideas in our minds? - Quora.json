            "answer_text": "If you are talking about knowledge, Yes all the knowledge that human beings have is from The GOD. The GOD tells us in Quran that and much more like The GOD sends down treasures according to the situation. If you observe, There\u2019s plenty of food for all the people of the planet, it\u2019s the selfish system that doesn\u2019t let the poor eat of the provision of The GOD. The bad ideas are from Satan and companions. they whisper in our ears the bad ideas and we think of them as our own and usually act upon them. once we act upon them we become responsible because satan and his companions (The Jinns) can not force us to do wrong, they only give us the idea. It is we who act wrongly and become sinful. Hope this answers Your Question. I could have provide references from Quran for this answer but i am running out of time and I actually don\u2019t have those verses at hand but i have read / heard Quran\u2019s translation many times so i know that all of it is in there. Here are few other verses for you to consider. Quran Chapter 6 101. Originator of the heavens and the earth\u2014how can He have a son when He never had a companion? He created all things, and He has knowledge of all things. 102. Such is God, your Lord. There is no god except He, the Creator of all things; so worship Him. He is responsible for everything. 103. No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. He is the Subtle, the Expert. 104. \u201cInsights have come to you from your Lord. Whoever sees, it is to the benefit of his soul; and whoever remains blind, it is to its detriment. I am not a guardian over you.\u201d 105. We thus diversify the revelations, lest they say, \u201cYou have studied,\u201d and to clarify them for people who know. 106. Follow what was revealed to you from your Lord. There is no god but He. And turn away from the polytheists. 107. Had God willed, they would not have practiced idolatry. We did not appoint you as a guardian over them, and you are not a manager over them. Quran Chapter 2 176. That is because God has revealed the Book in truth; and those who differ about the Book are in deep discord. 177. Righteousness does not consist of turning your faces towards the East and the West. But righteous is he who believes in God, and the Last Day, and the angels, and the Scripture, and the prophets. Who gives money, though dear, to near relatives, and orphans, and the needy, and the homeless, and the beggars, and for the freeing of slaves; those who perform the prayers, and pay the obligatory charity, and fulfill their promise when they promise, and patiently persevere in the face of persecution, hardship, and in the time of conflict. These are the sincere; these are the pious. Quran Chapter 2 256. There shall be no compulsion in religion; the right way has become distinct from the wrong way. Whoever renounces evil and believes in God has grasped the most trustworthy handle; which does not break. God is Hearing and Knowing. 257. God is the Lord of those who believe; He brings them out of darkness and into light. As for those who disbelieve, their lords are the evil ones; they bring them out of light and into darkness\u2014these are the inmates of the Fire, in which they will abide forever. 258. Have you not considered him who argued with Abraham about his Lord, because God had given him sovereignty? Abraham said, \u201cMy Lord is He who gives life and causes death.\u201d He said, \u201cI give life and cause death.\u201d Abraham said, \u201cGod brings the sun from the East, so bring it from the West,\u201d so the blasphemer was confounded. God does not guide the wrongdoing people. Quran Chapter 39 53. Say, \u201cO My servants who have transgressed against themselves: do not despair of God\u2019s mercy, for God forgives all sins. He is indeed the Forgiver, the Clement.\u201d 54. And turn to your Lord, and submit to Him, before the retribution comes upon you. Then you will not be helped. 55. And follow the best of what was revealed to you from your Lord, before the punishment comes upon you suddenly, while you are unaware. 56. So that a soul may not say, \u201cHow sorry I am, for having neglected my duty to God, and for having been of the scoffers.\u201d 57. Or say, \u201cHad God guided me; I would have been of the pious.\u201d 58. Or say, when it sees the penalty, \u201cIf only I had another chance, I would be of the virtuous.\u201d 59. Yes indeed! My Verses did come to you, but you called them lies, turned arrogant, and were of the faithless. 60. On the Day of Resurrection, you will see those who told lies about God with their faces blackened. Is there not a place in Hell for the arrogant? 61. And God will save those who maintained righteousness to their place of salvation. No harm will touch them, nor will they grieve. Quran Chapter 41 33. And who is better in speech than someone who calls to God, and acts with integrity, and says, \u201cI am of those who submit\u201d? Quran Chapter 25 73. And those who, when reminded of the revelations of their Lord, do not fall before them deaf and blind. Quran Chapter 18 100. On that Day, We will present the disbelievers to Hell, all displayed. 101. Those whose eyes were screened to My message, and were unable to hear. 102. Do those who disbelieve think that they can take My servants for masters instead of Me? We have prepared Hell for the hospitality of the faithless. 103. Say, \u201cShall We inform you of the greatest losers in their works?\u201d 104. \u201cThose whose efforts in this world are misguided, while they assume that they are doing well.\u201d 105. It is they who rejected the communications of their Lord, and the encounter with Him. So their works are in vain. And on the Day of Resurrection, We will consider them of no weight. 106. That is their requital\u2014Hell\u2014on account of their disbelief, and their taking My revelations and My messengers in mockery. 107. As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, they will have the Gardens of Paradise for hospitality. 108. Abiding therein forever, without desiring any change therefrom. 109. Say, \u201cIf the ocean were ink for the words of my Lord, the ocean would run out, before the words of my Lord run out,\u201d even if We were to bring the like of it in addition to it. 110. Say, \u201cI am only a human being like you, being inspired that your god is One God. Whoever hopes to meet his Lord, let him work righteousness, and never associate anyone with the service of his Lord.\u201d Let me give you an example here. Let\u2019s assume this life is a glass of water in your hand, what many of you don\u2019t know or want to accept is that there\u2019s more than an ocean of water is waiting on the other side for you to drink as well. You have taken 2\u20133 sips from this glass of water in your hand meaning you have spent like 20\u201330 years in this worldly life and it tasted bitter so now you want to make it sweet and for this you are going to use all means whether they be very wrong like stealing other money in many ways. Causing some trouble to others while trying to obtain better living for yourself. Engaging in unlawful relationship, Unlawful in sight of The GOD. There are many things connected to these things so use your own imagination here. If you are wrongfully making this life / glass of water sweet, you are spoiling the ocean of water waiting for you to drink. You have to drink both of them, This glass of water and That ocean too. It is up to you, do you want this glass of water to taste sweet and compromise whole ocean or do you want to show patience with this glass of water and sweeten the whole ocean which surely is yours and will be sweeter than anything you can ever imagine. Human beings have not been given the capability to imagine what is Heaven. Heaven is going to be awesome. Peace. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! I think He puts an idea in my mind to want something, and then when it appears, it seems amazing, but really, it was a set-up. Like year before last at the end of summer I told God that I \u201creally want a nice private swimming pool to swim in next summer.\u201d I don\u2019t know why I wanted it so badly, but I did. The next summer my duaghter moved into an apartment complex with the most beautiful and rarely used pool in it and I got enjoy it to my heart\u2019s content all by myself while visiting for days at a time. Wonderful! I know when I am thinking in a typical linear fashion from point a to be to c and then an idea \u201cx\u201d is seemingly dropped into my mind, it\u2019s probably an idea from God. Also when I pray about something and leave it up to God to answer, later an appropriate verse of scripture from out of nowhere will come to me and answer the question that I asked. I know God just answered my question. Yes, I believe wholeheartedly, that God puts ideas in my mind. ",

I used to have the holy bible app on my phone. But have not since I've previously gotten this newer phone. He urged me to get it again for a good read and to listen throughout the day. And I quoted to him a verse that I heard in church a few years back, and when I downloaded the app, the verse I quoted verbatim was the \u201cverse of the day\u201d on the holy bible app. Some people say coincidence. But the fact that it could of been thousands and thousands of other scriptures to be the verse of the day. But no the very same day I talked to him and downloaded the app. The next day I woke up and it was that verse. God has all intensive purposes for every thought that is given to us, you just have to pray and ask for clarity of thought to find out what that is and how it pertains to you and your walk with him. -will Age:22 ",

Fabricating their ideas, motives, ambitions, and desires- which all serve as mechanisms to rectify his own egotistical nature, and to distract him from the loniliness he suffers from as the only omnipotent creator( with the weird bowl haircut). If this were true, it would put god beyond the realms of cynicism, egoism, and the general nature of being a sadistic asshole\u2026 It would put him in the category of the clinically insane. The idea that he has devoloped a stark narcisstic personality disorder that he would alter the thoughts of others just to make himself feel appreciated is more than selfish, more than lonely, its just pure evil.
