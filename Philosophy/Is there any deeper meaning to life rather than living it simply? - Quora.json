            "answer_text": "The life of even a single human being is highly complex in nature and amazingly diverse in comparison with another human being. Such a complex being obviously cannot be understood simply by dissecting their respective lives but other factors have to be analyzed to fully understand just a singular life. Since consciousness reached a significant stage in human evolution, it had drastically changed the perspective in which earlier humans filterd the observable universe. From that point onwards the human life had changed significantly and all that they once functioned without question became obsolete. To answer the question there are numerous ways, among them the diplomatic answer is highly unfavorable as it just actually gives the audience the choice to make their own decisions and not really give anything conclusive from its own end. But I will try to give the answer that people actually want [the conclusive answer] There is a greater meaning to life than what we commonly observe or experience ; as human life is giganticly complex so is the reason behind its existence. Who are we or why are we here is the most common question people ask, but the question they should ask is that who should we thank for everything that had been created just for us. Isn't it enough that we live the most diverse life in the universe / think about it. If you like the answer upvote it / if not notify me. ",

            "answer_text": "Helping others and uplifting yourself is fine,but there is a deeper meaning of life too. Have you thought about your soul anytime?You are not merely a body and mind,you have an ignored soul also residing in your body. When you will think about it?Life is unpredictable.Death can knock our door anytime anywhere without noticing our age or position. Our ultimate purpose of this mortal life is to merge our soul in the ocean of immortality so that we wouldn\u2019t have to come in this world again and again in different species.It is not cumpulsory that we will always get birth of a human being.Please think about it.You will get that path like me for sure,if you have earnest longing for availing this opportunity of human life. All the best! ",
