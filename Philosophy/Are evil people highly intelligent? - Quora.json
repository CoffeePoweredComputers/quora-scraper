            "answer_text": "If so, you\u2019ll never know they are evil. A healthy mind with high intelligence, never turns evil. Highly intelligent people see beyond the empty things which turn one evil. Evil is the result of an undisciplined mind. The only exception lies in an unhealthy mind. Someone who lacks empathy, may use their intelligence for evil, within delusion. This can be caused by a lack of nurture or destructive human contact at a young age. However, the moment they break their delusion, they will see the error of their ways. ",
