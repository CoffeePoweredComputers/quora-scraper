            "answer_text": "People suffering from depression can make more accurate predictions than optimists. It\u2019s called depressive realism, and it springs from a healthy (or unhealthy) suspicion about the world. These pessimists are able to rate their abilities more realistically, typically believe that the past predicts the future, and take into account statistics about all the bad things that could happen. And in doing so, they seem to get a more accurate reading of the world. As an unapologetic optimist placed firmly on the other end of the spectrum, at first glance this rang true. I overestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes in my own life and tend to say \u2018it\u2019ll work out!\u2019 during times when all evidence suggests otherwise (\u2018We\u2019ll find that ring you lost!\u2019 followed by a forlorn attempt to search the streets of Bangkok). I probably lie to myself more often than a pessimist does. So should I take off the rose tinted glasses and double-down my efforts to be more pessimistic? Should you? Hold up, not so fast! Later studies cast serious doubt on depressive realism (phew!). One study found that depressed people do a poor job of predicting both positive and negative events. The bad events they predicted would happen in life did indeed happen to them (failing a test, getting into a fight with a friend). But those bad things ended up actually being worse than they predicted, which means their prediction wasn\u2019t very accurate. On the flipside, the few good things depressed people predicted \u2018could happen,\u2019 ended up happening more often than they thought (they aced the test, got the job, found a boyfriend). They underestimated the variable of luck in life. In other words, the pessimists were wrong on both fronts. A more practical example: just because the failure rate for job applications at Google is high doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t figure out some clever ways to get your resume to stand out. A pessimist may not even try to apply, while the optimist believes they have more control over their future and thus are willing to try more things to get the job. They may apply for different roles, reach out to ex Google employees for interview tips, hire a career coach, etc. And in doing so, they cap their downside and increase their upside. The optimist may think they\u2019ll get the job at Google, but still fail the interview. But they\u2019ll try elsewhere, and are more likely to get a reputable job at a tech company. And that\u2019s the simple case for being more optimistic. ",
