            "answer_text": "Although, \"Who am I?\" Is the question most people under 40, or anyone who has not been mediating 10 years, should be asking, the question most of us should asking is, \"what is the thing I could be doing this minute that would have the best result for ALL?\"  It is neither easy to answer nor easy to do, at first. But, with practice, there is an inner voice that is not the typical ego type answer that maintains its safety, its judgments, its values, its preference for reinforcing belief in separation, its auotomatic fear-driven response, but instead the Voice that you know is true: the instinct to turn left when it was your intention to turn right, the voice that tells you that this particular homeless person should be given five dollars, that you should share the name of your doctor with a stranger this time, that it IS more appropriate this time to go in early (or go in late), or call the plumber, or to say you're sorry, or to switch medical plan, or accept the wedding invitation, or go to the wake. With practice, you get reinforcement for doing the best thing, the right thing, and you learn to ask more frequently, and hear more accurately. And, it need not apply only to \"action\" decisions.The thing that you should be doing might be, \"not making the decision yet\" or, \"forgiving and forgetting the incident between you and ___\" or \"truly listening to the other person and not interjecting your idea at this time.\" Thanks for the A2A.

            "answer_text": "This question is the result of misconception about Ramana Maharishi\u2019s teachings. When He says \u201cfind out who you are\u201d and He has suggested repeatedly ask yourself \u201cwho am I?\u201d, He never meant it to repeat this question endlessly as a mantra. Unfortunately this is how most spiritual aspirants interpret Ramana\u2019s core teaching. It is not going to be easy to undo this damage. Just forget about asking yourself any question, instead focus on your own aliveness. What is the nature of your aliveness? What is it that differentiates you from a piece of furniture? This aliveness is not a thing in the first place. This aliveness screams out loud \u201cI am not inert. I am a no-thing, a non-material spirit.\u201d. This aliveness is sitting right on your nose. It can never be known as an object. There is no way for you to sneak behind this aliveness secretly and observe it. That is because you are this aliveness! Just like the eye can see everything else but itself and just like a camera cannot take a shot of itself, aliveness cannot see itself. It can only BE itself. This TRUTH should be intuited with intelligence. This TRUTH, INTELLIGENCE, ALIVENESS, SELF and CONSCIOUSNESS is the BRAHMAN of the Upanishads. This intuition can happen in an instant HERE and NOW. Do it. ",
