            "answer_text": "No science is specifically about observing what is happening and recording it in the most accurate way possible . This can be done by simply using ones senses to observe and record or it can be done by experimentation the result of which are then recorded in the same way . Though a large proportion of art has been about observing nature and existence it\u2019s primary function is to find meaning and the truth of how it makes us feel . As humans the way we understand the universe and make it meaningful to us is ultimately a mystery. It may always be a mystery and that may be the ultimate truth of who we are . If we find out who we are , art may meet up with science again . ",
