            "answer_text": "An open-minded person is a relatively wise and mature individual who is willing to listen and learn and doesn\u2019t prejudge. That\u2019s a boring answer, so I\u2019ll go over habits that open-minded people practice to improve their open-mindedness: They welcome wisdom/knowledge, but never believe any of it is indisputable.They verify and fact-check information before sharing such info to others as factual knowledge. They remember the sources of the info, whether it\u2019s 3rd hand, speculation, a deduction from a collection evidence, or simply a casual observation.They thank others who correct them, improving the accuracy of their knowledge, rather than pridefully deny that they are incorrect.They try not to over-think nor deduce based on assumption. They prefer accuracy, so they try to gather more info from the best available source to fill in the information needed, and supplant unreliable sources of information such as their imagination.They\u2019d rather leave questions unanswered, than put faith in the best answer they can think of. They instead say they do not know, or they don\u2019t have enough information to answer accurately.They try to piece every bit of related information into a larger picture, to gain an understanding of how everything is connected, to ensure there are minimal unexplained contradictions.When they are having trouble understanding something, rather than judge it (wrong, poorly worded, coming from someone who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, etc.), they step back and re-evaluate and try to see it from a different perspective, to try and find the point of the message. This is akin to empathizing.They try to question everything that is seemingly irrational, such as their emotions (fear, love, etc.) and attempt to answer their own questions through research and experimentation, rather than imagination, speculation, probability, etc. as it leads to more reliable information that they can further utilize.They dislike misunderstandings, and will try to clear any up, especially if it\u2019s due to their nature of preferring not to read other people\u2019s minds and preferring not to interpret their \u201chints\u201d based on probability through their past personal experiences.And finally, they see even questionable sources of information as an opportunity to learn.An open-minded person can see a so-called idiot as a human with many diverse sides to them, with both merits and demerits. They do not see merely one character trait, to classify them to a group to judge how open they should be to them. For instance, if the open minded person believes that the Earth is a sphere, and encounters a flat-earther, they will not try to correct the flat-earther, but instead try to learn the details of the flat-earther\u2019s belief/stance. They\u2019d find it interesting that the flat-earther believes Antartica is the wall surrounding the Earth, and that the sun and moon are circling above. They\u2019d see the person as a human that\u2019s normal in every other way, except for this belief and how they form an impressively sized community with other believers, being relatively harmless and contributing to society in other ways. In contrast, the closed minded person wouldn\u2019t give you someone the time of day if they weren\u2019t open to them. These closed minded people only selectively open up to others, accepting only what they believe to be \u201ctruth\u201d. They seek such truths and preach them to others as gospel, gathering more to their tribe. They may claim to be open-minded, but they only offer you a keyhole to be picked, that locks away their mind. They expect a certain convincing answer to open the door, but they can very well close the door later if they feel you overstayed your welcome. These types love an open-minded person, to stuff it with their preached \u201ctruths\u201d/beliefs. I would relate an open minded person to a self-learning AI-robot, in contrast to a closed mined person as a directly programmable robot that grants limited authority to specific individuals to make changes.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the request. Since you asked me, I\u2019ve got an unpopular opinion to share with you: No one is \u201copen-minded.\u201d That\u2019s just another one of those things we\u2019re told that everyone should be and, so, almost everyone wants to be thought of as being that so that they\u2019re not negatively judged\u2026but they\u2019re not. I like Pamela\u2019s answer, for the most part, if you\u2019re looking for a definition. But I really don\u2019t believe any one person can be all of those things, not even the majority of the time. Everyone fits a contradiction of being open-minded in some ways and not in others\u2014we\u2019re too complex as human beings to not be narrow-minded about some things, which people then try to distinguish as simply having standards and preferences. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever find a person who consistently fits with any definition of open-mindedness or of what you\u2019d consider to be open-minded, unless your definition is fairly simplistic or narrow. Everyone judges. (Again, my opinions here, partially based on being educated in psychology.) Judging is healthy, a defense mechanism that aids your survival. But we\u2019re told we shouldn\u2019t do it and that doing so makes you narrow-minded. Everyone has \u201cstandards and preferences.\u201d Typical life examples: -Sally loves to meet new people and has all kinds of friends from different backgrounds, but Sally will only date white men and would only marry a white man. Is she open-minded because she socializes with all kinds of people, or is she narrow-minded because she will only date men of one race? Does only dating men of one race indicate she is not as accepting of different kinds of people as she wants to believe or as she seems? Or is it just a standard or preference? What if Sally says she is also open to new experiences\u2014does her refusal to date non-white men contradict that? -You ask Thea, your single friend, what she\u2019s looking for in a man. Thea says she is pretty open, she really doesn\u2019t have a particular \u201ctype\u201d and that she isn\u2019t looking for much. She just wants to find someone to spend the rest of her life with. Then you point out that this guy you both know, Jeff, is also single. Jeff is a very good guy, very smart, hard-working and he is fairly attractive. Why hasn\u2019t Thea considered Jeff, you ask? Thea responds that, while there is some chemistry there, Jeff makes less money than she does. Thea wants to partner with someone who at least makes as much as she does, and she\u2019d prefer to partner with someone who makes more. She wants a financially stable future, especially when she\u2019s ready to have kids, and she doesn\u2019t want to \u201ccarry\u201d anyone or be the breadwinner. You point out that Thea has dated multiple guys who fit her financial standards. Thea agrees but responds there was always either no chemistry or the guys were jerks and cheaters. Now, is Thea, in refusing to date Jeff\u2014to whom she actually does feel some attraction and with whom she does feel chemistry\u2014just maintaining her standards? Or is this a sign that she is not as open as she says she is? Is she looking for a lot more than she thinks she is, or is she being honest with herself? After all, from this, we can at least gather that she wants financial stability/security, chemistry, monogamy. If you keep questioning Thea, what all else will you find out that she truly wants that is closing her mind to a lot of available men? (Not to say you should date cheaters and jerks, but what about good available men?) -Bob says he is an open-minded person. Bob is a supervisor at a company, and he holds monthly lunches with a selected number of employees under his supervision to discuss how everything is going and to get their point of view on different topics and issues at work. He says he wants to hear their ideas and wants to know what they think can be done better. Kelly works for Bob, and she has a number of issues with how things are done under Bob\u2019s supervision. Bob can be a micromanager at times, his passion in meetings sometimes comes off as unreasonable criticism and he expects immediate results from everyone\u2014even if they\u2019re fairly new or if they\u2019re a partner company that has only been implementing their strategies for about two months on something that typically takes more time to see results. One day after Kelly again experiences one of these issues with Bob, i.e. micromanaging or unrealistic expectations, Kelly expresses her issues with Bob directly to Bob. In response, Bob terminates Kelly\u2019s job, and Kelly is walked off the premises. He believes Kelly showed some insubordination in what she expressed about his micromanagement and that she did not fit the fast-paced company culture. And since no one else has said anything to him about his leadership style, he does not agree with her assessment\u2014she simply lacks confidence or the ability to get the job done. Bob still continues to hold monthly lunches to get employees\u2019 input on how things can be done better and still believes he is open-minded and that these lunches underscore that he is. Is he? Or does he only want to hear certain things and certain types of feedback from employees\u2014in particular, feedback that is not specifically related to him and his leadership style? Does he mainly want people to agree with him or to present ideas that fit with his idea of the company culture, or is he truly open to all ideas and feedback? \u2014 This is how people are, guys. It\u2019s not open-minded, to me, to only be open-minded up to a certain point or only about certain things. It\u2019s human complexity. ",
