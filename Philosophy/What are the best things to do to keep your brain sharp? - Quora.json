            "answer_text": "Quit Jerking off too much. You'll notice a significant increase in mental sharpness and clarity just by dialing the frequency down to no more than a couple of times a week.Be alert, and stay in the present. Do not let your mind linger into the miseries of the past and the uncertainties of the future.Question everything, and take nothing for granted. You have queries? Cool, get it answered. You grow by asking questions.Read more; be it books, newspapers or online content. Start small, and keep at it. You will grow smarter. You will be sharper. You will be wittier.Regarding wit and humour; watch Comedy shows, sitcoms and the like. Watch your humour, sarcasm, wit and comedic muscles explode in size.Brain games like Sudoku, or Chess.Coffee. But don't overdo it, because you will need higher and higher doses of it later on to feel the buzz.Don't do drugs. Most addictive drugs work on the principles of dopamine addiction.Let me try to explain what this is in brief. Dopamine = feeling good and motivated. More dopamine levels = more ooohhh soooo goooood and more motivation to do whatever you want to do. As a human, we always try to do activities which release the most dopamine overall. Now, Healthy and useful activities such as exercise, working towards a goal, a project, socialising, reading a book, meditation\u2026 All of these release dopamine in moderate levels. Addictive activities such as Junk food, Cocaine, Heroin, Porn, Sex\u2026 release dopamine but in larger amounts. How much larger? 3 to 5 times the amount released by the former activities. There are cells in your brain which respond to dopamine, called as Dopamine receptors. Also, the brain has to maintain a balance of chemicals. If any of the chemical, dopamine included, goes out of balance, it can affect every other function inside. This is where the problem starts. Normally, in a healthy person, he receives most of his dopamine from healthy, helpful activities. And so, his dopamine receptors stay sharp and efficient. Think of a smooth, soft and high quality sponge. When you indulge in addictive behaviour, your receptors are hit with more dopamine than they can handle. And while it feels good, your brain has to maintain a balance(remember?), so it downregulates the receptors. Which in common lingo means make them less efficient, and less primed to absorb dopamine in the future. Think of a rough, poor quality sponge. Eventually, your receptors become so downregulated that beneficial activities like talking to people, working hard to achieve something, meditating,reading,working on your health\u2026 just do not elicit the same response in your receptors anymore.  Have you ever looked at an addict, and mocked him for his lack of willpower? It's not willpower. It's not that he doesn't want to change. 10 year olds know that drugs are addictive, and can screw up your life. It's chemistry.  Skip the drugs, people. It isn't worth it in the long run. And Yes, Porn and Junk Food are a kind of drug too. Use it sparingly. Eat the right kinds of food. Foods rich in healthy fats often benefit the brain as well. Walnuts, Almonds, Fish, and foods high in Omega-3 fatty acids. Weight Train. Any kind of physical exercise helps stimulate natural dopamine and endorphins (another chemical responsible for feeling good). They also keep you fit (duh).Sleep enough. I really wish I could come up with a one step solution to increase brain power, but sleeping enough is the closest I can get. Shoot for 7 hours at minimum.",

            "answer_text": "Follow these tips if you want to become mentally strong : 1.FIX A TARGET : Fix a target for the present day . Wake up early in the morning and start working on it .

I found these medication helpful for my grand father who was sufering from dementian Memory Repair Protocol - Official Website 2.BREAK THE FEAR: Fear of society !! Fear of failure!!! Fear of doing something different !!! Fear of becoming a laughable element !!! Fear of being alone on the road you have chosen !!! These are the various kinds of fears that we have in our mind. You should be focused on your destination and not the temporary and transient obstacles like these that will come in your way.Just start and you will see the benefits on the way. 3.MEASURING : This is very important part . When you will start a work , some people will support and majority will criticise it . Think like this at that time : TODAY IS YOUR TURN AND TOMORROW IT WILL BE MINE!!! And when you will eventually succeed, many people will criticize you but even a greater number of them will applaud . MEASURE the two of them and be happy with the applauses and take inspiration from the criticism by being even more productive and successful. 4.FRIENDS CIRCLE : This influences your behaviour a lot. If you have a competitive friends circle , you will get more competitive and more productive every day . 5. ACCEPT THE CHALLENGES : Never refrain from accepting a challenge . Always be ready to face the challenge and win it . Make entire strategy to complete and win the challenge in minimal time .It\u2019s not mandatory that you will win every challenge , but with every challenge , your mind will get stronger and more productive. 6.PONDERING OVER : In case you become unsuccessful, ponder over the factors which hold you back .Ask these questions to yourself : What were the glitches in my plan? Why I didn\u2019t thought of these before ? What can I do now? How can I fill these glitches ? Or Do I need a fresh start? 7.INTERNALISATION : Don\u2019t just listen to a motivational and inspiring thing , internalise it in addition.Try to apply all the aspects of it in your life .
