            "answer_text": "My understanding of this comes from the people in my life who served in different wars and different generations. When you agree to serve, your training alters how you see the world while in uniform. You are trained that combat is intended to destroy some or all of you and so you have no choice but to enter into the fight intending to kill or neutralize those threats first. To support this idea, enlistees are reminded constantly of what they are fighting for. A war is a mission to win. Your comrades are family you will fight to protect with your life because they would do the same for you. The homeland is a place with noble ideals to protect. Self-preservation is also fighting for the right to return home to one\u2019s family and regular life. If you don\u2019t intend to kill the enemy, you will lose all those things. Once you pass basic training, you understand that choosing to die rather than fight is a betrayal of the oath you swore to uphold. It may not be required. A service person may not come anywhere near combat or a situation of violence, but it is nonetheless an expectation and consequence of a choice. Some people return to civilian life and struggle to re-integrate based on the shift back to an idea that taking a life is a complex and traumatic thing. ",

            "answer_text": "If you were a soldier at war, would you rather kill or be killed? When under those exact conditions, I thought that assuming all human life to be of equal value, it was natural for me to prefer to save what was closest to me (myself) over a stranger. I have always felt extremely grateful for not having been put into such a situation; one in which I had to choose between killing or being killed. ",
