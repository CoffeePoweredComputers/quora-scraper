            "answer_text": "Well, yes and no, depending on what you mean by \u2018same propositions\u2019. In basic propositional logic, you represent a statement by a letter, for example p, q, r, etc. Stating, in a formal system, that two statements p and q are logically equivalent is basically saying that the terms used in these statements are different but that p and q mean the same thing. If identity conditions for propositions are based on the terms used in a proposition, p and q are different propositions that are logically equivalent. If identity conditions for propositions are based on meaning, p and q are the same propositions. Let\u2019s look at an example with simple arithmetics. Statement p is \u20182 plus 2 equals 4\u2019, while statement q is \u20182 times 2 equals 4\u2019. The operation used in each statement is different than the one used in the other statement. These two statements are logically equivalent. Would you say that \u20182 plus 2 equals 4\u2019 is the same proposition as \u20182 times 2 equals 4\u2019? I\u2019m really asking the question, I don\u2019t have a straightforward answer to this. I would however think that the most common answer is that no, logically equivalent statements are not necessarily the same proposition. The stronger argument that I can think of for this is that we use logical equivalence as a mean to define terms or concepts. For example, you can define multiplication as a series of addition. If two logically equivalent statements were the same propositions, then there would be no sense in defining anything : giving a definition for something, let\u2019s say x, would simply be restating what x already means with other words. A definition of x would give no information whatsoever about x that wasn\u2019t already implied by stating \u2018x\u2019. Now, that might be correct if we\u2019re talking about extensional logic (what x and the definition of x refer to in the world), but it wouldn\u2019t make sense if we\u2019re talking about intensional logic (what x and the definition of x mean to someone). It\u2019s getting a bit technical though. ",
