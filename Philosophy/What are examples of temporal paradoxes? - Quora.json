            "answer_text": "The temporal paradox doesn\u2019t exist. If you go back in time and do something, it just happens that thing already has happened. If you decide to go back in time it must mean that whatever you did somehow made the present. For example, if you\u2019re alive and you think you\u2019re going try to go back and kill your grandfather, you would be advised against doing that since you know that if you did, something would have happened so that you somehow failed, if not you\u2019re alive only because you never tried which is preferable.
