            "answer_text": "I think you are envisioning a sort of yin and yang scenario but that's not necessarily the case here. True NO-Thing is the absence of both yin and yang. Even the concept of a void dosen't truly capture the esence of true NO-Thing as a void implies the absence of SOME-Thing. Not even the concept of NO-Thing can exist in true NO-Thing. Something can not exist in true NO-Thing AND nothing can not exist in true NO-thing. It is a difficult concept and the closest I can come to comprehending it is trying to envision what it was like before i was born. ",

I've imagined it, but then I've imagined pink unicorns too.    I'm not sure what else to say to satisfy Quora.  This seems all that needs to be said about nothing.    Don't reify it.  Nothing is just the absence of something.   You can use it as a mathematical concept or for meditation.  But you can't actually find it.  It doesn't actually exist. ",

Anything might enter from outside a bounded/finite void or if the extent of nothingness is total / infinite then void is continuous and immutable. Previous answer:This is a misuse of language. This is not a noun describing an object \"nothing\" as this is the antithesis of existing. Like a female man. Your question is ( deliberately ) flawed by the choice if words and at any deeper level. Had you phrased it \"is anything possible where there is nothing?\" If would have had a very straightforward answer. ",
