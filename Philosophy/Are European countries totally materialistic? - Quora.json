            "answer_text": "No. But spiritual and religious matters belong much more to private than public life in Europe than in the Americas, while in the Islam world they dictate political and private life to a certain extent. Europe has been more influenced by phenomenology, the principle that science and law must be based on what we know from our senses, from our instruments and from rational causality which can be proven out of any creed and belief. And this varies within Europe from East to West and from North to South. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely not. Western Europe has the right mixture of materialism and social care which means letting the economic cake get bigger and at the same time look after the weak, poor and unfortunate in society. Western Europe may not talk about meditation or Yoga but population is open minded and more people are including these practices in their daily life. In india spiritually is more or less but when it comes to helping unfortunate downtrodden people government and rich people need to do a lot more. There is a lot more charity work ingrained in western European culture and rest of the world needs to learn from them. ",
