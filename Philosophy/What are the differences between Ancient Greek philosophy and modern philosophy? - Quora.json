            "answer_text": "In Classical philosophy the object is the center of the inquiry. In modern phylosophy since Kant the subject is the center of inquiry. The main Greek schools presupposed that the mind gave a trustworthy intuition of reality. That is called realism. That was so since intuitions not only about external objects but about feelings or about abstract universals like love, justice and so on, can be communicated and argued about with relative precision, So they are objective and real in a certain sense. This standpoint in philosophy is called realism. It admit hard realism and soft realism depending on if the universals exist really or are only in the soul or the mind of the thinker. Plato and Aristotle respectively are the two proponents.  Modern disciplines give support to the realist standpoint like artificial intelligence which has rediscovered and use metaphysical terms already discovered by plato and Aristotle as well as evolutionary psychology, which states that abstract intuitions are universal in and specific of our specie, and evolved  for communication and social collaboration. These intuitions build our  human nature and our common vision of reality. But there are some slight lack of precision in very abstract matters used in metaphysics. It happens that some essential bits upon which build a systematic thinking are controversial, like the notion of being, the distinction between unity and multiplicity, what distinguish a category of things from other and their non essential attributes, what relation exist between the matter of a thing and his classification within a category or essence. The relation between universals like Human Being with a human in particular. There were endless discussions about these matters.  The lack of an \"atomic theory\" of metaphysics upon which every philosopher would agree, but specially the triumph of the natural philosophy  (henceforth called \"science\" as such) that studied the material phenomena, exemplified by Newton and his laws made philosophers question metaphysics until his total rejection in logical positivism and analytical philosophy. There is a precedent in the rejection of metaphysics however in the middle ages. These precursors of the modern philosophy, The Nominalists, Occam for example, rejected universals as a genuine object of study since universals and metaphysics limited the omnipotence of God. Universals for the nominalists were simply \"names\". By centering in the subject and rejecting metaphysics the modern philosophy has renounced to discuss and argue about moral and political values at a rational level. A hallmark of modern philosophy is the distinction between values (that must be personal) and facts (that must be objective).  And the distinction is/ought.  This only leaves physical force or mass indoctrination as the playground for ideological and political confrontation.  ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A if I got that right.The short answer would be that philosophy as a way of life was much more important for ancient philosophy than it is for modern philosophy. For example, according to Aristotle, the life of pure philosophical meditation was the ultimate goal to realize for anyone who could (he was pragmatic) because it was the best way to achieve happiness. All his political and ethical philosophy was build around this i.e. that the political leaders (which he called the \"true\" politicians) should allow the citizens the possibility to live a life of philosophical meditation if possible. Of course, it was not as easy as it may seem but the idea was that a life dedicated to philosophy was the best life possible for humans. Ancient greeks really thought that philosophy was the only sure path to happiness. Thus many of them organized their philosophical systems or theories around this idea. Epicurians, Cynics, Sto\u00efcians, Platonicians, Aristotelicians, etc. considered philosophy as the best way to live one's life. They all differed in regard to the means to live like this but they shared the same belief in general.Today, it's more about epistemology i.e. the research of how we know what we know, or pure pragmatism i.e. what can be useful. Thus, analytical philosophy is far more popular in the academia than the philosophy as a way of life. The human mind has become so complicated that the discipline is, in my humble opinion, less attractive than it must have been in the ancient times when it was less about analysis and more \"happiness driven\" if I make myself clear. How can I live the best life possible? That was the main question in ancient Greece? And their answer was: I have to give the priority to my mind (or my soul) instead of my body. Today, it's much more oriented on the physical and practical aspects of life. We started with the merits of philosophical contemplation and we are heading towards the world of artificial intelligence. Some call that evolution or even progress. I'm not so sure about this. But that's another story. ",
