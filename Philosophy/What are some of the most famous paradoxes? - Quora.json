            "answer_text": "Catch-22: A situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it. A soldier who wants to be declared insane in order to avoid combat is deemed not insane for that very reason, and will therefore not be declared insane. \"anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy\". Hence, pilots who request a mental fitness evaluation are sane, and therefore must fly in combat. At the same time, if an evaluation is not requested by the pilot, he will never receive one and thus can never be found insane, meaning he must also fly in combat.

Barber paradox: A barber (who is a man) shaves all and only those men who do not shave themselves. Does he shave himself? Bhartrhari's paradox: The thesis that there are some things which are unnameable conflicts with the notion that something is named by calling it unnameable.Crocodile dilemma: If a crocodile steals a child and promises its return if the father can correctly guess exactly what the crocodile will do, how should the crocodile respond in the case that the father guesses that the child will not be returned? Socratic paradox: \"All I know is that I know nothing.\" Predestination paradox: A man travels back in time to discover the cause of a famous fire. While in the building where the fire started, he accidentally knocks over a kerosene lantern and causes a fire, the same fire that would inspire him, years later, to travel back in time.Temporal paradox: What happens when a time traveler does things in the past that prevent him from doing them in the first place?Grandfather paradox: You travel back in time and kill your grandfather before he conceives one of your parents, which precludes your own conception and, therefore, you couldn't go back in time and kill your grandfather. Hitler's murder paradox: You travel back in time and kill a famous person in history before they become famous; but if the person had never been famous then he could not have been targeted as a famous person.

            "answer_text": "Lend me your attention for the next few seconds. I promise you that you will start to think differently after reading this article. Imagine that you have invented the time traveling. You are now in possession of the ability to go back into the past and traveled many decades back in time. Hypothetically, what if you murdered your own grandfather in his childhood and what will be the outcome of that action? Since your grandfather has died in his childhood, one of your parents were never born, and you will never be born as a result. However, if you were never born, then who killed your grandfather? (The Grandfather Paradox). This is what is called a paradox. \u201cA paradox is a statement that, despite apparently sound reasoning from true premises, leads to a self-contradictory or a logically unacceptable conclusion.\u201d Here are five such paradoxes that will improve your critical thinking and improve your perception: The Crocodile ParadoA crocodile came out of the river and caught the child. The father begged the crocodile to give back his child, to which crocodile agreed upon a condition. If the father can correctly predict whether the crocodile will either return or take the child, then the father can have his child back. If the father predicts that the crocodile will return the child, then there won't be any paradoxes. If that is what the crocodile was actually planning to do, then it obviously has to leave the child and if the prediction is wrong, then it will take the child away. However, what if the father predicts that the crocodile will take the child away, then that creates a paradox. If that prediction is true, then the crocodile has to give the child back as per the agreement. But by giving back the child, the prediction itself becomes false. And it can't take the child away because by doing so the whole statement will become true again. Do you think there is a way in which this dilemma could be solved? The Bootstrap ParadoxIt is a paradox in time traveling that has kept every thinker searching for a solution. It is actually related to the origin of an object or an individual. Imagine that one day a time traveler buys Shakespear\u2019s Hamlet from a London bookstore and then travels back in time to the Elizabethan era. There the man happens to show the book to the real William Shakespeare, who copies the whole book and claims it as his own work. Centuries have passed and over the years the Hamlet is printed and reprinted many times until it finally reaches the shelves of a London Bookstore, where the time traveler finds and buys it and he takes it back to Shakespeare creating a loop. Now the million dollar question here is- who wrote the Hamlet then? The Paradox of the CourtIt is a very old problem in logic which originated in the ancient Greece. According to the story, a famous tutor Protagoras took on a student called Euathlus to tutor him on law. It was based on the understanding that the student pays Protagoras for his tutoring soon after he wins his first court case. However, after the tutoring, Euathlus had a change of heart and decided to not enter the profession of law. This prompted Protagoras to sue Euathlus for his tutoring fee. Firstly Protagoras argued that if he is to win the case, then he would be paid his money. On the other hand, if Euathlus is to win the case, Protagoras would still be paid as per the original contract since Euathlus would have won his first case. However, Euathlus had a different claim, that if he wins, then he would not have to pay Protagoras, as per the court\u2019s decision. And if Protagoras is to win, then Euathlus would still not have won a case and would therefore not be obliged to pay. The question is: which of the two men is right? The Ship of TheseusIt is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object. Imagine there was a ship, called the Ship of Theseus. The ship was on a journey to travel around the world starting from Athens. As the voyage progressed, the ship needed repairs and replacements. At every stop damaged or worn out parts of the ship was replaced one at a time, in such a way that when the ship returned to Athens, every single part of the ship was replaced. Now that the ship had been restored by replacing every single part, is this the same ship? The Boy-Girl ParadoxA family has two children and we are being told that one of them is a boy. In that case, what is the probability that the other child is a boy as well? Yes, we all will rush to the answer that 1/2 is the probability of the other child being a boy. However, according to the probability theory, in the two child family, there can be four possible combinations of children. These are two boys (BB), two girls (GG), first one boy and second one girl (BG), and first one girl and second one boy (GB). Since we already know that one of them is boy, we can eliminate one of the combinations, which is GG or the case of having two girls, and we are left with three possible combinations. This means the probability that the other child is a boy is 1/3 and not 1/2. Source: Five Paradoxes That Will Definitely Blow Your Mind ",
