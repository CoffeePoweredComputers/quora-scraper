            "answer_text": "Wow big question. Let me preface by saying, I'm not a counselor, nor do I play one on the internet.  If it's you or someone you know, get/encourage professional help.  If the person with the trauma is more of the \"diy\", never asks for help kind of person, consider giving them \"On Killing\" by Lt. Col. Grossman.  Grossman has made his career off of both studying and counseling many vets with PTSD (after serving as a ranger himself--if I remember right).  The book gives a powerful perspective into a place very few of us ever go to.  Lot of guys find it comforting to see that they are normal after all, just forced into an abnormal situation.  That book can be super helpful towards that end and it's packed with stories from plenty of vets in exactly the situation you describe, and worse. The emotions of killingFrom that book, we know that there is a common and repeatable series of emotions someone goes through after a kill.  Memory is fuzzy and I'm too busy to check, but it's something like 1. indignation at being attacked usually, 2. shock at how fast it happens, 3. satisfaction, or even joy that you won (your training was effective and paid off), 4. guilt about that satisfaction because you just killed someone, 5 ... typically exhaustion, sometimes nausea, this is often because of the adrenaline wearing off.   Very often, there can even be feelings of guilt, because you don't feel guilty.  Nobody ever said we're logical, but we are certainly predictably irrational.   In your situation, accidentally killing innocents would probably cause a very high level of instant guilt, shame, and questioning.  \"Am I a bad person?  Clearly I must be with what I did ... How can I look my family in the eye ever again?\"   A bit about trauma ... Now with particularly traumatic events, things get set as triggers.  It's normal and often was a survival function (if our ancestors survive a tiger attack and start being hyper sensitive to stripes in the jungle--that could save them in the future) but sometimes it can hinder us if it's a disorder*.   Your brain will craft grooves in it so if any of those triggers appears, you can't help but fall into one of those grooves.   Imagine there's a field in your mind, you walk across it everyday, it's a necessary part of life, and things you do often get paths worn into them just because you do them so often.   Now something traumatic happens and an entire canyon instantly appears.  You still have to get across the field, but now it's hard to avoid the canyon because it takes up so much of your mental field.   Every time you step into that canyon, you start tumbling down through all the emotions, flashbacks, memories, and especially guilt.  Then you have to begin a long climb out of that canyon all over again.   The triggers that start you falling into that canyon can be anything--often things you never noticed before.  Scents, colors, sounds ...  That's what living with a trauma can be like.   Trauma Therapy 101stopping the trauma spiralThe common path for therapy focuses on disarming those triggers, helping you not to stumble into your canyon of trauma (keeping with the metaphor) and maybe even building structures over it so you don't have to take a tumble into your canyon of guilt / trauma so often.   This is the reverse of operant conditioning and training.  You need to start going to the triggers intentionally with nothing bad happening (this is why professional help is recommended, it's also a little like overcoming phobias).  This is why I've heard of marines that love air soft.  It's a full on battle, with a hyper realistic gun and enemies ... but nobody dies and the worst injuries tend to be scrapes and bumps.  It's helping some of them get rid of their personal triggers.   handling guiltThen, of course, it helps to talk about it.  There's a power in simply telling and talking about it, bouncing it off of someone.  Guilt shared is guilt halved.  This is also why a lot of vets form talking groups, so they can talk about their experiences and get perspective from people like them, with shared experiences.   Of course, counseling is probably the best option, and any competent counselor will know of these strategies and dozens of more, but that's a few of the basics to help you understand.   \"How many learn to cope?\"Unsure, not my field, but I imagine those who ask for help often make full recoveries.  One of my students had PTSD but made a full, and frankly, heroic recovery thanks to counseling and--minorly, my training.  No other experience with it in my life. \"How is it complicated if the soldier feels he was negligent or careless ...\"Again, not an expert, but this would likely intensify the guilt and shame, making it that much harder to talk about.  Feelings of isolation too would be rampant.  Professional counseling would be paramount.   Extra nerd stuff*I always found it really useful to know what classes as a disorder and what doesn't.  Does this behavior / experience cause \"impairment, distress, or disability\"?  Then you might want some counseling and some help.   A bit deeper is the 4 D's of disorder but this leaves a few grey areas so I don't like it as much.  A Disorder has to be:    ->Deviant (basically not normal in society)    ->Distressing (negative feelings in you personally)    ->Dysfunctional (keeps you from being able to do your normal, daily activities like getting ready for work, keeping friendships, etc)      ->Dangerous (to yourself or to others)   See the murkiness of the 4D's?  \"Well it's distressing but I don't want to kill myself and I can still work if I cry in the morning first ... is that a disorder?\"  In short, if you think you need help, go get help.  The \"impair, distress, or disability\" just helps to convince people that it's okay to get help--and it is. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm unable to answer this question personally, however, I did recently have a conversation with a Vietnam Vet who was in this situation. He said the situation was this: He was in a tunnel, almost pitch black with one other person behind him and a pistol in hand. He advanced slowly up the tunnel, looking for enemy, booby traps and caches. Upon hearing something he stopped and listened, realising that someone unknown was in front of him in the darkness, he pointed his weapon in front of him and noticed a pistol pointed directly back at him. In this instant he claims he saw the pistol and a finger frantically attempting to pull the trigger (which was later found to be seized with rust). He immediately fired his pistol, emptying the whole magazine. After the situation had settled he discovered it was a young boy. He had severe PTSD and seemed awfully disgusted in the situation that resulted in the death of the young boy. He also seemed to attribute his PTSD more to another specific event than the one mentioned above. I can only guess but it seemed that, while he was horrified about killing the boy, he acknowledged that the horrible situation was more to blame than himself. I don't know how long it took him to accept this, or whether he really has or not. I wish I could better answer this question, thanks for the a2a. ",

            "answer_text": "Since I was a2a, there would be a range of reactions, dependent on the psychological state of the individual. The degree of psychopathy would have an effect, in that remorse and personal guilt would lessened, if not eliminated. And, lack of psychopathic tendency would increase the potential for Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome; which could range from mild to the level of a disabling disorder.If there is a belief that personal negligence was involved, the likelihood of PTSD increases. Psychological counseling could allow an individual to reconcile personal responsibility with situational circumstances beyond their control.Henderson and Simon [Crimes of the criminal justice system (1994)] indicated that Alienation Theory on a micro level includes a defense mechanism to internal and external stressors, through dehumanizing members of an \u201cout-group.\u201d This reduces internal conflict when oppressing members of the out-group. \u201cIn-group\u201d refers to any group an individual identifies with, as opposed to an out-group, a significantly distinct group with which an individual has no affiliation. Group-think leads to positive group identification and cohesion, and may also lead to poor decision making, due to belief in group morality, illusion of invulnerability, illusion of unanimity, intimidation of dissent, self-censorship, diffusion of responsibility, collective rationalization, and poor risk assessment [Myers, D. G. (2012). Social psychology (11th ed.)]. The two types of dehumanization are self-directed, which mutes emotion, and leads to adherence to bureaucratic demands (as seen in well-documented research of Zimbardo and Milgram); and, object-directed, characterized by negative labeling and stereotyping, as self-protection against guilt and shame.

I personally do not know a vet that is not dealing with depression, alcoholism, addiction, simply straight out PTSD. I'm sure killing a civilian by accident stays with them and I'm sure they replay over and over again in their heads and they have to push to stay mentally strong until they can forgive themselves if ever. I couldn't even begin to judge considering the danger and quick judgements they have to make in split second.  A brave and yet heartbreaking job. ",
