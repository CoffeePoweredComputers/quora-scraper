            "answer_text": "I'm largely ignorant about Neuroscience. However, I will say that scientists will NEVER figure out the mystery of consciousness. Subjective consciousness is immaterial, and the scientific method can only measure what can be observed.  Neuro-chemical brain activity can show what is happening, but will never be able to show what it is like for that something to happen.  This limitation and realization can turn atheist into believers. Here are a couple quotes where this limitation is admitted. Christof Koch states that subjective conscious experience has \u201cdaunted the scientific method\u201d (Koch 2012, 23-24). Revonsuo argues that materialism will never be able to address subjective consciousness, and even if we were to be given the correct theory it \u201cwould equal what hamsters could make of Charles Darwin\u2019s Origins of Species if a copy was placed in their cage.\u201d(Revonsuo 2010, 30) This shows that the challenge mentioned in the Qur'an over 1400 years ago still has not been solved. \"They ask you [O Muhammad (saws] concerning the Ruh (Soul/consciousness). Say: 'It is one of the things, the knowledge of which is only with my Lord. And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given very little.\" [Qur'an Al-Israa 17:85] ",

            "answer_text": "On the whole, I think most neuroscientists accept that consciousness arises from neural activity in some way. Beyond that, things either aren't discussed much or there are some disagreements. For example, some neuroscientists have put forth theories of consciousness (Cristof Koch, Michael Graziano, Mike Shadlen, etc), but these theories tend to address different aspects of the problem of consciousness or in some way deny consciousness altogether. Ultimately though, it may surprise people to find out how little most neuroscientists talk (especially openly) about consciousness.  ",
