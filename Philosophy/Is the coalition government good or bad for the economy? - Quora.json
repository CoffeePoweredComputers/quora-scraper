            "answer_text": "Coalition Govt is an absolute necessity for the survival of democracy and healthy economy. We have increased GDP and economic growth during UPA alliance whereas we are practically watching the scenario of reduced GDP and stunted economic growth under a so-called strong government led by Narendra Modi. Also, people get much benefit from coalition govt because when coalition govt plans to increase some charges or taxes or fares, the alliance parties oppose them. Out of the fear of loosing support, ruling party reverts its numerous anti-people decisions. ",

            "answer_text": "Good for economy as far as past experience is concerned. 1990 to 2014 were good years for economy and there were coalition government or weak governments. In 2014 congress got better mandate and they started feeling invincible and they did not produce good results. But better that BJP government of last five and half years. ",
