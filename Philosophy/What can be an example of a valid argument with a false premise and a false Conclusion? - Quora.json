            "answer_text": "If you mean a conditional argument of the form P => Q then any two false statements can be said to have that form even if they are unrelated. You may have heard people say, \u201cIF <premise> THEN I am a monkey\u2019s uncle\u201d. This is sound logic even though the conclusion is necessarily false (unless the premise is found to be actually true). Even statements that are obviously unrelated qualify. For example: \u201cIF Isaac Newton is alive today THEN Hillary Clinton is the current US President\u201d. This might appear to be a ridiculous statement since there is no known connection between Isaac Newton and Hillary Clinton but in a conditional statement, if the premise is false then the conclusion can be true or false so this statement qualifies as a conditional statement. Also, the premise will never be true so we can\u2019t prove that the conditional statement isn\u2019t true meaning that we can\u2019t prove that there is no connection between these two people. Although not required by the rules of logic, some may insist that the conditional statement be demonstrably true even if the premise and the conclusion are always false before we can give it the form P => Q. That is no problem: \u201cIF the moon is made out of cheese THEN the moon is edible\u201d. ",
