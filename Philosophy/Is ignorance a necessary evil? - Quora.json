            "answer_text": "I hate to shoot down your question like this, but there\u2019s one flaw which I have to point out (Actually, I love shooting down questions, it\u2019s the best part of Quora). Ignorance in itself is a relative term. At NASA, not knowing the quadratic formula would be considered ignorance, if not insanity. In a kindergarten classroom on the other hand, not knowing the quadratic formula would most likely be normal! Now that that\u2019s done, I\u2019ll stop bugging you about a 5 word question, and I\u2019ll get on with the answer. In my opinion, ignorance isn\u2019t necessary, but rather impossible to avoid. No matter how you go about, there will always be people who know more, and there will always be people who know less. This isn\u2019t always a bad thing, especially if you\u2019re one of the people who knows more! After all, we do need someone to work he register at Walmart, and someone to flip the patties at McDonald\u2019s! If that person knew as much as a NASA scientist, I have my doubts he would still be doing that job. Through these points, I can derive the conclusion, that although ignorance isn\u2019t necessary, it is still always going to be present, thus why don\u2019t we make the best of it, and actually profit from its existence! TL;DR - I like my Big Macs, and ignorance makes them possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Ignorance is not necessarily evil, although evil acts may come out of ignorance. Ignorance has two levels. One level simply refers to the uninformed or uneducated. The other level is a dense stubborn mind set that is incapable or unwilling to change even in the light of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. This is called cognitive dissonance. This is part of, or closely related to, the mechanisms allowing people to believe in a lie. It has been suggested that when you tell a lie as little as three times it becomes a truth. Also related, is the failure to remember the source of the lie. When the source can no longer be recalled, the lie more easily becomes truth. Apply these possibilities to the development of cognitive dissonance. Define evil as: That which needlessly seeks to eliminate life, liveliness, or the ability to thrive on a personal, structuctural or an ecological level. Because the lie was intentionality passed along to begin with, the subsequent cognitive dissonance would be evil if it fills the requirements to eliminate life, liveliness, or ability to thrive. Ignorance, in this case, would be classified as evil but not necessary. ",
