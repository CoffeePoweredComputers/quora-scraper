            "answer_text": "I believe that you have to see both sides of that question. Be idealistic in what you want in life but also realise that there\u2019s pain and tragedy in life, it could hit you at any point in life and you need to be prepared for when worse comes to worse. For example, for many reasons why there are homeless people are because of the trauma experienced in childhood, the wrong people they trusted and the mental illness developed from those adverse circumstances. Imagine how you would view the world if you had something traumatic occur in addition to being homeless? You would definitely be messed by the world you live in but I can\u2019t speak for that community as I have been very fortunate to experience homelessness (this is just an example). You need to realise that yes, life can be unfair but it can be filled with many beautiful things like love, you just can\u2019t have the mentality of \u2018we all will be dead\u2019 because then you\u2019re just not listening to yourself and just following some stupid idea that in turn will eventually ruin your life. Sorry I went off on a bit of a tangent there, so to answer your question, I think you can\u2019t see the nice things in life and say \u2018people are all nice\u2019, no they are not! If you saw what things they can do yes, they have the ability to cause extreme suffering but at the same time, you can\u2019t view all as malevolent because as humans, we want to be trusted by other people and that\u2019s why we go into relationships and friendships seeking that special bond and that\u2019s where you have to view both sides of the story.

            "answer_text": "The fact of the matter is in reality we have good and evil, the dark and light side. Beautiful and amazingly experiences. But we also have negative experiences. There's no way that we will or can see good in bad no matter how hard we try. Yes for a few days maybe? That's why  Its important to know that without Jesus Christ we will never be able to cope. It's only when you have Him as your Lord and Savior that we are able to see nature, and people with His eyes. Yes we do have the good the bad and the ugly\ud83d\ude10 But our opinions about it all changed dramatically. Lovies ",
