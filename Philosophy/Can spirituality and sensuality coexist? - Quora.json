            "answer_text": "Yes. The CS Lewis quote from the Weight of Glory recognizes this to be true: \u2026it would seem that Our Lord finds our desires not too strong, but too weak. We are half-hearted creatures, fooling about with drink and sex and ambition when infinite joy is offered us, like an ignorant child who wants to go on making mud pies in a slum because he cannot imagine what is meant by the offer of a holiday at the sea. We are far too easily pleased. (26) Thats a quote you can mentally wrestle with and reflect on for quite some time. And, the key aspect of sensuality that Christianity speaks to is the issue of commitment. Commitment points to a deeper issue in the ethical life and in the life of wisdom which our modern life unfortunately neglects. The larger emphasis on the importance of commitment in terms of living great lives is echoed in David Brook\u2019s commencement speech at Dartmouth:  This spoken word speaks to the larger issue of Our Counterfeit Gods:  It goes a second step. Any understanding of the message of the Bible that doesn\u2019t include the cross is missing its key central piece\u2014its literally and figuratively missing the very heart of the message. All of this points to the question of the cross. Humans are imperfect. Humans can find freedom in Christ\u2014freedom from sin, freedom from idolatry, freedom from addiction in Christ and Christ alone. ",

            "answer_text": "Can spirituality and sensuality coexist? Yes, of course.   All of life is spiritual. You do not have a separate \u201cspiritual life\u201d and a separate \u201cmaterial life\u201d. You have One Life. There is only One Life\u2026and that Life is Spiritual.  (Just bear in mind that the senses do not always witness to Truth as it is. It witnesses to Truth as you want it to be).  You are a spiritual person. You are a beacon. Your light shines on this world and serves as a beacon for others to find their way. You love deeply, and are dearly loved. As your presence is experienced as a blessing for countless others, so too would your absence be missed quite significantly. We can experience the blessing that is you \u2026 because of sex.   Truth is very simple.  The only reason something might appear as complex, is because it is trying to hide something. Usually, it is trying to hide the fact that its foundation is not as solid as it is made to be. It is thus when layers and layers of BS is spiraled around it. The glue used to bond these layers together being distractions.  This is what is referred to as illusions (or temptations as in the \u201cOur Father\u201d prayer). But, Truth itself is by nature very simple. It\u2019s nature of course being\u2026there is nothing to hide.  There are many various different techniques to get to Truth in \u201cspiritual development\u201d. Unfortunately, we tend to so often get caught up with \u201cform\u201d over \u201cfunction\u201d (another distraction). Of these, just questioning in itself is an often overlooked, but very efficient techniques to arrive at Truth. (By this, I mean\u2026question everything). Two of these approaches are: Removing the layers to get to the core[1]Apply \u201cdirect approaches\u201d(Applying direct approaches to questioning is often not a very popular approach as it tends to make one feel and be perceived as \u201cnegative\u201d\u2026due to the tendency to call BS directly for what it is)[2] With regards to this question on \u201ccan spirituality and sensuality coexist\u201d, an example of a direct question would be: Was the world created for our rejection or for our enjoyment?(Bear in mind that the answer to this testifies of your judgement of the \u201ccompetency\u201d of its \u201cCreator\u201d) When one undergoes \u201cspiritual discovery\u201d, you in essence seek\u2026 \u201cto meet with the Divine\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Since both spirituality and sensuality exist it's not a question of if they can coexist but how. All possibilities exist. All possibilities coexist. All possibilities arise as opposites. No possibility can arise without its opposite. Yin cannot arise without yang. Matter cannot arise without antimatter. Something cannot arise without nothing. \"The opposites, while separate in reality are together in their possibility.\" (Aristotle). So the question is, How do opposites coexist? The ancient Greeks called this coexistence, Adikia which roughly translates as the war of the opposites. Alchemists saw it as a ceaseless re-balancing signified by Libra's uneven scales. The I Ching sees the opposites switching sides. This is signified by the solid line becoming the broken line and vice versa. In my opinion these are all primitive accommodations. Eventually the opposites evolve into the enlightened coexistence known as Democracy. This is not an offhand metaphor. The founders of the United States were enlightened. Even the name they gave this country, \u201cUnited States,\u201d proclaims this. In a democracy the opposites, thesis and antithesis, work together to form a synthesis. God is a democratic synthesis of all possible opposites. God is both spiritual and sensual. The synthesis of the opposites is intensely sensual for God just as democratic governance is for its citizens. In Hinduism this Godly union of spirituality and sensuality is called Yab Yum.  ",

            "answer_text": "Spirituality concerns aspects of the spirit and the process of evolving to higher spiritual awareness. Sensuality is that which appeals to the senses. When any spirit incorporates into any physical organism, it acquires sensuality. They not only can co-exist, but must. For only thru sensuality can spirit appreciate any incorporation. The real issue here is to attain balance and not allow sensuality to become addictive and thus blind the spirit to avenues of higher vibrational awareness. Not easy to do as sensual pleasure is extremely addictive. However, it also comes with a higher cost of pain as well. Moderation is the best path to follow in binding together the co-existence of spirit and sensuality. ",

            "answer_text": "Most definitely! I\u2019m 20 years old (so a college student). I have no shortage of wild weekends, and yet, I\u2019m living in the spiritual 24/7. Do not think of the spiritual as separate from the sensual. Think of them like Russain Nesting Dolls in which spirituality is the bigger doll that contains the smaller doll of sensuality within it. In other words, experiencing sensuality doesn\u2019t mean you have to sacrifice spiritual experience. If you reach a high enough level of spirituality, you see the depth and meaning of the Universe in the most mundane things (even trash laying out on the street and the very rocks beneath your feet). With that said, I have never lost touch with the spiritual, even while partying. Now like I said, this takes a high level of spirituality to achieve (the past 9 years of my life has been continuous spiritual experiences one after the other and yet they\u2019re all blended into one \u201cinstant\u201d). So for people who are starting out, they may find it beneficial to focus more on spirituality than on sensuality. At least until they attain a level of focus where attention to one can be included within attention to the other, like the Russian Nesting Dolls. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the most powerful ways to experience your spiritual essence is through delving deeply into the feelings provided by the senses. Whether it be pleasure or pain, the senses are an avenue to feel the self. Just as releasing a current understanding to a deeper contemplation can expand your awareness, giving your all to a particular sensation will open up a universe of space and bliss. An obvious example would be the how the small self is lost at the height of sensual pleasure. At climax, there is no me, there is only the feeling of blissful being, enjoyed by the body, experienced in the mind. Another example is the feeling that a song can give, when you totally lose yourself in it. For me it is listening to Pat Metheny\u2019s soaring guitar that transports me beyond the body, or dancing to certain dance/house songs where I lose the sensation of having a body, and become just free beingness. When spirituality can be seen to thrive beyond the confines of sitting in meditation and other traditional settings, it expands, and the goal can be experienced in any sensual activity. Then you are really in tune with and expressing the inner being we all share. ",

            "answer_text": "Basically, consciousness just is. It cannot even be labelled by the words we give to things in this third dimension. Labels, genders, descriptions, all of these are just thoughts. That's not to say they aren\u2019t necessary for the third dimension. The physical body needs some gender in order for the continuation of life on earth. It is also a dualistic world. One thing cannot exist without it's opposite. No thing can be without space yet space is nothing. Ask yourself, \u201cWho am I?\u201d and there shouldn't be an answer. I find this to be a handy exercise as I can experience my true self, infinite awareness if I had to label it. It's too difficult to put into words, it just is. That is all. I Am that I Am. I Am that awareness. And so, gender is necessary for reproduction and for the experience of duality, but ultimately does not exist. Duality can be transcended. That's one of the next steps for humanity. ",
