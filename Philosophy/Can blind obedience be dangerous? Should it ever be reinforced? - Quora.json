            "answer_text": "There are a lot of parents out there who expect blind obedience from their children, justifying themselves on not-so-good examples of parental guides such as the Bible, the military methods and books of horrible people as in the author of \"To train up a child\". They preach that blind obedience is just what they need so raising a child won't be so troublesome. News here: raising a child IS troublesome, because you're raising a human being, helping them discover who they are, contributing build up their personality, teaching them about life and sharing a moral code that they will conclude by themselves. Teaching blind obedience is dangerous at best,because you're teaching them that they are not important, their opinions, their wishes and their own search for wellbeing, and what they should be doing is trying to please you no matter what you ask for them (that is why it's called \"Blind Obedience\" because parent expect obedience in what they say NO MATTER WHAT) Raising a child means teaching them to think for themselves, and when they make a mistake taking the time to explain why it was not the correct thing to do or to say, making them think of different ways, alternatives. Blind education sets them in a mind set where they think that what they wish to do is second, and puts them at the level of animal you can train. Our brains and minds are something so distinctive of our species, we should not make our children think it's worth less. Obedience is important, yes, because they're still too young to totally know what's best for them, but blind obedience is dangerous, because it puts them in second place on their own life and deprive them from their sense of identity and self management. (Blind obedience is seen in this context as the parents \"training\" (so to say) a child to do whatever they say without question, all the time, not to the response in situations of emergency) ",

            "answer_text": "Is being enforce on me. One of the reasons I am hated by the United States security apparatus is because I question what they understand is an authority someone superior to me. They want to make me feel regret because I question an authority as they see it and I did not follow instructions with blind obedience. The United States security apparatus is clear if I develop blind obedience to authority and follow orders I would have never been in the situation I am in and die. The bariatric surgeon in august 2017 in the second visit say it to me, that I am in my situation because I did not obey my mother. He say this because the police told him to say it. The bariatric surgeon explain to me the why and what I have meanwhile my mother just say this is good because I say so and this is bad because I say so. The vast majority of orders that my mother gave me were bad for me (they were part of the harassment the police ask my mother to do as part of my neutralization process and to motivate me to fall to police entrapments) but a few were good, in the eyes of the security apparatus that\u2019s irrelevant I must obey with blind obedience and that my mother do not have to explain me why. The United States Security apparatus understand that someone must obey the orders of a superior as they perceive it with blind obedience, failure to do so result in a state of rage inside the security apparatus, how dare him to ask why, how dare him to question and not obeying. The United States Security Apparatus use cointelpro too to promote blind obedience to authority and punish with those who fail at this task with death. My first visit to the bariatric surgeon he told me this: I have full blown diabetes and is destroying my body. Nobody told me this, they told me that I have pre-diabetes and that the spots I have on my skin happen to everyone nothing to worry about, here take some cream! (they did this because the security apparatus told them to do so)My blood pressure is extremely high. Everybody told me that a 140 blood pressure was high but inside the parameters nothing to worry about! (they did this because the security apparatus told them to do so)That the protein out of my kidneys was extremely high and that my kidneys have to be monitor. Everybody else say that it was high but nothing to worry about and that\u2019s was at the end meanwhile they told me that there are just traces of protein. (they did this because the security apparatus told them to do so)When my bariatric surgeon told me all this my mother went into a rage and start yelling at the bariatric surgeon signaling the Vitamin B12 bottle color black and red. The bariatric surgeon understood the message and from that moment on each time I talk to him he start coughing and when the bariatric surgeon start coughing each time I talk to him my mother understood that he understood and she calm down. My mother knew for a long time because the police explain everything to her everything the bariatric surgeon was telling me but she never say it to me because her as the police understand that they are the authority and I must obey with blind obedience everything they say to me and that they do not have to explain to me why like the bariatric surgeon did that day. If I obey with blind obedience my mother I would have finish in jail (she was helping the police entrap me like many others were doing too, so I finish in jail) and I would have lose weight the bad way (malnutrition) as I was constantly harrass at the kitchen. A lot of people say that I could have put a kitchen in my room and that\u2019s no excuse. After the visit to the bariatric surgeon my mother celebrate calling her brother Tito and saying laughing that life is so short! refering to me and the fact that no medicine doctor will treat me after witnessing the reaction of the bariatric surgeon after she show him the B12 bottle with the color black and red. My mother got scare after she saw me distress because of my kidney situation and call her brother Tito to defend her fearing that I will physically assault her. I did not threaten or show any sign of anger I just cry and show distress but she interpret that as a sign that I will physically assault her. The police appear then showing me their guns using plausible deniability (they are just making a traffic stop or they are just checking this or that) in the street but making sure I always saw their guns as a warning that if I physically assault my parent because of my kidney situation they will shoot to kill. This is because my mother express her concern to the police. I was walking in the beach in 2017 and out of the sudden I just seat and start crying and people call the police and the police circle me like if I am about to do some terrorist attack. Basically they associate my crying and distress in 2017 with me committing assault, battery, murder and/or terrorism (the story of my life as people always have the tendency to believe I am about to commit any crime known to humanity and even the ones not created yet).

            "answer_text": "Blind obedience is what causes cults such Scientology to exist and the Jonestown Massacre to occur. Those are two examples where it has been VERY DANGEROUS. It should not be encouraged let alone enforced. Even in the military, if given an Order and the order is Illegal under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, you must refuse it. But if it is a valid order and you \"choose\" to ignore it, it can be seen as \"Cowardice Under Fire\" or at least \"Failure to Obey a Lawful Command\" which has its penalties. So there is a difference between \"Obedience\" and \"Blind Obedience\" even if the person who is supposed to \"Obey\" does not have all the facts (a person in Command does not need to \"explain\" an order).
