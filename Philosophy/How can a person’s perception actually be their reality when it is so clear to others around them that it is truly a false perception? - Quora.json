            "answer_text": "People can perceive the same thing quite differently, such as witnesses at a traffic incident, views on a political candidate, or views on any controversial subject. Maybe how we perceive ourselves - and how others perceive us - is more controversial than we thought?! We had just assumed the views were more or less congruent \u2014 well maybe not? Things might be worse than we thought. Or better than we thought. The problem may be something that should be there but isn\u2019t. Or with something that shouldn\u2019t be there that is there. The problem may be with the person who is being perceived by others. But the problem could be with the onlookers. Or some of both. Or neither. We have to \u201cconsider the source\u201d of the comments, whether they might be prejudiced or have hidden agendas to make us feel good or bad about ourselves. People\u2019s perception of self (or others) is colored by FILTERS of past experience and life conditioning, including traumas, hopes and fears, positive or negative attitudes, biases of attention, prejudices, absence of relevant past experience, failure to check their appearance from all angles in a mirror and in different lighting, failure to get a wide variety of feedback in life, etc. On the other hand, it\u2019s OK to be different, unless it\u2019s an \u201cemperor has no clothes\u201d situation. In the case of absence of relevant experience, a person doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re missing, and doesn\u2019t even know that they\u2019re missing something. Introverts, people who don\u2019t speak up and share authentically, but instead withhold or hide within themselves, may be misunderstood since what others see for good or ill on the outside may not be what\u2019s going on for the person inside. People who are arrogant or overconfident usually don\u2019t perceive this about themselves, but it\u2019s obvious to others who may be offended by those attitudes and behaviors. Arrogance can be the flip-side of shyness, an overcompensation for shyness or feeling like they\u2019re not enough just as they are. The incongruity can be so severe that no one wants to talk about it. The topic becomes the elephant in the room, an \u201cundiscussable.\u201d As the therapists say,,\u201dWhat\u2019s not being talked about is running everything.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The phrase \u201cperception is reality,\u201d suggests that the way we look at things, what we see, & therefore the beliefs about what we perceive all come together to for our reality. If someone is hallucinating & they believe what they see to be real, whether it is or not, to them this is their reality. It's what they believe to be real and therefore is part of the basis for how they'll behaviour/think while the perception exsists. For instance if someone is hungry and there's one of their favourite foods in front of them, they'll be compelled to eat the food. This is so we can interact with our environment/situation in an effective way, and progress through life. In particular, if you meant hallucinating when you said \u201cfalse perception\u201d than you need to realize/consider a key aspect of what it feels like to hallucinate (which we all are when we dream), which is most people don't know their hallucinating(dreaming) when their hallucinating. This means they believe the false perception is real no matter what other people say, because that's how most people dream. This occurs more so when someone is hallucinating while awke, because they don't expect to be dreaming while their awake. Some people have the ability known as lucid dreaming, which means their aware their dreaming/hallucinating, this usually occurs when something impossible happens in their dreams, prevoking the idea their hallucinating. However, for people suffering from psychotic disorders, this rarely happens. Therefore since they believe their hallucinations to be real they'll act like it's real, which is why people with those disorders are so irrational while expericing these perceptions, and hard to convince that their hallucinating.

            "answer_text": "The question is, \u201cHow can a person\u2019s perception actually be their reality when it is so clear to others around them that it is truly a false perception?\u201d To quote the poet Robert Burns, O wad some Power the giftie gie usTo see oursels as ithers see us! \u2014To a Louse: On Seeing One On A Lady's Bonnet, At Church For each one of us, the one thing we know for certain is that we exist, think, and perceive. Thus, our own perception is, naively, our reality. That is the condition of the newborn. As we grow up, we begin to understand that there is some sort of external reality that feeds us milk, changes our diapers, picks us up, puts us in bed, and so on. To express this at greater length, We asserted earlier that there is at least one absolute existential truth: one\u2019s own existence. We said further that the proof of this is one\u2019s consciousness. But what is the nature of that existence? Most of us believe that existence extends beyond our own consciousness. Indeed, the modern western reader may object, \u201cWe all know that physical existence is the true reality, and consciousness a product of it.\u201d Let us consider that notion, starting from the only truth of which we can be absolutely certain: our own existence. Why do we accept that physical existence is a reality at all, let alone the true or primary reality? The answer is not difficult: if I try to act as though my consciousness is the only reality, I get bad results. Contrast, for example, the dream (or daydream), in which I am able to fly, against the waking result of flapping my arms and jumping. Even if nobody else is present to give me feedback, I perceive that there is some external reality that is different in the waking state than in the dream state. From infancy on, we progressively learn the nature and boundaries of a personal realm and a shared realm. Through direct experience, observation, discussion, and reading, we find that this view is shared by others, and we come to accept the existence of a physical realm as a truth about reality. The existence of a physical realm does not by any means prove, however, that consciousness is a product of physical existence. All it proves is that reality is larger than our own personal existence (consciousness). It does not provide any clue as to the true nature of our personal existence or of physical existence, or to whether physical existence is a cause of consciousness, a result of consciousness, or neither. The nature of reality and its relationship to consciousness are among the existential questions that will be addressed later. For the moment, we wish simply to emphasize that materialism\u2014that is, the currently dominant conception of reality as primarily physical, with all other aspects of reality being by-products of physical existence\u2014is simply a conception, a set of beliefs, which, like all beliefs, should be examined carefully in our search for truth. Materialism, like Newtonian physics, may turn out to be a very useful approximation to reality when applied to the proper domain, but inappropriate and inaccurate in other domains. \u2014Truth: A Path for the Skeptic, Reality. Here is one description of our true reality: Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is a direct evidence of the revelation within it of the attributes and names of God\u2026. To a supreme degree is this true of man, who, among all created things, hath been invested with the robe of such gifts, and hath been singled out for the glory of such distinction. For in him are potentially revealed all the attributes and names of God to a degree that no other created being hath excelled or surpassed. All these names and attributes are applicable to him. Even as He hath said: \u201cMan is My mystery, and I am his mystery.\u201d Manifold are the verses that have been repeatedly revealed in all the Heavenly Books and the Holy Scriptures, expressive of this most subtle and lofty theme. Even as He hath revealed: \u201cWe will surely show them Our signs in the world and within themselves.\u201d Again He saith: \u201cAnd also in your own selves: will ye not, then, behold the signs of God?\u201d And yet again He revealeth: \u201cAnd be ye not like those who forget God, and whom He hath therefore caused to forget their own selves.\u201d In this connection, He Who is the eternal King\u2014may the souls of all that dwell within the mystic Tabernacle be a sacrifice unto Him\u2014hath spoken: \u201cHe hath known God who hath known himself.\u201d \u2014Gleanings from the Writings of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, number XC. In brief, our true reality is such that if we truly knew that reality, we would know God! Therefore, if our perceptions were finely tuned, they really would be our reality. Unfortunately, that is not how we generally orient ourselves, and so, we have distorted perceptions, both of ourselves and of those around us. The best we can do is to look to improve our own character, while overlooking what we perceive to be faults in those around us. O Emigrants! The tongue I have designed for the mention of Me, defile it not with detraction. If the fire of self overcome you, remember your own faults and not the faults of My creatures, inasmuch as every one of you knoweth his own self better than he knoweth others. \u2014The Hidden Words, Persian #66. Here is advice from one who spent much of his life in exile and prison for his religious beliefs: Soon will your swiftly passing days be over, and the fame and riches, the comforts, the joys provided by this rubbish-heap, the world, will be gone without a trace. Summon ye, then, the people to God, and invite humanity to follow the example of the Company on high. Be ye loving fathers to the orphan, and a refuge to the helpless, and a treasury for the poor, and a cure for the ailing. Be ye the helpers of every victim of oppression, the patrons of the disadvantaged. Think ye at all times of rendering some service to every member of the human race. Pay ye no heed to aversion and rejection, to disdain, hostility, injustice: act ye in the opposite way. Be ye sincerely kind, not in appearance only. Let each one of God\u2019s loved ones center his attention on this: to be the Lord\u2019s mercy to man; to be the Lord\u2019s grace. Let him do some good to every person whose path he crosseth, and be of some benefit to him. Let him improve the character of each and all, and reorient the minds of men. In this way, the light of divine guidance will shine forth, and the blessings of God will cradle all mankind: for love is light, no matter in what abode it dwelleth; and hate is darkness, no matter where it may make its nest. O friends of God! That the hidden Mystery may stand revealed, and the secret essence of all things may be disclosed, strive ye to banish that darkness for ever and ever. \u2014Selections from the Writings of \u2018Abdu\u2019l\u2011Bah\u00e1, Selection 1.

            "answer_text": "Perception, is so ambiguous because the mind is also just as complex as perception as one cannot exist without the other. Each complexity is different for each person; I could view power to be something else entirely. For example you could perceive power to be \u201csaving one\u2019s allies\u201d whereas I\u2019d see it as the ability to re-shape the whole world and never stop evolving, near perfection until absolute perfection. Neither of those views are wrong per say; both are power but which is power to you is what matters. If you\u2019re asking how can people believe in false pretenses\u2019s that they believe are a true \u201cvision\u201d or some righteous road but in reality it\u2019s clear to those that, the road is a dark one. Well the answer to that is much more simple, no matter someone\u2019s level of perception it can always get misconstrued or twisted even by themselves and that is usually caused by a breakdown of sorts. I can admit my nature before things happened to me wasn\u2019t what you\u2019re reading. I decided after a long life of realizing humanity's stupidity for what it is; sheer ignorance. So even as of today I seek the \u201cPower\u201d I stated, for my evolution will be much better than others. Now as you can clearly see I am damaged as well; but in order to understand this world and human beings; to understand what we normally cannot we need to bare the pain. What I suggest you do is try and point out the better path for you\u2019re friend, otherwise that friend will follow a dark path, like I did because I had/have no one. ",

If you subscribe to he notion that a person has a particular perception of the world that becomes \u201creal\u201d to them, that\u2019s also fine. And it explains a lot of how to deal with folks\u2019 opinions and reactions. However, if a person\u2019s reality is that the really, really, really know they can fly, their perception will likely be irrelevant as soon as it contacts the ground. The basic idea is one of context. Many people seem to claim that \u201ctheir reality\u201d is something that the rest of the world simply has to accept as valid. But that\u2019s 1) not likely to persuade people who they\u2019re trying to persuade, and 2) not something many of us, such as myself, give a rat\u2019s $#*(#$* about. We may know someone is very committed to a certain view and how it affects them, but there are other people in the world. As far as I know, there are quite a few of them, and their priorities are not necessarily subject to one person\u2019s \u201cpersonal truth\u201d. Which can result in problems for that one person. ",

Anybody\u2019s perception isn\u2019t infinite. It doesn\u2019t reveal complete reality, nor it is meant for that. A perception depicts a search for the relevance. Just as you pick up a coin from within a lump of garbage, a perception is a pick, not an unlimited involvement. So, a perception reveals partial reality, however small or large it may be. A perception is currently the handle of reality, because of its \u201crelevance\u201d. The reality, however large it may be, offers itself to be handled through the perceived point. Perception of partial reality has been often wrongly described as \u201cfalse perception\u201d. It is an incomplete perception, not a false perception. ",
