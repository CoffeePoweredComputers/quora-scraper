            "answer_text": "It depends on how the owner cares for it and in case of LUV(light utility vehicles), it is recommended not to drive on the roads of India. Since the ground clearance of LUV made by toyota and chervolet is very low, hence i saw many people getting dents even on well maintained roads palm beach roads(Palm Beach Marg - Wikipedia) when driving on high speed. If we talk about the MUV\u2019s and SUV\u2019s, qualis is an outdated model and lacks many modern specifications, and today in India it is only used by cops and in some rural locations as taxi. I remember during my high school, my school van used to be qualis and I was a fat guy so i use to either sit next to driver or on 3rd bench and all the time I can feel smell of burning paper which i first thought was problem due to improper servicing but i felt the same in other qualis variants since in my location many qualis were owned as taxi too so if we talk about the question \u201cIs it true that Toyota cars never die?\u201d so answer in this case is NO. But this isn\u2019t the conclusion:  this is what i think is the king, manufactured by toyota and i will describe it as the king of SUV since it can go in the most ugliest roads ranging from the most dangerous roads of world like Kabul\u2013Jalalabad Road(Kabul\u2013Jalalabad Road - Wikipedia) and deserts and many more such extreme locations. Not only this makes me think it the most premium car, it is really easy to handle and other key features like pickup, uphill assist and other modern entertainment,infotainment and robotic features make it the king. In India it is considered as a standard of being royal hence it is mostly owned by corrupt politicians, businessmen and DALITS. Some other good things of owning a fortuner being Indian includes having an assured cutest girlfriend since india is a country of gold diggers. If you see a fortuner in India on road, then either it would be family going on vacation or a cute girl with her sugar daddy and the daddy would be 70\u201380 year old person who is either a businessmen or a DALIT. Also while in traffic people usually admire this car causing a distraction and slowing down, hence it naturally makes a clear way for you in traffic. hence according to toyota fortuner justifies that TOYOTA CARS NEVER DIE. And according to my opinion it is a dream car and if i will justify it in a sentence, it would \u201cowning a fortuner for me would be equivalent to dating taylor swift\u201d ",
