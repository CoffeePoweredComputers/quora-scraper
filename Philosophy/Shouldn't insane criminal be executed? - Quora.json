            "answer_text": "I believe an insane criminal should NOT be executed. Being insane is not his own fault. A \u201crotten apple\u201d in a tree may occur not because of its will. it\u2019s everyone\u2019s duty, actually. Now Law itself is complex, and in real life it has different method to make justification. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s a murder, the judges won\u2019t make a judge until the proof is proven, probably includes about the ingredients of poison used, or guns, or whatever it is and how the murderer killed a person. The same goes for an insane criminal. there must be something wrong on his mind, it must be a disorder or mental disease. I thought he must be removed from society, but not to be killed. He is a living human too. What Law needs to do is to make regulation so society is safe from anyone like this insane criminal we\u2019re talking about, also the safe zone for the criminal. State should provide a place where the criminal can sleep and eat well, with a particular treatment, spend the rest of his life and die in that place. ",

            "answer_text": "There are numerous justifications for legal punishments, including but not limited to retribution, deterrence, and rehabilitation, as well as for the protection of society. Different punitive measures are tied to different justifications or combinations of justifications. If the death penalty is being used, and of course it should be used fairly if it is to be used, then which of these reasons apply to it? And which reasons apply to those who cannot tell right from wrong? Rehabilitation (usually imprisonment) is not a concern with the death penalty. Obviously you can\u2019t learn (be rehabilitated) if you are executed. And those who are incapable of understanding shouldn\u2019t be imprisoned for rehabilitation, either - it won\u2019t do them any good. They could be imprisoned (or possibly executed) for retribution, but that seems inhumane, since they won\u2019t understand why it is happening. People who are incapable of understanding not to murder should be dealt with somehow. But the reasoning has to be consistent. If you advocate executing people to set a lesson for others (deterrence) or for the protection of society, then it shouldn\u2019t make any difference if they are incapable of understanding why they are being executed. But if executions are about retribution, then they shouldn\u2019t be applied to those without remorse, only to those who knowingly murder. ",
