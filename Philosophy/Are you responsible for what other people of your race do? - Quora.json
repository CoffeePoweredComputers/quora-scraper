            "answer_text": "No you are not, but racists will hold you responsible anyway, because you don\u2019t exist as an individual to them. And the reality is some groups of people on earth are far more group oriented than others, and are more likely to judge you by whatever group they perceive you to belong to, especially if they don\u2019t know you as an individual. Most of the world is not embracing \u201cWestern Individuality\u201d, that\u2019s what WEIRD (western educated industrialized rich and democratic) people do. My advice, stop worrying about people and things you cannot change. You really can\u2019t control the actions of others, all you can control in the end is yourself. I would say if it bothers you so much, then do something to improve the average situation of your group. You might be able to influence some folks (who influence some other folks) to act the way you want. Change starts with a person who has a dream that makes plans to try to change things. Usually an unreasonable person that does not accept the way the world is but wants to make the world fit their vision. Most people aren\u2019t successful in this, but sometimes\u2026it does happen.
