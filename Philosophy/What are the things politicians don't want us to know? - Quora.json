            "answer_text": "That their big party-politics game is a magnificent farce and we have no real representation. (I am answering from a U.S. perspective, but similar things could probably be said of other countries.) Each of the major parties expects us to believe that they are doing this.  In truth, though, what is actually going on is something more like this.  In front of the cameras, they\u2019re all going to destroy each other. Lots of rhetoric. Lots of hooplah. But in reality, it\u2019s not even a real conflict, and they\u2019re all buddies behind the scenes. Even insofar as the politics do get real, it\u2019s more like the internal politics of a company than what we should see in the government of a country. They really are fighting to get the promotion, but the company maintains the same objectives regardless of who gets that promotion, and the one who doesn\u2019t get the promotion is still content to take his seat and play whatever role he can. So what is actually going on? In Europe in the past, society was divided into three estates.  The clergy, the nobles, and the commoners. For a long time in France, these three estates were officially recognized in that each had representatives in the Estates-General, which was basically a proto-parliament. At one point, the Third Estate demanded that each of its representatives get one vote in the process, while the First and Second Estates wanted each estate to have only one vote. This occurred because, even though the First and Second Estates had different interests, those interests were still largely aligned, so they had a tendency of colluding together against the Third Estate, which represented the most people. Tensions escalated over a period of several days until the representatives of the Third Estate showed up one morning to find that they had actually been locked out of the Estates-General altogether. Today, people try to adapt this social model to fit our situation. They will often try to add a Fourth and Fifth Estate to make it work. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s accurate, though. We still have three estates; it is just that the estates are different now. Here is what we have now: First Estate: CorporationsSecond Estate: Government ElitesThird Estate: Commoners(I actually use the word \u201ccorporations\u201d loosely. This comprises corporations, any other large companies, activist groups, professional associations, labor unions, etc.) We have two major political parties - the Republicans and the Democrats. The Republicans want us to believe that corporations (or some of them, at least) are our friends and that government is our enemy. The Democrats want us to believe that government is our friend and corporations (or some of them, at least) are our enemies. And yet, Republicans push for big government - even unconstitutional government (Donald Trump and civil asset forfeiture) - and Democrats accept massive amounts of cash from the very corporations they demonize (Hillary Clinton and Wall Street and Big Pharma). What is actually going on is that, just as happened in France centuries ago, the First and Second Estates are colluding together against the Third Estate - and locking us out of government. And they are succeeding in this by engaging in controlled opposition. Each side wants us to believe that they are the good guys and the guys on the other side of the aisle are the bad guys while they continue to engage in a bawdy political struggle that is a total sham. They get all worked up over non-issues that they aren\u2019t going to do anything about anyway so that we won\u2019t notice the boring but important stuff that they are quietly working together to \u201caccomplish\u201d. I\u2019m not talking about lizard people and the Illuminati. I\u2019m talking about \u201csecrets\u201d that are out in the open and conspiracies that are totally obvious.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, though. I\u2019m not calling for a revolution to topple the First and Second Estates. Truth be told, I feel that they will always exist in some form. I cannot picture an advanced human society without them. It is just that I want to see better checks and balances and more transparency and accountability. ",

            "answer_text": "Years ago I worked for the federal governme. I had a security clearance. Often what was classified. So I'd assume one thing politicians don't want you to know is how much money they authorize to spend. (Keep in mind that while the president proposes it's Congress that disposes.) The president can't spend a dime. They say you probably don't want to observe the process by which sausage is made. The same goes for legislative acts. Passing bills is a messy process. A lot of horse trading takes place and lots of \u201cadd on\u201d spending measures are incorporated into bills. Rarely do they end up looking like early-on drafts. Much of this occurs behind closed doors in order to ensure that word doesn't get out. The list goes on and on but one item that also stands out is how those in Congress spend their time and monitor their allowance to run their offices. You've heard about absenteeism, fundraising jaunts, speaking gigs, book deals, overseas travel, wining & dining . . . the list goes on. They don't want you to know any of this. ",
