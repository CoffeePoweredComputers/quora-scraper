            "answer_text": "I confess, I'm hard pressed to tell whether this is a trick question: possibly some eminence is curious to see how widely diffused post-structuralism is. But nevertheless, here goes: First of all, when people speak of being \"post-structuralist,\u201d that does not (except, I suppose, in some very eccentric formulations) mean \u201chaving superseded structuralism.\u201d Rather, it tends to mean a type of thought that is informed by the insights of structuralism. It signifies, in effect, the triumph of structuralist thought in helping people think through the dynamics of language and of culture, of the circuits and mechanisms by which meaning (and I'm paraphrasing, here, an eminent professor I had the fortune to study with) is created, maintained, circulated and transformed. That said, I'll offer what is possibly a superfluous take on structuralism as such: Consider the three bears; the ones that ran afoul of Goldilocks. She sat down to sample their porridge. The first bowl was too hot. The second bowl was too cold. The third bowl, she decides, is just right (probably because it cooled to the right temperature while she was stealing the other bears\u2019 food, but that's beside the point). When used to describe porridge, \"hot\u201d is not an absolute term. In fact, it's not an absolute term in any context at all: even the Kelvin scale which begins at absolute zero with the (notional, as far as I know) complete immobility of matter doesn't tell us when something is hot. No, that term, like \"cool\u201d and \u201cjust right,\u201d is relational. It derives its meaning from its relation \u2014 in specific contexts \u2014 with other options. There are hot and cool stars, but their temperature bears no useful relation to porridge which merits the same description. So if you have a context \u2014 dining table, bowls of food \u2014 you know the structure within which these arbitrary markers, \"hot,\u201d \"cold\u201d and \u201cjust right\u201d function, within which they make sense. And the active tenor of that claim \u2014 they make sense \u2014 is critical. In structuralism, meaning does not derive from some absolute or immanent (inherent, inbuilt) characteristic; it derives from a specific (though fluid and complex) relationship to other terms in the same system. And the construction of the systems within which this happens is a specifically human one. It is easiest, of course, to consider two-term systems as a start. Think, for example, of the old m/f \u2014 masculine and feminine. One fundamental way a structuralist would consider these terms would be as negations of the other. Which is to say, the elements we (and I'm speaking generally!) identify masculine are defined by their not being feminine, and vice versa. Feel free to add, here, a whole history of the violence and destruction that has been done to people in service of that dynamic! The thing is, a non- or anti-structuralist \u2014 which would be, basically, an essentialist \u2014 would reject this notion because s/he proceeds from the assumption, the insistence, that things mean what they mean regardless of the cultural and linguistic structures we associate with them. I encourage you to wonder about why this \u201cessentialist\u201d take on meaning is inadequate\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Julian Halliday is right. I would only add that the main difference between structuralism and post structuralism is that the post structuralists are aware that a structuralist approach can be applied to challenge any given \u201ctruth\u201d. As meaning is a function of the relationships in a system, \u201ctruth\u201d is a function of a very complex relationship between social interactors (people, who lives and works and has fun in some given matterial contexts) and their varied ways of thinking and acting, the existing institutions, etc. As the interactions change in time (due to other changes, such as immigration, change of governments, changes in science, for example), economy changes, the culture changes, people change. In that scenario, truths also change (whats good, bad, acceptable, etc), so truth shows itself as essencially nothing. There is no Truth with cappital T. Structuralism sort of implies this. Yes, if i jump i\u2019ll end up with my feet (hopefully) on the ground; i wont question that, and anyone can find out what happens if you jump. There are many truths like this one, but this are not the truths that defines how we should live our lives. Post structuralists uses this to confront some \u201ctruths\u201d that \u2014for example- are helping to mantain forms of segregation (if we take \u201cthere are two genders, man and woman\u201d as true, then what happens with people who dont identify with these? What legitimates this way of thinking? (that there are only two genders) Why should this view be the main one held by any given society? and why is that, in certain societies, it becomes the main view? ",
