            "answer_text": "It is especially important to believe in yourself now more than ever. EVEN IF (you think that) YOU ARE NOT GOOD AT ANYTHING. I have been trying for years to explain this idea to myself, here it goes. Let\u2019s say you want to run a 200m race at school. How do you define \u2018good at running\u2019 to yourself? If you were like me 10 years ago(when I was 15 years old), you\u2019d automatically think of the fastest runners at school. You would compare your own speed, agility and stamina with theirs. And I could react in two ways, according to my mindset: 1)Fixed mindset(That all your abilities are \u201cfixed\u201d, and cannot be added to) You could just say to yourself\u201c Man, I wasn\u2019t born with those traits. They are luckier than me, and won the great lottery of life. I am NOT GOING TO EVEN TRY, because I can see imminent failure\u201d. With the fixed mindset(\u201cNah, I can\u2019t change that much\u201d), you set high standards, and assumed you could not get to that standard, and you stop trying. 2)Growth mindset(That you can \u201cgrow\u201d your abilities with concentrated effort) You could also say to yourself \u201cMan, I am a human being just like them. I have legs that can run like them. So what is it that makes them special? Do they move their legs faster? Do they have a certain posture? I understand that I may not be like them now, BUT I AM GOING TO TRY TO GET BETTER\u201d. With the growth mindset however(\u201cOk, maybe I can change, even its a little bit at a time\u201d) , you believe that you are as capable of being great as anyone else, and you try and give it a shot. The difference between these two actions was self-confidence, or believing in yourself.  The growth mindset was required in order to initiate your attempt to become a better version of yourself. Without that mindset, your abilities would stay where they were, and you would not even make an attempt. Cultivating my self-confidence by repeating the words \u201cI can do anything that I set my mind to\u201d helped me gradually fight my own doubts about my running skills.  In 12th grade, since it was my last year, I decided to push myself harder and learn to visualize the race in my mind and clear myself of doubts. I remember asking my brother to time my 200m laps. I would make small adjustments to my technique and felt happy when I made small improvements, because I was challenging my own perceptions. My self-belief was now translating into measurable results with my lap-times. :D Suffice to say, I won my first gold that year, and I was overjoyed at not just winning the race, but winning against self-doubt. Now imagine how tons of people right now are using their fixed mindset to make decisions about their lives. They don\u2019t fail, but they don\u2019t win either. They keep wishing that they could be a famous actor, or a famous athlete, or an expert at something, but they don\u2019t do anything about it. Because they predict that they will fail in the future. They decided their future, although the future cannot be predicted(even by horoscopes). See how many people are self-sabotaging themselves? And in our time and age, people are being exposed to higher and higher bars of success now more readily through Instagram and Facebook.  That makes them even more intimated to take that first step. We need belief in ourselves now more than ever. You, or anybody else, cannot predict the future, so why imagine that you will fail? Imagining that you will succeed with focused effort will motivate you to work harder, and eventually you might improve. But you never know if you don\u2019t try. Check this TED talk out by this coach.  It\u2019s exactly what helped me once. Hope it helps you understand the growth mindset better.  ",

            "answer_text": "It is always worth believing in yourself. I do not believe that there are people who are \u201cnot that good\u201d (as you wrote in the question details). Each and every person on this planet has potential. It sounds cliche, but often this potential just has to be uncovered before anything can be done with it. Some people are content living the lives they live, and if you are happy, that is brilliant. Some people are not content - they are always striving to achieve something. Both types of people believe in themselves, just in different ways. But here\u2019s the trick: you don\u2019t have to believe in yourself in order to be who you want to be. Fake it until you make it, I\u2019ve heard some people say. And I think it works. The only difference between the people who believe in themselves and the people who don\u2019t, is what drives them to do whatever it is they do. Trust me, you are brilliant. ",
