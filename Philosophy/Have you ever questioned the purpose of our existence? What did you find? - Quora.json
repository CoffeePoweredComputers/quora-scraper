            "answer_text": "I do not ask the purpose of our existence, as I am asking the Source of All to reveal to me a secret that it is my job to try and discover. What I do question is the purpose of my existence. I am but one pair of eyes, one pair of ears, one nose, one tongue, one set of hands and feet. I am one tangle of electromagnetic fields formed by the signals from within my body, and the signals from outside my body, tethered together by my brain. And it is through all of these strange parts of me connected together by the Life Planner, that the Source of All participates in the Universe. There are so many others: some like me, some different. Some fly in the air, some swim in the sea. Some are covered with fur, some with scales. Some stand on the same planet I do, some on another\u2026sometimes we are looking out at the same stars through the ripple of space time. (Sometimes I wave, lol\u2026really) The only purposes I have been sure of is being the mother of the my children, and this is the greatest honor. Another is to learn from my non-human brethren, and yet another is that I should share this with all of you, because each of you is another set of eyes and ears, another nose and tongue, another tangle of electromagnetics\u2026and so on.

            "answer_text": "We are transformers of cosmic energy. We take in energies of one set of frequencies, transform them and then radiate what we don\u2019t use back into space. This is not just information to think about. We can actually train our attention to focus on those currents of energy as they pass through us. This is possible because our attention is a current of energy passing through our minds. To get started, simply focus your attention on your attention. It\u2019s located in the middle of your head, behind your eyes and between your ears. Try to stay with that sensation for as long as you can (soon your attention will slip back into the thought stream, but you can return to that unique sensation whenever you wish, whenever you can remember you wish). Once you have learned how to intend your attention to pay attention to itself as a current of energy, it is not a big leap to connect with the big currents rushing through the whole body. This is a very special form of amusement, very entertaining, but like certain chemicals, can be disturbing for certain types of people who do not have a strong anchor in ordinary everyday reality. So proceed with caution. If you find that it is too disturbing, just forget about it. ",
