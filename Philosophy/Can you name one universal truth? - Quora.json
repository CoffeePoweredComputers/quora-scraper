            "answer_text": "That care heals everything.  I was sociopath who didn't believe in any social relationship. I hate people. Maybe it was one of the factor that make me have mental disorder, 2 years ago I was diagnosed with it. I was the one who trusted noone and stand on my own foot for everything, broke. I became dependent almost in everything. I was sucked in my disease, up down facing severe depression and mania. I started to have disabilities in social interaction and taking care of myself. Spending times in my rooms for days during depression time and hanging out like crazy during mania. I destroyed my academic life. People started to recognize that I was \"insane\", that was stigma started. It was dark, I felt I lost everything : friends, trusts, hopes. Medicine didn't work for me. At the peak of my hopelessness, there was this guy that attract me. He is nice and kind. In short, we become friends and I told everything to him my burdens. Surprisingly, he dont judge and listen, and stay. For the first time, I'm attached to someone emotionally, and his existence heals me drastically. I am alot better now and step by step I learn how to engage emotionally to more people. For this nice guy who keep staying, thank you :) ",

My one universal truth: Change is constant. This satisfies all qualification criteria ",
