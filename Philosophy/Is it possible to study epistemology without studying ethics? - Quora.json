            "answer_text": "No, yes, and no. I believe that both analytic and continental philosophy are valid pursuits.  To cut off one path would imply that we already knew the answer, and the whole point of philosophy is that it studies things that we don't know the answer to.  One could say that the point of the field of epistemology is to figure out what \"epistemology\" is and why we're studying it.   From my standpoint as an analytical philosopher, I tend to think of epistemology in terms independent of ethics. However, I've reached a point in my pursuit of epistemology where I don't believe that it stands on its own \"underlying\" everything else.  Rather, I see epistemology as the attempt to systematize the way the (highly complex) human mind both models and results from the (trivial but large) universe around it.  Call it the point where ontology, physics, and psychology meet. In that sense, epistemology and ethics are not independent.  I don't think we'll ever find a way to disentangle the way humans view knowledge and the way they make moral judgments.  Both are the result of applying human cognitive facilities. I still suspect that the ultimate end goal of explaining all of the metaphysics in terms of the physics is achievable, but we're not there yet and it would be misleading for the analytic philosophers to cut off other lines of research.  There are insights to be gained. However, what I'm talking about here is a highly general synthesis.  I assert that philosophy is ultimately a cognitive field, in which epistemology and ethics are just two aspects.  In particular, the continental philosophers who draw their circles around the two, while excluding other aspects I consider crucial (from physics to neurology to experimental philosophy) are making at least as big an error.

            "answer_text": "Indeed they can be studied separately since epistemology is the philosophy of knowledge (who one knows things, how knowledge is obtained, types of knowledge, methodology, etc) + ethics is concerned with how to engage with the other (alterity, intersubjectivity, how to acknowledge/interact, etc). Ethics, at least in continental thought, is usually tied more closely with morality (the development of a system of what is right/wrong, values, etc). Epistemology could be better correlated with ontology (the philosophy of being) as the latter will establish the objects of knowledge, categorization + related.  ",
