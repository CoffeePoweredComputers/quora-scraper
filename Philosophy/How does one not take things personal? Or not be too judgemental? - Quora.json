People confide a lot in me (a mixed blessing) a lot because I listen well. All it requires is occasionally asking a clarification and murmuring reflectively once in a while - and not giving gratuitous reassurances, agreement, or Sunday school lessons. The fact is, to lie, steal, cheat, war, and seek instant gratification is human. We discourage them because we are closely packed social animals. Still, it makes everything understandable, though not acceptable. Homo sum humani a me nihil alienum puto. ",

Ask better questions, put yourself in their shoes and realise that your perspective is just that, its not based on any truth or fact. Everyone sees things differently so usually there is no right or wrong exactly. ",
