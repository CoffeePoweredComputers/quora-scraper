            "answer_text": "There\u2019s nothing known as \u2018Subjective\u2019 or \u2018Objective values\u2019. The \u2018definition\u2019 and \u2018end product\u2019 of \u2018Values\u2019 are objective. But its understanding, execution and implementation are subjective. Consider this example- Many people believe that \u2018Beggars\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be given alms but should be taught how to work because this way they will never be able to come out of the begging thing. And by not giving them the alms we are helping them to cede begging. Whereas some people believe that beggars should be shown compassion and mercy, as they lead a terrible life so we should help them by giving alms. The First case might be a bit harsh but acceptable and the second one is a bit soft. But in both the cases they are helping as per their values. So here, as humans they know they are supposed to help as it\u2019s an important human value to help others but the way they help is different. But in the end its end product is the same. Because both the types of people are helping in some way or the other or rather I should say Beggars are being helped both the ways. So the purpose of the value \u2018helping\u2019 is served. So in this case, whether to help or not, in which way should the help be offered are all subjective and depends upon from which perspective they are looking at the things. Let\u2019s consider one more example: Terrorists do sacrifice themselves and yes it is for a bad cause but from their perspective they are doing the right thing by sacrificing themselves as they think they are doing that for a particular reason which according to them is right. On the other hand, our Soldiers sacrifice to protect the nation. Both of them are sacrificing but for different causes. Thus the end product of sacrifice is the same but the implementation of sacrifice is different as one cause is noble whereas the other one is not. The same way, all the values are objective but the way they are supposed to be executed or understood is subjective.  |ABs| ",

Objective values are based on evidence and can be proved or demonstrated, not so easily debated or refuted. A subjective value may be to have a good, liberal arts education or you\u2019re fond of your coin collection, whereas the objective value may be to love one another as the fulfillment of all moral duty to man.
