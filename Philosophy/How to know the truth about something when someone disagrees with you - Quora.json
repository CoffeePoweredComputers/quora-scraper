            "answer_text": "There has always been a difference between \u201cthe truth\u201d and \u201ca truth\u201d For instance you are driving your car and suddenly you experience the balance wobbly, you realize \u201ca truth\u201d that you have a flat and your journey ruined. But the moment you spot a Mechanic, your realization of \u201ca truth\u201d becomes false, as the mechanic can easily fix the situation and you would again be set for your journey. This holds true for every instance in the materialistic world, take any example. Which is the reason why its said \u201cihamuna sukhiyimpa\u201d, \u201ceverything connected with the material world is momentary pleasurable and can turn table any moment\u201d \u201cThe Truth\u201d is that fact which withstands the test of time and never changes. \u201cDharmo Rakhshati Rakshitah[1]\u201d, \u201cSatyamev Jayate[2]\u201d \u201cAhimsa paramo Dharma, Dharma himsa tathaiva cha[3]\u201d are few examples, There are countless facts leading to the same single Truth (i.e the supreme energy). So when you ask \u201cHow do you know the truth about something when someone disagrees with you\u201d, it only means that you do not know \u201cthe Truth\u201d and hence are confused. To change your position from such state you need to practice, the knowledge of which comes at a cost not negotiable via money.

What is the real definition of ahimsa in Sanatan Dharma?",

            "answer_text": "What you now know is that you never knew the truth, if all it took to doubt yourself was someone disagreeing with you. A fact is a statement backed by evidence. Either it\u2019s backed or it isn\u2019t. Either the evidence is accurate or it isn\u2019t. A fact has nothing to do with what anyone thinks about anything. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re 5\u203211. It doesn\u2019t matter what anyone says, not even you. If you\u2019re 5\u203211 you are 5\u203211, and either you know it or you don\u2019t. You either measured it yourself or you didn\u2019t. You used accurate tools or you didn\u2019t. You measured it recently or you didn\u2019t. But none of the variables makes your height not a fact, or the height that you know completely false. Either you know a fact or you don\u2019t. You either know the accuracy of what you know or you don\u2019t. The same applies with whether your car needs gas. Or whether you\u2019re out of milk. Or whether you\u2019re late for your appointment. Or whether you did your homework. These are simple facts. They are simple facts, because the evidence that backs them is simple also. An opinion is a statement backed by a person. Opinions are always right. The fact that \u201cyou thought something\u201d or \u201cfelt something\u201d or \u201cbelieve in something\u201d are all true, so long as you are honest. But because we make up our opinions freely, they are often factually incorrect. They can even be impossible to factually test. This makes opinions contradict easily. But we\u2019re still all entitled to our opinions. Therefore, we only have a problem when we decide we must agree. We only have a problem when we disagree with someone else\u2019s opinion. But the moment you do this, the only basis for you to be correct is either your opinion \u2014 in which case you\u2019re just pulling the higher moral authority card \u2014 or facts \u2014 in which case you are suggesting there is valid evidence. In the case of the former, they will usually fight back, unless they love you enough not to. In the case of the latter, and in the case that there was true evidence, then what you held was never an opinion to begin with. Which makes you a confused person if you did not know that. And, which also still does not make you correct, unless the other person believes in facts. Yes, you can be scientifically correct, and yet perfectly good, smart, fun loving people will completely disagree with you and may even make you eat dirt. Why? Because everyone is entitled to their opinion. But everyone is not entitled to their facts. And everyone that puts milk on their grocery list when they are out of milk does practice this. So in the end, they\u2019re just being smart with you, and you with them, if you\u2019re returning the favor by arguing over facts. You either have evidence or you don\u2019t. It\u2019s either accurate or it isn\u2019t. And either you can read the evidence properly or you can\u2019t. There is nothing to argue over. There is only agreement of knowledge, or admitting you do not know. If you do not know, you could look it up. Do some digging. Go look for yourself. And that\u2019s something you cannot do while arguing. ",

            "answer_text": "Are you assuming that you have the truth unless someone disagrees with you? WHen you have a view, there\u2019s no particular reason to believe it unless there\u2019s some access to information that you and only you have. Otherwise, it\u2019s just someone\u2019s opinion that you know about. If you believe that there are people smarter than you with divergent views you have some reason to suspect you\u2019re wrong. So, then you begin the process that all ideas should take, gathering a wide range of information over time, looking at the different takes on it, the vest interpretations you can find, looking at the pros and cons of them, trying to locate and filter out biases and self-delusions, then tentatively assessing where the weight of evidence and argument leads. This is best done through many discussions with others, not just in personal reflection. ",

If you argue about how to move on business wise or how to plan a holiday together, there is not real right or wrong. Business problems may be solved with the help of a moderator or an external force. In a holiday or marriage situation you partner has desires too and I take it into consideration and do for her things I do not fancy so much as she does for me. A disagreement may bring a new information into the situation, so a seldom brush it down. ",
