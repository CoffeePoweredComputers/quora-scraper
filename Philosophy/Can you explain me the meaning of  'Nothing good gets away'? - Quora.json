            "answer_text": "Hello Anurag, This doctrine is very deep and is just reciprocal of what we understand from it. If we say that NOTHING GOOD GETS AWAY, than it also means that EVERY BAD NEVER REMAINS AWAY. Good and bad, cannot be isolated as different identity. They are one, how can you come to know that what is bad or what is good.  The reason is that if you have experienced bad than only you can identify the good and vice versa. Otherwise what will be your definition of good and bad. If you feel bad, than only you can feel good, otherwise it is impossible. We have even very deep and meaningful doctrine which got followed for a long time and now it has been a history from a long time too. And that doctrine is to be WITNESS, just see and accept, if bad is there than to accept it and if good is there than to accept it. This leads you to get above from bad and good both. And when you are above and can see that good and bad are coming to you and passing from you, than the remaining is purest of you.......the soul. Hope you will find explanation useful, Thanks and regards the almighty residing in your kind heart, Arinjay ",
