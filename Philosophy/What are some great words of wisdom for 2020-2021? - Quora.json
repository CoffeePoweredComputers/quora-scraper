            "answer_text": "Hi, a deep, but potent question. Thank you for the request to answer. First? It truly depends on \u2018your own character\u2019 BOOM . . . Do you just sort of want to \u2018cruise\u2019 along with an OK life with as few \u2018speed bumps\u2019 as possible? (and nothing wrong with that) . . . but/or? Do you want a Life full of \u2018Great\u2019 . . . The majority truly are content with an O.K. life that sometimes bumps into a \u2018Wow\u2019 day . . . but? The \u2018great life\u2019 seeker (who actually are a minority) can not, and just won\u2019t settle for less than the \u2018greater\u2019 venture. The O.K. seekers will never \u2018chase\u2019 words of wisdom\u2019 for more that \u2018just a bit\u2019. If you are looking for a \u2018truly fulfilled\u2019 life . . . digest these words. One day? you will cease to live. May be in 70 years, may be next year, or next month, or even tomorrow . . . you don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know. The most simple words of wisdom?  Seize the day. Where did that come from? Hamashiach . . . Repent (Quit thinking the old way) Look inside YOU . . . follow the one who\u2019s chair (throne) is \u2018INSIDE YOU\u2019. Ash-can the religious, and social Drama Queen B.S. Follow your/our Creator (s) I won\u2019t go any deeper than that . . . it would make me look like a teacher, and or a preacher (I have little room in my life for either) Grasp \u2018Understanding\u2019 and quit \u2018learn\u2019n plastic knowledge. (it will pollute your earth) Does this? help to answer your question? Hey, thanks again for the request . . . and have a Great Day. from \u2018Cubby\u2019  ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhat are some great words of wisdom for 2020\u20132021?\u201d I have two thoughts I would like to share here. Do with them what you like. First, those who search for answers to questions they ask received the answer to that question ten thousand times before they asked it. We ignore these answers because the answer doesn\u2019t seem to fit, or we don\u2019t like what we have to do (see the myth of Jonah). It may sound silly, but consider asking yourself \u201cDo I know the answer to this question?\u201d before you seek advice on your career, dating life, existential questions, etc. Second, these are those who equate general knowledge with wisdom. This perceived wisdom leads to overconfidence, and overconfident people are prone to standing in the way of the good of all. When taking a stance of any kind, take the time to ask yourself \u201cWhat am I standing in the way of?\u201d before you prevent something real good from happening. Thanks for listening, and I hope this helps.  ",
