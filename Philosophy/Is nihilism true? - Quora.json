            "answer_text": "No, it is not, but some of the people would have you believe otherwise. By pontificating nihilism to be true, or false, you've violated it's very doctrine\u2014 which is rejecting any form of inherent truth or meaning. Some of the people who have answered this question are probably unaware of the paradox that they've created. By equating nihilism with truth, a nihilist denies nihilism itself. Thus, they become the very thing they sought to admonish. There is no truth or falsity to nihilism and it is dangerous to associate it with either of them. ",

There is no physical explanation for the universe in its current state that does not break the law of physics.
