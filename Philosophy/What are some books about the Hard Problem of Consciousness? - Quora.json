            "answer_text": " Why doesn't all this cognitive processing go on \"in the dark,\" without any consciousness at all? In this book philosophers, physicists, psychologists, neurophysiologists, computer scientists, and others address this central topic in the growing discipline of consciousness studies. At the 1994 landmark conference \"Toward a Scientific Basis for Consciousness\", philosopher David Chalmers distinguished between the \"easy\" problems and the \"hard\" problem of consciousness research. According to Chalmers, the easy problems are to explain cognitive functions such as discrimination, integration, and the control of behavior; the hard problem is to explain why these functions should be associated with phenomenal experience. Why doesnt all this cognitive processing go on \"in the dark\", without any consciousness at all? In this book, philosophers, physicists, psychologists, neurophysiologists, computer scientists, and others address this central topic in the growing discipline of consciousness studies. Some take issue with Chalmers' distinction, arguing that the hard problem is a non-problem, or that the explanatory gap is too wide to be bridged. Others offer alternative suggestions as to how the problem might be solved, whether through cognitive science, fundamental physics, empirical phenomenology, or with theories that take consciousness as irreducible.

            "answer_text": "Here is a small list off the top of my head. Susan Blackmore has written a \"text book of consciousness\". Amazon.com: Consciousness: An Introduction (9781444104875): Susan Blackmore: Books She comes from a very materialist point of view and tends to make statements that seem like non-sequiturs to me, but that's just me. Along the same lines, \"Consciousness Explained\" by Daniel Dennett is a surprisingly well-written and thoughtful book, but when you come down to it he basically argues at length that there isn't really all that much to be explained. Causing some to refer to the book as \"Consciousness Dismissed\". The late great Francis Crick of DNA fame has written a book called \"The Astonishing Hypothesis\", well worth a read, which again comes from a strictly materialist perspective. Crick was interested in finding the parts of the brain involved in conscious awareness, with limited success. Moving on to the other end of the spectrum, Shadows of the Mind by Roger Penrose is a somewhat technical book (written by a highly-regarded professor of mathematics who has helped Stephen Hawking with his equations) which argues that mathematics alone shows us that something we don't quite understand is going on in the human mind. Penrose also talks about his highly-speculatively theory of microtubules being involved in consciousness. Biocentrism by top biologist Robert Lanza is completely non-technical, to the point of almost being a meditation. It's not easy to get at what exactly he is asserting, but it seems that he also thinks the mind is not simply the product of a machine. Anything by David Chalmers on the topic is probably worth a look. I can't remember which of his books I've read, if any, but he takes the view that there really is a hard problem to be explained, and indeed coined the term in the first place. If you don't mind some mathematics, Quantum Mechanics and Experience by David Z. Albert is very good; he talks about the various possible interpretations of quantum mechanics, some of which may view consciousness as \"primary\" and some of are purely material interpretations. What I like about this book is the way it pushes you to think of consciousness in some quite concrete terms. Finally, if you can put up with terribly obscure language, Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant brings up some interesting points. He also wrote Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics which summarises the book, and is still hard to read but not as hard as the original. ",
