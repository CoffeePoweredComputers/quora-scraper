            "answer_text": "I think it is in no way offensive if foreigners assist celebrations of the Day of the Dead in Mexico. The celebration is quite different from region to region. One of the most famous is being held in Michoacan. If you visit there, you might want to leave your camera at home, even if the colorful celebration might entice to take pictures. I lived for 21 years in Mexico, at its northern border, and contrary to a widely held believe, the Day of the Dead is celebrated there, too. I went on 21 Novembers with my in laws to the cemetery to pay a visit to the deceased. We did not stay for the night, the place is in midst of the desert. But it was always a picknick, when all family would meet and kids were having fun, them being all cousins of first, second and third grade. We adults would commemorate some anecdotes, clean the tombs from windblown dust, buy thos \u201cZempoales\u201d flowers typical for the occasion. Some people would play the favorite \u201cRanchera\u201d song of their relative, others, like my brother in law, share a can of beer. At home, you put up a little altar with food for your relatives, tiny bits only, and usually, you also assist Mass the day before, All Saints\u2019 Day on November 1 st. At home, we always ate again, the picknick was only a teaser. Usually a big meal made of something where all could be served at once. Contrary to Europe, where this day usually is all serious and cold, cloudy, in Ciudad Juarez this was often the last really hot day of the year. One also could observe, at least from 2007 onwards, how good the harvest of \u201cLa Flaca\u201d (as Death is called in Mexico, being a woman) has been since last year. Usually a bumper crop. Sounds a bit rough and lacking piety? Then you should read the \u201cCalaveras\u201d, little poems where people make fun of Death and their public people, usually falling victim to \u201cLa Flaca\u201d . ",

            "answer_text": "I spent a couple of weeks in Patzcuaro during the Day of the Dead and stayed overnight in the graveyard in Cucuchuchu. I \u2018found\u2019 a family of siblings holding their vigil by the grave of their brother and in my very poor Spanish asked if I could sit with them. They were happy for me to be there. We tried to communicate during the night and I was very respectful of their ritual. It was a very moving experience. Yes I was just a tourist. I\u2019m not a Christian (i\u2019m Buddhist). And no I don\u2019t believe the soul of their brother returned during the night to visit them. But this didn\u2019t stop me from sharing what everyone feels when they lose a loved one and pay their respects. I think outsiders can gain emotionally and spiritually through participating and I think the Mexican people feel proud of their traditions when a foreigner respectfully joins in. ",
