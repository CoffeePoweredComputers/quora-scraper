            "answer_text": "Paraphrasing Bertrand Russell (philosopher): The purpose of pure philosophy is not results. The purpose is to expand your mind.  When you philosophise, you ask yourself large questions: What is reality? How do I know what reality is? What does knowing mean? What is truth? What is quality? What distinguishes objective from subjective? These questions may not be answerable. You may find no answer yourself. But in the search, you have expanded your mind. As doing calisthenics exercises and strengthens your muscles, so philosophy strengthens your mind. Neither of these brings tangible benefits to the outside world: nothing is changed because I lifted weights or thought about the difference between the objective and the subjective. But you will be changed for the better. That is the value of philosophy. With thanks to User-10192816784516729009 for the A2A. ",
