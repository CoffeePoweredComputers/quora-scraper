            "answer_text": "For us to answer this question will need to analyze each discipline with their nature and goal. Anthropology Anthropology is the scientific study of humanity, concerned with human behavior, human biology, and societies, in both the present and past, including past human species. In other words Anthropology, \u201cthe science of humanity,\u201d which studies human beings in aspects ranging from the biology and evolutionary history of Homo sapiens to the features of society and culture that decisively distinguish humans from other animal species. Nature of Anthropology Its roots go back to the intellectual Enlightenment of the 18th and early 19th centuries in Europe and North America. As European nations developed colonies in distant parts of the world and Americans expanded west and south into the territories of Indians, it became apparent to them that humanity was extremely varied. Anthropology began, in part, as an attempt by members of scientific societies to objectively record and comprehend this variation. Curiosity about strange people and customs in far off parts of the world is what primarily motivated these early amateur anthropologists. By profession, they most often were naturalists, medical doctors, Christian clerics, or educated explorers. They asked such fundamental questions as whether or not the differences between human cultures are the result of genetic inheritance and if there is a relationship between the size of a human brain and intelligence. It was late 19th century that anthropology finally became a separate academic discipline in American and Western European universities. Goals of Anthropology: Firstly, one of the main goals of an anthropologist is to understand the fossil record of early humans and their ancestors as well as the archaeological record of more recent prehistoric societies. Secondly, to understand how we adapt to different environmental conditions and how we vary as a species. Thirdly, to understand the behavior of monkeys and apes in their natural settings. Fourthly, is to learn about both the biological and cultural aspects of humanity around the globe and throughout time. Sociology Sociology is the scientific study of human society and social behaviour. Sociology is a discipline in social sciences concerned with the human society and human social activities. Auguste Comte, a French social thinker, is traditionally known as the \"Father of Sociology\" as he coined the term 'Sociology' in 1839. Nature of Sociology To begin with, Sociology has developed as a value-free discipline. It is concerned with is, not with what ought to be. Sociology is an empirical discipline like Physics, Chemistry, or Mathematics, and not as an applied science like Engineering or Computer Science. A Sociologist analyses society from different angles and acquires knowledge about society and patterns of social interactions. Goals of Sociology: The immediate goal of sociology is to acquire knowledge about society like all the other social sciences discipline, as Samuel Koenig has pointed out the ultimate aim of sociology is \" to improve man's adjustment to life by developing objective knowledge concerning social phenomena which can be used to deal effectively with social problems\". to understand how membership in one's social group affects individual behavior.to understand the meaning and consequences of modernity, postmodernity and the new globalization.Understand the meaning and consequences of modernity, postmodernity and the new globalization.Understand how cultures and institutions interact in different societies.Understand the causes and consequences of social change in terms of general causes and effects as well as unique historical circumstances.Understand the causes and consequences of population composition and pressures and how population affects the environment and development of societies.Political Science Political Science is the study of the nature, causes, and consequences of collective decisions and actions taken by groups of people embedded in cultures and institutions that structure power and authority. Nature of Political Science Politics is not only a mere institution of governance but also a mechanism for achieving societal goals. Nature of Political Science is a social science concerned with the theory and practice of politics and the description and analysis of political systems and political behavior. It includes matters concerning the allocation and transfer of power in decision making, the roles and systems of governance including governments and international organizations, political behavior and public policies. Political science is thus a study of the state in the past, present and future of the political organization, political processes and political functions of political institutions and political theories. Political science has several subfields, including political theory, public policy, national politics, international relations, human rights, environmental politics and comparative politics. The antecedents of Western politics can trace their roots back to Greek thinkers Socrates, Plato (427\u2013347 BC) and Aristotle (384\u2013322 BC). The studies were philosophy oriented. Plato wrote The Republic and Aristotle wrote the Politics. Aristotle is known as the Father of Political Science. He is famous for his statement \u201cMan is a political animal\u201d. Goals of Political Science: The main goal of political science is the concern with the process of growth, industrialization and change and the impact on government forms and policies. The goal of political science also is to describe how various political systems function, and to find more effective political systems. Best of Luck ",

            "answer_text": "You don\u2019t get it, do you. Neither anthropology, nor sociology, nor political science, have \u201cnatures\u201d or \u201cgoals\u201d - only people do - as anthropods, as social individuals, as polities: and their natures thus are very varied, and the goals are multifarious, and the studies of these variations are what constitue anthropology, sociology and political science. And because of the great variations involved, you CANNOT start off by making the simplifyng assumption - \u201cWell, all people are basically the same\u201d - hence mega loads of b/s. You\u2019ll just have to listen to your Professor, stating what HE thinks is the bleeding obvious about his subject - and remember to regurgitate it come the examinations. And don\u2019t call it \u201cscience\u201d - it is Literature, of the class Fiction, or light entertainment. Or alternatively it is VERY advanced Chemistry, of the Trans-Ontological elements - Narrativium, Speculum, Hopium, Mendacium, Idiom, and the rest. ",
