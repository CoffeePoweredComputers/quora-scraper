            "answer_text": "The Big Picture of Idealism and Humanity: First, let\u2019s be clear, we all have idealisms. We all have maps we impose on the world. Improvement. Progress. Growth. These are in some sense natural motivations of the human person. And they are ultimately both expressions of and motivations for such improvement. Humans are idealists. Beyond that, even the anti-idealists do this. So in some sense they are idealists too, albeit more skeptically and perhaps without fully probing the depths of their own idealism\u2014which seems potentially more dangerous. What launched the American Revolution? Idealism. What launched the movement westward? Idealism. What launched the industrial revolution? Idealism. What launched the computer revolution? Idealism. I would say Plato\u2019s Cave helps provide some insight. We have the ideal and the real. The ideal is something to strive for. The real is the status quo. There would be no change, without some kind of idealism about the world. In abstract terms, we have imperfect drawings on earth that strive for the beauty and excellence of perfection. All circles are an attempt at the perfect. Think of a car made by say Lexus, Mercedes, or BMW. That\u2019s the striving for perfection. In some sense all products or at least the great products are a small attempt to strive toward that kind of perfection. Even the movement toward Quality Improvement and Six Sigma, and other forms of improvement point toward this ultimate striving. The Cons: Well you can get caught up in a bad idealism. What are truth claims of your idealism? What are its implications in history? The problem is that it\u2019s easy to manipulate this at the level of subjectivity, rather than stepping back and looking at the big picture. The Comparison: What do we do with such a choice? Be self-reflective. Discover which idealisms you have.Reflect on if they are the best you can have about your life and about the world, considered from the perspective of human purpose and contribution.",
