            "answer_text": "For me the definition of (objective) Truth is that which does not change. I offer the scientific model as my illustration: I believe it to be an objective statement that \u201cObjectivity is the prime directive for the scientific mind.\u201d It is necessary to draw conclusions based on empirical evidence. That scientists have attempted to make this evidence true is, I believe, subjective. It is accepted (albeit at times grudgingly) in the scientific community that when new empirical evidence is presented, the information previously acted upon and accepted as truth changes. This leads me to conclude that, building on a now obsolete \u201cversion of truth\u201d does in effect negate (at the very least) its objectivity. I have a lay person\u2019s interest in quantum mechanics theory. I found it fascinating to read about the actions of the scientist who is set on gathering what will be considered \u201cobjective\u201d evidence. It has led me to an interesting thought that points to an even more interesting conclusion. The scientist is an individual. That in itself establishes subjectivity. She (subjective pronoun referring to an individual) has been born with a unique combination of characteristics and personality traits and they have led her to pursue a career in science. Arguably, she enjoys the gathering of empirical evidence. She attends grade school, strengthening both her skills and her personality as it becomes integrated with these new skills. She then sets sight on higher education in order to pursue this goal. Universities have been created as repositories of learning by those with the same characteristics and personality traits as we observe in her. This is one of the reasons why she decides to pick one university over the other \u2013 the appeal of like minds in the pursuit of like goals. She attends this university and eagerly accepts the empirical evidence that is presented to her and the other young, bright minds who are her fellow students. These students graduate and become scientists in the pursuit of new empirical evidence. Each one uses the evidence that has been gathered and accepted as truth by those before them. Using the analogy of an assembly line (for argument purposes only!), at one end of the line goes the freshman and out the other end comes the scientist . . .having assimilated what they have been presented as true. I am not saying that this is wrong. We do our very best with the knowledge we have at the moment. As author Neale Donald Walsch stated, \u201cNo-one does anything inappropriate, given their view of the world.\u201d This applies to the beneficial as well as the detrimental. Every scientist would say, \u201cI am a scientist.\u201d We understand what this label means. Quantum mechanics has disproven the long held view that the being observing and that being observed are two separate entities. One cannot help but influence the other. What came to my mind is that all evidence is subjective, given that each of these scientists who will continue to produce this proof over and over in subsequent testing are of a certain mindset, of similar background and all have very similar training. They fit a mould. It is what makes them scientists and not farmers . . . or prison guards, monks, or exotic dancers. Would the scientific community accept the proof that an exotic dancer has gathered as empirical evidence if he has no scientific background\u2026especially if he came at it with a radical method of information gathering, contrary to the previously established protocol? Would the scientific establishment integrate his findings into their work and allow its publication for public assimilation? Perhaps, but it would be very difficult. And very subjective. I would like to suggest that the evidence that we accept as empirical is subjectively gathered by a body of individuals that use their subjective individuation in an attempt to identify that which does not change. At best they can only \u201crealize\u201d a reasonable facsimile. I have considered the creative ability of each of those individuals and their innate ability to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d - to manifest into this world, through imaginative theories and testing - fresh new empirical evidence\u2026 Regardless of how radically aligned with the creative force this person may be, the experience is still subject to his or her perceptual filters. As an individualized aspect of the collective, this has been my (subjective) experience with all forms of creativity. For any of us, even those with extended longevity, the very short linear timeframe in which we have flourished, as well as our subjectivity to the laws of this realm, does not lend itself to a comprehensive and objective viewpoint. We are at best, a clear filter, but a filter nonetheless. Our limited intellectual capacity does not allow for comprehension of the whole. Considering this, I contend that, perhaps, the same line of reasoning can be applied to the spiritual aspect of knowledge gathering. My point is this \u2013 The Truth remains unchanged regardless of my interpretation (perception) of it. Just because the whole world believes something is true does not make it True. My conception of unchanging Truth as objective fact, to me, is what Truth may be. All else is subjective. ",

            "answer_text": "God is the absolute reality hence invisible The unimaginable concept of God is not from the side of God. It is only from your side since it is your defect. Your imagination cannot transcend the dimensions of space to understand God, who is beyond space, being the creator of space. God is the absolute reality and the space along with consequent creation is a relative reality. This point keeps God beyond space. This point cannot be sacrificed because the creation including space can be possible and under the full control of God only, if God alone is the absolute reality. If both God and creation are absolute realities, the control of God on creation becomes impossible. If both are absolute realities, you can see God in the space itself. But, there cannot be two absolute realities. Absolute reality can be one only. Otherwise, there is no possibility of creation. The concept of creation comes into the picture only when one absolute reality exists and creates the relative reality. A real rope cannot create a real snake. A real rope can create a false snake as an illusion. Therefore, to see the absolute God, you have to make the world as another absolute reality and in such case the creation becomes impossible. All this is the technical difficulty in the process of creation and hence it is inevitable. If you understand this analysis, you will not mistake God as sadist troubling you by hiding Himself. All this analysis is given by Shankara. [All these information are regarding the absolute God, but such God comes in human form to allow us to see Him, through the human incarnation] Why God has to come in human form at all\u2026 God is unimaginable and hence, cannot be even imagined by even sharp intelligence. Therefore, there is no possibility of any kind of interaction with God. God knows all of us, but, we can never know God. Hence, the interaction with unimaginable God is one sided only. But, we like to have an interaction, which is in both sides. We like to know, see, talk, touch and live with God. We like to serve God because service is the practical proof of love or devotion to God. For this purpose, God comes down in the same medium in which we exist. Hence, God comes in human form. If God comes in the form of an inert object, our service becomes impossible. For the sake of inert objects, He has to come in the inert form. But, the inert objects do not interact at all. If He comes down as a bird or animal, the birds and animals may interact and the human beings cannot interact. In such case, you cannot talk with God since you cannot talk with a bird or animal. We cannot clarify our doubts with God in such case. If God comes down in the energetic form, we cannot touch God and cannot live with Him for a long time. Therefore, the human form is the best suited to the human beings. The energetic form of God is relevant to the departed souls existing in the energetic bodies in the upper worlds. But, the human form of God is not easily available. Even if it is easily available, most of the human beings suffer with ego and jealousy towards a co-human form. Any human being does not agree the greatness of a co-human being. Therefore, the human incarnation interacts with those few selected devotees only, who conquered the ego and jealousy. For other human beings, the human incarnation behaves like a co-human being only following the usual social norms. Krishna behaved like a human being only with all the people and behaved like God for His close devotees. Therefore, God comes down for the needy only. ",

            "answer_text": "This is really two questions. The first is, \u201cIs there an objective reality?\u201d The second is, \u201cIs that reality knowable?\u201d The objective reality is that every thing and idea is comprised of something and nothing and the Source of every thing and idea is both something and nothing. The bigger question is whether it is possible to know what it is that is both something and nothing. We can know it intellectually as Possibility. We can also know it experientially by resonating with Possibility as the un-Caused Cause. Aside from going through the process of finding and identifying with what we essentially are, we can just be it. The disadvantage of just being who and what you are is that if you don\u2019t first have an intellectual understanding of the objective reality of Possibility as the Source and as the supplier of infinite complexity, it\u2019s easy to lose track of who and what you are.

How can you know otherwise? It is possible that some people (i.e., prophets) have magical, transcendent abilities to discern truths about reality. It is also possible that even if you currently lack such abilities, you have latent abilities that could someday be revealed. Unfortunately, to judge such abilities, you must first have such abilities. Anil Thomas\u2019 answer here is an excellent test case. From my perspective, his answer is \u2018word salad\u2019; I can\u2019t even tell if it answers the question asked. ",

If we can all see it and agree on its properties, then the objective truth is that there is a light in the sky. And we can be sure of everything about the light that we all agree upon. Our world is built from interaction. Ninety-nine point nine per cent of our activities are based around objects, phenomena and events that other people can observe and agree with us upon. Anyone who deviates very far below that figure is a candidate for protective custody.
