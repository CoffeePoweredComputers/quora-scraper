            "answer_text": "Firstly such a situation would require there was something able and capable of \u2018starting up\u2019 reality prior to realities coming into being. Which implies that something existed prior to reality??? Which is a nonsense. So is it preordained?No! If it did exist then it is merely a part of reality itself as an existent, and hence not prior to reality at all. Reality is an ongoing process that is permanently undergoing change, forever. The notion that it was preordained implies it is like an entity that has a teleological \u2018beginning\u2019 and necessarily an \u2018ending\u2019 and that it was intentionally wound up set on a course by some power beyond reality itself (just like would be the case with a human inventor/creator-which is what this \u2018god\u2019 model is based on) Religious folk could and would argue that the power that set \u2018reality\u2019 on its way is and was a disembodied god. Consequently, such a god is asserted to be outside of reality. He/she/it is the god outside the machine. An idea that was associated with early mechanics and the analogy that god was like a great inventor/creator (of a machine). Such a god would have no part to play within reality, but rather would be just the instigator of \u2018reality\u2019 no more, no less. His/Her/Its only access would be via \u2018miracles\u2019 Interventions that went against the regulatory nature of the creation itself - that he/she/it invented initially. Such a belief is an article of faith with no evidence to support it beyond \u2018faith\u2019 and a belief that it might be so. The \u2018Big Bang\u2019 theory also has a theoretical beginning. But being scientific notion is has nothing to say about a power beyond reality, as science only occupation is attempting to arrive at empirical facts, and these exist only within reality. What is reality? No one knows the answer to this enigma. After 2500 years of reasoning and rationality we are no closer to understanding reality with even a remote understanding and even less of certainty. What science teaches us is how to \u2018use\u2019 aspects of said reality for our own human benefit, that is to utilises it as a utility for our own benefit, regardless of the consequences. The only reality you or I are capable of comprehending is the relative reality we call our lives; our dynamic interactions and ongoing participation in this \u2018reality\u2019 that we call our environment(s) of which we are a part. Beyond that all is conjecture, religious and or intellectual speculation, but no knowledge, no facts, just guesswork, some notions more interesting than others but eventually, mere supposition. Reality is a generic term for all the infinite interactions between space, time and its contents, including us and the billions of universes existing \u2018out there\u2019 in space. All this, however, is just language (This article and indeed all attempts to name entities and non-entities are mere words). And reality? whatever it is or contains is beyond our comprehension, and beyond mere words. All we know is what we learn from our immediate environment and what we have been taught via education, and this knowledge is changing as we learn more, as we grow older. And so it will be forever. The notion of certainty is only for religious believers, as articles of faith, for the rest of us there are only moments of awe in a lifetime that is a mere instant in a time-frame beyond our comprehension, a timeframe of billions, if not trillions of our life \u2018years\u2019. How could a mere part understand the whole? On lighter note, but nonetheless touching on the topic, comes this:- \u201cAs you travel on through life, no matter what your goal, Keep your eye upon the donut and not upon the hole\u201d. Written on the wall of a donut shop somewhere in the antipodes. ",

            "answer_text": "It is as much preordained as you may believe, and it can grow as much chaotically as you will dare to allow. \u201cPre\u201d assumes time, which is but a convenience compression dimension to allow our limited minds to comprehend what is. Reality is subjective, and in this subjectivity the notion of time is different to each observer. There is no actual way to read the book in advance, but to know that there is no ultimate \u201ctime\u201d, your transition through temporal states is statically eternal, at each and only one present moment which only exists, in our eternally missed present, we discuss what \u201cwas\u201d and what \u201cwill\u201d, but there never was, have you ever been to \u201cyesterday\u201d? it is only a dream in your mind, have you ever been to-\u201dmorrow\u201d? it is an imagination. Present time as well is a dream, since we never live in it. Our present moment is just a de-fibrillation between figments of static impressions (\u201cmemories\u201d from the \u201cpast\u201d and \u201cimaginations\u201d of \u201cfuture\u201d). If we ever were to wake up to the present moment, time would cease to exist, and we would stand eternal beyond space and time. in that spell of ignorance is broken, and we stand tall above all lies to see everything is, not pre- and not -post, just is, a painting, full, with any path across it telling a different tail, of a different life, we can live them all, or we can die on each and every one.
