            "answer_text": "It depends on what it takes for something to have a \u201cpoint\u201d. Assume, for the sake of discussion, that there is no life after death. I will die someday, and, after enough time has passed, all memory of my having existed will be lost. At that point, the world will be no different (in any way that anyone could detect) than if I had not been here at all. For many people, my passing into that level of complete oblivion makes my life meaningless, without a point. That\u2019s because they subscribe to a standard that, to have a point, something must have permanent effects. That standard renders all our lives \u201cpointless and meaningless\u201d. Hell, if you wait long enough (or stand back far enough) the entire history of life on Earth is \u201cmeaningless\u201d because it has no truly lasting impact. The Earth and the Sun will someday be gone and then forgotten, yet the larger universe of billions of galaxies will sail on without anyone being aware that we ever were here. Pretty depressing, right? This desire for permanence, for making a mark that will \u201cnever be forgotten\u201d is part of the reason that most people believe they face an endless future, after death. We are repelled at the thought of not existing, and being forgotten. However, in my opinion, this is the wrong standard for counting something as meaningful or important, the wrong standard for truly mortal beings (if that is what we are) to adopt. It is basing your own self-worth on something that you cannot have. Instead, as impermanent things, we should find meaning in impermanent things: relationships, experiences, goals and causes that give us purposes around which to orient our lives. The fact that all the things I concern myself with will pass away is not a reason to not care about them. It\u2019s not quite accurate to say I am giving them their point. Rather I find a point in them, something about them is compelling, and that\u2019s enough. ",
