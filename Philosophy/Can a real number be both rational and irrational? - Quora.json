            "answer_text": "No, and the reason is actually quite beautiful. A rational number is defined as a ratio of two integers. An irrational number is defined as any real number that is not rational. Because the irrationals are defined in this way, it is impossible for these two sets of numbers to share even a single element. Another example of such a relationship between two types of numbers is even and odd numbers. If we define the \u201ceven\u201d numbers as all the integers that are \u201cevenly\u201d divided by 2 (i.e. no remainders after the division) and define the \u201codd\u201d numbers as all the integers that are not even, then there will be no integers that are both even and odd. Not only that, but there are also no integers that are neither even nor odd. Together these two sets include all the integers but do not share any integers in common. Every integer must be either one or the other. And that\u2019s because of the way they are defined. In fact, whenever you define anything as not-something-else (which is called a definition \u201cby negation\u201d), the two \u201cthings\u201d will never share even one instance in common, regardless of what the definition of the first \u201cthing\u201d is. And that is what is so beautiful about definitions by negation: they provide a nice clean smooth break between two sets with no ambiguity between them. ",

Here\u2019s a thought: Take some irrational, let\u2019s say \u03c0\u03c0as a popular example, and divide it by a rational natural number such as nn Rational or irrational ? Irrational. Now let n\u2192n\u2192 something large. People like to say infinity, but they lack a grasp of that. It\u2019s out of reach. \u03c0n\u03c0ncontinues to be irrational But what is the limiting value? It appears to be zero. Which we think of as a ratio. Rational. Although I\u2019m not sure we should. This exposes the dangers of thinking that a limit (\u201ctends to\u201d) is the same as an actual equality. Which is short-hand (short-brained) thinking involving \u2018algebraic completion\u2019. Old-school mathematical dinosaurs maintain the distinction. Others are sloppy. Which is irrational. ",

            "answer_text": "Irrationality of a number is defined as the negation (the opposite) of rationality of a number. Therefore, no (real) number could be simultaneously a rational number and an irrational number, just as no subset A of a non-empty set X could have anything in common with its own complementary set X-A, because, by definition, what is in X-A is not in A, and what is in A is not in X-A. The Pythagoreans believed that if X is the set of all real numbers and A is the set of all rational numbers in X, then X-A is an empty set, that is, there are no irrational numbers (according to their mentor, Pythagoras) but Euclid proved that X-A is a nonempty set by showing that sqrt(2) is not in A (that is, it is impossible to represent sqrt(2) as a quotient of two integers) and therefore sqrt(2) is in X-A, and therefore X-A is non-empty!!! There is a legend that already one of Pythagoras\u2019 students has found a proof that the sqrt(2) is irrational, and he was taken by other students to sail on a boat and he never returned from that trip.
