            "answer_text": "Of course not. The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates could not have possibly been a Christian because he was born in around 470 BC or thereabouts and he was put to death in 399 BC. Jesus of Nazareth, the man whom Christians revere as the Messiah and as God incarnate, was probably born sometime roughly between 8 BC and 4 BC. Jesus probably began his public ministry in around 29 AD, around 428 years after Socrates\u2019s death. Jesus\u2019s crucifixion occurred either in 30 AD or in 33 AD. The eight authentic Pauline Epistles, the earliest surviving Christian writings, were written between c. 49 AD and c. 65 AD. The four canonical gospels were written between c. 70 AD and c. 130 AD, with the Gospel of Mark being the earliest and the Gospel of John being the latest. Historically speaking, there is no sense in which Socrates can legitimately be considered to have been a \u201cChristian.\u201d  ABOVE: Roman marble bust of Socrates from the Vatican Museums, a copy of an earlier fourth-century BC Greek original Nonetheless, even though Socrates was certainly not a Christian historically speaking, that did not stop early Christians from co-opting him as a sort of \u201cproto-Christian.\u201d The influential Christian Church Father Ioustinos Martyros (lived c. 100 \u2013 c. 165 AD) claimed that \u201cthe seeds of the Word\u201d (\u03c3\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5) had been planted in the minds of human beings long before the origins of Christianity. According to Ioustinos Martyros, many renowned ancient Greek philosophers, including both Socrates and Plato, did, in fact, unknowingly espouse Christian doctrines because they had received the \u201cseeds of the Word.\u201d Many other early Christians believed in this idea and it provided a handy excuse for Christians to adapt Greek philosophy for Christian purposes. This allowed the Greek philosophical tradition to continue even after the Greco-Roman world converted to Christianity. Furthermore, Plato\u2019s account in his dialogue Phaidon of Socrates\u2019s execution by the Athenians in 399 BC in which he was forced to drink hemlock served as a model for Christian stories of martyrdom. The fact that Socrates chose to die for his beliefs made him seem to many Christians like a sort of \u201cproto-martyr.\u201d  ABOVE: The Death of Socrates, painted in 1787 by the French Neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David. This painting shows Socrates\u2019s execution in which he was forced to drink hemlock. Plato\u2019s portrayal of the death of Socrates served as a model for Christian stories of martyrdom. ",

            "answer_text": "Socrates lived between 469- 369 B.C., so he was not a Christian. Socrates is one of the most representative philosophers of all the time. His ideas have something in common with the Christianity, but he was an original philosopher\u2026par excellence Like Jesus, he spoke about love, but in a different way, though in very eloquent manner. He was able to teach people how to manage their life in a detached manner, so we could say he knew what love means - the real thing, not a religious/ speculative version of it. Socrates was interested in ideas/ lessons concerning knowledge. He also spoke about a superior being - a divine one - in a very inspiring manner. His disciple Plato - the most renowned one - developed his ideas in a very eloquent/ sophisticated manner. Many philosophers were influenced/ inspired by his ideas. Xenophon - another pupil of Socrates - related many of the discussions of his master in \u201cMemories about Socrates\u201d. Socrates spoke about anything\u2026 all the time. He loved philosophy. That was his passion / vocation. But, unfortunately for him, he was too passionate in his teachings and because of that he was condemned to death by some political persons from his time. His death was a big tragedy for Greece, because he was condemned in a very unfair manner. We could say that there is a similarity between his death and Jesus's one. Both of them were martyrs. Jesus was crucified for his very good deeds. The same thing was happening with Socrates too. We might say that Socrates was a precursor of Jesus. Anyway, each of them deserved to be praised for their lives/teachings. We must keep in our mind his love for knowledge, which is the most important thing for an human being and in the same time, a totally necessity. The most renowned sentence of Socrates remains this one: \u201call I know is I know nothing\u201d, which is a paradigmatic one for his modesty about his knowledge and wisdom. ",
