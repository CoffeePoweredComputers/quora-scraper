When I was younger I was bullied and told by many people that I was worthless and I believed them. I was told by my own father that I was an idiot. I was told by teachers and bosses that I would never make it. I am hardly alone in this. Many people have been told by friends, relatives, coworkers, bosses, spouses, classmates, coworkers, strangers and others that they were worthless or ugly or not good enough or many other negative things and this has had a huge impact on those that choose to believe these \u2018truths\u2019.
