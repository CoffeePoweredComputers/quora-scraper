            "answer_text": "That\u2019s an interesting question. Nothing means nothing - the absence of anything. Space is not like that. It\u2019s teeming with energy. It\u2019s a thing intertwined with time to create the flexible fabric of spacetime. However, we don\u2019t know whether nothing exists because we haven\u2019t observed it anywhere in our universe. That may sound like an oxymoron - not having observed nothing. But to me, \u201cnothing\u201d remains a concept only. Everywhere we look, there is only stuff. Outside of the horizon of our universe, we give up and say \u201cthere\u2019s nothing out there.\u201d But again, based on what? ",

            "answer_text": "Things exist in space. Space itself is the absence of things (between them and within them on micro-scale. )The absence of things is also called a void, i.e., no thing. Quantum physics is fond of claiming that there is no empty space. That would make the universe a solid block of \u201cstuff\u201d with no empty space between things. That is nonsense. Your second question doesn\u2019t make sense. It treats a void (emptiness) as a thing. ",

Yes there is nothingness but that is not the same as non-existence. ",

According to physicists, there is no absolute nothing. There are vacuums. Vacuums are a case of nothing of that to an ever finer but never perfect degree. Even quantum vacuums are not nothing at all, for they seethe with virtual particles winking in and out of existence and are bathed in fields. ",
