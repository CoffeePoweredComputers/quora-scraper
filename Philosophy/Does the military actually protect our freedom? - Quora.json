            "answer_text": "No. By no means at all. Hitler & Imperial Japan were truly a threat to freedom period anywhere on Earth. The cold war with Russia was a stalemate. If anything, what they are doing now is compromising it by pissing off the world. If our military truly was fighting to retain freedom for the American people, they would then be fighting the genuine threat to freedom that continuously & systemmatically persists in slowly taking it away. I do not see where people get the notion of having much freedom to protect. The land of the free has the largest population of incarcerated people on the planet, & half of those imprisoned do not even have a victim or anyone to suffer whatsoever as a result of their actions. I myself was given 1.5 years in prison for a 4 gram pinch of weed I possessed. Every move we make is illegal in a sense unless the government profits from it. Practically have to pay just to take a crap these days. Nearly any licensing that is required pretty much equals a right that was stolen from us to then be sold back to us. If I were to get a ticket for not wearing a seatbelt, refused to pay it, they would come with a warrant to arrest me. If I then flat out resisted in refusal to comply, which is by the way , everyone\u2019s patriotic duty to resist unjust law, by doing so they would ultimately shoot me dead over a $25 infraction still being a crime. My county once sent men with guns to collect me for $30 that I still owed on a $370 fine. It is the peoples\u2019 duty to resist unjust laws imposed on us. Never will freedom be retained otherwise unless the people demand it. Our patriotic duty & sworn duty of lawmen & military to uphold & protect the exercising of that duty. With a very real reason why the oath of service includes domestic enemies as well as foreign. I cannot think of one freedom that Saddam took from me, or Korea, or Vietnam, Afghanistan, on n on n on. Those who hate us for our freedoms are those who are actually taking it at gunpoint. This is overall lengthy but I want to add this example. Alot of folksthink I talk shit ,yet it is they who do so with tucked tails. As one of my favorite pastimes, I go straight for prominent people of acedemia & elected officials. This is one mere example, they never utter one word in response\u2026checkmate. This one is to a Prosecuting Attorney himself, not one of his subordinates\u2026 Awhile back I saw an article in the newspaper about a Noble Co. man who was sentenced to 45 years for dealing meth & firearm possession. The prosecutor,  Eric D. Blackman       was talkin tough & proud as if he had accomplished something to be proud of. I called him out.The people should realize it is actually people like him who are the true criminals & enemies of the state. Prosecutors & judges are among the cancer cells of corruption that have rotted the bottom out of our rights & justice system. Why? For one, they have to spend many years as one of the lowest forms of scum before graduating to their positions. What scum of the earth strives to set free those who rape, rob,& kill for personal monetary gain to promote to highly regarded upholders of justice? Defense attorneys. So when I challenged domestic enemy Blackman with the following inquiry, what he said back to me was.......not a g**damned word. Fools. Explain to me.... Since they are the exact same thing, what gives government the audacity or the right to sell meth to children under the guise of adhd medication? The only strong message I see on drug dealers in your county is that you DO tolerate it ,just depends on who is selling them. Unless you can cough up one single person that this man forced into buying kids' meds...I mean meth, then you have unjustly deprived him of half his life for a victimless crime. It is matter of factly patriotic DUTY TO RESIST unjust laws imposed upon the people, and an elected official's SWORN duty to uphold justice.   Like every inch of the rest of the nation, surely you have seen a quite noticable spike in arrests and presence of Heroin? Being nothing more than a fraudulent ponzi scheme, the war on drugs is the longest lasting and costliest war in Americas history. Not one rung up the ladder has law made it in 40 years of the drug war. Why? Because it is indeed a ponzi scheme designed to bilk the people of and generate wealth for the state.   If what I say sounds ridiculous, prove it Mr. \"Prosecutor.\" Are you smarter than a 5th grader? I hope so because it would take a 5th grader within an hour to see, so explain how come...... Taliban had the Heroin industry buckled and on it's knees in having the poppy fields nearly eradicated prior to U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, where 90% of the poppy population required for Heroin grows. After U.S. took occupation of Afghanistan, Heroin production shot through the roof to record high levels. Loads of pictures and video showing our troops guarding poppy fields. Now do you believe Taliban, Al Qaeda, Isis or the likes are responsible for this influx of Heroin? If you do, then how dare you slap the people in their faces for assuming us so stupid to believe that law and government can protect us from what a man is thinking and potentially acting out in an act of terrorism. If terrorists had the ability to disperse a substance across the nation in such manner and time, do not you think half the population would be dead and America buckled by now? So unless you have the pair it takes to start climbing the ladder and producing results to show progress in moving up that ladder, you Sir, are nothing more than a treasonous rat like the rest of them. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a5gq4e4QHJU Afghanistan Heroin Trade Run by Congress, Bush Family and Bank of Americavia torchbrowser com Drug Wars: 70% of the heroin in US streets comes from Afghanistan - Jim Willie ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cFreedom\u201d is a tricky concept as there are several meanings: pure oxygen is free of contaminants from other chemicals, inmates in the US prison are free from the need to cook for themselves but they are not free to travel as they wish. Arguments that something supports freedom of one type may demonstrate that the something restricts or eliminates freedom of another type. Without some clarity, one can easily be intellectually bamboozled. The Liberal philosophy that underpinned the founding of the US generally referred to the rights and liberties of individuals when using the word \u201cfreedom\u201d. To protect rights and liberties people formed governments with specific responsibilities: to protect the Commonwealth from external threats, to protect individuals from the coercion of other individuals (coercion against their persons or their property), and to enforce the agreements (contracts) necessary for peaceful human interaction and exchange of their labor and property. Fulfillment of the first of these responsibilities requires a military of some sort. But the military is a tool of government and can be used by the government to protect rights and liberties (freedoms in that sense) or to violate those rights and liberties and prevent their exercise by the people. The government can also use a military for other, unrelated purposes. Perhaps you are questioning whether the government is using the military for legitimate purposes (protection of the society from external threats) or for other, illegitimate purposes. That is a very good question. The attacks on the World Trade Center \u2013 in September 2001, and earlier \u2013 are the kinds of things we legitimately expect government to protect us from. But it was too late once the attackers got on board the aircraft, and subsequent investigations revealed that the attacks were organized and planned by forces outside of the country. It was apparent that, for the government to do its job properly, the government must operate outside of the US, attacking organizations that were planning to harm us. As we have organized our government, this meant we needed to use the military.  Whether or not we needed to remain at war, fighting foreign entities and killing people, for 13 years is a very good question. But the question really is not whether the military is protecting our freedoms but whether the government is appropriately using the military or whether the government is inappropriately using a military for other purposes. Inappropriate use of government power is always a danger and we should always be on guard against it. So, in my opinion, a more appropriate question is \u201cIs the government using the military to protect our rights and liberties or is it using the military inappropriately?\u201d I think it is mixed. We have an enemy that is actively working to harm our society and us as individuals and has been doing so for several decades. Our government has been actively using our military to fight this threat for only 13 years; perhaps we should continue to use the military to fight the continuing threat or perhaps we should withdraw the military and use other means that the government has at its disposal. The military is a very blunt tool and its continued use may no longer be appropriate. It seems that the government has been using the military for other purposes and that the military has, on occasion, been acting to pursue its own interests and the interests of senior officers and the several military branches. I think the country needs the debate your question has triggered. ",

            "answer_text": "Like most things in life, the answer is probably \"It's complicated.\" Protecting the freedom and safety of US Citizens is undoubtedly the goal of most service members.  Every soldier, airman, marine, or sailor I have known has articulated this as the core of their service (along with more practical concerns like paying the bills, career training, etcetera). Some military operations and interventions do undoubtedly make US citizens safer.  Dead terrorists are preferable to living ones, in my humble opinion. For example - unless you buy into one of the variety of 9/11 \"Truther\" conspiracies (I do not), the Afghan conflict can easily be seen as an effort to seek retribution for those responsible for one of the bloodiest acts of terrorism in our nation's history.  In our attempt to eradicate the Taliban and Al Qaeda, we also sent a message - basically, don't fuck with us, you won't like what happens next.  (Whether the message actually deterred anyone is up for debate, I suppose.) Without any military, our freedom would certainly be in jeopardy as well as our safety. But the military, like any large organization, is a complicated entity.  It is wielded by politicians, who often have motives that are (at best) also complicated. Our foreign policy has at times been disastrous in its long term effects.  Our wars have not always been waged with clear goals, or clear moral rationale.  I said earlier that I prefer dead terrorists to live ones; I also prefer that people not become terrorists, and in some cases our government has actively created the terrorists our soldiers have later faced. A lot of people point to this as evidence of vast corruption on the part of our politicians, or of the insidious influence of the military industrial complex.  In my mind, such summations - while they may contain more than a few grains of truth - are overly simplistic (even when they're hopelessly convoluted).  The world is too complex to reduce our nation's history of wars to some sort of economic conspiracy on the part of Lockheed Martin; that sort of reasoning is intellectually lazy. The reality is, we live in a fractured, broken, complicated, unpredictable world, filled with imperfect humans who make at least as many bad choices as good ones.  So, yes, some of our conflicts have been ill-advised, and some of our military actions have been questionable.  We have committed atrocities, and we have created future enemies. I hate to sound trite, but what do you expect?  Perfection?  That's an ideal to strive toward, but its unachievable.  That doesn't mean we don't strive to do better, but it does mean that the mistakes, fuckups, and tragedies don't somehow overrule or blot out the good that's been done. You may disagree with the war on terror, and you may have good reasons for doing so.  You can point to atrocities and abuses committed by our country, and you'd be right.  But it's hard to argue that we're the bad guys in a war against people who behead journalists on video, throw acid on young women's faces, or gun down children looking for an education. Our national motives may not always be completely pure, and our methods may not always live up to our best ideals.  But if it comes down to it, there's us, and we're imperfect - and then there's evil.  The conflict is always going to be messy. On the balance of things, our servicemen do far more good than bad in the world.  They carry on traditions of duty, honor, brotherhood, and dedication to country that are sadly lacking in many quarters of our society.  And any one of them would give their life to protect our country, even if it is an imperfect place. So, in my opinion, yes, they do protect my freedom, and yours. ",

These decisions were created for many reasons none relevant to you and your freedom. Such as: Power hunger.Natural resources.Expanding land.Votes.Ideological differences (economical, religious, philosophical, racial, etc.).In other words it's like the mayor of your town likes to blaze the woods next door on fire so you guys have to pay for a fire department and be told they are there to protect you when in fact they protect the mayor house.  When a war breaks out. Do you see soldiers protecting your house or neighborhood? No they protect critical infrastructure such as media towers and power stations (not for you, but for the supply lines). Do you see the military protecting you or yours? No they protect the political elite. In other words you will be protected if you only work for the supply lines of militaries. Not completely though - you are just an asset. In answer to your question the military is not there for you nor your freedom. It's there to prevent or create or resolve conflicts you have nothing to do with but with the people in political power.  You are as valuable as cattle to farmers. Your value is your GDP PPP you contrbuite to the economy.  Yet we need that wasteful war machines to prevent wars because of the other political elite\u2019s dumbassery around the globe. If you ask me the answer to world peace is to put nuclear missiles in all world countries, disband militaries. Any country form a military and start worrying the world is nucked out of existence. We need to see it happening ONCE. Boom thousands of years without conflict. ",

Since basically the Civil War, our government has used the military to further either a political agenda such as stomping out Communism or lining their pockets by forcing American businesses down the throat of a foreign country. Anytime a country's leader,  which has been economically conquered by America, wants to either use their country's resources to enrich his own people or take its resources back from foreign companies, America steps in and intervenes. In the news it will be spun to show that America is the good guy and this awful dictator had to go. If they can not spin it that way they just use a coup or assassination to get what they want. Some of the military understands this but still wants to believe that they are doing it to save the oppressed. In their head they know that it usually is not true, but they want to believe it is, so many begin believing that they are fighting for freedom of the others who can't. The men and women of the U.S. military have to fight for what they believe is right. They get no benefits from the wealthy businessmen or politicians who get rich from war.   ",

            "answer_text": "Individual members of the military fight because they are ordered to do so, and sworn to obey their orders. The reason for the fight lies with the agendas and motives of the ones giving the orders. Sometimes it can be difficult to discern exactly what justifies the military operations. In recent history, we've seen the First Gulf War, whose purpose seemed clear enough: liberate Kuwait and remove the threat to Saudi Arabia. The mission was clear, and achievement could be effectively measured. Indeed, all this happened. The Second Gulf War was not so clear cut. Saddam's opponents believed (so they said) he illegally possessed WMD's (weapons of mass destruction). He was challenged to disclose them to inspectors and get rid of them, otherwise we would attack and do the job ourselves. He did not comply, so we went to war. And while the initial combat operations are long over, the war has transformed into the ugly conflict we pursue at this moment. And no WMD's were ever discovered. The problem with this war was that there was no clearly defined final disposition; it was assumed that the native population would endorse a democratic government. They did not. The \"war on terror\" is a bit more accessible in terms of understanding the threat, especially when it takes shape within our own borders. But it is much more difficult to \"fight.\" So, how does any of this relate to \"fighting for freedom?\" The answer is historical. After WWII, military and policy thinkers realized that the continental US was not protected by the oceans separating it from the rest of the world. Thus a deliberate decision was made to abandon an isolationist approach, and arrange for any future engagements to be fought \"over there.\" Not here. Together with an expanding global military presence, a global economy (with foreign oil as a key component) created situations in which the US economy -and therefore, its people- could be put at risk in many new ways. While our \"freedom\" might not be challenged by attacking hordes on our own shores, it certainly could be compromised by challenges to our economic and political strength, world-wide. And so, protection of our \"interests\" takes shape in many and varied operations, all of which may be collectively understood as \"taking the fight to the enemy.\" The fighting itself, as visceral as ever, finds justification in much more abstract areas. Hope that helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A In every way possible within the confines of fiscal reality. It\u2019s not purely altruistic, America\u2019s economy is somewhat dependent on free trade (as is the rest of the developed world) but we have most to lose since our economy is the biggest. That\u2019s a big part of why the US through it\u2019s Navy takes on the burden of keeping the sea lanes free and open world wide. Before the US the UK had the biggest colonial shipping empire the world had ever seen. \u201cThe sun never sets on the UK\u201d was a popular phrase 100 years ago because the UK was everywhere. In order to protect and manage their assets the UK had the largest Navy from the time of wooden ships until the time of the battleship. It was only with WW2 and the rise of the aircraft carrier (and America\u2019s industrial revolution being turned into the manufacturing powerhouse it is with regard to making weapons of war) that the balance of power in terms of world Navies shifted. There can be little argument that the US is the foremost proponent of democracy. It turns out that democracy is good for world peace because democracies almost never go to war with each other. As despotism and totalitarian regimes have faded from the world stage or been kept in check by American military might the ability to wage war globally has basically been eradicated. All the wars since WW2 have primarily involved two adjacent countries and/or the US because no country has the might to project their military around the world without the tacit approval of the USA. It\u2019s hard to argue that this isn\u2019t a massive benefit to freedom. Additionally if world opinion is strong enough and the cost low enough the USA has interjected it\u2019s military might into local conflicts in the name of freedom and protecting civilians. Kosovo is a perfect example. There was little benefit to the US but we still spent our treasure and blood to help eradicate the genocide taking place at the hands of the Serbs. I\u2019m sure a lot of people in American government would like to do more to make Africa safer but it\u2019s a giant quagmire that would cost billions or trillions and even after we left would fall into the same patterns of destruction. Corruption seems to be the one constant in Africa. Sadly the only two countries in Africa with a well oiled economy an a surplus of trade were both oppressive racists states (South Africa and Rhodesia) and once the were liberated both suffered a massive increase in violence and a massive decrease in GDP. They both have a negative trade balance and a crumbling economy. Despite previously being first world countries, neither has had a trade surplus under a black leader. EVER. Because of the rampant corruption that now is the norm I would be shocked if things changed any time soon if ever. Hard for America to justify getting involved in all the warfare in Sub-Saharan Africa as there is little likelihood of making things better. Sadly Islamic terrorism loves instability. In the face of weak corrupt governments and endless tribal violence and genocidal wars terrorism flourishes and ISIS/al-qeada support is rampant in Africa. Eventually Nato or America will likely have to confront the enemies of freedom and peace in Africa as well. These graphics are a few years old but it\u2019s the rise of the USA and other democracies that have made this the case. increased lifespans  less poverty  less war people always want to doubt this one because the news is full of war but it\u2019s less common and less deadly because America spends so much money avoiding unnecessary loss of life.  progress  you can read the full article here: 5 Reasons Why 2013 Was The Best Year In Human History ",

In 1904, Secretary of War Elihu Root reoriented the Army away from constabulary duties to a mission focused on defeating the conventional forces of other nation-states. This view has shaped United States military culture since at least World War II and continues to this day. Whether the rationale of a modern war against terrorism, again, changes the military's mission towards domestic order is yet to be seen. Many of the men who met in Philadelphia to draft the U.S. Constitution had the experience of serving with the Continental Army.  Our nation's Founders like George Washington, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton were  aware of the dangers external enemies posed to the new republic. The British and Spanish were not only on the frontiers of the new nation. In many cases they were within the frontiers, allying with the Indians and attempting to entice frontier settlements to split off from the country. The Constitutional Convention voted on, and accepted, the need for a standing army but sought to maintain control by the appropriations power of Congress, which the Founders viewed as the branch of government closest to \"the people\".

This is not to say that the two aren't aligned, but it would be remiss of me to ignore the fact that they aren't aligned universally.  I served in the US Navy, and at the very least while I served I believed that I was serving the best interests of the United States. At worst I felt used for a higher agenda, and perhaps that's where you question lies.  Insomuch as the military serves the interest of American citizens, it supports their freedom. Unfortunately, it can and is often used for other reasons. Therefore I can't give you a universal \"yes\" or \"no\" to your question, but I hope you understand.  ",

At no stage was the United States under threat of being invaded. And so life continued on. I suppose you could say they give themselves brownie points for being there ready to defend the freedom and liberties of the United States should they ever come under threat in 2552 AD when the Cyborg King of the New British Solar Empire decides to annex the old colonies with its army of Redcoat Robots. So in short. They are nice and enthusiastic people, but as an American citizen your freedom has never been defended by them. ",

Say, if it was medieval times, the king might decide to let your country\u2019s girls only marry to the invading country\u2019s boys. You might be reduced to a slave.  Your wage would be inferior to the other country\u2019s. In one word, half of your life would be suddenly stolen. A question remains. Why does the military continue to protect people who doubt them? Don\u2019t you realize that they are giving their lives for you, for their families, for their people, and you come here and doubt them? ",

Even those Military members who have yet to serve in combat and those who are privileged to serve during long periods of relative peace are serving the purpose of defending the US. If you feel that the the conflicts we are involved in are not justified, If you believe that the Military is only serving the interest of American Corporations do not blame the Military, The American People elected the Leadership that directs the actions of the Military.

They want their oil. It is just a bad look. They were idiotic not to just to take back the oil in the 1960s. It would have saved a lot of problems and intellectual ambiguity.
