            "answer_text": "TL;DR - Sounds like you want a list of top schools for computer science - tied for first according to one list are: Carnegie Mellon, MIT, Stanford, and UC Berkeley. Longer answer: It seems that you\u2019re making a few unfounded assumptions here about the relationship between weak and strong AI, and machine learning. Your first comment says: \u201cWeak AI => Traditional AI. (not what I am looking for but better than Machine Learning which is not really core of AI)\u201d Okay, I\u2019ll buy the first equivalence that you\u2019re making here, that \u201cweak AI\u201d is more or less the same as \u201ctraditional AI.\u201d Both typically mean handcrafted algorithms designed to solve specific problems. The claim that machine learning \u201cis not really core of AI\u201d confuses me. What do you mean by the \u201ccore\u201d of AI? The only things that I could think of that fit that definition are (1) math, and (2) algorithms, both of which taken together is more or less\u2026 computer science. Okay, so if you\u2019re looking at schools for computer science, here\u2019s one possible list of \u201cbest schools\u201d for it: https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings Of those, I wouldn\u2019t really worry about specific rankings if a school is within plus/minus five or ten ranks of another, since they\u2019re all pretty good places to start looking. I believe every school in the top twenty-five is a research institution. For a PhD, the lab group that you join is much more important than the school ranking, particularly when you get down to the level of wanting to do specific kinds of AI. Your second comment says: \u201cStrong AI => Artificial General Intelligence (what I am asking about)\u201d, but at the same time, you say you don\u2019t mean machine learning. Given what we currently understand about machine learning, I think you\u2019re misunderstanding either machine learning or AGI, or both. Nvidia has a good article talking about the relationship between AI, ML, and deep learning (The Difference Between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning? | NVIDIA Blog). You\u2019ll see that \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d is a catch-all term for a whole slew of techniques that meet the (fairly vague) criteria of making machine \u201cmore human-like.\u201d In the weak AI case, we can make machines fairly human-like through algorithms with very specific use cases. If you describe to me how you do a simple repetitive task, I could probably design an algorithm that mimics that, making an \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d because it behaves in a way that a human would for that task. But for General Artificial Intelligence? That implies a program that can do any intellectual task a human could. The only way of approaching this with a \u201ctraditional\u201d AI is to make a huge, messy pile of specific algorithms for every task that a human might encounter. Except learning. You can\u2019t teach it to learn things, because that would be machine learning. But learning is exactly how humans learn to be \u201cgenerally intelligent\u201d! Babies are pretty dumb, as far as specific \u201cintellectual tasks\u201d go - but they can learn! See the contradiction with excluding machine learning from the task of building AGI? Most things that I\u2019ve ever seen on frameworks for AGI first try to tackle the learning problem, usually in a way that mimics human learning in some way (be it through building neural nets, or learning from demonstration, or reinforcement learning, etc), because there\u2019s no way that we know of where you can build up a \u201cstrong AI\u201d from a domain-specific algorithms. Not that domain-specific algorithms are bad, mind you. This \u201cweak AI\u201d can be very good for many tasks because it leverages domain expert knowledge, and even the best uses of machine learning will often involve manually-provided domain knowledge at some level. I\u2019d recommend looking a bit more into both machine learning and general algorithms before diving too deeply into finding a good PhD program for AGI. ",
