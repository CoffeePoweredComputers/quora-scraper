            "answer_text": "Reality, by definition, is the state of the world in which it actually exist as oppose to ideal or notion of it. Meaning that reality is not perceived. It is the truth, something that is proven by evidence and logic to be factual. A tree falls down in the middle of the forest. Just because no one saw it fall, that doesn\u2019t mean that it didn\u2019t fall. The thing about people is that they tend to think that the truth is whatever they believe to be true. But the truth isn\u2019t base on beliefs. It is base on the facts. Centuries ago, humanity believed that the universe revolve around us. But we later found out that we were wrong after discover the truth through evidence and facts. Like I say, the facts is what makes the truth. An opinion that is believed by many is simply a popular opinion. It cannot be the truth because it is not proven by facts. Just think about it. If the truth is really base on perspective then we\u2019d all be billionaires. We\u2019d all be immortal and omnipotent just by simply alter the truth with our perception. But fact is, we can\u2019t. That\u2019s because the truth in this world can\u2019t be alter by our perspective. That is why we have to work tooth and nail to change our situation. Cause the the truth is not subjected to change. It is objected to change. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a strange question. Most of reality is \u201cin the eye of the beholder\u201d. You know from your physics book that all things \u2014 including humans \u2014 are essentially made of atoms and molecules and thus are \u201cempty space\u201d. Thus what we see and feel as physically solid is just some sort of epiphenomenon. What you see on your computer-screen is a pattern of tiny pixels that become pictures in your brain. A movie is a series of short frames that look like a dia-show for a common fly. What about God or Allah? Are they more than a collective narrative and image in the minds of the true believers? What about Oedipus Complex or Class Struggle? Are they more than theoretical constructs without any scientific base? Thus, even without assuming that the world is a \u201cdelusion created by the matrix\u201d we do not know what \u201creality\u201d comes to. In a sense, only our theories are \u201creally real\u201d. But even those may be wrong in most cases. Thus our concept of reality turns out to be something like \u201cconsistent constructs and assumptions on the the meaning of primary data\u201d. We try to make our theories consistent. But even the notion of consistency is dubious, because even any crazy conspiracy theory (Conspiracy theory - Wikipedia) looks consistent on first sight \u2014 be it Bilderbergers or Chemtrails or Lizards or whatever. Add the countless religious and political denominations to that. Reality is a really delusive and confusing concept. But we humans somehow got along with that and landed modules on Moon and Mars and built working cell-phones and cars and airplanes. It\u2019s a strange world. There are some real forces and some really true mathematical formulas, but most of what we take for granted is just a social convention and a collective myth or narrative to get along. It is about building useful mental constructs that work somehow. ",
