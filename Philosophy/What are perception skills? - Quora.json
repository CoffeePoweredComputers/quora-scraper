            "answer_text": "Simply put perception is what our minds tell us what we've seen with our eyes. What eyes see and what we perceive are two distinct things. What we would see and what we would miss is determined by our terministic screens - filters made up of linguistic materials such as words, phrases and their meaning. Perception skills involve being able to generate multiple perceptions each corresponding to some aspect of reality. An oft cited example is that of a glass half filled with water - alternative perception here is that glass is half empty. Not many people can perceive the possibility of a square being a circle at the same time. But a rotating square is a circle! A hexagone drawn on paper can be seen as a cube in isometric view. In the panchatantra story, the thirsty crow can't reach water at the bottom of a container - he generates alternative perception of \u201cwater reaching him\" instead of him reaching water. He accomplishes this by dropping pebbles into the container to make water reach him. Two women are claiming ownership of an infant. The king has to deliver justice. He orders the infant be cut in two halves and each half given to claimant women. The real owner women says he doesn't want the infant - she would rather let the infant live. The king had an alternative perception of situation. In a factory packing line it was observed some packages went out to market without the intended product in it. Engineers were scratching their heads to come up with some solution that would sense if the product is inside each package. A junior worker perceived situation differently and suggested a powerful fan be kept near inspection station. Strong air blow made empty boxes fly away. Problem solved! Once I saw a girl walking some distance in front of me. She wore a shirt that had an irresistibly good painting on the back. I grew curious. Upon reaching her to closely examine the painting I found out he was a boy - long haired slim boy! My dominant perception (girls have long hair) had misled me to an incorrect perception. People skilled in perception are able to see things differently. They tend to be more creative than the rest of us. This is because, perceptual flexibility is the starting point of creativity. ",
