I actually believe Mk ultra, mockingbird, paperclip, gladiato, phoenix program, Iran/contra, drone strikes, Watergate etc were real until I jumped on David ikes site and read about lizard people now I know it was all made up by conspiracy theory nut jobs.

However, there are those who try to discredit good conspiracy explanatory theory. Some are corporate, some government, some occultist, some all three.

Ok? Good luck learning more. ",
