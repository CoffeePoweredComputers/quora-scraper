            "answer_text": "No, you're engaging in the fallacy of the indeterminate middle. This is because you're using the word \"unanimous\" with two different definitions, but expecting them to be equivalent. A \"unanimous jury\" is different than something simply being \"unanimous\".  This is because the word \"unanimous\", literally meaning 'of one voice', is by definition limited to a specific scope/context.  You cannot simply speak of something being 'unanimous' without specifying the scope because it makes no sense: what does it mean for something to be \"of one voice\" if we don't define the group speaking with that single voice? The law in Arizona requires that one jury - a panel of 12 - be able to speak with one voice.  That panel of 12 isn't allowed to confer with any other group, including the original jury, and so it cannot be said to speak with the same voice as any other group.  In fact, even if two juries agreed - if all 24 came to the same conclusion - you couldn't speak of all 24 as being unanimous because by definition the two panels wouldn't have ever conferred.  True, they'd have reached the same conclusion, but they wouldn't be unanimous because they wouldn't be speaking together.  They'd be of two voices, albeit synchronous voices. ",
