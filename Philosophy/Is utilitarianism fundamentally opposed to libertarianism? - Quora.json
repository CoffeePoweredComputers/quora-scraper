            "answer_text": "There are two main sorts of libertarianism: Deontological libertarianism where the fundamental political concept is the right or self-ownership. And consequentialist libertarianism which basically says that for a given axiology (theory of value), that value will be maximized as a matter of contingent fact through libertarian politics.  Deontological libertarianism is fundamentally opposed to utilitarianism. If the facts turn out that you maximize happiness by redistributing wealth or regulating business more etc, this doesn't tell against deontological libertarianism. This isn't surprising since deontology opposes consequentialism (and hence utilitarianism) generally. Deontological left liberals like John Rawls fundamentally oppose utilitarianism! Consequentialist libertarianism is not necessarily opposed to utilitarianism. If it turns out that the best way to maximize happiness (or preference satisfaction, as the modern utilitarians tend to talk in those terms) is libertarianism, then utilitarianism requires libertarianism! Personally, I find it unbelievably unlikely that the facts of economics and social science turn out that way, as do most prominent utilitarians. Most prominent utilitarians support redistributive taxation. Some are pretty radical, for example Peter Singer criticizes John Rawls' Law of Peoples from an left-cosmopolitan perspective in his short and readable book One World (it's my personal view that Singer misunderstands Rawls, and takes him to be a proto-luck egalitarian, but that's beyond the scope of this answer).  So in most cases yes, libertarianism is fundamentally opposed to utilitarianism.  For there not to be a fundamental opposition requires an unlikely set of facts to obtain.  ",

            "answer_text": "The two are concerned about different aspects of humanity, different philosophical principles.  When application of one principle violates the other, they are in opposition, when there is no cross-violation there is no conflict.  Yet the principle of each dismisses the principle of the other.  In that sense, the two are opposed. The Philosophy of Liberty (from which much of libertarianism descends) is based on the principle that society should be organized and ruled in such a way that each individual has the maximum liberty (immunity from coercion) consistent with all others in society having the same liberty.  As I understand Peter Hawkins, this is deontological libertarianism.  The Philosophy of Liberty (Classical Liberalism) is about the nature of man, his interactions with others, and his interaction with the society in which he lives.   It is not concerned with outcomes. Utilitarianism is concerned with outcomes.  Its fundamental principle is that human interactions and society (including society's government) be organized to achieve the maximum utility - the best outcome.  (The evaluation of outcomes involves entirely separate philosophies.)  If I understand Peter Hawkins correctly, consequential libertarianism is actually a utilitarian theory, not a distinct philosophy. As Rob Weir points out, the term \"utilitarianism\" is broad and amorphous.  As Peter Hawkins explains, the \"libertarianism\" covers ideas consistent with Classical Liberalism as well as ideas that ignore Classical Liberalism.  These make the question a good starting point for wide-ranging discussion but almost impossible to answer.  ",
