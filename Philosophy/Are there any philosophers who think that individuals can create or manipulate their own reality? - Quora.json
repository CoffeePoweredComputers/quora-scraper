Answer: Well quite apart from the philosophers, psychologists and the medical fraternity, including pharmacists, know very well that people significantly create and manipulate their own reality. It\u2019s fundamental to the placebo effect. Placebo - Wikipedia and its fundamental to cognitive behavioural therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy - Wikipedia How you think about life, and how you behave and react to events is known to fundamentally change you physically, your body, your blood pressure, your mood, and your perceptions. The Marketing and Advertising Industries also know that your perceptions and choices can be manipulated, and the advertising industry is a trillion dollar industry precisely because it is known that these techniques of manipulation and influence do work. Change the way someone sees a Red Bull logo, and you change that person\u2019s perceptions, their reality, and their choices. Hope this helps ",
