            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t stress over everything. Do things you like, start things you are interested in. If you think it fits you, meditate (something that seem not yours things may be in the final, in some cases). If it\u2019s the case, change your eating habits, go closer and there, to the person you want to become. Understand yourself and even find good in the little things. If you are not well with yourself talking about appearance, try something new. A new style, hair style, make up, if it\u2019s your thing. Why not go check your health. Take care of mental health as well. How is your relation with others? what do you want to change? do you want to make it stronger? or maybe get out of some toxic relationships? then go do it. Think about what dreams you have, what do you want from your future. Where do you want to be and how you can get there. Stay motivated, or at least do you best to. If you want and hope, there is always a chance (even tho some things won\u2019t come if someone just want them, of course). I hope i helped you even a bit. I wish you luck. ",
