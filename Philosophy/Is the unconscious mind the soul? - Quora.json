            "answer_text": "A seemingly simple, straightforward question. However, there are many levels of understanding and definition involved which could make any answers complicated. Having read some of the answers already submitted, I realise the truth of that statement. The body generates electrical fields, sometimes referred to as the etheric and the aura. They both have various levels / depths which, to some, are \u201cvisible\u201d. To those who can routinely see the aura, it can be an indication of one\u2019s health, one\u2019s mood, etc. The etheric body can stay around for some time after physical death of the body. Are these then the soul? No, they are the product of physical, in-the-flesh life; mystical, yes, but not the soul. It is said that during \u201castral travel\u201d the etheric body, or something like it, detaches from the physical body and goes off travelling, carrying awareness with it. Is this then the soul? No, it isn\u2019t, so awareness (in this physical, space-time plane) is not the soul. Tibetan Lamas talk about the \u201cOver-self\u201d. Among its various interpretations, the mantra \u201cOm Mane Padme Hum\u201d can have the meaning \u201cHail to the Over-self\u201d, an acknowledgement of a higher \u2018self\u2019. Is the Over-self the soul? We\u2019re getting there. The Over-self is possibly part of the soul (not in quantity, but as a facet of the soul\u2019s nature). It is an observer, a sometime \u201cGuardian Angel\u201d, a recorder of one\u2019s akashic record. The soul is not a separate entity \u2018belonging\u2019 to a person\u2019s physical body. The soul is a tendril of Cosmic soul placed into a body, let\u2019s say \u201cfor the experience\u201d - although, in this case, \u201cfor the experience\u201d has a much deeper meaning than the superficial words. That collection of \u201cexperiences\u201d, I think, may be passed through the Over-self into the soul, and thus through to the Cosmic soul. One of the \u2018conduits\u2019 for the passing of the \u201cexperiences\u201d one way (\u201cuploading\u201d?), and \u2018guidance\u2019 the other way (in the form of conscience) (\u201cdownloading\u201d?), is the \u201cunconscious mind\u201d. So is the unconscious mind the soul? I don\u2019t think so, but I think it is an important conduit for communication between our space-time, carnal awareness and our soul. See? Even though I wanted to keep it simple, once one starts on this subject, the mind (sic) takes one off on a journey, some might say of discovery, others might say a flight of fancy. In the long run, that doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re all on our own road of discovery. On that note, I should close with the statement that I am not preaching that my interpretation is the truth, the only truth, etc. It is merely a clumsy attempt to describe something in a way that I \u2018sort of\u2019 see it at my current level of development, using words which can never be succinct enough to create a clear picture. \u201cOm Mane Padme Hum\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Your awareness is your conscious part of your Soul. You use with your awareness your brain including ratio and memory. Still the observer is your awareness and your conscious part of your Soul, put at birth for most people on zero memory. Ask brain scientists were the observer is located in your brain, they can\u2019t find it. There is no activity in your brain when you observes. This proofs that your Awareness is your conscious part of your Soul. Your subconscious part of your Soul is the awareness of your Soul. Some of us call this also your higher self. Within this higher self you have all memories stored of previous and future lives. Become time does not exist in the dimensions. Time is just a sequential placing expression of energy in our apparently material world. this is proven by doing regression and progression hypnoses, when you shut off the conscious thinking, you can access the memory stored in your subconscious part of your Soul, your higher self. See also Quantum healing hypnoses, like Alba Weinmann reports about. The body of the Soul consists of: The energy channels through your body and with their chakras.The astral layers of your bodyYour auraThe awareness of your Soul consist of: your awareness as conscious part of your Soul, interacting with your brain. visa versa to interpret the energy frequencies from high to low and visa versa. This awareness uses your brain and ratio. When you die, you don\u2019t use your brain anymore, and you just observe. That makes dying a tranquil process. After this you learn again to reason on higher frequency with your Souls awareness.Your higher Self as subconscious part of your Soul. There is a reason why your awareness is split into two awarenesses. The higher self is always pure positive. When you have a positive thought, you have a positive loaded energy pattern. and when your awareness has the same positive energy pattern, because you choose the same positive thoughts, you experience positive emotions.When you think I am a bad person, for example. Than you have a negative energy pattern in your conscious awareness and the higher self has always a positive energy pattern about a thought. Higher self thinks, I am good, I have to handle negativity with positivity. Because of the difference in energy pattern, you will encounter negative emotions. The reason for this is that your emotions are guiding you in life to become in line with your pure positive Soul. An negative emotion is just a signal, that you have negative thoughts, and you should change the negative thoughts into positive thoughts. Than you are good for yourself, AND for all other people on the world AND good for Nature. The ground rule of the Soul. More questions, let me know. Thomas.",
