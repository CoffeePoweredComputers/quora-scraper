            "answer_text": "There's two very distinct meanings of the word \"idealistic\". There's PHILOSOPHIC IDEALISM (which means that the given thinker emphasizes ideas over the material world - somewhat extreme example: if a tree falls in the woods; if no person hears it then it didn't make a sound). The opposite of this is PHILOSPHIC MATERIALISM (which means that people's ideas are and can only be a (more or less correct, more or less complete) representation of the material world. An example of this: this Universe has been around for some 13.8 Billion years (the Earth has been around for some 1/3rd of that or 4.567 Billion years); in both cases they existed without humans for 99.999+% of their existence - and yet, without humans and human thought - they very definitely DID exist - the Universe expanded, blue giant stars exploded and then collapsed into either neutron stars or black holes; the Earth developed continents which over billions of years changed shape and appeared and disappeared. IF human being had been around during those eons, the only important thing that would have changed is that ONE organism on one tiny single planet would have been REFLECTING on that Universal or Earthly MATERIAL EXISTENCE). There is also MORAL IDEALISM (vs MORAL MATERIALISM) which is/are very different. A Moral idealist might, due to IDEALS, put the welfare of others ahead of their own welfare (as most parents do for their young children). A moral materialist might judge people by how much material wealth or how much appearance of material wealth they have. Or will buy a more expensive item than they really need; or generally place their own welfare above that of others (selfishness for example). More examples of PHILOSPHIC Idealism (bare in mind HERE I am passing NO judgement on the value, worth or good vs bad quality of the examples to be given): Religious faith; belief that personal unique experience trumps collective common experience; how people THINK after they've gotten high on something (alcohol, drugs, pills, etc.) - they often believe they can drive quite adequately; but can't/don't. More examples of MORAL Idealism:Letting a competitor win (or finishing in a tie rather than beating them); a chimpanzee sharing bananas rather than \"pigging out\"; good-mothering (or good-fathering) which involve sacrificing \"personal gain / comfort / pleasure\" for the good of the child(ren). Colin Kaepernick (and now additional players) sitting down during the National Anthem - thus jeapordizing his reputation and even his job and salary for what he THINKS (or believes) is a more righteous cause.
