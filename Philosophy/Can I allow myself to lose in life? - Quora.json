            "answer_text": "That's up to you to decide everyone has their own life decisions and choices in their own hands it's their choice to give up or not but giving up means being a person who isn't willing to make efforts for their dreams, goals and achievements in short term a mere loser. Losers are those who don't \u201cwanna\u201d win but a winner are those who tries to win even if you don't win but atleast you try to and that's the way to become a winner so in my opinion no one should allow anyone to lose themselves in their lives.

            "answer_text": "It may sound cliche, but yes. The most successful people in life have allowed themselves to make mistakes. If you don\u2019t allow yourself, you\u2019ll get too frustrated because you cannot be perfect or do the best on your first few tries at something. I wouldn\u2019t say that you always \u201clearn\u201d from your mistakes, but allow yourself to make mistakes. They help you rise up. ",
