            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve heard this concept from a Harvard PhD. He talked to me about the \u201cpool of consciousness\u201d model - where the energy of a lifetime drifts off to some place where there\u2019s a pool of consciousness, and when people remember previous lifetimes,they\u2019re merely tapping into \u201csomeone else\u2019s journey.\u201d As I said to him \u201cI\u2019d agree with you but then we\u2019d both be wrong.\u201d That\u2019s not what\u2019s in the research. What people under deep hypnosis (and by extension, often report during a near death event) is that we have individual \u201cportions\u201d of consciousness. They claim that we \u201conly bring about a third\u201d of that energy to a particular lifetime, and roughly two thirds of that energy is \u201calways back home\u201d in the between lives realm. When someone does a between life hypnotherapy sessions (as taught by the Newton Institute to its licensed therapists) a person experiences going back \u201chome\u201d and reconnecting with that higher consciousness (for lack of a better term) and while being connected to that higher consciousness we are able to \u201cremember all of our lifetimes.\u201d As in \u201cour\u201d lifetimes - not everyone else\u2019s. However, because we are \u201call connected\u201d when we are back there, those that are closest to us - the members of our soul group - we can access their previous lifetimes, or they can \u201cshow them to us.\u201d Further, that while the two thirds of our energy is \u201cback home\u201d we can and do observe everything that\u2019s occurring here with our lifetime, and we are available (to ourselves) for advice, guidance, etc. I\u2019ve been filming people doing these sessions for a decade, and if they reported something else I\u2019d report that. But in the 45 I\u2019ve filmed,they mirror the 7000 that Michael Newton reported in his books, or the 2000 that Dr. Helen Wambach reported in her books. They say basically the same things about our journey. But don\u2019t take my word for it - anyone can access this information. I recommend taking a look at Newton\u2019s books, and their website where they have a database of practitioners. Some are better at it than others, but like I say, I\u2019ve been filming these events for a decade now and get the same results no matter who the person is doing the questioning, or who the person is providing answers. Doesn\u2019t matter their background, religion or gender - I\u2019ve chosen most of the candidates because of their skepticism (or strong belief in an alternative system) and they all have the same results (roughly.) There are reports that we \u201call feel connected back home\u201d which may be the source of the \u201cone consciousness concept\u201d - but they report that we \u201creturn to our soul group\u201d where we have (Newton reported from 3\u201325) individuals that we normally reincarnate with, people we\u2019ve known for a long time (hence the characteristics that are similar to quantum entanglement) and continue to reconnect with. They are separate souls (only bringing about a third of their energy here at any time) but we recognize them when we get \u201cback home.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The individual consciousness and the collective consciousness both exist simultaneously. Everything is consciousness. Everything is made from consciousness. Nothing can exist outside of consciousness. Consciousness is the one and only source to everything. Think of oneness (consciousness) coming into more and more distinctness for the illusionary individualistic experience. The I (Michelle) is perceiving life through a personal and unique perspective. Only Michelle knows what life is like as Michelle. That is my individual consciousness. When Michelle opens her eyes in the morning she is tapping into the collective consciousness of her family, of Rome, of Italy, of Earth and of the universe. Her internal consciousness and awareness either gels, questions, wrestles, denies, accepts or fears the outside world consciousness. Thoughts are like ticker tapes that endlessly pass through our minds. We each have our own \u2018Icloud\u2019 of thoughts which is our individual consciousness. Every thought that we have is not us thinking but consciousness simulating the thought. Each one of us are experiencing a collection of simulated thoughts. Michelle has her \u2018Icloud\u2019. Her \u2018Icloud\u2019 is designed by consciousness for Michelle\u2019s distinct experience. Michelle is her \u2018Icloud\u2019. This is true from the micro to the macro. Every cell in Michelle\u2019s body is conscious and is having its own unique conscious experience. Every cell in Michelle\u2019s body has its own \u2018Icloud\u2019 of simulated thought that comes from consciousness. Earth as a planet is also conscious and has its own \u2018Icloud\u2019 of thoughts and experiences designed by consciousness. We are all one massive matrix of consciousness having infinite experiences of itself. We are all infinite expressions of consciousness. Consciousness is God and God is consciousness. ",
