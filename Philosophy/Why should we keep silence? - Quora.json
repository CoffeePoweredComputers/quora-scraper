            "answer_text": "Believe me, there are many Benefits of Silence : 1. Silence provides inner peace.Can you remember the last time you sat in silence and heard the sound  of your breathing and felt the stillness of your soul? Moments like  these are rare, but we need them, like water or like the air that we  breathe. Take a few minutes a day to quieten your mind, let go of all  the insignificant issues that you can not control and just allow  yourself to let be. Feel inner peace washing through your body. Feel the  healing benefits of silence and solitude. 2. Silence helps to communicate on a different level.It always amazed me how my dad could just  sit with his best friend fishing for hours, without saying a word to  each other. I felt that the silence needed to be filled with something,  otherwise the whole situation got too awkward and uncomfortable. Only  years later I realized that there are different ways of communication.  Words allow us to exchange information, and sometimes express our  feelings. But silence is communication of the souls.There is something magical about just sitting quietly with another  person, and being in complete harmony with yourself and the outside  world. 3. Silence promotes self-discovery.The purpose of maintaining external silence is to encourage the  development of internal silence. Yet many people let their inner voice  die down in the external chatter. Benefits of silence go far beyond  inner tranquility and peace of mind. Silence offers an opportunity to  practice awareness and acceptance. It helps you to discover that  everything that exists in the universe is already within you. 4. Silence energizes you.Outside noise is tiring to our mind and body. Think of the tons of  stimuli that you receive every second. Think of all the bits and pieces  of information that your brain has to analyze, ignore, memorize and  retain. Then think of all the energy that we use while thinking,  speaking and performing actions. The best way to recharge our energy is  to sit for a few minutes in silence and let our mind and body rest. 5. Silence boosts creativity.Creative sparks rarely come to us when we are thinking hard about  something. Creativity requires solitude, concentration and above all the  silence of \u201cnon-thinking\u201d mind. 6. Silence enhances focus and mental clarity.Even if you have trained yourself to work in a noisy office or at  home with kids running around the house, your brain is still  pre-programmed to respond and investigate each sound that stands out  from the background noise (like a new telephone ring or closing door).  All these sounds distract us and make it hard to stay concentrated. Once  all the noise is gone, it becomes very easy to stay focused on the task  at hand and be more productive. 7. Silence predisposes to sharing.It is very easy to share your feelings and thoughts with someone who  knows how to listen. And most people in our high-tech world long to  voice out their feelings, achievements and worries. They long to be  heard. All you have to do is practice staying silent and listening. This  skill alone is guaranteed to improve your relationships and see people  you have known for ages in a different light.Make it your resolution today to find a quiet place where you can  hide from all the hustle and bustle. With each deep breath, let go of  everything that bothers you. Close your eyes and enjoy 10 minutes of  deep, relaxing benefits of silence and solitude.  \u201cNothing in all creation is so like God as silence.\u201d \u2013 Meister Eckhart ",

            "answer_text": "Silence play a great role in our life. It is very useful because, silence has a certain energy to it like no other energy source. It has the power to get people to think and to act ,it can help slow the mind down, and sometimes it can remove of all the frustration of our mind . We turn our thoughts and focus inwards and gain the power we need to refuel our minds .Our ego is temporarily switched off or at least made to quite for a bit , and we start to see the real world as it should be. Our thoughts get the in the way of reality. Sometimes we can not think what is right and what is wrong for us so sit silently and just go the core of your problem and try to find the solution in step wise . Example of when to use silence. During argument-One of the best time to use the power of silence is during an argument is to stay silent . The ego will be trying to force its way out of you and finish the argument but you are the controller,of your body and thought, not ego .When someone shouting at you listen all the word silently .And after sometime you can literally take all the power away from them and keep all your energy and saying absolutely nothing . This is extremely difficult to do but very powerfull because sometimes listen other is very beneficial for us .Silence brings clarity to thoughtsSilence will give more strength to our body and mind. Your concentration power will increase along with will power.If you can do your work with silence and peace mood .Your thoughts and action will glitter always.Never think what the haters and naysayers thinks about you what he tell about you, just focus on your work and give the best result because somepeople always with you and cares you without your knowledge.

            "answer_text": "Let me tell you a story which i read yesterday. Joe was an old man aged 75 years. He lived very happily and formed a beautiful family. His children grew up and moved to different cities in pursue of good career and future. He lived in a small village carrying the memories of his deceased wife. Joe had 4 grand children and they used to visit him during their holidays. And it was the vacation time and Joe was eagerly waiting for the arrival of his grand children. He was preparing his home for the kids, cleaning the home, mowing the garden, rearranging the household items, buying the favourite foods, dresses for the children, etc. In the busy arrangements, he lost his favourite watch.  The watch was gifted by his dead wife when their first child was born. Joe treasured the watch and it became his sole companion after his wife\u2019s death. He forgot the watch missing and was happy receiving the kids at home. It was only the next day when he was about to take bath, he remembered that the watch was missing. He saw the watch last when he was arranging things in the barn. He was shocked and very upset. His grandchildren asked him why he was so dull and asked him what troubled him. Joe said, \u2018Dear children, I lost the most precious watch I have ever had and I ever got in my life. It was gifted by your grandma and I lost it while cleaning the home! I feel like I\u2019m missing my heart.\u2019 Joe was on tears and the children promised him that they would search the watch for him. One granddaughter asked \u2018grand pa, do you remember when you saw the watch last before it was missing?\u2019 Joe told, \u2018I guess when I was cleaning the barn!\u2019 The children decided to search for the watch in the barn. The barn was full of waste materials, books, scraps, broken furniture, etc. The children searched for more than 2 hours with help of Joe and a servant, but could not find it. Joe was completely shattered and asked the children to stop searching as they could not find anything. The kids were also too sad, and consoled the grandfather. One grandson again moved to the barn, and Joe asked why he was going there again. The little boy requested others not to follow him and remain silent. While the others were little surprised, they still followed what he said. The little boy went to the barn and sat there in silence. The other children reached him and asked him what he was doing and the little boy asked them not to make noise. He sat there for about 15 minutes and then rushed to his grandfather. Yes, he got the watch and happily gave it to Joe. He was surprised and asked how he was able to find it. The little boy replied, \u2018I sat there without making a noise and the barn was so silent. After a few minutes, I heard the \u2018tick tick\u2019 sound and found the watch. Joe hugged him and thanked the little boy. This is the power of silence. If we stay calm, we can find the solution very easily! Sorry answer is little bit long Source - Internet ",

            "answer_text": "We live in a loud and distracting world, where silence is increasingly difficult to come and that may be negatively affecting our health. In fact, a 2011 World Health Organization report called noise pollution a \u201cmodern plague,\u201d concluding that \u201cthere is overwhelming evidence that exposure to environmental noise has adverse effects on the health of the population.\u201d We\u2019re constantly filling our ears with music, TV and radio news, podcasts and, of course, the multitude of sounds that we create nonstop in our own heads. Think about it: How many moments each day do you spend in total silence? The answer is probably very few. As our internal and external environments become louder and louder, more people are beginning to seek out silence, whether through a practice of sitting quietly for 10 minutes every morning or heading off to a 10-day silent retreat. Inspired to go find some peace and quiet? Here are four science-backed ways that silence is good for your brain and how making time for it can make you feel less stressed, more focused and more creative. 1. Silence relieves stress and tension. Florence Nightingale, the 19th century British nurse and social activist, once wrote that \u201cUnnecessary noise is the most cruel absence of care that can be inflicted on sick or well.\u201d Nightingale argued that needless sounds could cause distress, sleep loss and alarm for recovering patients. It turns out that noise pollution has been found to lead to high blood pressure and heart attacks, as well as impairing hearing and overall health. Loud noises raise stress levels by activating the brain\u2019s amygdala and causing the release of the stress hormone cortisol, according to research. An unpublished 2004 paper by environmental psychologist Dr. Craig Zimring suggests that higher noise levels in neonatal intensive care units led to elevated blood pressure, increased heart rates and disrupted patient sleep patterns. Just as too much noise can cause stress and tension, research has found that silence has the opposite effect, releasing tension in the brain and body. A 2006 study published in the journal Heart found two minutes of silence to be more relaxing than listening to \u201crelaxing\u201d music, based on changes in blood pressure and blood circulation in the brain. 2. Silence replenishes our mental resources. In our everyday lives, sensory input is being thrown at us from every angle. When we can finally get away from these sonic disruptions, our brains\u2019 attention centers have the opportunity to restore themselves. The ceaseless attentional demands of modern life put a significant burden on the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which is involved in high-order thinking, decision-making and problem-solving. As a result, our attentional resources become drained. When those attention resources are depleted, we become distracted and mentally fatigued, and may struggle to focus, solve problems and come up with new ideas. But according to attention restoration theory, the brain can restore its finite cognitive resources when we\u2019re in environments with lower levels of sensory input than usual. In silence \u2015 for instance, the quiet stillness you find when walking alone in nature \u2015 the brain can let down its sensory guard, so to speak. 3. In silence, we can tap into the brain\u2019s default mode network. The default mode network of the brain is activated when we engage in what scientists refer to as \u201cself-generated cognition,\u201d such as daydreaming, meditating, fantasizing about the future or just letting our minds wander. When the brain is idle and disengaged from external stimuli, we can finally tap into our inner stream of thoughts, emotions, memories and ideas. Engaging this network helps us to make meaning out of our experiences, empathize with others, be more creative and reflect on our own mental and emotional states. In order to do this, it\u2019s necessary to break away from the distractions that keep us lingering on the shallow surfaces of the mind. Silence is one way of getting there. Default mode activity helps us think deeply and creatively. As Herman Melville once wrote, \u201cAll profound things and emotions of things are preceded and attended by silence.\u201d 4. Getting quiet can regenerate brain cells. Silence can quite literally grow the brain. A 2013 study on mice, published in the journal Brain, Structure, and Function, involved comparing the effects of ambient noise, white noise, pup calls and silence on the rodents\u2019 brains. Although the researchers intended to use silence as a control in the study, they found that two hours of silence daily led to the development of new cells in the hippocampus, a key brain region associated with learning, memory and emotion. Hope it helps. ",

            "answer_text": " Silence is an expression that should be familiar. But the reality is often not the case, habitual noise has become a stubborn disease of modern people, even if only for a moment and a half speechless has become an embarrassment. What's more, it can be understood as decadence, pessimism, passivity, autarchy and being difficult to get along with others. This undoubtedly shows that modern people almost do not leave space for themselves and others to be silent. Perhaps silence plays a role occasionally, but it is reduced to a tool for expressing dissatisfaction or sadness. However, people who can't share the silence can never really enter each other's hearts! Valuable things do not come from words. Discourse is only a means of communication or response, and often can not convey the most subtle and profound connotation appropriately. After the extremely long road from the heart to the outside world, what is said has been basically distorted. The premise of discourse should be silence. Only after a long period of silence, with the thinking and feeling gradually formed from silence, can we really have something to say. Otherwise, the sound is just a meaningless vibration that wastes energy, that is, it can't move yourself or affect others. But a kind of irrelevant, and even gradually lead to the habit of putting the cart before the horse. The so-called influence may only be because of the superficiality! ",

            "answer_text": "The significance of silence is that more often than not it speaks louder than words!! This \u2018silence\u2019 is more so significant because of what can be achieved by being silent or by making someone keep silent. When you keep silent, you come across as a calm and humble person. Also, you can listen and grasp better. Thus efficiency of daily life in general increases. If you can make someone with a lot of ego and ill temperament go silent with a calm and befitting reply; rest assured, there will be a certain amount of transformation. Here are a few examples for better understanding of the same: Field Marshal Sam Bahadur Maneckshaw once started addressing a public meeting at Ahmedabad in English. The crowd started chanting, \"Speak in Gujarati. We will hear you only if you speak in Gujarati.\" Field Marshal Sam Bahadur Maneckshaw stopped, swept the audience with a hard stare and replied:\"Friends, I have fought many a battle in my long career. I have learned Punjabi from men of the Sikh Regiment; Marathi from the Maratha Regiment; Tamil from the men of the Madras Sappers; Bengali from the men of the Bengal Sappers, Hindi from the Bihar Regiment; and even Nepali from the Gurkha Regiment. Unfortunately there was no soldier from Gujarat from whom I could have learned Gujarati.\"... You could have heard a pin drop!!! Robert Whiting, an elderly US gentleman of 83, arrived in Paris by plane. At French customs, he took a few minutes to locate his passport in his cabin luggage when the following scene occurred:\"You have been to France before, Monsieur ?\", the customs officer asked sarcastically. Mr. Whiting admitted that he had been to France previously. \"Then you should know enough to have your passport ready\u201d, replied the customs officer rudely. To this the elderly US citizen calmly answered; \"The last time I was here, I didn't have to show it.\" \"Impossible! Americans always have to show their passports on arrival in France !\", the customs officer sneered. To this, the American senior gave the Frenchman a hard stare and then he quietly explained; \"Well, when I came ashore at Omaha Beach, at 4:40am, on D-Day in 1944, to help liberate your country, I couldn't find a single Frenchman to show a passport to.... \" You could have heard a pin drop!!! Soon after getting freedom from British rule in 1947, the de-facto prime minister of India, Jawahar Lal Nehru called a meeting of senior Army Officers to select the first General of the Indian army.Nehru proposed, \"I think we should appoint a British officer as The General of The Indian Army, as we don't have enough experience to do the same.\" Having learned under the British, only to serve and rarely to lead, all the civilians and men in uniform present nodded their heads in agreement. However, senior officer Nathu Singh Rathore, asked for permission to speak. Nehru was a bit taken aback by the independent streak of the officer but still asked him to speak freely. Rathore said, \"You see, sir, we don't have enough experience to lead a nation too, so shouldn't we appoint a British person as the first Prime Minister of India?\" You could hear a pin drop!!! \"Are you ready to be the first General of The Indian Army?\" Rathore declined the offer saying \"Sir, we have a very talented army officer, my senior, Gen. Cariappa, who is the most deserving among us.\" This is how the brilliant Gen. Cariappa became the first General and Rathore the first ever Lt. General of the Indian Army.

Most of the silent people are reserved by nature. They don't like to mingle with new person. They are used to a certain lifestyle. They would like to spend quality time alone rather than chit chatting or gossiping with others.

There is only one thing in this world which makes your dream impossible to achieve, i.e., the fear of failure Now, close your eyes and think about that quote for a second. . . You somehow felt like you have found a deeper meaning of life? Isn\u2019t it? I sure felt so. Why would that be? You might already know the answer.  It\u2019s because, most of the time, epiphanies happen in the core of silence. It\u2019s silence that is the loudest of all noise. It\u2019s in silence that we all revel and rejoice, with realizations and implications. Silence is what makes the close hearts speak. It\u2019s when we can successfully concentrate, meditate, understand, and maybe even connect with the universe. In the abode of silence, the sound of a blooming flower can also be heard. That\u2019s how the world reveals itself to you. One who comes to understand the world bit by bit, s/he understands life, for the cosmos speaks in that language. The solution of almost all problems lies in the realm of Silence. Anger and disappointment can be conquered in silence. Words have a very different implication to some turn of events. Silence is where you feel the greater force, divine, pure and full of knowledge. Meditation is the doorway to this world, where silence is the master-key. Silence is the love that has the highest vocabulary of all. It\u2019s the Tacenda of all misunderstandings, things that are better left unsaid. Silence is replenishing, rejuvenating, inspiring, thought provoking, peaceful, free, plagued by no stress, divine and full of knowledge. Silence stands to be the best language of all, non-controversial of all, most diplomatic of all and the easiest of all. Silence is life, silent in death. Have a peaceful day\u2026! PS : Read between the lines - also implies something that\u2019s directly not implied and can be understood easily in silence. What a beautiful thing, isn\u2019t it? PPS : If at all you find someone, with whom you can sit in silence and, cannot be plagued by that incessant need to fill the silence with words or small talk, hold on to them and never let go. Silence speaks volumes, and this shows you are made for each other. Hope this answers your question as to why Silence is very important. *** ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, there are two kinds of silence: External silence, which you\u2019ll \u201chear\u201d in a monastery, zendo, church sanctuary, and especially Nature, and Internal silence, in which your mind becomes like a still pond reflecting the clouds. Internal silence goes even further than that because it\u2019s not necessarily easy to make the mind hold perfectly still, so what one can do instead is to just let the thoughts and feelings flow thru one\u2019s consciousness without paying any attention to the material. So what are the benefits of silence? Not necessarily easy to define but i would include a sense of internal balance and a quietude of mind, clearheadedness, unhurriedness, the ability to glide smoothly thru one\u2019s daily life and tasks called Flow, a disentanglement with over-involved situations and relationships, a deeper self-understanding and thus a deeper understanding of others, better and uncomplicated relationships with others, along with the easy acceptance of oneself with all one\u2019s shortcomings and life with all Its shortcomings. The thing is, silence is generally the by-product of meditation, which is how one goes about letting the waves of one\u2019s mind die down. And the simplest kind of meditation is to merely follow\u2014focus on\u2014one\u2019s breath as it goes in and out. You can find further instructions on the Internet. Remember that it always takes slightly longer than one lifetime to become perfect. ",

If you grow a plant without giving it space, it won\u2019t grow very well and probably die very fast. If you constantly control a child and be too strict of a parent, this will not allow the child to grow and develop in a healthy manner. Everything needs space. Every human needs time for himself. Quiet time. And in that time you may allow your thoughts, you may daydream, you may do something you enjoy where you truly don\u2019t care about the outcome. We need this quiet time to ourselves so Continue Reading",
