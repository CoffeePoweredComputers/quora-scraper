            "answer_text": "Why would you want to manipulate other people's insecurities? I would think that would bring bad karma. It would also make you a cold hearted bastard in my opinion. When you use another persons weaknesses to you own advantage you betray yourself. You are no longer honorable. The consequences of your action will fall on you like a ton of bricks. Choose a better path for your own sake. I know this is not the answer you asked for but as an old lady who has seen people bring down hell on themselves please dont do this. ",
