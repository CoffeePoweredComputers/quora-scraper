            "answer_text": "Unityism; Social issues: Freedom of Religion as second-highest right. Expression and Thought are third-highest right. Take one guess which is first highest right. Abortion is permitted up to, but not including birth - that is when the child becomes capable of living on itself. Euthanasia is legal, for those with terminal illness only. Guns are a privilege, not a right. Handguns and Semi-automatics are restricted weapons, only for those with a valid reason, i.e . Semi-autos cannot be bought for sport shooting, while handguns can. Full-automatics are illegal, end of story. Every other gun (Pump-action, Bolt-action, Lever etc etc) can be bought for reasons not related to self-defense, i.e hunting. Also, universal background checks and gun registries are in place. One can only transport firearms when one has a lawful reason for doing so (going to hunt, sports shooting etc etc) and they must be in a dedicated gun case. The family models of 2 parents, and 2 parents +grandparents are to be championed as the best family models for stability. Both Personal Responsibility and Collectivism is to be entwined. You are not out there solely for yourself. You live in our country - you live to our expectations, and that is to enrich the community you live in. Healthcare: Free single-payer healthcare for all, ensuring that those most unable are covered. Mental health is to be taken seriously, and government income will be spent on ensuring mental health facilities are available, especially to those most vulnerable who generally are the least able to access them. Private hospitals, catering to the middle-class and upper-class, still exist. These are for profit. Economy: Government intervenes to prevent any: Collusion from occuring.Monopoly from occuring.Generally anything which is anti-consumer behaviour. Government supports small and medium domestic businesses through subsidies, handouts, business counselling etc etc. Government funds research companies, especially domestic ones. Government controls OCR and taxes in order to influence economy and maintain stable growth whilst minimizing inflation. Government can intervene when market economy is slowing down through economic stimulus. Government can also intervene when market economy is doing well through stimulus. For that matter, there is a progressive tax system for businesses, based on profit, thus meaning that taxes decrease or increase based on company performance. Below $5000 profit, tax is only 10% for anything below the $5000 bracket, while at profit above $100 million, tax is at 35% for any profit above the $100 million bracket. Also, progressive tax for consumers. Anything below $10,000 gross income a year is taxed at 10%, whilst anything above $90,000 is taxed at 33%. Military: Volunteer forces only, no conscription. Military spending is to ensure that the services are able to do their job: defend national interests. Education: Free education up to university, free education up to 3 years for universities. Education is to be funded so the next generation gets the best in education. There you go \u2014 the political ideology I would have if I made a party and what we stand for. ",
