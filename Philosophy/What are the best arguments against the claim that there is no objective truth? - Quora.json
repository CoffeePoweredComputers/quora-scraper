            "answer_text": "Objective proof is there for material phenomenon, for example, the rising of the sun in the east, which is provable or evident to everyone but objective proof is not there for subjective phenomenon or phenomenon which are beyond sensory perception which are not provable to all but true for the person, for example, spiritual experiences, or opinion of person about a thing or idea. Self-evident require no proof, for example, \u201cI exist and the world exists\u201d require no proof because I cannot question my own existence and what I think exists. If you doubt my existence, then your asking a question to me or anyone in Quora is futile. Even science and Mathematics are based on some assumptions which are taken for granted. Some people have classified objective truth as absolute truth. I don't agree with this. Absolute truth is true under all conditions irrespective of subject, time, place and other conditions. Absolute truth is beyond human understanding. Absolute Truth has no objective proof or subjective proof because it is the subject itself, it can only be realized through spiritual practice. If however definition of subjective and objective are different. then my answer may need change. I have taken the definition as given below: Edit: Answer to comments: Whether rising of sun in the East is objective truth: To our sense of sight, it is a fact that the sun rises in the east. That's why we call East as East and the west as west, where the sun sets. One is the apparent truth and the other is the real truth. Apparent truth has it's own relevance in our day to day life whereas real truth also has it's own relevance as scientific truth. In my opinion both are objective.It is relative but not subjective. Whatever is your position on earth, your East will be in the direction of the rising of the Sun and your west will be in the direction of the setting of the Sun. You objectively or definitely know which is your East and which is yoye West and everyone will agree with you at the same place. Subjective means everyone will not agree with what you say.I didn't consider the situation at North Pole or South Pole. But whatever is your observation, it is an objective observation and not a subjective observation.Definition of subjective and objective: Subjective means \u201cbased on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions\u201d. I hope you will agree that observing the sun rise or set is not a matter of personal opinion or feeling or taste.Definition: Subjective perspective or information or piece of writing is the detailed explanation of something containing more than facts, thus including assumptions, personal thoughts, feelings, emotions, opinions etc. ...Objectiveis measureable and observable whereas subjective cannot be measured.May 16, 2017Subjective vs. Objective: What's the Difference? \u2013 Difference WikiDifference Wiki - Versus Wiki \u203a subjective-...FeedbackAbout this resultEditReply User-1163825735406843779619h agoSubjective proof is for me only, objective proof is for all, for example Newton's Law of motion.",

            "answer_text": "Two philosophers are arguing, named EENIE and MEANIE. The dialog goes as follows: MEANIE: There is no objective truth. No statement can stand as objectively true. EENIE: Did you just make a statement? MEANIE: Of course. EENIE: So, is that statement itself objectively true? MEANIE: Well no, of course not, because I just said that nothing is objectively true. EENIE: So the statement \u201cthere are no objective truths\u201d is not itself objectively true. MEANIE: Er\u2026 I, uh\u2026 guess so, yeah. EENIE: That being the case, there must be some sense in which it is NOT true; therefore it is only sometimes true and sometimes false. MEANIE: So??? EENIE: So therefore, we can\u2019t rely on the statement \u201cThere are no objective truths.\u201d And if that statement is unreliable, then the statement \u201cThere ARE objective truths\u201d might well be true. MEANIE: I, er\u2026 yes\u2026 I mean No\u2026 I mean\u2026 Er, stop confusing me with your logic!!!!!!! ",
