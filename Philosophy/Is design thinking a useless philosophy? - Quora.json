            "answer_text": "I do write a lot on design thinking. You can check my blog for other articles (Navneet Nair \u2013 Medium) but here's something that would be something that answers this question: I think Design Thinking needs a makeover About a year ago, Natasha Jen gave this provocative talk at the 99U conference. It was an emotional outburst about Design Thinking. Natasha vehemently disagrees with the value Design Thinking provides. She thinks it is a buzz word. And very un-designer like. In order to drive her point across, she used everything from Google Image Search results to pictures of kitsch MRI machines. In fact she went on to proclaim: Design thinking uses just one tool: 3M Post-Its. A rather cheap shot, I must say. And facile too. Especially since she herself presented Steve Job\u2019s messy table as a counter argument. I\u2019m sure someone with Natasha\u2019s experience knows pretty well that good design does not come from external artefacts and processes but rather through a good old combination of inspiration and perspiration. Despite my reservations and glaring flaws in some of Natasha\u2019s arguments, I actually see this as an important presentation. It is a Hegelian Pendulum Swing where one extreme idea is counteracted with the opposite until a state of equilibrium is reached. We saw the same swing when the Flat Design movement countered to Skeuomorphic Design movement. We have seen the waterfall development process countered by Agile. And Avengers countered with the Justice League. OK OK, the last one is not really an example of Hegelian Dialectics. Just checking if you are still with me  Designing in the wild west One of Natasha\u2019s argument was that Charles and Ray Eames never used Post-It notes. They, in fact, used good old Moodboards instead. This again is one of her flawed arguments. After all, Post-Its were introduced the year Charles Eames died. Imagine the impact he could have had, if he could use Post-It notes.  But as mentioned before, good design is never the never result of the tools used. It is the result of a clear design vision. I\u2019m sure if you had given Charles Eames a hammer and a chisel, he would still have been able to produce this beauty.  In fact, a lot of good design came out during the pre Post-It era. The one common ingredient that stood out in good design is the clarity of vision. This is an important part of design that gets overlooked in the modern process. It is often seen as rather a tall order. People believe that it takes an enigmatic persona like a Steve Jobs, a Dieter Rams or a Charles Eames to articulate and drive down the right vision. And visionaries of that caliber are not born everyday. And that\u2019s where Design Thinking comes in It came with the promise to codify the thinking of Dieter Rams, Steve Jobs and Charles Eames into a single process. It further offered the same power to a newbie. Heck, it even promised that non-designers would be better designers. And this is where the fundamental challenge is. It is not clear to a seasoned designer as to what additional benefit the process provides them with. Their intuition has worked well for them. And often times the output they can produce without the design thinking process is far superior to the output that would have come out of \u2018rigorous design thinking\u2019. But that does not mean that design thinking is bullsh*t. Nor does it mean that Design Crits are the the only way to design. Or that you need to go back to the wild west mode of design. There are, in fact, a number of good things that we can gather from a the various process and maybe we should see what are the other places and times one can learn from. Maybe what we need is a better design process. I call this \u2018Value Centred Design' \u201cDesign Thinking is Dead.

            "answer_text": "absolutely not useless\u2026 BUT it is also just the same philosophy wrapped up in new language. And because it is the rage\u2026 It is getting a lot of play time. For those just entering the conversation\u2026 typical design thinking is organized in 5 iterative phases: Empathy, Definition, Ideation (brainstorming), Prototyping, and Testing (or feedback). Why this is so much different from the many iterative problem, solution approaches of the past is really emphasis on the empathy phase\u2014 understand your market on a human level \u2014 not just on a demographic or economic level. While that sounds lovely, I think that most designers don\u2019t work from checklists and don\u2019t avoid understanding their perceived users. In fact there has been decades of research on trying to understand human interaction with products. And may I point out that while it is nice to say we want to understand how people emotionally interact with our products, I am not certain that there is one, two or three ways that we interact emotionally :)\u2026 There may be thousands, and if that is the case then we are backing into demographics again. So what\u2019s the hub-bub. It may have more to do with the trivialization of designers in corporations. Businessmen make decisions, Engineers make decisions, but often their design decisions are not informed by designers. Thus engineers and business men are the target audience of the Designer Thinking philosophy. Not designers. Think about it\u2014 There are all these books being written about leveraging Failure, Designer Thinking, Thinking outside the Box, etc. They are all targeted at mid level and exec level management to make the corporation better. The audience is not the people in the field of design, graphics, etc. because we grew up thinking outside the box, we have always known failure or at least known rejection, we have always been marginalized, etc. etc. Without having taken courses in designer thinking (smile), and having only read a few white papers and online sites concerning designer thinking, I find it very ho hum as a designer (nothing new here). However, I find some things missing. I have always been of the opinion that most design is relatively straight forward. There is a problem and it must be solved. These are trivial problems because they are known. And typically, new technologies don\u2019t have to be invented to solve them. No outside the box ideation is required. For example,\u2026 Problem: Every time I turn on the hot water at the tap, it takes 4 minutes to get hot water\u2026 How do I get faster hot water? Solutions: Move the source of the hot water closer, Heat the water locally at the tap, insulate the pipes, \u2026 (assuming the water heater / furnace is quite functional). But the interesting problems are very ill-defined or just unknown. These historically have been called wicked problems (look it up). And these are the one\u2019s that predict use and behavior 5 years from now or 10 years from now. as well as use and behavior tomorrow. Infrastructure and Architecture are full of these types of issues. These are thorny problems that often require solutions to expose the problems. So any design philosophy IMO should include the wicked problem. Another missing element is the critique of prototyping. Prototyping often becomes the real deal because the (time) cost of prototyping is too expensive to meet market needs. Now I am not talking about a web site look and feel here. That can be done eight days a week. I am talking about code prototyping. Code carries with it the coder\u2019s bias. Regardless of whether it is a prototype or the final version delivery. Bias to deliver a solution is often ingrained in prototypes. and once a path is followed it is hard to go back because coder\u2019s (me included) love to reuse code. Anyway\u2026 enough rabbit holes. Design Thinking is great. Just not a lot of new ideas. But a lot of wrapping up old ones in new ribbons and bows. AND directing to people that should hear about design. just my .02 ",
