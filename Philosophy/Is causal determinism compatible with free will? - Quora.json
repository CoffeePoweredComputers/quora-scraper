            "answer_text": "The options are: Compatibilism: Causal determinism is compatible with free will. We act freely if our actions are determined by our preferences, rather than by an external agent coercing us.Libertarianism: Causal determinism is not compatible with free will, but randomness is. Our actions are random, so we have free will.Hard determinism: Causal determinism is not compatible with free will but causal determinism is true, so we lack free will.Impossibilism: Neither causal determinism nor randomness are compatible with free will.Some hard determinists are actually impossibilists, and no distinction is made between them. Some libertarians distinguish between randomness and the absence of determinism, claiming that freely will actions are neither determined nor random, but this is an issue with semantics. The meaning of the word \u201cfree\u201d is also, at bottom, an issue with semantics and the basis of the disagreement between compatibilists and hard determinists, who generally agree about the empirical facts.

            "answer_text": "No way. The question is simple: Is the action voluntary or not? If the action is voluntary, it is caused by the actor's decision to act. Free will is the ability to cause voluntary actions. If the action is caused by a prior event, then it is not voluntary. In determinism every event is the only possible consequence of the previous event. Voluntary actions are not possible. ",
