            "answer_text": "Yes, it does make sense to use \u201cbeginning to exist\u201d.But the followup part of the question, give me an example of things created out of nothing, this part is not related to the affirmation of the first part. I can produce curd from milk, and butter from curd. It makes sense to speak of an end of milk and a beginning of curd. But it does not make sense to ask how milk is created out of nothing. I\u2019ll track this question related to \u201cnothing\u201d back quick to it\u2019s core: How did life originate from lifeless matter?How did the universe come to be?These are the fundamental questions related to \u201cnothing\u201d. What if I told you that there was something before life, before the universe. Something that people call Qi.People in China used and use this word to describe many things. Certain herbs contain Qi. When people who are ill eat them they feel better. I don\u2019t know how, but it works: Qi. I have no problem with Qi. It\u2019s a philosophical stance, a claim that there is something prior to the known, but we don\u2019t and perhaps can\u2019t know it.It\u2019s a counter to skepticism which keeps asking an eternal chain of why questions. Qi has one fundamental attribute: it\u2019s not mystic, it\u2019s a confirmation of what\u2019s experienced and not explained.And that makes it completely different from a deity, the religious version of Qi. We might claim that Qi is before existence, that it\u2019s the origin of existence. Why not? It\u2019s just a word to describe something we see working and can\u2019t fully explain. Many previous instances of Qi are known by other names nowadays. Milk - curd - butter. Milk becomes curd because of Qi, curd becomes butter because of Qi. If you say that my reasoning is strange, I have a question for you: describe the precise conditions where milk turn into curd and curd turns into butter. What are the precise conditions when we talk about one of them and not the other. Or perhaps, if that\u2019s too complicated: Take your hair out, one by one. When are you bald? And if you put hairs back on, when do you stop being bald? But to say that milk, curd and butter do not have a beginning, to say that baldness does not have a beginning, that\u2019s odd. The two questions alone can be answered, the combination cannot. ",

            "answer_text": "Our universe appears to not always have existed. The current scientific consensus is that it started with the big bang, and that the initial state of the big bang came into existence out of nothing. This can make sense if we assume that time came into existence together with this initial state. In that case, there was no time before the big bang, and therefore the statement \u2018the initial state began to exist\u2019 is true by definition. Note that this answer doesn\u2019t satisfy me. The initial state of the big bang involves an incredibly dense, incredibly massive and incredibly small object that somehow popped into existence and exploded. An explanation in which the initial state of the universe consisted of a single quantum is, on the face of it, much more credible, presuming it can account for the same phenomena as the big bang. A single quantum is infinitely more likely to have arisen out of absolute nothingness than the initial state of the big bang. This option is explored in QO- suppose it all started with a single quantum ... . You could choose to believe that the universe has existed forever. But don\u2019t kid yourself that you\u2019ve got it nailed, because the question \u201cWhy has the universe existed forever?\u201d is as unanswerable as the question \u201cHow can something arise from nothing?\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing comes out of Nothing. Even the Whole Universe came out of Fluctuation. For instance, 1 comes out of a fluctuation of 1+ (-1) = 0 If you bypass the fluctuation, you might say that 1 came out of ZERO\u2026 but without the Fluctuation (Heisenberg Principle) nothing would ever change. So, Nothing comes out of Nothing. The closer we have of Nothing coming out of Nothing, is the Universe which came out from a Fluctuation of ZERO.

Marco Pereira's answer to Does the Huygens' Pendulum Synchronicity support the Quantum Lagrangian Principle? It just happens that his Pendulum Conundrum has the same mechanism as the Fundamental Dilator Quantum Lagrangian Principle and that pervades the Whole Universe and is the reason for the Quantum Mechanics Nature of Matter and the reason for Natural Laws.

            "answer_text": "The universe doesn\u2019t recognise \u2018things\u2019. It\u2019s merely a vast collection of different types of atoms. Human beings use words to identify certain collections and types of collections of atoms, because they\u2019re important to our survival and comfort, but that\u2019s just because we are the way we are. We use the word \u2018car\u2019, for instance, to describe a form of transport that can take us long distances along roads. A car \u2018begins to exist\u2019 when its parts are assembled in a functional way. When they\u2019re taken apart again the car no longer exists, but nothing has happened to the atoms; they\u2019re all still there. Some things come into existence slowly, like trees, by accumulating atoms over time. Some things, like adults, come into existence quickly, when a person has their eighteenth (or twenty-first) birthday. But these are not facts about trees or adults; they\u2019re facts about the way we use the word \u2018tree\u2019 and the word \u2018adult\u2019. The universe may have originated from a state of affairs which, if we encountered it today, we would call \u2018nothing\u2019. If and when we come to learn more about it, we might decide that \u2018nothing\u2019 is the wrong word for it. But what we choose to call it has got nothing to do with its potential to form universes, or anything else beyond communication between the English-speaking members of our short-lived species. ",

Stars begin to exist by the accumulation of enough matter to ignite stellar fusion. Streams begin to exist when water accumulates and rounds down hill. Automobiles begin to exist when they are assembled. If you are referring to the beginning of all existence that gets more complicated and we really only have conjectures at the moment. For all we know time itself began to exist when there became events that could be distinguished as before and after. As to things being created out of nothing we have a couple of possible examples. Quantum vacuum fluctuations are one. The Big Bang may be another. There is no evidence though of anything natural being created. The natural world and the universe has simply occurred. Humans and some animals create things but we use other stuff in the process and don't create them out of nothing unless you consider the idea of a thing to be a thing itself. We do make those out of our imagination which is about as immaterial as anything gets. ",
