            "answer_text": "A \u201cuniversal standard\u201d would be a rule or principle [1]that can be imposed on all of humanity, that every person must abide by. No\u2014there is no universal standard\u2014and a lot of Quorans don\u2019t understand that. There\u2019s no ruling authority with jurisdiction over the general populace as to how to go about obtaining knowledge or validating reality. Even the rules by which professional scientists keep one another in check\u2014such as the rule of Falsifiability\u2014have authority only over them in their workplaces and in their professional publications and other public disseminations of their findings, and not in every venue or sphere of public intercourse. I\u2019ve lost count of how many times someone on Quora has tried to disqualify one of my answers by presuming I must abide by such rules\u2014even on topics that are not related to the physical sciences\u2014and I\u2019ve had to set them straight. I have to remind them: \u201cWe\u2019re not in a laboratory, boardroom, classroom, or courtroom.\u201d These are the only venues where there is an authority who has the power to rule on the legitimacy of evidence and how it may be obtained. Finally, those who work in scientific fields are simply not the owners of any of the scientific methods or any that some regard as \u201cthe\u201d scientific method. They cannot restrict who may use them\u2014or must use them\u2014or how. For most purposes of negotiating reality, I get along well enough using my senses, comprehensive knowledge of human nature, and an honest and principled mind. But I also incorporate at least some form or part of the scientific method in all my investigations into reality.

            "answer_text": "The scientific method has been extensively developed, but the process is not and cannot be complete. We still have major frauds, like Global Warming Denial and Anti-Vaxxerism, and major error, like Cold Fusion. Each has been extensively debunked, but each still has supporters. Among the elements of the scientific method are these. Questions about whatever has not been explained and cannot be predicted, and about deviations from predictions where they are possibleExtensive observation and experiment aimed at finding new questions and answering older onesMathematical models designed to explain as much of the observation and experiment as possibleFurther observation and experiment carefully designed to falsify the models, if possiblePeer review on publicationReplication and refinement of critical observations and experimentsSome parts of the process are relatively well understood and relatively routine. Others require great leaps of creative imagination, which can then be subjected to the more routine process. It is sometimes necessary to invent new mathematical methods, even whole new branches of mathematics, in order to construct suitable models for the sciences. ",
