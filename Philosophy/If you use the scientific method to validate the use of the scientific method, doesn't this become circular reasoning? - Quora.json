            "answer_text": "I\u2019m sure you will get contradictory answers to the question: is validating the scientific method using the scientific method circular reasoning? It\u2019s a very good question. Some (not all) scientists assume determinism (everything that happens has to happen because it is caused by other events) and materialism / reductionism (for example, consciousness is nothing more than chemical and electrical events in the brain). It seems to me that arguments to support determinism and materialism tend to begin by assuming that these are correct. However, arguments about consciousness (for example) are so complicated that they are really difficult to follow. There are histories/ philosophies/ social psychologies of science that stand outside and examine what scientists do, what they should ideally do, and how human nature and individual preferences do not allow them to ever be truly objective or detached. I have done scientific research all my life (some would argue psychology is not a science, but it\u2019s at least as scientific as areas such as nutrition and physiology that deal with similarly complex problems). I think some scientists become dogmatic about science; they think it is the \u201cone true religion\u201d. I take a different position. I can\u2019t \u2018prove\u2019 it using scientific methods (which by definition exclude study of the non-material), but I think there are limits to what the scientific method can accomplish. Shakespeare\u2019s words say this nicely: There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,  Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.  - Hamlet (1.5.167-8), Hamlet to Horatio In one word: Yes. I think using the scientific method to try to prove the value of the scientific method is flawed. I believe the scientific method has value. But I don\u2019t think it is the only valid way of \u201cknowing\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "This is known as The Problem of Humean Induction. It\u2019s not just a problem for science but a problem for the whole idea we can synthesise (or have) useful knowledge about anything. How can we be sure that things we \u2018know\u2019 today will remain reliable \u2018knowledge\u2019 tomorrow? You will (I guess) be happy to eat tomorrow things you recognise as food today in the firm belief they will be delicious and sustain you tomorrow as they did today and yesterday. What gives you that confidence or any justifiable right to such a belief? You will eventually have to fall back on the idea that given those foods have sustained you all your life and you expect that to continue. The Problem of Humean Induction is named for David Hume an 18th century Scottish philosopher and possibly the most influential mind in the history of Western philosophy. What Hume observed that idea that things that have so in the past will continue to be so in the future is itself and idea and we don\u2019t have a way to extend it into the future without relying on the idea itself. Ultimately all knowledge, informal, formal, religious and scientific depends on the idea there are things we can assume to continue to be so into the future as much as they\u2019ve continue to be so in the past. All knowledge depends on the idea that we can even have knowledge. Eventually we have to go back to our lives and recognise we\u2019re not going stop eating or eat glass (or things we previously understood as poison) on the off chance those are the things that now sustain us. We\u2019re all going to work on the basis that we can (in ways we have to discover) use the past as a guide to the future or go mad, or starve or die or all those things. Science is no exception and while science has proved itself to be almost obscenely the most (indeed only) effective way of gaining knowledge we can\u2019t \u201cprove\u201d it will continue to be so in the future. But in fact we have no alternative. There is in fact no demonstrated reliable way of obtaining something we can usefully call knowledge other than by learning to pick out of the past rules and patterns that remain so going forward. Science is just our most formal way of doing that. ",
