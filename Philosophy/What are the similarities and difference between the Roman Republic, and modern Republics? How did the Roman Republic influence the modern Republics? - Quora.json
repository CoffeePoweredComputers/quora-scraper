            "answer_text": "In ancient times there were thought to be three systems of government-monarchy, aristocracy and democracy. The Greek historian Polybius said that each of these systems were unstable and would eventually deteriorate into their negative forms, tyranny, oligarchy and mob rule, respectively. There were republics in the ancient world. The term \u201crepublic\u201d comes from the Latin \u201cres publica,\u201d meaning \u201cpublic things.\u201d Examples of ancient republics were Rome, Carthage, and Rhodes. Republics were a mixed constitution with a monarchical component, an aristocratic component and a democratic component. In Rome the monarchical component was the Consuls, two of whom were elected yearly, the aristocratic component was to Senate, and the democratic component was the assemblies of the plebes. Polybius credited this system for Rome\u2019s political stability and power. Rome did not have a constitution and their republican system of government relied on adherence to tradition-the mos maiorum. The system began to get out of whack after the Second Punic war, and became non-viable during the first century B.C. when rival rival generals were allowed to field their own armies. Modern republics have constitutions mandating things like human rights, suffrage, separation of church and state, and an independent judiciary. The U.S. has a powerful military, but it has not yet happened that generals are permitted to field their own army. As long as that does not occur, the republic will endure. The present threat is the rise of plutocratic oligarchy. Rome influenced the modern republics by demonstrating that republics are both possible and desirable, and also by informing us of what not to do, which is to allow military leaders autonomy, and to allow a plutocratic oligarchy to arise.

            "answer_text": "What are the similarities and difference between the Roman Republic, and modern Republics? How did the Roman Republic influence the modern Republics? The modern type of \"republic\" itself is different from any type of state found in the classical world. While the structure and governance of these states was very different from that of any modern republic, there is debate about the extent to which classical, medieval, and modern republics form a historical continuum. Paul Rahe, a professor of classics for instance, argues that the classical republics had a form of government with few links to those in any modern country. At best, the word \u201crepublic\u201d is synonymous with the word \u201cregime\u201d with the simple meaning of a form of government or a form of rule without any of details. There is no direct or explicit connection between ancient republics and modern republics. Good luck people. ",
