            "answer_text": "This sounds like a garbled version of the principle of credulity, a principle advocated by Richard Swinburne: \u2018How things seem to be is good grounds for a belief about how things are.\u2019 (I believe that the principle was first proposed by C.D. Broad, but Swinburne is now its best known defender). Swinburne argued that without this principle we would not be able to form many beliefs about the world, and so would be unable to function. Right now, I see what looks like a computer screen in front of me. I don\u2019t stop to develop a watertight argument to show that it is a computer screen, I just assume that it is a computer screen until I acquire good reason to think it isn\u2019t. What\u2019s the difference between the Principle of Credulity and \u201cbeliefs should be deemed true until proven otherwise\u201d? I can\u2019t really see any difference in meaning between \u201cI believe that P\u201d and \u201cI deem it to be true that P.\u201d My beliefs just are the things I deem to be true. But there is a difference between it seeming to be that there is a computer in front of me, and my believing that there is a computer in front of me, such that the former can be grounds for the latter. (I can not believe that things are as they seem, but I cannot deem that things are not as I believe them to be). (If there\u2019s some difference in meaning between \u201cI deem it true that\u201d and \u201cI believe that\u201d it needs to be explained). Accepting the Principle of Credulity would perhaps mean accepting the point that the onus is on the person who thinks I\u2019m wrong to prove that. As it happens, I am not convinced by the Principle of Credulity. Swinburne argues for the Principle of Credulity based on the fact that Without This We Couldn\u2019t Function. He thinks we should accept epistemic principles if those epistemic principles are necessary for us to function. I think we could apply the Without This We Couldn\u2019t Function principle directly to perceptions. If I gave up the belief that there is a computer in front of me right now, I couldn\u2019t function. But suppose it seems to me that I see an angel. I could function perfectly well while believing \u201cI am seeing a hallucination not a real angel.\u201d The Principle of Credulity would lead me to believe in the Angel, but the Without This We Couldn\u2019t Function Principle would not. (When I put that point to Swinburne, he did admit that there is a distinction between things that seem to be so, and things such that if I didn\u2019t have them, I would be unable to function.) If you want to know more about the topic, you might want to look up more about the Principle of Credulity. ",

            "answer_text": "Should beliefs be deemed true until proven otherwise? Obviously no. Should beliefs be deemed false until proven otherwise? Still no! Don\u2019t confuse belief with fact. We all believe things that are not proven, and many of them cannot be proven. I believe that my wife is not having an affair with another guy. Did I prove this? Do I have cameras watching her or detectives following her? No. But she has earned my trust.When I get into my car to drive to work, I believe I\u2019ll arrive there without getting hit by a bus. Have I proven this conclusion by analyzing bus patterns or getting to know bus drivers? No, but I drive carefully and bus drivers have been pretty good too in my experience.I believe that the universe is infinite in size. Have I proven this? No, but makes the most sense to me.Many of the things we believe are like this: They are built on trust, experience, evidence, and reason \u2014 but not on proof. Also, it is implicitly understood that a belief may turn out to be wrong. Some beliefs involve some vague elements that cannot not even be clearly articulated, let alone proven. People could not function without having these sorts of beliefs, and for sane people, such beliefs usually work out well. When they don\u2019t work out, we learn something. ",
