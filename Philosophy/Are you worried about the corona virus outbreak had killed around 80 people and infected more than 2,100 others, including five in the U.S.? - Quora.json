In three months it has killed 162 people in a city of 11 million less than 100 people have been infected outside of China, which means they are doing a really good job containing it considering how much air traffic goes through China. The media started going on a rampage when there was less than 25 people dead. In the last 3 months of the flu season last year Cleveland, Ohio an American City of 385,000 people there were 174 deaths from flu related symptoms including pneumonia, no one bats an eye. These are the same sorts of people dying, mostly old people whose time was already limited due to age and other medical issues. Every month nearly 35,000 people die of Malaria in Africa. No one in America gives a shit. Thousands have died Puerto Rico because of Trump\u2019s mismanagement and republicans say fuck them they can\u2019t vote for the president, they don\u2019t matter. However when 170 mostly old people in a country of 1.4 Billion die, Americans begin to lose their shit. ",

            "answer_text": "I am headed in the direction of worry. First, the death toll is about 3% so far. That's high. That's the approximate death percentage from the 1918 flu. Second, the incubation period is variable, ranging from a few days to two weeks. That means we could be in a major epidemic before we knew it. Attempts to stop it by quarantining Wuhan have failed. It's into the world at large. It could fizzle out quickly, as we all hope. But it could be 1918 all over again. ",

For the people who have been diagnosed as being infected with the Corona virus, they are in government restricted areas. The Corona virus is respiratory so it can only be spread by coughing, sneezing or breathing within proximity. Because of this, I will not be exposed to it. I, therefore, have no worries about it. ",
