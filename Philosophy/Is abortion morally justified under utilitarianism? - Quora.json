            "answer_text": "Utilitarianism is (in short) the premise that that which does the most good to the most people while doing the least harm to the fewest people has a strong tendency to be good. It\u2019s degree of \u201cgoodness\u201d will be directly proportional to the quantity and quality of benefit vs. the quantity and quality of harm. In short: More people helped and the degree to which you help them determines how \u201cgood\u201d a thing is. When you say \u201cabortion\u201d, you are painting with a broad brush. If we go off of the western European model of what is appropriate in abortion, then killing a fetus before 18 weeks is perfectly fine because it\u2019s not a person. It is the epitome of a utilitarian equation \u2014 no person is harmed, one person benefits. It\u2019s good. Utilitarianism if followed slavishly breaks down. I consider myself to be something along the lines of a soft-utilitarian. I don\u2019t think you can adequately analyze every moral dilemma with a single school of thought on morality. A lot of how we determine good vs. evil has an implicit \u201ctime\u201d component in it. How much time you have to act and solicit aid is always going to determine which school of thought is best in a given moment. If you are careening towards a crowd and (to move along with this tired analogy) and can choose a fork in the road: hit a single child vs. hit 10 people in the crowd and you only have seconds to think, it\u2019s clearly the right choice to veer left (oh and the child is on the left). But along with a \u201ctime\u201d component, there\u2019s a \u201cchoice\u201d component. How much of a choice do you have in the course of events? See, this is where utilitarianism breaks down: what if you only have to push the child in front of the car to stop it from hitting the crowd? Very different course of action. A purist of utilitarian thought would say, \u201cThen it\u2019s good.\u201d But we know better. There\u2019s simply more to it than that. See: Specifically what characteristics of a healthy human fetus lead some pro-choice people to claim that it is neither alive nor human?What is the response to the argument from fetal potential in the abortion debate?The pregnancy, having become a reality, confines the choices. The fetus before 18 weeks is not a person, and so any abortion for any reason before that time, I don\u2019t consider to be much in any doubt. After that, I leave it to the local government to make policy based on the values of their citizens. I\u2019d prefer it to be left as legal as possible based on the needs of the mother. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends. Utilitarianism dictates that a thing is ethical if it secures a beneficial outcome. To say whether or not abortion is justified under utilitarian ethics depends on whether the fetus would have had an overall positive or negative impact on the world had they been allowed to develop, be born, and live. Utilitarian ethics would say it is unethical to abort any pregnancy which would result in a person who has a positive overall impact on the world. The flip side is that it would also say that it is unethical to not abort a pregnancy which would result in a person who has a negative overall impact. Of course, it is impossible to determine a person\u2019s overall impact on the world, especially prior to their birth. There are far too many variables and potentialities to be considered. Utilitarianism is a very poor guide for such issues unless you impose limits upon its scope, limits which would ultimately boil down to it becoming a matter of self determination. ",
