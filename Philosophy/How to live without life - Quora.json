            "answer_text": "It\u2019s time to make an inventory! Take a sheet of paper and pencil. List all of the aspects of your life. Career aspirations and continuing education might be written first. Hobbies go on your list. Digital magazine subscriptions, neighborhood affiliations, and charity fundraising campaigns. Everything. Once you have all of the items that comprise your \u201clife\u201d, then assign a number to each one that represents its importance to you. One represents the highest level of importance, Two means that a specific item is not as valuable as the ones. Placing a three next to another item indicates a low value in comparison to the others. In this way you can determine what is most important to you and should be maintained. The items on the list that are marked with a value of three can be discarded. For added insight. Show your list to a friend to get their feedback. You may end up saving something you might have tossed away in haste. It\u2019s a good procedure for everyone! ",
