            "answer_text": "These are the 4 tests of philosophy, and their examples. The Test of Independence: Philosophers are naturally independent in their thinking. They submit to no authority but that which they find the most logical. To be a philosopher is to disagree even when the rest agree and even oppose you. How much are you willing to abandon the Heaven of Conformity in the search of the Mountain of Logic? There is an example: You are living in an underground dome with your community, none of which has ever seen the light of the sun beyond the isolation of the underground habitat. Your community claim that venturing out of the Dome of Safety is a waste of effort and time, because there is only emptiness out there. If you are to complete the Test of Independence, then you are to seek the truth even at the cost of your reputation and respect from those who know you, in the name of clarification and discovery.The Test of Seclusion: Philosophers are not only independent-thinking individuals, but also people that go in their own ways, most of the time, by themselves. Philosophers are explorers of logic in distant lands, sometimes within the comfort of their own hermitage. To pass the test of seclusion, you are to know and to endure the Realm of Seclusion. You are to overcome even your own desires for company in the name of intellectuality and your actualization as a philosopher. Example: You are in a two-ways path on a Saturday night. One the one hand you wish to contemplate about whatever may interest you, and on the other hand your friends are to tempt you to be in their company, as a regular hangout on the weekends. To pass the Test of Seclusion, you are to overcome the temptation for company, in the name of the Love of Wisdom.The Test of Endurance: None is completely safe from angst, for the evidence of life, is the evidence of pain. Philosophers are no exception, even if they are to minimize their pain in the living. At times, philosophers are to suffer even more than the average individual, for their insights may bring great misery upon them. To be a philosopher is to prepare yourself for the possibility that you may be tormented when an insight is to be revealed by your contemplations. You have to endure the pain of the insight like a sick person endures the disgusting taste of a medical pill; endure it until it shall become acknowledged and accepted by you, and thus the increase of mental strength is to follow. Example: If you are to realize that, after logical thinking, there is no afterlife because there is no soul, then it might be of great pain to you, because you may realize how temporary your and everyone\u2019s life is. None knows what truly lies after death, but if there is no evidence to the existence of souls, then it is likely that there is nothing after death, but the end of life itself. Think of how horrible it might be for some.The Test of Power: There is a very thin line between a philosopher and a cult leader. To be a philosopher is to engage in intellectual activity that may or may not attract other people to listen to what you have to say; to be a cult leader is to use this attraction for the sake of eliminating the freedom of these interested people, by making them your minions. A philosopher seeks clarification; a cult leader uses their own clarification as darkening the vision of others, and thus taking away their independence to attain the Illusion of Power. If you are to pass the Test of Power, you are to resist the Temptation of Manipulation when you are to meet people who are interested in your philosophical thinking. You are to bring them from the darkness to the Light of Reason, and not the opposite. The Darkness of Blind Faith is the enemy of philosophy, not its ally. You are not to give orders to others, but be their guide, and the choice of following you or disagreeing with your reason is theirs and theirs only. When philosophy is to be used as a source of Socio-Political power, it begins to lose its purity as a Tool of Clarification, and instead it becomes a cult. If it is to gain popularity, it is to become a religion. Know the thin line between the two, and attempt to stay on the Side of Light, until you give up the desire to control others, and thus the Test of Power shall be passed successfully.",

            "answer_text": "Western cultural bias would have us believe or maintain that the term philosophy is strictly a tradition based affair. Categories of advanced thought echo within it's halls. That perspectives are challenged or advanced as schools of thought. While a student may surpass the teacher through intellectual prowess, in other cases the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 breaks free of their mentor entirely, often with voluminous and creditable works of their own. There are others who will address \u201cthe four categories\u201d, but a truer test of another\u2019s wisdom is much more interactive, intimate and subtle. In San Francisco, \u2018back in the day, Monday Night Class was being held by a man named Steven Gaskin. Like Alan Watts or Ram Dass, he was a very eclectic fellow. The general trajectory of his teachings had to do with paying attention. The city had already welcomed Zen Master Shunyru Suzuki and his influence had no small bearing on the beatnik and hippy generations. While on his deathbed, Gaskin conveyed the story of how he raced cross town for what is known in zen circles as \u2018transmission\u2018. I remember thinking when I heard this (as a general impression) that, if philosophy is a love of wisdom and the mind of the wise may be \u201ctested\", then perhaps a non-verbal accord or recognition of what constitutes wisdom might also be ascertained by exchanging a shared perception of mindfulness, after all, the quality of one's immediacy betrays the disingenuous. Years later, after reading several of Gaskin\u2019s works, I hitch-hiked to the commune know as The Farm to check things out. For brief moments I had the opportunity to meet him and left with a favorable impression. This same or similar experience occurred when I met Korean Zen Master Seungsahn. I had often wondered if the two should meet, whether that would validate what I half-claim to have noticed in both men -- a simple yet silent presence. If memory serves me well, their meeting each other occurred in Cumberland Rhode Island sometime during the eighties. Seungsahn grabbed Gaskin in an affable sort of bear hug and declared with an accent: \u201cThis Zen Master\u201d thus confirming what I long suspected. Perhaps it was indicative of the fifth \u201ctruth test of philosophy\". Sharing \u2018high tea' may be a thoroughly practiced ritual steeped in antiquity, but the quality of their shared rapport was a comradery of natural ease\u2026 ",
