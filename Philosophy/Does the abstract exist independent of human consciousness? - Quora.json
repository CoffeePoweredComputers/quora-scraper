            "answer_text": "The only way an abstract thing can exist is by having an abstracter. Any sentient being that can recognize that it is separate from its environment can create an abstraction because this recognition can only occur with the use of an abstracted conceptual paradigm. The verb abstract means to \u201cremove, separate\u201d. For humans, an abstraction occurs when they create a conceptual imitation of something that has been perceived. To understand what abstract means for us, one must accept as a postulation that our consciousness is derived under the conditions of a subjective machine that\u2019s integrating with an objective world. The world sends signals to the machine and the machine forms a conceptual rendition of its surroundings. The interpretation of these signals is the process of abstraction. Humans create physical abstractions also. Art, architecture, mathematics and so on. The abstract can \u201cexist independently of human consciousness\u201d if there is another entity capable of recognizing that it is separate from its environment by using an abstracted conceptual paradigm. If this kind of relationship does not occur than the abstract does not exist. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s first look at a simple definition of consciousness: the state or quality of awareness, or, of being aware of an external object or something within oneself. What is the realm of possible awareness? Consider the electromagnetic spectrum, of which we are able to perceive maybe 1%. Are there certain universal components that are inherent, even though they may only be an abstract at best? The spectrum would seem to have certain consistent qualities throughout the demarcations of bandwidth, which we call \u2018rays\u2019 currently. We don\u2019t have to be aware of them to know they exist, perhaps. Yet, the knowledge is in itself an awareness. If one loses the sense of self, as in bodily form and/or waking consciousness, either in the void or in the light\u2026 is there a consistent sense of individuality and collective consciousness in each? Some evidence points to the possibility of its truth. When one is in such a state, though, consciousness still permeates the experience as an inner awareness. Perhaps the notion of human consciousness needs further discussion first. ",

            "answer_text": "\u2018The abstract\u2019 doesn\u2019t \u2018exist\u2019 at all. Things like the Eiffel Tower exist: specific tangible entities with mass and volume. But sometimes we want to talk about groups of these entities, or groups of events that involve some of these entities, and for that purpose we have developed a language which allows us to refer to \u2018things\u2019 that are not existents in this concrete tangible sense. So I can use an abstract concept like \u2018French landmarks\u2019, and someone who speaks the same language can understand what I am talking about without me having to specify \u201cthe Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, Mont-Saint-Michel\u2026.\u201d and so on every single time. And likewise with other linguistic abstractions: cats, dogs, love, cheese, etc. Individual lumps of cheese are objects that exist; \u2018cheese\u2019 as an abstract concept does not. Abstractions are simply linguistic shortcuts. They\u2019re not the kind of things that exist as objects in the real world, any more than, say, a cricket score exists as an object. ",

            "answer_text": "I think by abstract you mean universals. Philosophical realism, both moderate Aristotelianism and extreme Platonism, think universals do exist independent of thought, while various kinds of Idealism think universals are (general) concepts in the mind. If you want to believe that the world you see in front of you is real, and not just something mind-dependent, then you will have to have universals \u201cout there\u201d because you see sameness and difference. The arguments for and against idealism and nominalism have consumed great amount of time in the history of philosophy. I love those arguments. Maybe you would also. ",
