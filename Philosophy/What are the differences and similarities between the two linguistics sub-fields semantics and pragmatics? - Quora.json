            "answer_text": "In short, semantics is the study of meaning,pragmatics is the study of context.The study of language actually distinguishes three branches: syntax, semantics and pragmatics. Syntax is concerned solely with relations between linguistic expressions;Semantics with relations between expressions and the objects to which they refer;Pragmatics with relations among expressions, the objects to which they refer, and users or contexts of use of the expressions.One note should be made is that semantics can operate in relative ignorance of pragmatics, but not the other way around. From an automatic interpretation, I can see that many artificial intelligence (AI) attempts have tried to automatically interpret texts\u2019 content but not yet succeeded. The contexts to be considered are just too tremendously large (somewhat arbitrarily large) and we don\u2019t know (yet) all the different ways in which context might influence interpretation.
