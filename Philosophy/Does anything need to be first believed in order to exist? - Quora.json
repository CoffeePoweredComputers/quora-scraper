I tend to believe that an invisible force probably created the universe with the help of evolution. I rarely, if ever, meet anyone who believes this. It might very well exist, but I don\u2019t believe that any of us will ever know. I don\u2019t think that it will be introducing itself. This doesn\u2019t make it any less real if it does indeed exist. Whether we believe or not matters not. ",

Because if you mean like chairs then believing in chairs ? but what would that even mean maybe you could say because to me obviously nonsense or a word salad as they say \u2014, do you like salad ? Or maybe you meant like socks where you do first have to believe in the market before you can \u201csee\u201d them ,but honestly I wouldn't know , definitely not be the right person to ask who neither believe in the market nor see any stocks .

We have the His Word, His creation, and best of all His Son Jesus who came to us revealed God in the flesh died for our sins so we can live eternally with Him. But the catch is you won\u2019t know He truly exist personally until the moment you accept by faith Christ as your Savior. He promise to make Himself known to you by giving you the Holy Spirit top live within you. John 14:23 - Jesus answered and said to him, \u201cIf anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him ",

You don\u2019t have to believe anything for your existence, but you can ask, if you are an eternal being, why are you in this temporary and miserable body? And the answer is because you were rebellious in the eternal Spiritual world, you have been sent down to this material world where everyone experiences birth, disease, distress, old age, and death, in 8,000,000 species of life forms, until they realize that they are suffering here. So if you are intelligent then you will take steps to get out of this miserable situation by surrendering to the Supreme Lord Krishna. And the easiest and best way is to chant Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare hare. Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. Please share. ",

            "answer_text": "I read about a study where people from a tribe in Africa who had never been in contact with industrialised society were contacted by anthropologists and shown video footage of a western city. The story is that not only could they not describe what they were seeing, they genuinely couldn't perceive the shapes and images on the screen. At some point a chicken came into view and they saw that readily enough. Obviously no-one is claiming that they were blind to the incoming light from the screen, but that a big part of seeing is not just receiving information but interpreting it, meaning that if the signal makes no sense to you, it is hard for your brain to even take it in.

There are many things we just recently discover but have existed for many, many years. consider the dinosaurs, the creatures in the deep oceans, and so on - many creatures are still unknown to us but they exist. We will one day discover more of them, but their existence is not dependent on our belief in their existence. ",
