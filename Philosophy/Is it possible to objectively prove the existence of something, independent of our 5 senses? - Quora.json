            "answer_text": "David Hume showed that all evidence is what we see, hear, taste, touch, smell, or feel emotionally. That last one is not part of our 5 senses. I don\u2019t see how it is possible to objectively demonstrate the existence of something without those. \u201cobjectively\u201d also implies intersubjective evidence. Intersubjective evidence is that everyone has the same evidence from the senses and emotions to approximately the same circumstances. This is why art and literature are not considered \u201cobjective\u201d, because people have different reactions to them. Therefore, \u201cfeel emotionally\u201d is often not intersubjective. This is a paper where \u201cfeel emotionally\u201d was objective and intersubjective: 2.

            "answer_text": "If I can't see it, or touch it, or smell it, or taste it, or hear it, then it does not exist, and cannot be measured. Our mind does not exist. Our thoughts do not exist. Consciousness does not exist. There is no such thing as a conscience. Phenomenology is an outright fraud. Psychology is an outright fraud. Homeostasis is medical fraud. Cybernetics is fraud. Bio-cybernetics is fraud. Psycho-cybernetics is fraud. Socio-cybernetics is fraud. Somatic senses and sensors are fraud (except of course our 5 senses). Intelligence does not exist, and therefore cannot be measured. There is no such thing as 'left brain' intelligences. There is no such thing as 'right brain' intelligences. There is no such thing as Multiple Intelligences - Howard Gardner does not exist either. Existential intelligences definitely do not exist. There is no such thing as existential/ism. Intuition is fraud \u2013 Einstein and Poincar\u00e9 were fraudsters. Steve Jobs too. Tim Cook too.The $2 trillion company called Apple does not actually exist. Spirituality is fraud \u2013 despite Sam Harris' protestations to the contrary. There is no such thing as \u201cthe human spirit\u201d. You cannot lift someone's spirit. You cannot crush someone's spirit. Fear, greed, lust, corruption, love, joy, peace, kindness, goodness, mildness, and self-control do not exist. Emotions do not exist. Emotional pain does not exist. Trauma does not exist. Morality does not exist. Ethics does not exist. The thousands of mathematicians and physicists who work with higher dimensions (4D to 11D) are delusional nut jobs and fraudsters. The placebo and nocebo effects do not exist. Out Of Body experiences do not exist, notwithstanding Dr Stanislav Grof's experiments and assertions. All Near Death Experiences and tales of travel beyond 3D are complete fiction. We are mindless machines or robots \u2013 nothing more, nothing less. The list is endless\u2026 ",
