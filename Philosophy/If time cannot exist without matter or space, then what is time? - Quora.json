            "answer_text": "It\u2019s an abstraction. Time and everything else all exist and don\u2019t exist at the same time. They exist because they can be abstracted, but they don\u2019t exist without their abstractions. The key is that not everything can be abstracted. There must be something to abstract from. Not all abstractions make sense, and not all sense is real. This source of our abstractions is everything at once, undivided, and unabstracted. Yet it is also nothing at the same time, because existence is abstraction itself. It\u2019s before it\u2019s anything. What is unabstracted cannot exist because it cannot be known. What cannot be known cannot be talked about, and so is beyond reasoning. Then what is time? It\u2019s connection with other abstractions is a good sign, because there are no abstractions that are disconnected from everything. But that can also be said about matter, or space, or anything else. And the key here is that everything knowable is also somehow connected to us, or they would be unabstractable. Abstraction is what happens when an intelligent agent makes contact, resulting in intelligence. Time is a concept, which in itself is a state of existence, backed both by common sense and mathematical proof and scientific evidence. Time is a piece of intelligence. Everything is a concept, which in itself is a state of existence. What anything is backed by though differs, and that is the only thing we have to differentiate existences to test how aligned they are with reality, how accurate they may be, and whether they\u2019re worth using or not. And testing whether they are worth using is something I\u2019m doing right now as I type, or what anyone does whenever they utter anything. Abstractions manifest themselves as words. Every word is connected with the root of all abstractions or else they would never come into being \u2014 words such as time, space, even God, and even reality. And that is why scientists can depend on words to do science, and philosophers can use words to untangle \u2014 or further tangle \u2014 reality. Words are an extension of reality itself. It is everything physically knowable to us making itself known. Then what is reality? Reality too is just a word, and the pursuit of a distinction between any other type or class of existence here is futile. Words are no less real than anything else. It\u2019s all real, and everything bleeds into everything else. The only illusion is the illusion itself which is the only true contradiction. There cannot be anything without something to begin with. At the end of the day, our intelligence cannot escape us, and we cannot escape our intelligence. Reality is not the basis of our models, but a model in and of itself. My reality is not your reality and neither are mathematical or physically accurate models, yet they are, to us, as real as it gets. Of course, this mind bending exercise does serve one progressive purpose. Throughout it all, we find ourselves getting smarter, and maybe that\u2019s all that matters. But I digress. Time is a word, and a very good word, at that. Use it as you wish, and you can learn from how others use it. ",

            "answer_text": "The simplest answer is that time exist the same way motion exists. If there was no matter to move or space to move through, motion wouldn't be possible. Time refers to motion through the temporal dimension. It's something that things do. If there were no things to time, time wouldn't exist/be possible. We didn't invent time. We named it. It's a naturally occurring phenomenon. We invented clocks, which allow us to measure the temporal distance an object travels. Now, our consciousness progresses from one moment to the next and as this happens, we perceive changes occurring around us and to us. This is how we experience time passing. It's not that time passes. It's us that move through the temporal dimension. We time. ",

Since time is the process of change or movement involving matter or space, then time is simply the observation of change, of matter changing or moving in a certain order.______________________________________________________________I am quite confident in my answer and I wonder what Richard Muller would think of my explanation.Thanks for the A2A!

This is called space-time and it's not a convention. It is one thing. You can speak of the space-time fabric. Your question thus actually asks if space-time can exist without matter. The answer seems easy: Yes. An even easier one would be the opposite \u201cCould matter exist without space-time?\u201d No. Back to your question, I would say maybe no after all. Although I can imagine an \u201dempty\u201d space-time fabric, it seems that from its nature it is obviously more than only that. All the ingredients to matter might well be included. Maybe if you'd launch a slightly different version of our space-time fabric, you could generate it so as to be sterile. With no possibility of appearance of anything. Our space-time fabric, it's my educated guess, might hide in even more than only space and time. Everything from a background for the four fundamental forces and energy, to the \u201cthings\u201d needed for consciousness. ",
