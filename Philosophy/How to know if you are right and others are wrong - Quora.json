            "answer_text": "If you think about it there is very little that can be spoken of as any sort of absolute certainty that doesn\u2019t require several caveats attached. Most people who truly believe that they are \u201calways right\u201d overlook the fact that the overbearing personality which usually accompanies that belief tends to put off others to the point they try not to even engage them in conversation. Even when the subject at hand is of a scientific nature and someone has \u201cdone research\u201d they can only claim to right as far as the current beliefs are concerned. Even Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, once believed to be an unshakeable \u201cfact\u201d in physics has come under scrutiny. I recall when the molecules of an atom were said to be the smallest particles in the physical world. Medicine is the same. Considered a \u201ctrue science\u201d there was a time when someone who suffered from any illness was deliberately cut so the \u201cbad blood\u201d could be drained out. In the mid 1970\u2019s I did a college term paper on the subject of the coming ice age that was presented as fact by the same people who 20 years later spoke of the ice caps melting because of global warming. Of course according to Al Gore we should have totally new coastlines around the world already. What I wonder is why for some people it is so very important that they are perceived as being right all the time ? Psychologically speaking it\u2019s a fair guess that it\u2019s due to an over-inflated sense of self, likely to compensate for high degree of insecurity. Not always, but if you place a bet on it, that\u2019s where the odds are best. I personally subscribe to the shared concept of those that many would consider to be some of the greatest minds throughout written history. The more we learn, the greater our understanding of just how ignorant we truly are. Those who find great importance in proving themselves right all the time have a problem because they must see themselves as the \u201cwinner\u201d and that they\u2019re smarter than whoever they are disagreeing with. I\u2019m over 60 and my years have shown me that if I\u2019m dealing with someone who \u201cknows it all\u201d there will be no way to prove them wrong, and if I did I\u2019d end up becoming frustrated over something of no real importance. It costs nothing to allow someone to walk away feeling they were right as they hold on tightly to their own ignorance. ",

            "answer_text": "I am always right. Once I thought I was wrong, but it turned out to be a mistake. How do I deal with the fact that everyone else is wrong? Well, I can give you an example. Just yesterday, I was having a conversation with one person who thinks he knows everything there is to know about cars. I told him there is a Jag Type E that costs 500K pounds. He said that is impossible because if there was such a car he would know about it. I showed him a picture of the car that \"does not exist\"  And I said, you are right, the car is just a figment of my imagination, sorry for that. This was the end of the conversation. He carried on saying that the most expensive new car you can buy was the Bugatti, and I told him, nope! It is not! He carried on explaining why he was right and I merely showed him another figment of my imagination, The Maybach Excelero, created by Italy's Stola Group, now under the name of \"Stola Phalcon\" that costs 7 Million.   He, of course, said the car was not real because if it was he would have to know about it, to which I replied: \"Sure if you say so, it must be true and I must be wrong\" People who think they know everything can be a great annoyance to those of us who do if we let them. The solution is to always say that either they are right or to say one of us must be wrong but who cares about it, let's have a drink to celebrate. :) ",

Unless we, as humans, either kill ourseves or grow up, everything that you see in the paper will happen again and again. I know that seems a bit cynical but I find I stress a lot less over the news than most people.  Edit- for new question. - All opinions are based on a persons life experience. Due to the fact that everybody lives different lives , no one will have the exact opinion. So that being said no one is exactly right or exactly wrong.  ",
