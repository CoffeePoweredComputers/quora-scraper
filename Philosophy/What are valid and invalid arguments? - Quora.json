            "answer_text": "Arguments such that it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusions false.  A valid argument must be such that if the premises are true the conclusions -must be true-.  There is no possible world in which the premises of a valid argument are true and the conclusion not true. Put another way,  the truth value of the conclusions must be greater than or equal to the truth value of the premises. There are various systems of logic which have this property.  By using the inferences rules one always reaches a true conclusion from true premises. By the way,  the validity of an argument does NOT guarantee the truth of the premises.  This must be determined by other means. ",

            "answer_text": "Valid arguments are instances of valid argument forms. They always transmit truth from premises to conclusion and transmit falsity from the conclusion to at least one of the premises. Invalid arguments don't always transmit truth from premises to conclusion, and don't always transmit falsity from conclusion to at least one of the premises. The premises of a valid argument always have at least as much content as the conclusion and the conclusion of a valid argument can only have content which is already contained in the premises. ",
