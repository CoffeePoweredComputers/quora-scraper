            "answer_text": "Lemme add to Anonymous's answer. That yes, people who have nothing tend to appreciate more what they have. Heck, why do we even bother to eat? Because hunger makes us suffer. People who have survived are sometimes more grateful to be alive. But that also takes another aspect. The death of others. How sometimes one is grateful that one survived, one was fortunate, while others weren't. Someone can appreciate what they have, considering there are other people who don't. Children in Africa could've eaten that food you wasted. Man, isn't that one most of us heard from our mothers at one point on life, or many times... But it adds even more meaning to life. Through empathy. Because the suffering of others gives us the opportunity to open our hearts and do what we can to help. Bringing people closer together. So, yes, we might hate suffering, or at least I do, but cannot deny that it adds a lot of meaning/point/value, to life. That is why it has to exist. That is why when we are in Heaven, we will appreciate Heaven, because we have known suffering, which was part of God's plan since the beginning. ",

            "answer_text": "Let's be very clear. We are not talking of children that undergo suffering. Presuming that we are speaking of suffering as an adult, this is what I think of it. If at all anything, suffering brings a delusion of meaning to life. When I say suffering, I do not mean going through difficult times, going through pain, being wronged. I mean suffering in itself, as an action, as a consequence of what has happened to you. When indulged in without reflection, suffering can create a sense of false self-importance. It can lead us into a cycle of blame, a negative narrative. It can lead us to create false battles within and without that distract us from discovering the real purpose of our lives that stems out of our inner vitality. Author Haruki Murakami once quoted in his book \u201cPain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.\u201d If applied mindfully, suffering could potentially bring us to our inner light. But when suffering becomes the narrative of our lives, we are no longer able to access our true potential to realisation. ",

It\u2019s also saturated with complaints about how bad things are. I find myself telling stories about myself, my life and the suffering I endured, and listening to others do the same. Everything we do, we do for the rewarding feeling it brings, including telling stories of great stuff and miserable stuff. We are story tellers first and foremost. Suffering does nothing but make us suffer; in the telling, we find meaning. ",

It is natural to be afraid of suffering for it\u2019s not a desirable state of existence. One must however, learn how to cope with it. At one such point of time in my life my mom told me that \u201csuccess is the best revenge\u201d. At that time I didn\u2019t know what it meant or implied. Over a couple of months I got better and eventually completed my studies and gave my examinations. I did well, and I was happy. In a way the experience milder me because now when I look back, I can see that I evolved and that I had the strength to do so, which I might not have gotten without suffering. ",

I\u2019d only like to add that I think that there\u2019s something to be said for the notion that \u2018we choose our pain\u2019. In a certain sense, we are defined by the things that cause suffering. One may choose to remember a painful event because of the lessons that can be learned thereby. One may define herself by feeling sympathy and pity for those less fortunate. One may practice meditation in an attempt to alleviate or avoid suffering. In each case, suffering seems to give life some meaning. ",

Another person, in the same situation and with the same personality, would have been wounded beyond repair. There are similar distinctions in other conditions. Poverty forced on others can lead to wasted lives and sickness and death. But someone who takes poverty on himself or herself, and grows through it, is among the most blessed of people. ",

Whenever there is suffering, see that the solution is near. For example, when it is 5 o clock in the morning, we look forward to sunrise and it happens. When suffering, imagine it is 5 o clock and Sun is rising now.. ",
