            "answer_text": "A delicate question which exposes to the excesses of mysticism on one side, to those of reductionism on the other. First there is no consensus on the existence of levels of consciousness. It is better to speak of levels of mental organization, some of which enter the field of consciousness and others do not. Conscious contents are not just sophisticated concepts. For example, we consciously perceive a tiny mosquito bite. But not the arrival of a photon on the retina; the signal is already transformed into a visual image when it reaches conscious integration. The difference is probably related precisely to the number of levels of organization traversed by the information. The higher the number, the less the primitive impression of the signal is accessible to consciousness. There are clearly successive levels of organization in the consciousness. To represent oneself as a person is a degree superior to the simple fact of experiencing oneself. It is a real construction that is not yet in place in the young child. Neither is the evolution of mental schemas in others: it is always possible to only experience oneself even when one is able to represent oneself. We are able to perceive this shift. Levels of social organization are supported in consciousness. For example a person is able to think about a subject as an individual, or parent, craftsman, company manager, elected, expert, etc. Each of these postures incorporates broader judgment criteria. Observation of the subject is at a level of consciousness different from others, to the point that they can be contradictory. Example: the judgment of the father is radically opposed to that of the expert. Context summons the level that will take the decision. We tend to say that \"I\" choose by weighing all the criteria, but it is rather the context that places our \"I\" at the appropriate level of consciousness to facilitate the decision. These levels are very specific to the mental organization of each individual and there is only oneself to try to specify them. To generalize them is very arbitrary. It is putting one's own mental schemas on others without necessarily corresponding to them. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe that there are multiple levels of limitations. I call it the four prisons. The first one being space. You are limited to your location. In life, you can only access things that are around you. Whether if it is people, toys, food, or products, you are stuck with what\u2019s available around you. Not to mention that you can\u2019t be at multiple place at once. Which means you can\u2019t observe information that happens at another point at the same time as you\u2019re observing information that happens at this point. You can\u2019t be a two places at once. The second one is time. You are limited to the time that is given to you and you can\u2019t go back in time to change things. If your time is infinite, you might be able to do a lot of things but you can\u2019t do things that has gone extinct or meet people that has already died. You are forever stuck in the present. The third being your sense. In this world, we only have five senses and they are see, touch, hear, smell, and taste. Beyond those, we are unable to sense beyond anything else. Like being able to see air molecules or being able to sense other people around us without seeing or touching them. The forth being your mind. In this world, we are limited to what we know. Even your imagination, things that are beyond this world, you can only imagine things that you know. That\u2019s because you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. For example, you don\u2019t know the existence of apple juice. Even if it exist, it may as well not exist at all to you because you don\u2019t know that it exist. ",
