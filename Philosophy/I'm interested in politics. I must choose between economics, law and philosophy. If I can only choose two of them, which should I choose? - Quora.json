Now then , you are left with law and philosophy. You choose law and study to do the above, because govt will rob you land for road widening or HT power line projects , and will kill your cows for feeding the poor people.

Are you in kindergarten, do you have to do project in high school or are you up for a PhD at Stanford University? And may I suggest another subject for you to consider and to dedicate your life to: creation science. Because of the enormous amount of people in the US believing in creationism I think you'll have a nice big audience for your future publications about the subject. Must be easy to make a living out of it. Just follow into the footsteps of Kent Hovind. ",
