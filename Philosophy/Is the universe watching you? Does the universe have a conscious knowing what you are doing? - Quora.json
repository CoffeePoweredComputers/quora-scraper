            "answer_text": "Allow me to give this one a try. Since the beginning of humans, man has been fascinated With the stars. \u201cSurely the gods must be up there watching over us \u201c they would say. There are historical documents that tell of these gods coming to earth to help us ,and help advance the knowledge of humans. Large numbers of people To this day believe the Egyptians, and the Mayans were helped by the gods from outer space . the Greeks were so sure of it that They developed these great tales of how the gods came from the heavens and helped win wars, created the seas, and all the lands that we have around us, brought Us happiness and sadness. Although I myself believe that mathematically ,there must be other forms of life in the universe... For the first time in history we can see far into space. We now know the there is no end to the universe, and there is no beginning of time. It is something that has been planted in our minds since we were born. When I was a child I knew nothing of time ,except someone saying \u201ctime for bed \u201cor \u201ctime to eat\u201d. Now as we\u2019ve grown, we know how important Time is. The time will come when another life form is found in the universe by us. It is a mathematical certainty. Just a hundred years ago we were still riding around in horse drawn carriages. Technology has advanced so fast, in such a short period of time, that we now have telescopes that we use to see extremely far into space. With the next generation of telescopes we may even be able to detect life on another planet such as ours, in another universe . Here is where my point about time comes into play. What we see in other galaxy,s with our high powered telescopes, has already happened years ago. Sometimes even thousands of years ago. That means if advanced life forms are out there, They have a thousand year headstart on us. Surely our galaxy cannot be the last galaxy developed, so we may be ahead of the game of sightseeing the heavens for that galaxy, but far behind for others. Buy the time our probes reach another galaxy, we will have been either extinct or have evolved into another species through the process of evolution. Our planet will not be the only planet occupied by the human species . A Hundred years from now if not sooner, I personally believe that there will be thousands on Mars .and a hundred years after that, the moons of Saturn or the sky,s of Venus. If we continue to advance , we Will find a way to to leave this solar system, but it will take Generations far beyond us to do this amazing feat. And we would need to harness the power of the sun in order to accomplish this\u2026..Then \u2026. We shall be the gods of Greek mythology\u2026.The Dream is real. ",

            "answer_text": "Science will say no. Scientists expect that it would speak to them directly or otherwise look or behave like an animal of some sort (living things with bodies). But what if the universe IS the body of a living thing? A conscious being? How would we know if it was conscious? I suggest that IF the universe was conscious, our entire physics would be turned upside down. The basis of existence, and certainly living things, wound be different. We would suddenly have to ask how do you explore such a fact? Would devices made from metal and plastic be capable of exploring that consciousness? In fact, the only tool that would likely be useful for exploring the consciousness of the universe wound be consciousness itself. We wound have to start looking into things like near death experiences, hypnosis (past-life regression), psychedelic drugs, and enlightenment experiences. It\u2019s also useful in my opinion to look at other pieces of the puzzle. I highly recommend the book Darwin\u2019s Doubt by Stephen Meyer for the most scientific argument about why evolution and the origins of life look directed and like an intelligence is/was involved. Things like DNA and cell walls. Etc. In the end I don\u2019t think the consciousness of the universe will ever be proven in a scientific way, much like string theory. There is nothing to test it against. Nowhere to \u201cstand\u201d to get a look at it, you might say. But individuals can come to their own conclusions by assembling the pieces of the puzzle. Good luck. ",
