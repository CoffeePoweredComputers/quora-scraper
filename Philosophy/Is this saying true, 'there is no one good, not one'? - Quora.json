            "answer_text": "as it is written: There is no one righteous, not even one. There is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. All have turned away;all alike have become worthless.There is no one who does what is good,not even one. Romans 3:10-12 (CSB) The fool says in his heart, \"There's no God.\"They are corrupt; they do vile deeds. There is no one who does good. The LORD looks down from heaven on the human race to see if there is one who is wise, one who seeks God.All have turned away; all alike have become corrupt.There is no one who does good, not even one. Psalm 14:1-3 (CSB) There is certainly no one righteous on the earth who does good and never sins. Ecclesiastes 7:20 (CSB) \u201cThere is no one righteous, not even one....\u201d (From Eccl 7:20; see Ps 14:1.) Here the word \u201crighteous\u201d (\u03b4\u03b9\u0301\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, dikaios) is used in its basic sense of \u201cconforming to a norm.\u201d The norm to which every human being must conform is the law of God, in whatever form it is available and relevant to him. This text says that no one is righteous; no one has conformed to this norm; everyone has broken God\u2019s law; everyone has sinned (3:23). That is, no one is righteous in an absolute sense, in the sense of sinless perfection, which is the only way we could be accepted by God on the basis of our own righteousness. Thus the need for the gift of righteousness revealed and offered in the gospel (1:17). Jack Cottrell, The College Press NIV Commentary \u2013 Romans In verses 10-12 statement of the universality of sin opens and closes the passage. Sin has affected human intellect, emotions, and volition. Note the repetition of \"none\" as well as \"all\" and \"not even one,\" all universal terms. In verses 13-18 Paul described the words (vv. 13-14), acts (vv. 15-17), and attitudes (v. 18) of man as tainted by sin. This passage is one of the most forceful in Scripture that deals with the total depravity of man. Total depravity does not mean that every person is as bad as he or she could be. It means that sin has affected every part of his or her being and consequently there is nothing anyone can do to commend himself or herself to a holy God. \"Depravity means that man fails the test of pleasing God. He [sic] denotes his unmeritoriousness in God's sight. This failure is total in that (a) it affects all aspects of man's being, and (b) it affects all people.\" The statement that \"there is none who seeks after God\" (v. 11) means that no one seeks God without God prompting him or her to do so (cf. John 6:44-46). It does not mean that people are constitutionally incapable of seeking God. People can and should seek God (Acts 17:26-27), and they are responsible for not doing so. \"Paul's portrayal of the unrighteous person may seem overly pessimistic to many contemporaries. After all, do we not all know certain individuals who live rather exemplary lives apart from Christ? Certainly they do not fit the description just laid out. Although it may be true that many of our acquaintances are not as outwardly wicked as the litany would suggest, we must remember that they are also benefactors of a civilization deeply influenced by a pervasive Judeo-Christian ethic. Take away the beneficent influence of Christian social ethics and their social behavior would be considerably different.\" \u2014 Tom Constable's Notes on the Bible ",
