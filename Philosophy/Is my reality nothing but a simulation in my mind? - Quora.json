And no I can\u2019t tell you where or how all that stuff happens. We are all but simulations within it. Shakespeare got it well. \u201dAll the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages. \u201d And the whole thing has been called \u201cmaya\u201d, \u201cthe dream\u201d, illusion and lots of other names. We could discuss endless opinion of how to describe a virtual holodeck output. We all see it all the time. And occasionally there is a glitch in the Matrix that is noticed and remembered. ",
