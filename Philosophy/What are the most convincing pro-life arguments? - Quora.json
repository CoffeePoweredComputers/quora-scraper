Unlike many (on both sides) who make statements based on slogans and ignorance, I try to justify my beliefs with examples and references - which stems from my training as both a scientist and a science teacher who has taught the basic biology of reproduction in schools. I can only, really, state the arguments that are convincing to me but then they would be the ones I believe to be most convincing anyway\u2026 I believe that all living human beings have a right to life and protection under the law regardless of colour, creed, sex, sexual inclination, physical or mental ability, wanted or unwanted or AGE - or any other reason/excuse that another human being might have for wanting to destroy or limit that life. It is an indisputable, scientific fact that a new human life starts with the fusion of two gametes to form a zygote. Every child at or about the age of 13 in the western world should be learning about the signs of life and Mrs Gren\u2026 Life processes : Revision, Page 2 \u2190BBC school revision website. When Human Life Begins \u2190 American College of Pediatricians. It is a matter of extreme prejudice that one human life does not have any rights simply because (s)he is less developed or more vulnerable than another. In a legal sense, the unborn child has no citizenship and therefore no rights, but then again this was true of slaves at one time too; and native Americans; and native Australians; Let\u2019s not forget Jews, gays, handicapped and negroes in the Third Reich. It\u2019s only signatures on a piece of paper that changed all that and other signatures on paper can change that for the unborn, too. A signature is a small difference to a human being, but everything to Human Rights. Can something so important be defined ONLY by something so trivial as a signature or is there something fundamental that warrants the signature in the first place? What Are Civil Rights? - FindLaw \u2190general legal look at human rights (unborn excluded - you have to extrapolate for the unborn). It is astonishing that most, if not all, of those who advocate abortion would also condemn child abuse, yet abortion is an extreme form of abuse of children, akin to the mediaeval torture / execution referred to as being \u201cHung Drawn and Quartered\u201d. Hanged, drawn and quartered - Wikipedia This could be considered analogous to sucking the baby through a small medical vacuum tube which effectively minces the little one\u2019s body or the technique of the partial-birth abortion. Abortion - Wikipedia Or again, who would not be horrified by a mother who kills her son by making him eat salt\u2026 Mom gets 20 years to life for poisoning son with salt \u2190 USA Today \u2026yet she would get lots of support to kill her unborn child by poisoning herself with a pill or burn off his skin with a saline injection or have a doctor inject a poison into her unborn child that will stop its heart? \u2190 all methods of abortion. Abortion Treatments - Types of Abortion \u2190British Pregnancy Advisory Service Feticide | BPAS \u2190British Pregnancy Advisory Service Aside: One aspect I don\u2019t understand is\u2026 if abortion is such a simple, ethically good thing - why is the method used so important? Why would one method of \u201cremoving a pregnancy\u201d, for example \u201cdilatation and curettage\u201d be acceptable whereas another, the \u201cpartial-birth abortion\u201d is federally banned in the USA? Could it be that this method is too gruesome and mediaeval? USA ban or not, this method is used in some countries. It is denial on a massive social scale that stops people seeing abortion for what it is. For an overview of denial see: The Self-Sabotaging Behavior of Denial. Take a look at the section titled \u201cShooting the Messenger\u201d about 1/3rd of the way down the article. Many Pro-Choice supporters don\u2019t actually realise what they are campaigning for and are mislead. We all want to believe promises that can get us out of a bad situation - even if it is a lie - we choose what we want to believe rather than accept the blindingly obvious that is staring us in the face. The irrational vitriol that people use claiming to be justified by \u201ccampaigning for women\u2019s rights\u201d just to salve their consciences - this is denial of guilt. Let\u2019s face it - over 50% of the aborted unborn are female too - what about their right to grow into women? Abortion clinics will describe what happens to the mother during an abortion, but never do they describe what happens to her child. They don\u2019t even refer to it as a child. What are they hiding from their patients? A foetus is just as much a human being as a baby, toddler, infant, adolescent, adult or geriatric - the word we use to describe our stage of development is irrelevant - we are all human beings. The lack of information from abortion clinics is disingenuous - in fact lying by omission. I could put up pictures or give links to photos or detail, but that would cause distress to some. However, they are easy to find online if you do a Google search - or even find videos on YouTube. In the US, much weight is put on the case of Roe V Wade in 1973. However, as was revealed in a Congressional hearing in 1998 to mark progress of the decision after 25 years, Jane Roe - real name Norma McCorvey - recanted her testimony and exposed the whole case as based on a lie. http://www.endroe.org/mccorveytestimony.aspx Lying under oath, distorting the truth about abortion and the humanity of the unborn, financial gain from carrying out abortions (are there any surgeons performing abortions who are poor?) and the sale of stem cell and fetal tissue / organs to pharmaceutical companies\u2026 Fact-checking Congress\u2019s fetal tissue report ,\u2014 Jan 2017. (Contains links.) \u2026is something that the pro-choice campaign relies on heavily. In summary: I am Pro-Life because I believe all living human beings are equal and share a common Right to Life. My rights do not supersede the Right to Life of anyone else which is the absolute, supreme Human Right which no other Right can replace or take priority over. ",

            "answer_text": "It comes down to this question: Is the embryo a human being or not? If the answer to the question is no, then we can do practically whatever we want with the embryo. If the answer is yes, the embryo has human rights, of which the first one is the right to life - this either/or situation is unavoidable. All other considerations (the circumstances of the mother, if the embryo comes with malformation, financial implications, etc) might be important and worthy of finding good solutions, but irrelevant when it comes to analyse abortion from the point of view of morals. I have never heard a good pro-Abortion argument -ever-. All of them come down to pieces after scratching the surface of their approach. These are the facts: The embryo is alive (grows, feeds, respond to stimulous, etc).The embryo is human. It has human DNA. It belong to the human specie.The embryo is different to the mother. It has a DNA different to the mother\u2019s DNA -any school child knows this.The embryo is a person. This is less evident than the previous points and it depends on the definition of \u2018person\u2019 you might have. The best definition was stated by Boecio \u2018individua substantia rationalis naturae\u2019 - Individual substance of rational nature. Which raises the question: Even if the embryo is human-alive, can be considered an individual? can it be rather a tissue o bunch of cells? The answer is no (unless you are willing to admit that you and me are also \u2018a bunch of cells\u2019). A bunch of cells, a tissue or an organ will never develop into anything different. The embryo evidently will develop naturally into a human adult if nothing goes wrong with it. On the other hand: if the embryo is just a bunch of cells, to whom do they belong? - It doesn't exist such a thing as cells belonging to nobody. There's always a \u2018someone\u2019 the \u2018subject\u2019 of those cells. The only possible answer to this question is that the \u2018someone\u2019 is precisely there, where those bunch of cells are. Therefore, the embryo is a person. The only moment in which this argument might not be valid is the case of twins, before the split of cells occur. But even in this case we never have a no-person. On the contrary we have \u2018at least one\u2019.It can be argued that the zygote/embryo becomes a person at some stage of the pregnancy, but not at conception. This idea is not silly but ultimately does not stand logic. The human DNA is formed at conception - this is a biological reality. The successive changes in the embryo - all of them - come from \u2018within\u2019 the embryo, not from outside. This is a major consideration, because if any development came from outside the embryo, pro abortion people would be right in saying that the embryo becomes a person \u2018at some stage\u2019 during the pregnancy. But if all development come from within, this means that the substance never changes. The embryo before certain development is the same thing as the embryo after the development. It is like the caterpillar and the butterfly: the change/development came from within, therefore both are the very same being.There is zero evidence that the human embryo is not human being. This is particularly clear after a couple of weeks when the heartbeat appear. And in doubt the moral principle state that the action should be avoided. In other words, if I could be killing somebody -not sure- with my action, then I should avoid performing that action - even at a great cost, because we are talking about the life of a different person.Once the right nature of the human embryo is acknowledged, there is nothing that can justify abortion, except the risk of the life of the mother, due to ethical considerations. Typical pro abortion arguments are: a. Women have the right to decide over their own bodies. Correct, but not over the body of their son/daughter. They cannot do anything that will end up with their intentionally sought-after death of the baby. b. The embryo is part of the mother. This is ridiculous. c. The embryo is not part of the mother, but it is inside the mother, therefore the mother has rights over the embryo\u2019s existance. Unacceptable. The fact that the embryo is inside the mother is not something the embryo chose. The embryo did nothing to be in those circumstances. We cannot kill the baby for that. d. We cannot oblige women to carry on with an undesired pregnancy. It would be like to oblige her to save somebody\u2019s life against her will. Nobody can be obliged to be heroic. This argument is not intellectually honest. The example given is incorrect. It is true that nobody can be obliged to save somebody\u2019s life, buf in the case of pregnancy, the baby is there due the woman's choices, not the baby's choices. She must carry on and accept the natural consequences of her actions. The only exception to this argument might be rape. This case requires more time and space, but it represents less than 1% of all abortions in the US. e. The baby is a person, but he/she has less rights than the mother. Unacceptable. Either one has human rights because one is human or not. There are no half-solutions. If so, this would be like stating that there are humans category 1 and humans category 2 (according to their rights), like what the Nazis did with the Jews. This approach is really dangerous. And if this distinction can be made based on \u2018age\u2019 or development, there is no way to stop it from being applied to other distinctions based on other aspects (race, population, gender, social utility\u2026) Scary. Some defend this idea based on the degree of dependence of the baby, whose survival totally depends on the mother, therefore this justifies her higher rights over the baby. This is evil. If it happens to you that you depend \u2018a lot\u2019 on the good will of somebody else, you wouldn't want that person to think this way. And where you draw the line? Can a doctor kill a patient saying \u2018his life was depending completely on me, therefore I have the right to terminate his life\u2026\u2019. No. Maybe more dependence means more responsibility, rather. f. The baby is not a person because he/she does not have consciousness (self awareness). This is not a stupid argument. Normally the person that mentions this argument does not understand well the concept of \u2018consciousness\u2019. Self awareness is not something we \u2018have\u2019, it is something we \u2018do\u2019. It is an action done by the intellect. But an action cannot define what something is. It would be like defining a dog as the animal that barks. It is a bad definition, because to bark is an action. True that we would expect a dog to bark, but there are dogs that do not or cannot bark, and this does not mean that they are not dogs. Even humans are not doing an act of self-awareness when sleeping, this does not mean that they are not human when they sleep. There are other actions usually performed by humans that some people don't do, like producing sperm, for example. Small boys do not produce sperm but they will. It doesn\u2019t mean they will be human only when they do produce sperm. Same thing happen with self awareness. It is a matter of development. On the other hand, there is no evidence that very act of being born triggers the development of self awareness. g. The baby becomes a person only at birth because he/she can self-sustain, because he/she breathes by himself/herself. Same idea than before. This statements implies that the definition of being human lies on the ability to perform an action: to breath. The purpose of breathing is to take oxygen to the blood. The embryo does this in a different way before birth, but this is done anyway. The mechanism used cannot determine if he/she is a person. Otherwise a person connected to artificial breathing machine wouldn't be a person. h. If you could save either 1000 embryos or one already born person from a fire, for example, you would save the already born person over the 1000 embryos. Hence we all understand that, somehow, the embryo is not really a person yet. This argument is based on \u2018what you would do if\u2026\u2019 this is always a fallacious question. Our emotions can make us do things that are not necessarily right. Our intellect feeds from our senses. It is perfectly normal to feel more compassion and be more compelled to save and protect a nice and beautiful child rather than an invisible \u2018something\u2019 especially if we don't know well that that \u2018something\u2019 is actually a bunch human being. One could also prefer saving his own daughter instead of 1000 human adults, because we love her more; but this does not mean that the 1000 adults are not human beings. i. Spontaneous (natural) abortion occur all the time, therefore provoked abortions cannot be bad or immoral, because Nature itself does it! Nature produces earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, death\u2026 Nature kills people. That is the way of Nature, yes, but this doesn't mean that it is okay for humans to produce earthquakes or to kill people. Not logical argument. j. Abortion is a human right (women right). This is absurd. No one has the right to do evil, to intentionally terminate the life of another innocent human being. k. The embryo is not a baby, because we call it embryo or blastocyst, not baby. This is just semantics. We use different words to speak about the same being at different stages of development: zygote, embryo, fetus, baby, child, adolescent, adult, oldman\u2026 all are different words for the same thing. l. If abortion is evil, we should punish those women. But this idea feels just bad and unfair. It feels bad and unfair because of the culture in which we live. The law does not just forbids and allows, the law also teaches. If abortion is legal, people in doubt will think it is okay because it is legal. Most women who undergo abortion do not think they are killing a baby - or at least they trust the legislator if not sure. This ignorance, plus the usual and sometimes colossal social and financial pressure associated to unwanted pregnancy build up a massive mitigant factor on women - not so on the \u2018service provider\u2019 though. m. Abortion will happen whether it is legal or illegal. If it is illegal, it is dangerous for women, therefore, because it will happen anyways, it should be legal. This argument is not logical. It is like saying \u201cpeople rob banks. It happens even if it is illegal. Some of those people actually die trying to rob banks. Therefore to rob banks should be legal\u201d. It is an insane argument. We cannot legalise and condone evil because it happens anyway. The very position called pro-choice is absurd. Imagine if somebody asks me \u2018do you think that people should be able to rob banks?\u2019 and I reply \u2018I personally wouldn't do it, but I'm pro-choice. If someone feels like doing it, it is her affair\u2019 - It is crazy. Nobody is asking if \u2018you would it or not\u2019. The relevant question is \u2018Do you think abortion is okay (morally acceptable) or not. And the logical positions are: pro-life (no) or pro-Abortion (yes). Not pro-choice.
