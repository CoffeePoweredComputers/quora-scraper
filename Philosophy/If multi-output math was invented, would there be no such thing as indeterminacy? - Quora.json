            "answer_text": "There are multiple-valued function (such as the log and  roots) used in complex analysis, but you have to be careful with them. If you\u2019re talking about indeterminacy in the calculus sense, though, multi-output math isn\u2019t the fix. The calculus pedagogy can be fixed, but indeterminacy is a necessary part of the whole process. Some things converge to a finite number and have a limit; others diverge, sometimes in specific ways such as  does, and sometimes the situation is unclear. Near-numbers can let you see what indeterminacy means, but that it happens is unavoidable. One example: Take  (don\u2019t simplify it), and suppose : . In words, all we can say about this quantity is that it stays positive (which is true!). We can\u2019t say for sure from this whether it converges or diverges, because just knowing it stays positive isn\u2019t enough information to determine which happens (thus in-determinate). If we simplify it to  first, it comes out nicely: , which squeezes in (from the positive side!) to a limit of zero. Both of these statements are true and consistent with one another; but the latter one lets us determine what\u2019s going on (convergence to zero), while the former one just doesn\u2019t give enough info.
