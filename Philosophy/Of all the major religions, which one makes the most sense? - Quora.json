            "answer_text": "For an answer to your question, we need to think rationally, recognizing that we are finite beings with finite intelligence and wisdom, which we can use only in finite ways regarding only finite views, things or concepts. Even all our logic and science have finite limits; and our scientific laws breakdown at the point of Big bang. We cannot even think of or imagine any finite thing that we have not experienced in the past. If I mention the name of something that I have used but you have never seen and heard about, then mention of the name will not mean anything to you at all, nor will you be able to imagine it; because you lack its knowledge and perception. Then we need to ask ourselves what makes more sense: This finite universe (or infinite number of finite universes, for that matter) came out of nothing on their own; or Infinite Creator created these finite entities out of nothing? The order, balance and consistency emerged on its own randomly; or the Creator made it happen? Each one us can have only one of the two views: \u00b7 There are infinite number of finite universes that came into being on their own out of nothing, whereby our universe happens to be one those finite universes. But his is a wild speculation that is not based on knowledge and has no scientific basis. It is illogical and irrational because we have never seen any finite things coming into existence on its own. Our experience in life shows that finite things come into being only by someone making it happen. \u00b7 An Infinite Entity whose infinite existence is beyond our finite ability to understand has created this magnificent universe and designed its laws and parameters so that it is characterized with balance, consistency and sustainability. This is in line with our experience and thus logical. But it is also corroborated by many excellent, intelligent and outstanding individuals who bore witness that have had the first hand experiences with that Creator. Therefore, a logical and rational person has to believe in the Infinite God, and cannot be an atheist. As the number (multiplicity) is a finite attribute, the Infinite Creator can only be a unique Infinite entity; also, an entity cannot be finite and infinite at the same time. Hence, all beliefs espousing polytheism, trinity or pantheism are illogical. That reduces the choice to Judaism and Islam. \u00b7 The question is: can God be racist, favouring one race at the cost of other races, on the basis of genealogy? Or Will he be the one Who treats all of human being in the same, just manner, liking or disliking them on the basis of performance, not in whose house they happened to be born. \u00b7 Another point to think about is: Does it makes sense that God grants people free will using which people live in this world differently, some extremely evil, some extremely wonderful, but they all die and become dust without encountering any consequences of how they lived? A serial killer or rapist end up just like a saint who made many personal sacrifices for the sake of helping people? Will God do something as meaningless and purposeless as this, without doing ultimate justice for all? 115 Did you then think that We had created you in vain and that you were not to be returned to Us? 116 So, supremely exalted is Allaah, the True Sovereign; there is no other god beside Him; the Lord of the Noble Throne.117 If anyone invokes along with Allaah any other god \u2013 of which he has no proof \u2013 his reckoning will be only with his Lord! The disbelievers will never attain Falaa\u0125 \u2013 success in pleasing Allaah. 118 So say, \u201cMy Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of all the merciful ones.\u201d (23:115-118) How ever one looks at it, only Islam is left as a rational choice. This rational and logical conclusion is further supported by all those messengers of God (such as Moses, Jesus and Prophet Mu\u0125ammad peace and blessing of Allaah on all of them) who came to this world from time to time. They were the finest, wisest, and most truthful people of their societies and they gave witness on the basis of their personal knowledge that God exists and that He has sent them as His messengers. They were like the scientists who told us about the existence of neutrinos. Although hardly anyone has seen a neutrino, people believe in their existence on the witness from the knowledgeable scientists. ",

            "answer_text": "A religion would make sense if that is a religion where God talks to men and explains the meaning of life, the way to behave and the reason to behave in one way and not some other way, directly, with authority of God. Often on Quora, I come across questions of the kind \u201cHow can I prove that God exists?\u201d. Invariably, this ironic answer comes up (I paraphrase a common answer from memory without quoting anyone): Demonstrate that God exists by praying to him about something miraculous and tangible, such as, ask God to throw a lightning bolt. If I see a lightning bolt, you have proven that God exists. If there is no lightning bolt, then you have proven that either God does not exist or He is not interested in us believing in Him. The answer has an obvious defect: God indeed may not want our knowledge of Him to be scientific, with laboratory proof. He may want us to know Him by faith. In fact, if God were subject to scientific discovery then God would not be the Creator of nature with all its laws but rather a part of the created world, and therefore not-God. In fact, our God plainly said so: some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: Master we would see a sign from thee. Who answering said to them: An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign: and a sign shall not be given it (Matthew 12:38\u201339) But the answer has a kernel of truth nonetheless: perhaps not to satisfy an Atheist\u2019s silly caprice, but to teach His sentient creation the truth not discoverable by science, God, if He exists, would interact with men. Any religion that only points to myths or statues in order to speak of God is by definition something man-made: perhaps good art or good way for people to get together and enjoy one another\u2019s company, or a good way to transmit wisdom to the young, but not a good way to learn about God. The religion that makes \u201cmost\u201d sense, \u2014 in fact the religion that makes every sense, \u2014 is the religion that was given to us by God in person. This is our God, and there shall no other be accounted of in comparison of him. He found out all the way of knowledge, and gave it to Jacob his servant, and to Israel his beloved. Afterwards he was seen upon earth, and conversed with men (Baruch 3:36-38) I am come that they may have life, and may have it more abundantly. (John 10:10) with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they go out (Luke 4:36)   Alex Pismenny's answer to Why are the Greek gods considered myths while the Christian god isn\u2019t? Alex Pismenny's answer to Do you believe in Jesus? Why or why not? What evidence do we have that Jesus was resurrected? ",
