            "answer_text": "Homosexuality is CLEARLY condemned in the Bible. It undermines the basis of God's created order where God made Adam, a man, and Eve, a woman -- not two men, not two women -- to carry out his command to fill and subdue the earth (Gen. 1:28). Homosexuality cannot carry out that command. It also undermines the basic family unit of husband and wife, the God-ordained means of procreation. It is also dangerous to society. Unlike other sins, homosexuality has a heavy judgment administered by God Himself upon those who commit it - and support it. This judgment is simple in that those who practice it are given over to their passions - which means that their hearts are allowed to be hardened by their sins. \"For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27 and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error,\" (Rom. 1:26-27). As a result, they can no longer see the error of what they are doing. They will not seek forgiveness. They will die in their sins and face God's holy condemnation. But, that isn't all. In addition to the judgment of being given over to their sin, those involved in it also promote it and condemn others who don't approve of their behavior. \"...and, although they know the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, they not only do the same, but also give hearty approval to those who practice them,\" (Rom. 1:32). So, in their hearty approval of homosexuality they encourage others to be trapped in their sinfulness. This means they will reject Christ's redemptive work on the cross. Without Jesus, they will have no forgiveness. Without forgiveness, they will have no salvation. Without salvation, there is only damnation in eternal hell. We don't want this for anyone. The only hope for the homosexual, and all people who break God's laws, is to realize that God is holy and he will rightfully judge all who have sinned against him by breaking his law (1 Kings 8:32; Ps. 9:8; 1 John 3:4). If he did not do this, then he would be approving of wrong doing. However, God is loving (1 John 4:8) patient (Rom. 2:4), wanting people to repent (Acts 17:30) and come a saving knowledge of him so they might be redeemed. What this means is that the sinner must turn to Christ, who is God the Son in flesh (John 1:1,14; Col. 2:9), who bore our sins in his body on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24), died and rose from the dead (1 Cor. 15:1-4), and made it possible for sinners to be saved from the righteous judgment of God by faith in what Jesus did on our behalf (2 Cor. 5:21) and be forgiven of their sins (Eph. 2:8). This is done receiving Christ (John 1:12), by believing in him and his sacrifice that is a payment for our sins to God the Father. Like any sinner, the homosexual needs to repent, receive Christ by faith, and be saved from God's righteous judgment by trusting in Christ and the judgment that fell upon him on the cross. They need to pray and ask the Lord Jesus to save them. ",

            "answer_text": "Contrary to what some have stated here, the verses in Romans chapter do include homosexuality as an immoral act. I was thinking of one chapter, number 18, in the book of Leviticus. It\u2019s context covers a multitude of situations that are \u201cdetestable,\u201d or \u201cunnatural.\u201d They cover immoral acts like incest, having sex with animals, as well as heterosexual and, yes, homosexual acts. If we are truthful, most are considered as detestable In today\u2019s world as they were thousands of years ago. In view of this, isn\u2019t it a bit odd that the act of homosexuality Is the only one so many choose to criticize the Bible about? Today\u2019s ideas labeling immorality as an \u201calternative life style\u201c or a \u201cnew normal\u201d raises a lot of moral questions. For instance, in the near future, will we possibly be asked to consider \u201cincest\u201c as another \u201cnew normal.\u201d And what about the possibility of being exposed to a claim that having sex with animals is another \u201calternative life style\u201d? As today\u2019s societies continue to take an \u201cend-run\u201d around practical Bible moral standards, is there any reason to believe this could not happen? It seems to me that all the problems that divide and plague human today are morality-based. History seems to indicate that resolving such problems is beyond the scope of \u201cthe rule of law.\u201d What then is the solution? ",

            "answer_text": "Those are not the only verses on homosexuality. There are more verses in the Old and New Testament on this topic. God is a God of positivity and creativity. God is not a God of stagnation. God gave the \u2018Gift of Sex\u2019 to be shared between husband and wife to: 1 Increase their intimacy. 2. To be open to the gift of children from Him. COVENANT OF PURITY - 1 Corinthians 6:19\u201320 Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies. In the Old Testament all the sexual sins came under the common head of \u2018Adultery\u2019. Also even spilling of semen was punishable with death: Genesis 38:9 But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother\u2019s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother.10 What he did was wicked in the Lord\u2019s sight; so the Lord put him to death also. HOMOSEXUALITY / LESBIANISM / UNNATURAL SEX - Leviticus 18:22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination. Leviticus 20:13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. Romans 1:26\u201328 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error. Furthermore, just as they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done. Jude 1:7 In a similar way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion. They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.

If you reject it as a fairy tale or something else then you must base your beliefs on some other authority. But keep in mind that truth is truth whether we believe it or not or accept it or not.
