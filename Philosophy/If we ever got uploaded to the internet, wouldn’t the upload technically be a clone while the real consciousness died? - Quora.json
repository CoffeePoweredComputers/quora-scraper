            "answer_text": "Yes but assume that the action of copying your neural pathways is non-destructive. That would mean that, for the remaining time your biological form lasted. There would be two of you effectively. This raises some significant ethical questions about the right to the digital \u201cbeing\u201d created through this process and that being\u2019s right to determine what happens to its original body. If you are truly the same person then should each have a say of what the other becomes from that point or do you concede the other is it\u2019s own being and free to make its own choices from that point on? Question like these are why many technologies are held in check for decades despite being nearly ready for mainstream use. The ethics and laws surrounding them need to be set before we using them even for the first time or you end up with crisis situations like the one I outlined. ",
