            "answer_text": "It is an axiom housed in the structure of Classical Logic, before words like \u201caxiom\u201d and \u201claw\u201d were better defined. If there is a proof of the Law of the Excluded Middle, it\u2019s because there is another axiom (precondition) that pretty much states something equivalent. Therefore, it\u2019s actually proofs that two-or-more preconditions result in the same effects. It\u2019s not necessary to use Classical Logic; therefore, it\u2019s not necessary to use the Law of the Excluded Middle. There are numerous logic systems (most) that do not use the Law of the Excluded Middle, such as Intuitionistic Logic Systems. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. The \"law\" is an axiom of logic. Using logic to try to prove an axiom is circular unless it can be derived from the other axioms. The law of excluded middle distinguishes logic from the rest of mathematics. Without it you have mathematics. Other branches of mathematics are self-consistent. If the law of excluded middle were universally true then mathematics would not exist. ",
