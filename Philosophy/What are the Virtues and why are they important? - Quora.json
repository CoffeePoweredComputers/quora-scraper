            "answer_text": "Aristotle pioneers virtue in western philosophy. The four chief virtues are courage, temperance, justice, and prudence/practical wisdom. Courage concerns what is worth acting on, temperance what is worth desisting, justice proper relations with others, practical wisdom knowing what good ends/goals are and how to achieve them. N.B. that virtues are not necessarily moralistic. Practical wisdom requires a bit of intellectual excellence. When Aristotle first talked about virtues, physical excellence was also its own category of virtue. Virtuous living is equated with enduring happiness, eudaimonia, on Aristotle's account.  ",
