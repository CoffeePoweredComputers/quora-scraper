            "answer_text": "The root cause of lying is a deep sense of insecurity. So you have achieved a kind of balance by \u201clying for so long\u201d. However the automatisms you have put in place ended up hiding you from yourself. You know this is not really you. But what is worse? Showing yourself as weak and insecure, or living trapped in the web of your own lies? When I started Kobudo I realized that everyone is wielding a sword all day long, we just don\u2019t realize. What made me realize was the attitudes of my fellow beginners, giving all kinds of indications as to their intentions as opposed to actually performing the cut. Many would fall short, if not miss altogether the mark. In this context we talk about \u201csincerity\u201d as the first requirement for being able to practice. Sincerity as in: true aim. Not as easy as it seems, even for people who do not usually lie - because we don\u2019t want to hurt. But a great path towards \u201cthe truth\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "You have to practice. You practiced lying, didn\u2019t you? It was difficult at first. It felt emotionally bad, and required constant mental gymnastics to maintain. But you persevered and practiced so much that you became capable of nearly continuous pathological lying. It didn\u2019t happen overnight. So now you have to re-train. Don\u2019t answer anything rapidly, because you\u2019ll probably just say a lie automatically. Think of what you\u2019re going to say, and then ask yourself if it is true. And don\u2019t say anything until you know it\u2019s true. Because the truth is, you\u2019ve always known what the truth is. You just trained yourself to never say it. Now you have to mentally train yourself to always say it. You already know it, but: Practice makes perfect. For better and for worse. And that is very appropriate, because you are always wedded to yourself. ",

You don't have to offer 20 excuses as to why you lied or \u201cwhat else have you lied about.\u201d Just tell the truth, apologize if you hurt anyone and let them know you don't plan lying about anything that important ever again. You will hear all sorts of things, from judgements, criticisms and lectures. No need to defend yourself again and again. Just let them have their say as you nod in agreement. Hopefully, you will go to God with this problem first. Ask for forgiveness, repent and TRUST THAT YOU ARE ALREADY FORGIVEN. Lastly, you have to forgive yourself. Truly forgive yourself. I don't even know you, but I am so proud of you. This takes guts and character. When you are done fessing up, you are going to feel AMAZING. ",

It's harder to be completely honest in this day and age, especially with yourself. But, once you learn how, and finally break the cycle of lies, you will actually know an internal peace like nothing you ever experienced before. Just be careful, because that peace is easily shattered by a single lie, and the cycle begins again. Once you have purged yourself of all the lies, and laid them bare before others, your spirit feels uncaged, and there is little anyone can ever hold over you. There is an undeniable wisdom to the Biblical saying \u201cAnd the truth shall set you free\u201d, for those whom have experienced it. And yes, this is the voice of experience talking. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you tell the truth and stop lying? You probably don\u2019t. Once lying proves effective for you, it\u2019s almost foolish for you to give up on using it. IMO, the only way to no longer lie is to have and experience that is like dying and rebirth. Your present thinking+behaving must be \u201ccrushed\u201d (die in a sudden battle) before you will change (long term\u2026forever and ever). Without that happening, you will slide back into lying. So if that does happen you can and likely will \u201cswitch teams\u201d and jump over to a beautiful and noble victorious team. I recall the Biblical story of Saul becoming Paul and this is the type of transition/experience you will almost surely need. Saul was intensely anti-Jesus in the sense of considering his claim to be the Jewish Messiah as heretical and an abomination. One day Saul was shaken to his core and after that, he \u201cswitched sides\u201d and became the most passionate advocate of Jesus. That\u2019s just an example of what I mean when I say you\u2019ll likely need a nearly traumatic even in your life to indelibly change your beliefs. And it\u2019s our beliefs that drive (and can change) our behaviors, not circumstances nor reasoning. And beliefs don\u2019t change easily, especially if the ones we have now are working well for us. I hope this helps. ",
