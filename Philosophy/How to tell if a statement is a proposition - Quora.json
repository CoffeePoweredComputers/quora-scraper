            "answer_text": "A proposition or sentence in truth functional logic[1] is a declarative sentence that can be either true or false unambiguously. If one cannot expect the statement to have a definite true or false value then the statement is not a proposition. Statements about the future spoken now, although declarative, are still ambiguous. Commands, like \u201cDo this!\u201d and exclamations like \u201cWow!\u201d are also not declarative statements. One does not expect anyone to claim they are true or false. They express meaning, but not the kind of true-false meaning that a proposition has. If one has such propositions then one can combine them with connectives like or, and, not, if-then or if-and-only-if to make another proposition that can also be assigned a truth value. One defines these truth-functions as taking propositions as input and producing propositions as output. Nothing else would be a proposition in this classical truth-functional logic.
