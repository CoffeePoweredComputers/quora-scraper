            "answer_text": "Adam Smith believed that under free market capitalism the tendency of people to enrich themselves, resulted in greater prosperity for all. Marx believed that this tendency would lead to a concentration of capital in fewer and fewer hands, a reduction in wages as capitalists reduced their costs, and a consequent reduction in costs as worker became unable to afford goods made by capitalists. Smith was writing 250 years ago, Marx 150 years ago. Capitalism is still here, wages and profits have steadily risen and poverty has been greatly reduced. Looks as if Marx was wrong and Smith right. Marx was a noddle. ",
