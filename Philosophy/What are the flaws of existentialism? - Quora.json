            "answer_text": "I get mistaken for being an existentialist rather frequently, and I see it as an understandable mistake. But I\u2019m not an existentialist in the sense of a Sartre or Nietsche, etc. I agree that existence precedes essence, which I think is so obvious as to make it rather stunning that humanity believed anything else for so long. That is\u2026 it\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s no purpose to our existence, no meaning \u201cout there\u201d to be fulfilled by you, etc. Humans are the meaning-makers, end of story. That doesn\u2019t mean that life is doomed to meaninglessness, it means that you\u2019re the source of it. \u201cInauthenticity\u201d, according to me, is all of the things that happen because humans don\u2019t take responsibility for the meaning that they make \u2014 they make stuff up, but then project that meaning out onto objective reality, as if watching the world through self-made lenses that distort the shapes of things, while denying that they made their own view. So where I part ways with the famous existentialists is when we get to freedom and the challenge to \u201cmake life meaningful by your choices.\u201d To me, that\u2019s like getting 2/3 of the way to your destination, and then calling Mom to report that you arrived safely. You\u2019re not done yet, it\u2019s a mistake to think that\u2019s the end of the journey. The last 1/3 of the trip starts when you have accepted that you are the source of all meaning. The basic idea of this last 1/3 is that if you are the source of all meaning, then you are also naturally the source of what \u201cI\u201d means. Nothing can mean anything without my permission, and if that\u2019s the case, what does \u201cI\u201d mean? What is this I that is giving its permission, where does it come from? The answer is always paradoxical, regardless of the metaphors or analysis you do about it \u2014 \u201cI\u201d must grant validity to its own existence, and in order to do that it needs authority, and to get authority it has to give authority to itself, and so on. The \u201clogic of existence of self\u201d becomes an endless recursion when you try to explain or understand it, because you can never get to a place where this kind of \u201cself\u201d is grounded in some objective truth. Yet at the same time, this kind of \u201cI\u201d is unquestionably the source of all meaning \u2014 it is entirely possible to experience yourself and life through that frame of understanding, and doing so makes a huge difference. It slams the door closed on the kinds of deep questions which have tormented philosophers and seekers for so many generations \u2014 this works, period. Someone who solves this puzzle has the world explode into fireworks of possibilities within their own life, there\u2019s just no doubt left about the riches and wonder of being alive for an individual who is able to be the source of their own meaning. There\u2019s a natural, almost mathematical wholeness and unity to this solution to \u201cwho am I?\u201d, such that when you get it, you know that you got it and it\u2019s hard not to want to share it and express it. That\u2019s a very different outcome than imagining that you\u2019re some isolated soul on a desolate rock in a remote corner of space, shouting out at the heavens in an attempt to make their life meaningful by telling some story about it all. So that\u2019s why the existentialists were wrong: they just didn\u2019t finish the trip \u2014 they didn\u2019t see that the source of all meaning, when it builds its own mirror, becomes a lamp that makes its own fuel and there is a kind of light that comes naturally from that way of being.

            "answer_text": "There are a few flaws. Even though personally I consider flaw a harsh term. Existentialism is massive. Going into every tendrils of its influence is impossible as it's grounding epistemology rests on the subjective it is extremely hard to pinpoint exactly what Existentialism is this makes what i think to be the biggest flaw a lack of definitive structure which by nature is also its greatest strength. Any point any existentialist makes there is almost certainly one who disagrees. This being said the variety within the field is so much I would consider that a major flaw. No one actually agrees what it is or where it even started. In William Barret's Irrational Man he does a survey of existentialist themes and influences but it is just too large and contradictory. Existentialism is inherently a subjective field and because of that there is no where close to a consensus.Because it is so large and because it is so popular a few major Existentialists are taken to speak for the whole while more minor ones are ignored. For instance the proliferation of Existentialism in the Arts mean that Sartre, Camus and de Beauvoir end up all to often being the mouthpieces and even then it's is through their fiction or secound hand. This dissementation without concentration allows for massive amounts of misunderstanding and poor characterizations even in Sartres onetime which spurred him to give the lectures that became Existentialism is a Humanism. To many people read a book or too and think they understand all of it. Which may work better in philosophical fields like scholatism with a strong orthodox viewpoint and tradition. But existentialism in founded on the very fact that all people are disagreeing.The third major flaw is relativism. This is a major issue. Pure relativism leads to a complete destruction of any moral consensus. This is another attack that had to spur Sartre write Existentialism is a Humanism. This is also addressed in Simone de Beuvoir\u2019s Ethics of Ambiguity. So it's not like they don't try to formulate ways that allow ethical practice to exist. But the epistemological foundations of Existentialism logically prohibit a priori ethical delineations to exist. Yes you can appeal to higher powers like many theological existentialist or like Buber appeal to a deeper sense of connection with your fellow beings. But I still think existentialism allows for a strong sense of relativism that can't be easily ignored.This is mainly directed towards Sartre and many other popular Existentialists not disincluding Kierkegaard either (though I don't think you can take his work as an agreeing monolith) but I believe Sartre in particular often comes across as far to pessimistic. My problem is less that his personal philosophy is so and more that the mainstream of Existentialism accepts this ad the go to. Gabriel Marcel for instance is far more positive when agreeing with many of Sartre ontological essentials.There is of course numerous fields that suggest a priori objective that fundamentally conflict with existentialism. However, a major conflict for me personally is instead with the Wittgensteinian school of language. Wittgenstein gives ontological primacy to our use of language. The word used in descriptive philosophy color and inform our discussions regarding said philosophy. If this is indeed the case Existentialism fundamental starting point of the \u2018existence preceding essence\u2019 is for the Wittgensteinian a mere linguistic confusion. For two disparate schools that hardly interact from opposite fields (continental vs analytic) I still find it hard to reconcile the two. Is the primacy given to the fact that we exist or the fact that we can say we exist?These I find to be the major \u2018flaws\u2019 or arguements against existentialism. Postscript. God or theology in general doesn't conflict in the slightest. For Christianity read Tillich, Kierkegaard or Marcel. For Judaism Martin Buber or Heschel. ",
