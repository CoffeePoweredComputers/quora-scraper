            "answer_text": "A very broad question opens a large free space for the creation of a meaningful response. Too narrow of a question closes the space for potential answers, and can sometimes hamper the ability to create meaningful dialogue through a forceful directiveness. If the purpose of your conversation is to gather knowledge from an expert, then an adequately broad question allows the expert to decide what information will be most relevant to you. A more narrow question might direct the answer to a specific domain of knowledge, but ultimately, the expert will know what the important domains of knowledge are, and what signposts are along the way for you to make sense of the journey.    Which is exactly how language works, our words open clearings for the creation of meaning, but the words we use are the signposts of those who have dwelt on this earth before us. The most open and meaningful words come from the poets who create the open space of the world with their novel descriptions of experience. What question should we ask the great poet, the narrow question with a narrow answer, or the broadest question in the world? ",
