            "answer_text": "Q: How can we categorize human knowledge? A: One way is: Domains in culture. eg Here is a very very small sample of some example domains  And here\u2019s the evolution of some domains of knowledge  Source: StoryAlity #149B \u2013 The Tree of Culture But see also this chapter in The Encyclopedia of Information Science & Technology: StoryAlity#144 \u2013 The structure of the meme, the unit of culture (Encyc of InfoSci & Tech 2017) And see also: StoryAlity#140 \u2013 The Evolution of the Systems Model of Creativity (Csikszentmihalyi 1988-) As for: And how is each category related to the other? That\u2019s super-complex. Culture evolves just like Biology. So - take a look at how different species in biology are related (eg through a common ancestor.) Noting also that: Knowledge = Culture = Information. Here is another way to organize it Note: Maths is at the bottom (we\u2019re probably living in a sim, see: Nick Bostrom) And without Geology (a place to be) and Physics and Chemistry you can\u2019t have Biology (organic chemistry)\u2026 Once you have Biology you can have Psychology (eg living things have control centres, eg brains & nervous systems) and once you have those you have groups, and culture. etc  StoryAlity #100A \u2013 The 3 Universal Laws of Holon/Partons So one way to organize it is emergence. Like the diagram below. (Emergence goes upwards in the diagram)  Source: StoryAlity#143 \u2013 All of life is doing science ",
