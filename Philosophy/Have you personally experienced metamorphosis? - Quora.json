            "answer_text": "All males should know that their bodies have experienced metamorphosis during gestation. The reason I say this is because we all start out as the same genderless fetus. In the first few weeks when reproductive cells form they are identical. Every fetus is feminized unless masculinizing influences come into play at key times during gestation. This begins when the presence of the Y chromosome trigger's the development of testes. These are the same reproductive cells that would have developed into ovaries. If at anytime during gestation there is an inadequate amount of testosterone genitalia will develop in the female direction, regardless of the presence of testes. With such a complicated network of systems, a lot of things can go wrong. This leads to imcomplete masculinization of the male fetus or partial masculinization of the female fetus. These are what we call intersex individuals. So my metamorphosis experience began with this body's incomplete masculinization due to an extra copy of the X chromosome. I was assigned male and was under tremendous pressure from the other males to be more like them. This is sort of an instinctive behavior and is manifested in various gestures and scenarios. The main thing is that it wasn't pleasant. I had to some how adapt and become more masculine. It would have to be both a physical and emotional metamorphosis to be convincing. Seemingly as a fluke I began to learn how to play drums in a rock band. As I got better as a drummer I began to gain confidence. As a young adult I became interested in body building techniques to give my body a more masculine appearance. This hard work paid off because I went from a shy, effeminate, weakling to a confident above metal drummer with a body like Tarzan. The muscle bulk was difficult to maintain but the confidence I acquired was something I got to keep. I actually got to experience something similar to an average masculine experience in my 30s and 40s. Then at age 50 I experienced another metamorphosis. I had a mysterious illness and lost most of my muscle bulk. The body of my youth return. My behavior changed but I adapted and kept myself healthy both physically and emotionally. I had to find a new way to feel confidence particular in my sexuality. But since it's a metamorphosis that is happening gradually I have been able to adapt and even find some pleasant surprises in the experience. I no longer think in terms of being less masculine. It's just life and all I can do is make the best of what I have. At this point in time it's all about making the best of what time I have left. Sometimes I think about the fact that these bodies are living tissue made up of trillions of cells. They are a metamorphosis waiting to happen. I'm sure a lot of people experience some sort of a metamorphosis if they live long enough. ",

            "answer_text": "Of a type, there was a time at my lowest, when Failure was crushing my defrnses, and God spoke to me affirming that He chose me and not me Him. Removing from me the drive where I thought I'd I could do this or that and thus I might Earn some degree of favor. Having understood it was His decision and not mine, removing me from the equation, my ability and actions, my psychology underwent a major change. It shifted from a performance based identity ot a manifest identity. A freedom to be, rather than perform. Obviously for those who have not experienced this, an accurate conception is highly unlikely. But there is a Freeing quality that accompanies it, yet it was achieved in a mode of surrender, not achievement. ",
