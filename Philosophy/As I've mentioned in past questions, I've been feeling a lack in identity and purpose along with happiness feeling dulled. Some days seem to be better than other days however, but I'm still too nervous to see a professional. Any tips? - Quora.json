            "answer_text": "If you are uncertain about seeing a professional\u2026 then maybe think about SELF-HELP\u2026 You mention \u201clack of identity, and purpose along with happiness feeling dulled\u201d\u2026 you also mention \u201cnervous\u201d\u2026. \u201cLack of identity\u201d can be a \u201cdissociation, or depersonalization\u201d sensation\u2026 where a person feels disconnectioned, and \u201cnot themselves\u201d\u2026 I have had some of this myself. Derealization, is when the world and reality seem \u201cSURREAL\u201d\u2026 Loss of purpose, reason, goal, meaning, and value, can be depression issues, and indeed we often feel\u2026\u201djust plain LOST\u201d\u2026 in depression.. I certainly did. Loss of happiness is depression is itself\u2026 a lack or loss of joy, or pleasure in things. \u201cNervous\u201d is a stress response, and can also be an Anxiety issue\u2026. Would you be interested in a SELF-HELP emotional technique for this? I have one\u2026 I use it on my PTSD\u2026 I went to doctors\u2026 got drugged\u2026. that was it\u2026 I studied the mind in the 70s, took a course on psychosomatic phenomena, and events\u2026 much was about the subconscious and emotions\u2026 this technique I teach is based on much of that work. This is Psychology and emotional research based and supported research, practice, and experience over the last 130 years. If SELF-HELP\u2026 something you can start to do TODAY\u2026 would interest you\u2026 Let me tell you some things about emotions\u2026 this is what you are dealing with. Even if you have a medical problem\u2026 like me\u2026. it can give you emotional issues. Have you had some shock and trauma in your life? That becomes emotional. Have you ever heard of Emotional Charge? It is a psychology term for ..\u201dBottled up emotions\u201d\u2026 Emotion means\u2026 Energy in Motion\u2026 so when this energy gets bottled up, it gives us a pressure, and this pressure can build and give us stress. Anger is a stress emotion. So is Hate\u2026 Pain and Hurt as well\u2026and it gives us a shock\u2026if you look at an incident\u2026 there was probably a shock at the beginning of it\u2026 that then changed into your emotional responses\u2026 As I mentioned, \u201cnervous\u201d is a stress response, and it is an emotion\u2026 anxiousness is another one\u2026 but in the apprehension of Anxiety\u2026 Now\u2026 The energy of an emotion, has an amount, intensity, frequency, and polarity\u2026 Purpose-LESS\u2026 is seen as a negative polarity emotion. So, emotions have a Charge\u2026 just like electricity\u2026 and so\u2026 Purpose-LESS\u2026 would be an Emotional Charge\u2026 it is an Energy Load, on us\u2026 Purposeless is a depression range emotion\u2026 depression is about LOSS\u2026 less, and lack of\u2026 which is what you report. This would be your emotional charge\u2026 \u201cI feel a loss of purpose\u201d\u2026 right? Here is my podcast on Depression emotions, and one on \u201cLESS-NESS\u201d\u2026the state of being without something\u2026 it is usually a part of depression. Podcast 0009 is on Depression Emotions and how the technique can help stop them. Happiness Is No Charge 0009 - Depression Emotions by Happiness Is No Charge \u2022 A podcast on Anchor Podcast 0010 is about emotions of \"Less-ness\", like \"Hopeless\" and feeling \"Worthless\", and how the technique can help stop them. Happiness Is No Charge 0010- Emotions of Less-ness by Happiness Is No Charge \u2022 A podcast on Anchor Feel free to listen to any other podcasts as well, there is one on stress\u2026 I have a video on Anxiety, message me if you would like to see it. Doing the technique addresses this Emotional Charge. It reduces it\u2026 it lessens, fades\u2026and can stop\u2026 this is observable while you are doing the technique\u2026there are 8 ways to tell the technique is working\u2026one of them is\u2026 FEELING BETTER\u2026 no kidding\u2026 I have stopped my own Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Episodes with the technique, it even works on the emotions of a PAST episodes\u2026Shock and negative emotions are stored up in MEMORY\u2026 \u201cbottled up in memory\u201d a reservoirs for emotions\u2026 I have PTSD\u2026 so I deal with Pressure, Stress, Anxiety, Hysteria, Depression and even suicidal issues at times. Many times this is FROM MEMORY\u2026 These are some things the technique works on... #suicidal thoughts, #flashbacks, #panic attacks, #Aggravation, #Anger, #Hate, #Hostility, #sadness, #grief, #guilt, #worthlessness, #hopelessness, #Fears #Stress, #Intimidation, #Shyness, #Worry, #Horror, #Terror, #Panic and MORE. The benefit to a person would be, the technique would take those down for them, and they would feel better\u2026 really\u2026 With my PTSD, I use the technique on all of those emotions listed above. This particular technique does not require a practitioner. You do the technique on your emotions\u2026 I could lead you to those emotions\u2026but you already know them\u2026 right? So you might make a list of them\u2026 and then just do the technique on them, you don\u2019t need me for that\u2026and you can do this technique anywhere.

I have done both of these things and I have found that they have brought meaning and substance into my life. We can only concentrate on ourselves for so long until it starts to feel meaningless. We are meant to connect with God and others. I understand what you are speaking about. You lose that spark that makes life worth living. This Leads to you losing yourself because everything seems mundane and with no purpose. That is probably because it is. Finding that reason to get up in the morning is essential to our well being. I don\u2019t mean just getting up to go to work. What I am speaking about is something that requires your attention externally that stirs you internally. It is great to focus on ourselves but that is a very small scope and can have you living in a very shallow manner. Purpose driven combined with passion is something that we should all be seeking in order to live a fulfilled life. ",
