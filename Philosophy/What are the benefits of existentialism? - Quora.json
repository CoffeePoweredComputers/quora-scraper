            "answer_text": "Existentialism is a philosophy that emphasizes individual existence, freedom and choice. It is the view that humans define their own meaning in life, and try to make rational decisions despite existing in an irrational universe. According to existentialism: (1) Existence is always particular and individual\u2014always my existence, your existence, his existence, her existence. (2) Existence is primarily the problem of existence (i.e., of its mode of being); it is, therefore, also the investigation of the meaning of Being. Existentialism is a philosophical way of talking. It sees humans, with will and consciousness, as being in a world of objects which do not have those two parts. ... Many religions and philosophies (ways of thinking about the world) say that human life has a meaning (or a purpose). Existential therapists help people to become more aware of their choices, their freedom to make decisions, and the consequences of their actions. This type of therapy helps people develop a better sense of how they are the \u201cauthors\u201d of their lives. Source Google ",
