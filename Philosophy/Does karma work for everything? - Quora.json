            "answer_text": "Yes. A thousand times yes. I have a blurred memory but few things are hard to forget. *Story time* I was five. Playing hide and seek with my eight year old sister and other kids from the apartment. He closed the front door and walked out of his house. *Let's call him \u201c bhaiya\u201d as he was about 8-9 years older than I was* I gave him a shout \u201cBhaiya! Come join the game\u201d. He ran towards me and said \u201cAlright. What are we playing today?\u201d \u201cHide and seek\u201d, said I. \u201cOkay then. I'll stay for a round. Let's hide together, evelinne. \u201d And the next moment, we both held each others hands and ran to a small building. Where no children go to. He said it was the perfect place to hide. No one would know and we could easily win the game. \u201cOkay!\u201d The building was like an abandoned store. With locked shutters and worn off paint. It had a concrete slide like thing for building support. We didn't go too far as the building was near our apartment. He lifted me up, made me sit on the slide like thing and asked me to keep an eye on the seeker. Asked me to make sure no one knew our hiding place. That's when I felt something moving under my upper thighs..and the next thing I knew.. His fingers were touching my vagina. Rubbing it and trying to insert his fingers inside. It was going for a long time and the degree of discomfort was extreme. I decided to make him stop. I asked him to let me go and he did so. I was almost crying while running back to my home. Scared. Refusing myself to believe what had happened. Trying to forget. I tried telling it to my sister, who was hiding behind my apartment. Completely focused on the game. \u201cCarol, Bhaiya is a bad person\u201d. That's all I could say. Things were normal for him after this incident. He was my neighbor and knew my family and me very well. Both, Our parents worked in the same department and were friends. Also, my parents adored him. He knew I was a shy kid and I would not tell it to my parents and things went just as he wanted. Working for a paramilitary force,Both our parents were transferred to different cities. I was happy to vacate that place. I loved my new school. And one day I got to hear that Bhaiya in the new city, was hanging out on the terrace with his friend. His friend challenged him to climb down the apartment through an old water closet pipeline attached to the building. The pipeline broke, his attempt failed and days later he went into a coma and lost little of his memory. He recovered after a few months though. Now.. I never had a feeling to retaliate or anything. I was nine years old when it happened and I was worried about his health condition. I tried forgetting the past and speaking to him. Deep inside we both knew what he had done and it still makes me uncomfortable. We never spoke about it and I never tried speaking to him after that. After a year, I was transferred to the same city where everything began. -Evelinne Mary. Edit : It is important to differenciate between a good touch and a bad touch. Talking about molestations, harassments , sex offence, rapes, violations is okay. Please speak with a parent or someone you can trust. There are always people there for you who will listen. You should never feel like you are in the wrong in such situations and you don't have to keep things bottled up. Don't be scared to talk about that human being, who's actions were inappropriate and disagreeable, may it be your uncle/aunt, your friend or that friendly neighbor. Such things can mentally affect your life and leave a scar. It took me 8 years to tell it to my sister and my mother. I narrated the incident to my father in april 2019. I regretted for not talking about it sooner\u2026but it's never too late to express yourself. Peace. ",

            "answer_text": "NO it does not! It's a coping mechanism. A human idea utilized to make sense of what would otherwise be the purposeless chaos of reality. It's a false-positive generated by our pattern-identifying bias. We want to believe that there are greater reasons behind why things are the way they are. If a guy gets tremendously successful, he must somehow deserve it. If a child is born with a congenital disorder, she must have somehow deserved it. Similarly, if somebody is helping others, they will someday be repaid for it. If somebody is hurting others, they will someday be punished for it. This idea is easier to make sense of than disorder. Humans have been selected for pattern-recognition, and we see patterns everywhere- even when there are none. There is a mild element of truth to it. If you're doing something unethical or illegal, it's possible that you'll eventually get found out. Some things go unnoticed for extended periods of time, but we can reasonably assume, for instance, that the oppressed with rally against their oppressors. That's \"karma\". We can find lots of instances that confirm it, and it does vaguely seem to be consistent with the way the world works- or the way a part of the world works, and what we focus on. Karma works within small, highly visible communities. It works in small towns where everybody knows everybody. Your deeds don't go unnoticed. There's a certain social reality that you have to work with. Karma is when we take these small-town ideas and hope that they continue to work in the global context. I'm not too sure about that. Life is more complex than Karma. The problem with karma is when we use it as justification for human inaction. I'm not going to get involved, because the Universe will punish him for his bad deeds. We forget that we are a part of the Universe. To answer the question directly- I don't feel very much for Karma. I don't feel that it's a particularly useful concept, and so I make it a point to discard it whenever I sense it emerging. And it does emerge, because I'm human too, and I also suffer a predilection for convenient, comforting explanations. If you create something good and meaningful in the world, it's possible and likely that you will be rewarded for it. Because people are social creatures, and we reciprocate- as long as we are clearly aware of what's going on. (Sometimes we are not. We look at Boston and we overlook Syria. Is that karma? No, that's human ignorance, human frailty, human inability to process vast amounts of data. We need to fix that, and we can't count on some elusive force.) Karma is perpetuated by confirmation bias. We don't hear from the good people who suffer and die. We don't hear from the bad people who are happy, content and successful, either. (They know to remain hidden, silent and not to brag. You can check out Jon Mixon's answers for some beautiful insights into those people.) When we see good people being rewarded, it confirms our bias. When we see bad people being punished, it confirms our bias. When we see good people suffering, we comfort ourselves. When we see bad people having a good life, we comfort ourselves. Karma is comforting. Life is not comfortable ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. To understand the philosophy behind the karma, we should know the literal meaning of karma. What is Karma? KARMA means work. So by literal meaning everything you do is your karma. So, your DEEDS are your KARMA. WORK does not mean that it has to hold an impact like in physics, whatever you do is karma, even if you don\u2019t do anything and sit idle, it is also your karma. What does the Karma Philosophy say ? It says everything you get through in your life is due to your karma, i.e your deeds, work etc. Whatever you do in life in the present has its impact in the future . and yes everything includes not doing anything too. So whatever you do is your karma and everything happens in your life is due to your karma (deeds/works/efforts). So, THINK BEFORE YOU DO anything in life. Do good to receive good in life is the bottom line of the story. Happy Reading : ) ",

            "answer_text": "This world of humanity is based on full freedom and absence of any forcible destiny. Here, you are free to do any type of work and no destiny forces you to do any specific work as said in the Gita (Na kartrutvam...). The concept of destiny exists only in the link of the specific work and the specific fruit. You have full freedom to put your finger in fire or water. No destiny forces you to put your finger in fire or water. The destiny lies only in the link between a specific work and corresponding specific fruit. It is destined that the fire burns your finger and the water keeps your finger cool. The destiny is not in the selection of the work. You have put your finger in the fire due to ignorance or ego. After burning the finger, you may say that you have put the finger in the fire due to the destiny. God has destined the specific system, which links every action with a specific fruit. After putting your finger, God is not ordering the fire to burn it. The subsequent fruit for a specific work is already destined. God or the destiny does not interfere with the choice of your selection of a specific work. Even the so called past destiny does not interfere with your works. The composition of your psychology is fixed based on your past deeds. Thus, work is responsible for the will and the will is the generator of the work. Since the composition of your psychology is already based on your past deeds and is fixed, you can treat that as destiny and in such case, destiny is guiding everything. The psychology is a specific pattern of ideas generated by the past deeds and it is called as \u2018Samskara\u2019. An idea can be changed by knowledge. Samskara is a fixed concept and the right knowledge is a group of right concepts. You have the opportunity of hearing the right knowledge since God comes to this world quite often in human form. You have the freedom to hear such divine knowledge or not to hear. You have also freedom to practice the knowledge or leave it without practice. At every step, the basic freedom is given. This human world is also the right place for testing the devotees and here also, the full freedom is protected. You are totally free to sacrifice anything or not to sacrifice anything even if God desires for it. God does not force you or threaten you or wash your brain in your sacrifice since such sacrifice is not real. God is pleased only with the real sacrifice done by the soul in the atmosphere of total freedom. In the examination hall, you are totally free to answer the question paper to any extent or even to return the white paper without writing even a word. God preaches the total concept and in the stage of implementation of it, God does not influence your mind in any way. After teaching all the right knowledge through the Gita, Krishna said that the decision to fight or not is totally left to Arjuna (yathechchasi\u2026). The basic reason is that God is not in need of anything from anybody. The sacrifice is not to satisfy God but only to uplift you. The sacrifice proves your real attachment to God and such real attachment is not in the benefit of God but it is only in your benefit. Krishna asked for the special gem from Satrajit, the father of Satyabhama. Krishna is not in need of that gem. He is the creator of that gem. Even without the help of that gem, He can create wealth. He can even stop the power of the gem to create the wealth. Krishna asked the gem from Satrajit because Satrajit cannot maintain it and will fall in trouble. Only for the welfare of Satrajit, He asked him for that gem. But, Satrajit thought that Krishna asked that gem for His personal benefit and thereby, for His personal satisfaction. Such misunderstanding made Satrajit to refuse the gem. Astrology says that the happening of good or bad incidents is due to the planets. This misunderstanding again leads the people to think that their actions are destined by the planets. Here, your actions are not destined by the planets. Your actions are only destined by your psychological set up, which is destined by your past deeds. The planet links the specific fruit for the specific action. You do something based on your Samskara. The planet gives its correspondent fruit immediately. You blame the planet for guiding you to do a specific work and this is totally wrong. A planet is only destined to give the specific result linked with your specific action. The specific work is based on your specific psychological pattern only. The horoscope gives the composition of your specific psychological pattern. Since your future actions also depend on the same pattern, future prediction can be easily given. A specific psychological pattern is always linked with a specific composition of planets representing your qualities or ideas. Therefore, there is no external destiny here other than yourself regarding your future. If the Samskara is modified with the help of the divine knowledge, the whole destiny is changed, which means your horoscope totally disappears. Every period is divided into sub periods, every sub period is again divided into further sub periods and every division involves the revolution of all the nine planets again and again. This means that human being is a mixture of both good and bad always in every step of the time. Actually, the basic concept of astrology indicates that there is the existence of some unimaginable supernatural force that guides this world. Hence, astrology is an introduction for the philosophy. Without taking this basic reality, you misuse the astrology to justify yourself by linking your wrong actions to the planets. The worship of the supernatural and unimaginable planets introduces the worship of unimaginable God. But, this is again misused as the worship of the planet for not giving the bad result for the bad action done by you. If you worship God, He will preach you the right knowledge, which changes the total destiny. By your worship, God will not protect you from your sins. Therefore, in this world, the destiny is also in your hands only. There is full freedom for you to change your destiny through the right knowledge. Hence, this world of humanity is called as \u2018Karma Loka\u2019, which means that your actions decide everything and that your action is based on your psychological pattern only and not by any pre-determined external destiny. The upper worlds are called as \u2018Bhoga Lokas\u2019 because there is no freedom to perform any new action and you have no freedom at all, but for enjoying the destined results for your already recorded actions. \u2018Pravrutti\u2019 means attachment to worldly bonds. \u2018Nivrutti\u2019 is detachment of your worldly bonds for the sake of God. This world is the stage for both pravrutti and nivrutti. Full freedom up to the level of changing your destiny exists here. Your destiny is only your fixed psychological pattern generated from the past deeds and not any other external force. This pattern can be changed by the right knowledge received from God in the form of preacher. Therefore, there is every chance for changing your destiny in this world. Generally, people blame the reason for their bad actions to be some external force called as destiny in which there is no trace of their personal psychological involvement. People say, \u2018People say so\u2019. The people cannot be the authority unless the whole subject is perfectly analyzed. Even there are several misinterpretations in books written by ancestral scholars. You should not blindly take the people or the ancient books as authority without analyzing them perfectly. The Gita says that you will laugh at such authorities if you analyze the subject with sharp scientific intelligence (Buddhyaayukto\u2026). Even if the implementation is impossible, it is better to have the right knowledge, which follows the soul to the next birth so that the practical implementation can be done sometime in the future. This point looks quite good, but there is the practical danger. Just like the cooked food can be attacked by the bacteria in the atmosphere, the right knowledge is also attacked by the worldly attractions and sometimes, the right knowledge may become weaker and weaker and even may finally disappear even in the later part of this life. Therefore, it is better to implement the realized concept as early as possible like eating the cooked food immediately. ",
