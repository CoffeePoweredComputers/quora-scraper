            "answer_text": "Time is a construct of Spacetime\u2026 that is (to be simpler) it is part of the structural design of all space and matter. Gravity plays an integral role in this construct, as does Space\u2026 so it exists whether we measure it or anyone observes it BUT it can be stretched, dilated and even bypassed (into the future) but the ability to \u201creverse\u201d this construct is directly adverse to it\u2019s function and therefore the ability to \u201creverse\u201d this construct would be highly localized, unless you can rewind the Universe. (and likely very short lived) Allow me to be simple. At July 8th, 1957 the Earth was at position [x, y, z, t] in the Milky Way Galaxy and or the Universe. (depending on your point of reference) The Earth is traveling thru the Universe as it whips around the Sun which is also moving thru the Universe as whips around the Milky Way Galaxy\u2026 so today August 20, 2019 the Earth could be millions of miles from where it was in 1957 as we are moving in a big circle around the center of the Galaxy. (trillions of miles?) To go back in time, you would need to reverse the spin of everything! OR at least travel back to the exact position in space where the Earth was at that time in 1957. If you truly went back in time and you look at the night sky, the position needs to be correct. You would need to first travel to the position the Earth was in 1957, which is millions of miles away before even thinking about dilating time. If an alien spaceship crashed in 1957 and I wanted to go back in time and verify this, you would have to be in the same position that the Earth was and the spacecraft 62 years ago or you wouldn\u2019t see the spaceship fly by. (unless you rewound the entire Universe to that position) If it were possible to create an inverse time dilation and if it didn\u2019t take a preposterous (infinite) amount of energy to create one and assuming you could somehow travel back to where the Earth existed in Space and Time in 1957 (without taking forever to get there)\u2026 then possibly\u2026 if you wrapped or compressed the fabric of spacetime near a singularity\u2026 for conjecture. However\u2026 the ultimate Catch 22 would be the lack of simultaneity of events\u2026 what is someone else\u2019s past could very well be your future\u2026 so whatever you do in the past, already happened\u2026 the fact that it\u2019s your future does not change the fact that it\u2019s already happened, from the viewpoint and time of another observer. (which Einstein\u2019s work helped me understand how they can be in a different order) So traveling to the past only changes YOUR future and only so much as it\u2019s what happens to YOU next. (you, as the time traveller) For everyone else, it\u2019s already history and doesn\u2019t ever change in ANY way. Hope I didn\u2019t spoil every single Time Machine show for you or your concept of fate. ",

            "answer_text": "I am delighted that you asked this question because it is so great and can have many different answers! Ok so first off, I'm going to answer this in two parts. The first part will deal with traveling back in time. As in just yourself. The second part will deal with actually reversing time for the entire universe, which I believe will be the hard part! Part One: A New BeginningDon't you just love vague titles that could pertain to anything and may not even make sense all the time? Me too! Time travel is a huge topic in one of my favorite genres: science fiction. You've got books like The Time Machine, movies like Back to the Future, and, my personal favorite, shows like Doctor Who! Time travel has been a subject of interest for, well, a long time! Now, time to get into all the technical stuff. Or was the time actually yesterday? Hmm... Anyways, focusing on backwards time travel, there are multiple theories delegating the conventions and practicalities of backwards time travel. For one thing, you've got the Multiverse Theory! Basically, this states that for every possible decision that could be made, a new universe is created where in each decision that wasn't made, was made. Let's say you go to Taco Bell and have the option of ordering a Chicken Quesadilla or a Steak Quesadilla. You choose chicken. Poof! A new universe was made where you chose steak! It's that easy! That way you get both. Well, you don't. But the other you gets the other one. Ok never mind about the Taco Bell. Let's say the Multiverse Theory is correct. Let's apply a common time travel paradox to this situation: the Grandfather Paradox! You go back in time and kill your grandfather. Poof! A new universe is created in which you never existed. Now, you won't die, but you \"supposedly\" aren't able to return to the present either, for whatever reason. This applies to any decision that you would make in the past. Next theory! Ok, so I may have forgotten the name of this theory, so don't hate on me for that! Anyways, basically this theory states that whenever you go back in time and, say, kill your grandfather (look daddy, recursion!). Once you kill him, the paradox takes it effect! Boom! You're stuck in an infinite time loop! You were never born, so you never killed your grandfather. Meaning that you were born, so you did. So you aren't born. Then you are. Crap, brain hurts now. This would basically happen to any decision you made in the past. You want to create Apple instead of Jobs and Wozniak. But then you already made it, so you wouldn't have had the desire to go back in time to make it instead. See how this works? Theory number three! I don't know the name of this theory either. I know, I know, I'm a bad Quoran for not doing my proper research beforehand. But hey, I like pulling stuff out the top of my head! So, this theory states that the decisions you make in the past were the ones that created the future that is your present. You go back in time to kill your grandfather. Turns out your father was adopted afterwards because your grandfather wasn't there to have a biological son. You got back in time to kill Hitler as a baby. Ha, he ended up being adopted too! But no one knew because they didn't want him to find out. But he does. Probably. I don't know. So there are probably more and more theories out there, but I thinks it's safe to say that these are the most popular. So now, is backwards time travel possible? Well, first, is it possible to separate the time dimension from the other dimensions to traverse it in a backwards fashion, sort of like riding a wave? Or is time is own universe made up of multiple spatial dimensions, and you need to get into it to travel through time? With all the possibilities, no matter how outrageous, there really is no way to know until someone manages to do so. And would it even be practical? If the infinite time loop theory is correct, then no, it'd be pretty stupid. If the Multiverse theory is, then sure, if you want to have yourself CEO of Google in another universe with you stranded back in time. What about the you-caused-your-own-future theory? I mean, it's going to end up happening anyways. Right? Now it could be possible if we had two temporal dimensions, one flowing in either direction. Just hop on one and get off at the proper turnpike. Or find a way to ride the one we have backwards, like trying to swim upstream against the white water rapids of time. Part Two: .esreveR ni sihT etorW INow with a title that makes sense, and probably a much shorter section, we got to reversing time.  Does anyone remember the Jimmy Neutron episode where he made the little remote that rewound whatever just happened? His dad used it to re-eat his food, and I finally found someone to connect with. As interesting and humorous as that was, I honestly don't believe that going in reverse is at all possible. Unless you could devise a quantum universal \"reset\" button or \"start from last checkpoint\" option. Much like a video game, you do something that was stupid. So stupid you wish more than anything to undo it. So you pull out your trusty QURB and return to where you were five minutes ago. Now, you would probably be the only one with memories of it, or else it would be essentially useless, except in some scenarios. Now if you didn't have memories of it, would you make the same mistake? I don't know, my QURB hasn't arrived from ThinkGeek yet. So this concludes my answer! I'm sorry that I wasn't able to answer the second reverse part very thoroughly. It really was a thought-provoking question. If I come up with anything else, I'll be sure to edit this question. And please, if anyone else has ideas, suggestions, corrections, or anything of the sort, feel free to comment! Again, thanks for asking this question! ",

            "answer_text": "I have never been able to understand people\u2019s views on time. People talk about \u2018why does time flow forwards?\u2019 and \u2018can time be reversed?\u2019 as if those are logical questions instead of pure meaningless nonsense. Now, I could just be ignorant. That is always a possibility. But I would love someone, anyone, to explain, without any bad assumptions and logical fallacies, what the heck these statements even mean. Because it seems extremely simple to me, but clearly many people disagree. This is how I see it. Time is the perception of some state change. Time is not a \u2018thing\u2019 that can be manipulated (slowed down, sped up, reversed, questioned why it goes in one direction and not another)\u2026 it is just an observation of some state change. Let\u2019s not discuss the measurement of such state changes for now, because time, in the bare form that we know it, is an experience. And the measurement of any phenomena is not equal to the phenomena itself - it is a representation of the thing, not the thing in itself. For example, it is idiotic to ask why time moves only forward, for exactly the same reason it is idiotic to ask why a glass that falls on the ground breaks apart but can never \u2018un-break apart\u2019. This is ridiculous. It breaks because it fell under gravity and then hit an immovable barrier and the glass shattered because of the forces on the glass, causing various forces on the pieces\u2026 hence it shattered. To ask why it can shatter and never un-shatter is absurd (I believe I saw this \u2018question\u2019 being asked in some \u2018scientific\u2019 documentary on time once). For it to un-shatter would require a lot of other forces. What has happened, has happened. Done. I made a cup of coffee an hour ago, that happened. What that means is, what meant \u2018making coffee\u2019 for me was part of a state of the universe that I judge to be about an hour ago. That state came and went - like days of a week. The universe IS a collection of \u2018stuff\u2019 (whatever that means) in a constant state and state transitions. There is no \u2018time\u2019, there is just what we call time - the progression of these states and our observation and experience of it. And so the notion of \u2018reversing time\u2019 seems like a very silly idea to me. What it would mean is somehow forcing the current state of the universe into a previous state - but how would that be done? And if it is done, certainly it would require impossible vast amounts of energy and some \u2018device\u2019 to make it happen - and then for that \u2018device\u2019 to annihilate itself in such a way so that even it would be deconstructed so that the universe is in the same state as before - i.e. without that device existing. Sounds like very bad science fiction, and it is. Worse of all - reality is reality even if there is no-one to observe it. So if \u2018time is reversed\u2019, if the state of the universe is somehow returned to the exact same state as it was in a week ago for example - then the fact remains, time has passed, as it always has. I.e. - states changed. Not backwards - always forwards. States cannot change backwards by definition, because backwards implies \u2018against the gradient of causality\u2019. And that means effect without cause. And that is neo-scientific nonsense, which, inexplicable, seems so popular these days. But as always, anyone with more knowledge than me, correct me if I am wrong, please! ",

            "answer_text": "Systems with only a few degrees of freedom have no inherent direction in time: you can't tell if the movie is running forward or backward. In our universe, systems with a large number of degrees of freedom; like rocks, amoebas, and people, are bound by an Arrow of Time. For (way too many) details I quote from a long answer I gave some months ago: The fundamental laws of physics are time-symmetric: no before and after; no cause and effect; no past and future. Time doesn't flow. The concept of communication cannot be given meaning. The answer to your question does not lie there, but it will pop up again below. We don't experience time that way at all: we remember only our past; influence only our future. By 1927 Arthur Eddington had reified this asymmetry with the name Arrow of Time, and identified it with the direction your entropy increases. Clausius' compressed 1865 restatement of his original 1850 definition of the second law of thermodynamics: entropy (another Clausius definition) never decreases; implies everything's [1] entropy increases in the same direction in time, so everything's Arrow of Time points in that same direction. But what is entropy and why is the entropy of everything with well-defined entropy changing in the same direction? What is that direction? We can answer that. By 1901, J Willard Gibbs had created and named Statistical Mechanics as we now know it, and discovered three entropies [2]. They coincide in the limit of large numbers, and agree with the original thermodynamic Clausius definition whenever the Clausius entropy exists. For systems with only a few degrees of freedom, the definitions give three different constant entropies: entropy is not a useful concept for small systems. Two of Gibbs' definitions are based on the hypervolume of the space of all realizations of a system with energy equal to, or less than or equal to, the total energy of the system. Gibbs coined the term \"phase space\" for that space of all realizations. The term is now often used to refer to the 6n dimensional space of positions and momenta of a system of n point particles: Gibbs' definition encompasses all degrees of freedom of any given statistical system.[1] The rapidly increasing hypervolume of our early universe established rapidly increasing Gibbs entropies applying not just to the whole but to every subset with enough degrees of freedom to entail well defined entropy, which persist to this day even within regions such as our own galaxy which have long been gravitationally removed from the general expansion of our universe. This explains our universe's 2nd law of thermodynamics (Clausius' 1865 restatement of his original 1850 creation), which asserts that the entropy (Clausius' coinage) of everything with enough degrees of freedom to possess well-defined entropy increases in the same direction.[1] Everything's Arrow of Time points in the direction in which the universe is expanding! We have lots of degrees of freedom so we are fully entrained in our Arrow of Time. Exceptions: As mentioned above, in systems with so few degrees of freedom that we can keep track of them all, the concept of entropy is not useful. There is no Arrow of Time: the fundamental underlying physical time-symmetry prevails! Between 1930 and 1935 Einstein, in the context of quantum mechanics, became increasingly bothered by the presence of information that could not have been communicated at \u2264c, not noticing global presence of information within its timespan is a fundamental property of all physical models going back at least to Newton. In 1935 Einstein called it \"spooky action at a distance\" and Schrodinger called it \"Quantum Entanglement\" in agreement. We still use this wildly misdirected term, applying it to systems with only a few degrees of freedom, so if you like DISentangled from the surrounding Arrow of Time, and only incidentally quantum mechanical in that systems with so few degrees of freedom must generally be treated that way. So, to tie it all together at last: each of us is entrained in our individual Arrow of Time pointing in the direction our entropy is increasing; which, along with everything else in our universe with enough degrees of freedom to possess well-defined entropy, is determined by the direction of early rapid expansion of our early universe. On the other hand, isolated systems with only a few degrees of freedom experience no flow of time at all. Time is a free parameter in nonentropic systems. [1] Really, everything with enough degrees of freedom to possess unique well-defined entropy. Also, the \u201cthings\" are supposed to be closed systems. We're not even sure our universe itself is closed. Everything exchanges energy with its surroundings but generally not at a sufficient rate to affect the assertion. The occasional things undergoing such massive energy exchange with something else that one of their entropies reverses its direction of increase need to be treated together as a single sufficiently closed system to sustain this assertion. [2]. Boltzmann and others had tried and failed to create a consistent statistical model for entropy based on the concept of disorder. In the last quarter of the 19th century, Gibbs, and eventually Boltzmann, understood this approach cannot be made precise and cannot be freed of inconsistency. Boltzmann got part way to one of Gibb's entropies with a probabilistic definition limited to point particles in equilibrium and still inconsistent; still lacking a firm foundation. His microstates per macrostate could not be made consistent. It looks just like one of the Gibbs entropies, and is still sometimes called Boltzmann's equation, despite the fact that only the Gibbs entropies are built on a solid, consistent foundation; i.e. actually make sense, and only the Gibbs entropies apply to all statistical systems, equilibrium or not, point particles or not. The Gibbs entropies carry right over to quantum mechanics! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. I have two theoretical solutions to the question. But they are far from practicality as far as i think. But you asked \"somehow\" so i m giving it a try. Its a bit classical approach.  Solution 1: Imagine universe as a recorded football match going on television. Every brain watching it is like witnessing this universe. Your mind is watching, analyzing, concluding, and commenting on the match. Now if someone reverses the time, it'd not be like reversing the direction in which the video is being played alone. You and your mind are the part of that universe too. It'd reverse the entire direction of the popping up of your thoughts in your mind too. you wont realize that time is running in reverse direction. Your mind cannot be separated from the space-time if the time is being reversed truly. It is very different from travelling into the past, because you wont be conscious to it.  Now forget universe for a while. The problem is a bit more related to brain as far as i think, because its our mind witnessing the universe. Imagine a test brain in laboratory. It is shown some event for some duration.  Assuming every state of mind and consciousness is nothing but an arrangement of all particles inside brain, we can theoretically keep track of all the particles up to as much certainty that i guess is required to reverse the process. Assuming we have a device which can rearrange each and every particle inside brain, we can program it to rearrange them in reverse order in which particles spontaneously arranged themselves during the passage of time during the event. This would be similar to reversing time. But as explained earlier, the brain wont recognize it because nothing is adding to the memory. The consciousness too has reversed( even i cannot imagine what that even means). But there could be a solution if we can do this reverse process during the forward passage of time, because then, during the reverse process, it'd be like normal thinking.  I think we'd require a parallel consciousness for this, which would think in reverse. Our mind is conscious to the thoughts it is used to with, like the one thinking with forward time. So, at every instance, there'd be two stream of thoughts running in mind, one with the time, another opposite to the time. If we reverse the time, the opposite stream will tune with the direction of time and our consciousness will shift to it. But is that possible?  There are a few problems. One we'll have to connect another brain with a device which has seen the event, so it can know the reverse event and thus can create reverse thoughts, and in turn can do the entire reverse process with the second brain. It can be done in laboratory with a pre recorded video as the event, but in real life, the device would have to look into the future. It'd be like travelling to future and then coming back to present and work accordingly.  Since we can travel to the future according to theory of relativity, going to the future is not a big deal(it is though). But coming back to future is a serious big deal, because it'd be like going back in time. So far we dont know how to truly go back in time. But time can be reversed in an small space. i'll discuss it in my next solution. The second problem is whether parallel consciousness would work? I think very soon our minds are gonna become hybrid with the progress in nanotechnology and artificial intelligence. Then we can try this concept of parallel consciousness, because it'd be more plausible then. I know this solution is like complete out of sci-fi movies, so please bear with it. Mybe in future we'll have to adapt with this parallel consciousness and hybrid brains. Also, if somehow LHC helps us finding the ultimate equation of universe, we may know future without travelling into it. So far in this discussion i have just tried to solve the problem of not realizing the reversal of time. But still the main problem exists. How are we gonna reverse it? The movie, \"Memento\" never showed a conventional direction of time. It included all scenes but un-ordered in time. But once the movie ends, all the scenes get connected into a perfect story, as if it was shown in an ordered fashion. Maybe the same is the case with our universe and mind. Maybe universe is nothing but a set of images/events, and our mind is connecting them in the way it makes sense. If we can, i guess, connect a mind thinking in reverse direction, we might be able to see the universe with opposite direction of time. The other way to reverse time is in my next solution. Solution 2:Next solution includes reversing time in a small space. Sometimes our purpose may not be to reverse the time in entire universe but in only our surroundings, like earth, solar system, or milky way galaxy. Theoretically we can rearrange all the particles as in a previous state in time. But since it'd be a non spontaneous process, it'd result in decrease in entropy of that space. To compensate that decrease in entropy, we have to increase the entropy outside that space. But since entropy of universe only increases in forward direction of time, we cannot make this small space as big as the universe itself. And also the space should be isolated enough so that changes outside it may not affect the inside space considerably.  Then, assuming we have enough technology and energy, we have to rearrange the particles to some previous time and we are done. In this way we can even recognize the reversal in time because we can spare the particles of our body and let them be how they are. But it'd create a vacancy in that space, because in some time in past you were not alive so your particles must be inside someone else's body or somewhere else. Even if you were alive, the particles keep exchanging with the surroundings. So if you are gonna keep yourself untouched, you cannot see the past exactly the way it was. Note that in this method, your are not actually reversing the time.The time is moving the way it was before, you are just creating the illusion of reversing of time by reversing the events by rearranging particles. But its almost same as reversing time if you cannot go outside the space during your lifetime. Cheers!! ",

            "answer_text": "Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo. Time is flowing at the rate of 1 second per second, thats for sure. Maybe there is a place in space, beyond the universe, and way past other mutiverses, (if they exist) where time runs backwards, but I doubt it. I think time really is just neurons recording events, you can physically see these events in photos, and video. Outside observers see your clock moving more slowly if you go to a black hole, or get close to the speed of light. So time can flow at different rates in space, or if you travel fast. Its a theory that time can stop at the singularity of a black hole, and that time would reverse if the speed of light was exceeded. But in the singularity of the black hole, even if it take a googleplex amount of time for a second to pass from an ouside observers perspective, then time has not really stopped at the singularity. Imagine if you went to a room where time flowed backwards, you would have to stay in this room for a year, in order to create something to reverse. Then you you push a switch to reverse time in the room, after 1 year has passed. So as soon as you stepped this room, you would step right back out of it, with no memory of being in the room for 1 year, but a whole year would have passed on the outside of the room for relative observers. It may even be more complicated than I just described doing an experiment like this. This experiment could mess with the laws of physics, and possible kill you, maybe cause a paradox. So even if you could reverse time, would you want to? It may kill you trying an experiment like this on yourself. I think that time would continue to stretch with time dilation. Speed of Light (c): Light travels at a constant speed of 1,079,252,848.8 (1.07 billion) km per hour. That works out to 299,792,458 m/s, or about 670,616,629 mph (miles per hour). That is just a random number. If you could see a light clock, on a light beam exceeding 670,616,629 mph, I doubt you would see it freeze, and stop. As for going back in time, by exceeding the speed of light, I doubt that would happen also. Because if you could see the behavior of a light clock as it travels at the speed of light you would see the the beam move from the top of the clock to the bottom, and back to the top again, to complete 1 second, as the light clock moves forward through space. You can see how a light clock works in this YouTube video below, you can skip to 17 minutes, and 20 seconds to see the explanation about how a light clock works.  So you see the light clock create a V shape, as it moves from the top to the bottom, and back to the top again. So no matter how fast you are going the V shape is just going to get longer, and longer as speed increases, from point A to point B, even if the distance from point A to point B is googolplex long amount of distance in light years. The V shape of the light clock, would never stop growing longer as speed is constantly increased, or stop, or reverse, why would it, it can't. Even if it takes a googolplex amount of time in light years for the light clock to move vertically by 1 cm, time has not stopped. Message me with your thoughts on this experiment. You can read my greatest answer to the time travel in the Quora link below. Hope it helps.

            "answer_text": "We describe reality as information sequences interconnected by transformations. For complex entities we speak of sequences of states. For example, our consciousness is a sequence of states of neural schemas of the brain. Time is a parameter based on the transitions between each elemental state. The larger this space is (from the point of view of another sequence of information which records it), the more the proper time of the sequence of states is slow. Our consciousnesses have each their own time but they are close enough so that we can communicate :-) A first big question about time was to know if only the states of the present exist (those of the past disappear in nothingness and those of the future do not exist yet), or if all states exist in a reality called \u2018block-universe'. The first hypothesis (presentism) has become untenable since the discovery of the relativity of time. We exist with the future and past states of entities that move at speeds different from ours. All states are therefore inscribed in reality. The second big question is whether states are happening or not. Is there a tension running through the states to create a movement from one to the other, or are the equations motionless? Another way to ask this question is to consider the sequence of states as content, and then is there a container called time, a sort of gut that would contract from place to place on the sequence to signal a present? This question is not resolved. Contrary to what one might believe, the existence of an arrow of time does not answer this question. The arrow of time is not a movement. It simply says that the two directions of the sequence are not always read in the same way. This asymmetry exists weakly from the quantum interactions, then becomes the rule during the thermodynamic organization in the condensed matter. The sequence of states is therefore not reversible for macroscopic entities ... but the term 'reversibility' only makes sense if we assume that there is a course of time. We have seen that the question is not decided. Yet our consciousness clearly experiences a course of time. Is it an illusion? Hard to decide, again. It is possible the only succession of states of neural patterns is responsible. They would 'walk' from the least organized to the most organized. The 'walking' would then be the depth of information. No need for happening, for tension. A more personal assumption is that this march is the surimposition of information levels. It is a concept different from simple deepening, which remains sequential. Surimposition is the fusion of these levels of information that does not make their relative independence disappear. Like geological layers that pile up to make the final appearance on the surface, called 'present'. The time experienced would be a thickening of these layers. There would be a movement, but only in the very specific dimension of the organization. I hope I have communicated a little dizziness only to accept the (almost) final answer to your question: To say if we can reverse the time we must already know what it is exactly, which is not the case. However, it is the answer for so-called ontological time, that is, property of reality. For the so-called epistemic time, owner of the mind (this famous sequence of information which records the others), there exists a scale of the times peculiar to each level of organization of the real. The scale of peculiar times concerns more precisely the models constructed by the mind to represent these levels. Models are manipulable algorithms in both directions of their sequences. It is through them that we are able to reverse time, that is to say, to trace the past of reality. Finally we are not so blind since without knowing what time is, we are already able to reverse it. Nothing surprising: the human claim being known for its lack of limits, it is normal that it works in all directions ;-) ",

            "answer_text": "In spite of being a mysterious phenomenon in the quantum mechanical context, Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity considers Time to be just a fourth dimension in our reality. If Einstein\u2019s theory is to be followed, then motion through this dimension should be smooth. Then why is it that time-travel is still a thing only in science fiction? An experiment from 2019 shows the boundaries that differentiate the past and the present, on a quantum scale. Researchers from the US and Russia teamed up to find a way to alter on the most fundamental laws of physics. The researchers wanted to bend the second law of thermodynamics. The second law states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time, and is constant if and only if all processes are reversible. This small statement is the guiding principle for all the physical processes in the universe. Even when subjected to quantum processes, the second law does not lose its ground. If you observe carefully, this is the only law of physics that mentions the word time. Other laws of physics are time-dependent, meaning, they work well in the forward time direction as well as in the backward one. \u201cThat law is closely related to the notion of the arrow of time that posits the one-way direction of time from the past to the future,\u201d said quantum physicist Gordey Lesovik from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. To put it simply: you could zoom in on a game of pool, and a single collision between any two balls won\u2019t look weird if you happened to see it in reverse. On the other hand, if you watched balls roll out of pockets and reform the starting pyramid, it would be a sobering experience. That is the second law. In the quantum realm, things get a bit different. As we focus in on the tiny gears of reality - in this case, solitary electrons - loopholes appear. Electrons, if we consider, are defined by the space they occupy. We can only give a range of locations where a given particle is likely to be, rather than its definite location. The details of this characteristic of electrons can be properly summed up using the Schrodinger\u2019s Equation. This equation represents the possibilities of an electron\u2019s characteristics as a wave. If we imagine the same game of pool, as previously discussed, according to the Schrodinger\u2019s equation the balls are somewhere on the pool table moving at a certain speed. But, in quantum terms, the ball is everywhere at a bunch of speeds.  There are certain conditions under which the equation describes a particle localizing into a small region of space, just like a ball coming back into your palm after being thrown. This thing was simulated in Quantum Computers, and simulations were run, which showed that this could happen after all. The algorithms used by the researchers could assist in potentially improving the performance of quantum computers; other than that, this experiment could provide us with great insights into what could be possible if we can harness the power of quantum physics.

            "answer_text": "There are ideological \"parties\" in physics. In relativity theory, time invariance is defined as a component, i.e. physical laws should be able to run backwards in reality. The CPT theorem postulates fundamental symmetry and above all time symmetry of physical laws. It is only at another term for the same thing: Physical laws should also be able to run backwards in reality. However probably most physicists belong neither to the one nor to the other fraction, since backward running time has never been observed, which is indirectly recorded in the 2nd law of thermodynamics. This majority of physicists assumes that time can not run backwards. All fractions ignore each other or tolerate each other and make friends despite everything. So the point, whether time can run backwards or not, is officially in physics an unexplained matter. Most physicists assume that this is not possible, but can not give a conclusive reason for it. An attempt by the author to give a reason follows: Why can't time run backwards? Every physical action requires potential energy. Then these energies are transformed by physical processes. This transformation requires a signpost/algorythm, i.e. what is transformed and how. The starting point for the energy transformation are those reality factors with the lowest threshold for an energy transformation that are \"affected\" by the potential energy. This corresponds to water finding its way through the algorithm of least resistance. The type of transformation is regulated by physical laws. We therefore have the starting situation of the presence of a potential energy, the algorithm of the lowest threshold value for an energy transformation in the sphere of action of the start-potential energy. Then an energy transformation according to the rules of physical laws. How should this universal process run backwards? ? The start-potential-energy is transformed. The processes with the lowest threshold value for an energy transformation are no longer present because they have absorbed energy. There is no backward algorithm according to the lowest threshold of physical factors in the sphere of action of the former potential energy. Likewise, there is no potential energy left. The backward process would first have to build up a new potential energy. Where should this energy come from? Secondly, the algorithm of the lowest threshold value is blocked at the same starting points as in the forward process, since these starting points have absorbed energy. So the return process can not attack at the same starting points. These would be two points, why a backward running of time is basically not possible. Example follows.

            "answer_text": "Direction of time:  According to Wikipedia; Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Source: Wikipedia.com But how do we measure time? In fact there are two devices. First one is a clock which is used to measure time intervels a day. Second one is a calendar which is used to measure time interval greater than a day.  If anyone asks a question that in which direction the time is going you will probably say that time is going forward but infact every thing is relative. So the time is. You can not imagine a positive without negative. You can't imagine happiness without sadness. Similarly you can not imagine whether the time is going forward or reverse unless you taste both. So, science has arbitrarily assumed the passage of time after Big Bang as positive after relating time with entropy.  Source: Article Central According to Arthur Eddington time is measure of increase in entropy. He stated that as Entropy is increasing with time  so Entropy is arrow of time. -Second law of thermodynamics EXPLANATION: If you see a broken egg, you say that it's unbroken condition must've occurred before it's unbroken condition. Why you say so? Because you check the entropy of it. As broken egg has greater entropy than unbroken egg. So unbroken condition occurs earlier than broken one.  If you mix a dye and water entropy increase. Diffusin of dye with water seams more realistic than process reversed.  Let us discuss order as entropy. Suppose you are given 10 questions whose answers are unknown to you. You start guessing questions. There is only  one condition out of 87091200 that all of  your questions are true. In the same way if you shake a dye-water solution there is only one condition out of unlimited conditions that molecules of dye and water are separated. As one over infinity equals zero so it is impossible. Suppose it had happened, now will you say that time is reversed as entropy of solution is decreased. Nope certainly no, as entropy of entire system is always increase since Big Bang ( according to science ); you have increase entropy of the universe by shaking the solution.  Never stop learning ",

            "answer_text": "No. You can\u2019t reverse something that isn\u2019t moving in the first place and time doesn\u2019t move. That\u2019s the solution to the asymmetry issue. The reason we don\u2019t see things happening in reverse is because time has nothing to do with it. All things at every level and everywhere are in motion, moving through time. Time is a dimension, not a river, which allows events to take place, just as space allows for things to have positions. If those objects change position, then that is an event which moves through time. You can\u2019t reverse time because time wasn\u2019t going forward to begin with. The reason we can run back film, and thus think of doing the same with time, is because the film was recording what was taking place both in space and time and has the freedom to run backwards, just as you do. But running the film backwards is not the same thing as running time backwards because time was never going forward at all, but the film was moving forward, through time as it moved during filming in the camera, thus it can do what time can\u2019t, and be reversed.

            "answer_text": "Consider an example. There are two people lets say A and B billions of light years apart and are sitting on a bench in the park. Consider that there are two photons a and b, photon a carries the image that person A is sitting on the bench and photon b carries an image of the person A coming to sit on the bench. The first situation in which both are sitting, person B would receive the image from the photon b after which it would receive the photon a billion years apart when person A is seated on the bench. Now if person B starts moving away from person A more than the speed of light then the photon a wouldn't catch up with person B rather person would catch up with the photon b because that photon had already left person B billion of years ago when photon a reached. So person B would see person A again coming to sit on the bench. Now if we take this theory far enough then person B would see the birth of person A because after travelling more than the speed of light person B would reach a photon that would contain the image of younger person A. This is a hypothetical example of time reversal or travelling into past which utilizes the theory of relativity. ",

There is no time, there are only temporal phenomena. Events are structured in time as in any other construction and the chronological succession is the one it is and it doesn't make sense to speak of inversion. Nevertheless, everybody does speak about it, but it is only because psychologically we live in the world of our minds, no the real world, by real meaning objectual. It\u2019s not a matter of physics\u2014although it\u2019s at the root of the development of physics\u2014but of psychology immediately, and philosophy ultimately. ",

Time is a concept that enables us measure intervals between events and, hence, cannot be manipulated. You can manipulate the events and produce the illusion that time is variable. It\u2019s claimed that if objects travel faster than the speed of light, it\u2019ll alter causality i.e. the sequence of events will be disrupted. Specifically an event can occur before the cause. Causality never changes under any circumstance. You only perceive that the order has changed but you can\u2019t alter the cause. If you\u2019re travelling in a ship faster than the speed of light, you\u2019ll catch up with photons that were emitted in the past. In fact, you\u2019ll see events happening backwards. This doesn\u2019t mean that reality is happening backwards, it\u2019s just an illusion. Unfortunately, relativity is based on such illusions. I mean the speed of light is the same for all observers - really! I mean it isn\u2019t, I don\u2019t care what Einstein says. Beware of idol worship i.e. Einstein said so, therefore it\u2019s true.

            "answer_text": "No. The arrow of time points only one way. And, there's not much agreement on whether time actually exists. I think of time as an expression of motion. Everything exists in the present. We can record where things are to remember them and this record can be time marked for sequencing. Our experiences help us predict and plan for the future. Because everything we see is actually a light image from a distant object, virtually everything we see is in the past. The further away, the older the image. When we change our motion and travel toward a distant object, especially at a higher speed, we shift our frame of reference while traveling and experience time dilation. But this is not time travel. It's a change in differential motion of matter. ",

Firstly, can we practically reverse it - No we can't, at least till date considering the technology we have. Secondly, can we create an illusion of time reversal- yes, we can and the best tool that we have is our brain. just an example while listening to a old song/movie you often think about those memories that were associated with it, so when the song was playing it's actually proportionate with the time but your emotions and memories were reversely proportionate with time. Just like a video playback. If we are able to capture a man's life in a video (not considering the cost of recording & storage) and runs a playback when he dies it would be similar what i have just said. ",

According to Einstein\u2019s energy formula all mass has energy. The calculation of time started in ancient times by means of solar system relative movement happenings that is day and night as 24 hours and its unit as second and now it is compared to oscillations of an atom. An atom has electrons which oscillates as in that like planets in solar system relative movements of planets or sun . So time unit is relative movement of counting an atom oscillation in numbers or counting of fraction of day and night. If no oscillation of atom or no movement in solar system or no movement of anything in universe unit of time cannot be obtained so time is nothing only counting of movement or happenings in this universe.

You would think so if you consider time to be a linear transformation as the present advances towards the future, leaving the past in its wake. This view, however, begs the question of what exactly is the present as the future seems to pass directly to the past. see the diagram:  If we consider time to be three-dimensional, however, we can see that it is not possible to reverse what we consider the passing of the present time. Our past exists in a different dimension acting at right angles to the present. The imaginary time component contains the quantity, \u2018i\u2019, the square root of minus one. It defines the future, necessary for the existence of the present but never itself existing.

The future is a projection based on the human ability to predict physical processes. Time travel may be achieved by suspended animation, or aging, but there is nothing of substance to Time as \"being real\" so the notion of spacetime as a fabric fails, BUT the concept of Time is intimately connected to space (as Einstein said), as a record of relative motions in space -- just choosing convenient reference \"clocks\" such as regular orbits or rotations.
