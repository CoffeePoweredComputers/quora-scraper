            "answer_text": "Q. In philosophy, is there still a branch called cosmology? A. Ancient philosophy dealt with cosmology until science took over. With the fact that cosmology doesn\u2019t interact with humans like ontology does, and that science only claims something to be true once it has been empirically proven; the idea of philosophy delving into it is found somewhat quite illogical. However, I do believe if you look hard enough you\u2019ll find certain philosophies today that do go into it. If people can believe in religion, they can certainly believe in philosophical cosmology.

            "answer_text": "As we are in the \u201cgolden age of cosmology\u201d, this branch indeed provides numerous opportunities to intermesh with the concept of infinities. Therefore, it does contribute a fertile ground for further philosophical study. Although it\u2019s earliest form, as \u201cphysical cosmology\u201d depended purely on celestial mechanics, it is at the least to say physics is potentially the conceptual foundation of modern cosmology followed by the fundamental theories of it. In whole, philosophy begins where physics ends, and physics begins where philosophy ends. Given large-scale structures, dynamics, and scientific theories, it is a branch of philosophical study in which the approach is to understand the space-time relationships of the universe. It will and always will be. ",
