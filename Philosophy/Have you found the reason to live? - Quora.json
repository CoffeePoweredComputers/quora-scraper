Not only that, I - as in this person / being, responding to this particular question at this moment - also found out, to my utter amusement, that the reason is exactly the same for all Homo Sapiens, irrespective of nationality, religion, language, wealth, social status, etc. Reason\u2026 Purpose\u2026 Objective\u2026 Goal\u2026 call it whatever\u2026 the purpose of a(ny) being born as a human, is to realise the Truth (about Creator, creation, existence, et al) and attain Mukthi (the ultimate liberation from the repetitive birth-death life cycle spiral). In this ancient culture, this has been common knowledge for millennia, and millions have strived to attain this. Many have actually attained it as well. I became aware of this eternal Truth, when a Guru (Realised Master) happened in this lifetime, and altered the course of my life journey, decisively. May Grace make that happen to you as well, in this lifetime itself. Shambho! ~Swamy | `@PrakashSwamy ",

Who knows wether hell or heaven exists or not or it is just the imagination .We are here for a mission, go find it and grab it. Motherfucker I am not able to grab my fiance hand and you are telling me to go find and grab that is invisible or not known. See let me tell you one thing. This world is full of magician. Some play with physical power some play with unseen mind game. We should not fall prey to these miserable things. Love and do whatever you want no matter what it is. I said do whatever you love to do no matter what it is or how scary or wiered it may looks to you. Go and enjoy. Never try to find out the mission or to try to prove yourself to this creepy fucking world. Just enjoy ",
