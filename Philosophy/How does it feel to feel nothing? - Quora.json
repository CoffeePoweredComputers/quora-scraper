            "answer_text": "The feeling of nothingness is like space, it is vast, it is infinite and it has no ends. You fail to measure it, to draw a line and limit it into a parameter. While growing up, I\u2019d always be filled with enthusiasm and excitement, excited for every small event, however insignificant. Sometimes I feel that I exhausted my bucket of feelings and therefore many times I don\u2019t feel anything at all even for the consequential events and activities, and I feel perfectly at ease with it. I\u2019d always imagine and associate this \u201dnothingness\u201d with possible symptoms of depression, until I started experiencing it myself, and no I am not depressed. I am perfectly fine. I think my feeling of nothingness has a lot to do with situations and specific people. The bitterness they created in my life, the experiences they left me with, it got to a point where my body, mind and soul refused to take Anymore. It feels like my heart has shut itself to protect me from misery and anxiety. It doesn\u2019t want me to get hurt anymore, with people and their actions. And I know this is perhaps a fabrication of my own mind, but it makes me live at peace. It lets me sleep peacefully at night. Feeling \u201cnothing\u201d makes me happy, it gives me peace, it saves me anxiety, it saves me the rage, it saves me energy. ",

            "answer_text": "My experience of nothingness is not that it is empty, the entire manifested universe and totality ( that includes the unmanifested) is there right in front and around us, it is something like experiencable but undefinable. Example is try discribing experience of sweetin any known language on earth . we have disconnected the consciousness from memory, the feeling of nothingness is due to not being able to describe the experience as it is not there in our memory either, how to describe it in a language known to others here on earth when we try it does not match the words attached to limited things, just immagine all the things we did not experience here on earth, but they exist, another example, the child it can see and observe everything all around itself but does not know everything. It is just like being in a land where we dont know the language. Only we know that everything exists as we can experience (see, touch smell taste and hear) it, the others 0don\u2019t know the language, how do we communicate . Everything observed and recognised is within the limitation of language. Sign language and gestures are not sufficient to make you or others grasp the description. The experience of totality is lost as soon as we attach to any one thing and concentrate on it , try to describe it. ",

At the end of the day when I arrive home with a heavy mind and my senses are about to bid me off, I found my mom prepared with a delicious yummy summy dish, accompanied by my bhabi, or maasi, enjoying a hilarious chat shat session, about their early days or about our childhood, I try very hard to keep my senses on, to enjoy those. But found myself awaking almost in the very morning. I feel like nothing. I feel the same when I miss out my friends\u2019 gatherings. I try hard to be a part of everything that added value to my life, but as we know someone is more faster than you, even if you are the fastest. The Time. May be the anger, the misery, the stress results to feel like nothing. Hate it yaar. Fir v life to chalti hai. Nd of course I am the famous chatter box :>:> ",
