            "answer_text": "There are many different aspects of Philosophy and different courses will deal with different aspects of the subject. Regardless of the particular part of philosophy that the course you might choose would deal with, one would expect that clarity of thinking would come across. The importance of meaning and the communication of meaningful language are factors in all aspects of philosophy, whether logic, ethics, metaphysics or whatever. So, the main benefit would be coming out of the course as a better thinker. A serious danger, however, in taking an elective course in Philosophy; you might get hooked and change your major! ",

            "answer_text": "+ Some academic departments are very jealous of their status, encouraging them to discourage all but the most determined from taking what their subject. Philosophy is possibly the most overarching subject so this is a common Philosophy department attitude. Not all are suited to major in Philosophy, but departments could do much better at showing starter-outers what philosophy does and can do. Philosophy is abstract. Names of its concepts often give no clue what is really involved. Slight changes in emphasis of an idea can leave one confused and tied in knots. A conscientious Philosophy prof would forewarn students when those were coming and lead them along in thrashing out the big ideas. This is done best thru skilled questioning, not haphazard questioning. There is also much to the claim that if an expert cannot explain his subject clearly he does not know what he is talking about. \u2018Cannot explain\u2019 differs somewhat from \u2018will not explain\u2019. Both categories include plenty of profs, but I would fault those in the latter category more. They just need to make the effort so people who take the 1st five courses get the basis of a solid education. After about five courses, telling those contemplating further study of Philosophy that from there on the work load, each student\u2019s individual effort, and the difficulty would increase. As a result, only those interested in majoring should continue. ",
