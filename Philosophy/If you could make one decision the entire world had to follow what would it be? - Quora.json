            "answer_text": "If you could make one decision the entire world had to follow what would it be? I would propose switching the expenditure of wars and military hardware into agricultural tools to provide cheap food and alleviate poverty. To follow the wisdom taught in Isaiah 2:4; it teaches that \u2018Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more\u2019 Isaiah also taught that the efforts and the resources should be invested in the agricultural tools to produce food instead of wasting the resources in the military hardware \u2018they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks\u2019 We should also remember the wisdom taught in Isaiah 9:16 Those who guide this people mislead them, and those who are guided are led astray. That wisdom teach that some leaders do not listen to the poor people who need food and peace; they listen to the powerful military generals who justify military expenditure and who glorify wars to defeat their enemies Isaiah mentioned that we should not listen to the leaders who promote wars, we should change the priority to the agricultural tools and prosperity instead of building the military hardware, No country in the world would ever announce the cost of the rusted and scrapped military hardware; they consider that as top secrets. The actual expenditure of the depreciated military hardware could have eradicated poverty and could have transformed earth into a paradise. We should also remember the wisdom taught in ISAIAH 32:16-18 The wisdom teach that justice will bring peace He mentioned that without justice; people will not have peace or secured home If the majority provide the same rights to the minorities in each country; justice will promote compassion and cooperation instead of hatred and conflicts.

Unfortunately, even the most ardent followers of the Christian Bible don\u2019t adhere to this admonition, which is also found in the Jewish and Muslim holy books, among others. ",
