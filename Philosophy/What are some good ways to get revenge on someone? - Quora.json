            "answer_text": "\"What are some good ways to get revenge on someone?\" I'll present my case as a theory, to protect the not-so-innocent. Some twenty-five years ago, Mark lived in an apartment building where a central staircase came out on eight apartments, two apartments per floor. Mark lived on the top floor. Opposite from his apartment lived Mr. Bat. There was one more flight of stairs to the attic, where every occupant of the apartment building had a storage space, fenced off with wooden slats. Mr.Bat was old and angry. He walked around with stooped shoulders, glaring at everyone. He'd spit at people's feet and cursed them. Mr. Bat lived alone in his apartment and came out only to get food and drink. Hating everyone and everything, Mr. Bat had his own rules about how things should be. Mark had a cat. The cat loved to pee on paper. Mark collected the old paper to take to the paper waste disposal, but he couldn't put the box with used newspapers and discarded flyers and magazines in his apartment, because the cat would pee all over the paper. So, Mark placed a small cardboard orange crate right outside his door in the central stairwell and put his waste paper there. One day, he came home and the waste paper crate was gone.  Mark wondered if someone had taken out his waste paper, but it didn't matter, because it had no value. So, he put another old orange crate in the same spot and put his waste paper in. When the waste paper crate was almost full, the crate disappeared again. Slightly amused at the idea of a waste paper thief, Mark put a third orange crate in the same spot, wondering if this one would also disappear. The crate filled up slowly and a week later, when the crate was almost full, it disappeared. Mark put out a fourth crate. A day or two later, he went up to the attic to fetch something from his storage, and found three full crates of waste paper had been upended over the slatted wooden fence into his storage space. All his stored possessions were covered in waste paper. There was only one person insane enough to do something like this, the only person in the apartment building who wouldn't just ask Mark not to put waste paper crates in the central staircase. Mr. Bat. Mark knew the old fart was home, but Mr. Bat refused to open the door and talk to him. Mark went to talk to the other neighbours. The ground floor neighbour advised him to put a note in Mr. Bat's mailbox, explaining that if Mr. Bat had a problem with Mark, he could either take it up with Mark or the building supervisor (who didn't have a problem with a small waste paper crate in the hallway), but that Bat had to leave the crate alone. Mark put a polite note in Mr. Bat's mailbox, cleaned up his storage space, put out another crate and filled her up. Just before the crate was full, the crate disappeared again. And, predictably, the crate had been thrown in Mark's storage area. Pissed off, Mark did something not too bright. He put a second note in Mr. Bat's mailbox, telling him that Bat should keep his fucking fingers off his stuff or he might lose his fingers. Three days later, Mark's manager asked Mark to come over to headquarters because there was something wrong with the department records at the building Mark worked for. When Mark arrived for his meeting, his manager arrived with the HR manager, took out a letter and read: Dear Sirs, Your company employs a Mark X, who lives at Apartment Building XYZ. Your employee throws waste paper into the stairwell and that construes a fire hazard. As a good neighbour, I attended him to the situation, but he steadfastly refused to keep his waste paper in his apartment. I took it upon myself to put his waste paper into a more appropriate place in the attic, but Mark X didn't appreciate my efforts and as you can see from the note I included he threatened me with violence. I'm an old man, living alone, and I'm afraid of Mark X. Since I could see from his work uniform that he worked for your respectable firm, I can't understand how your firm could employ people like Mark and condone this type of behaviour. I though you should know. Sincerely, Mr. Bat. Mark was seething with anger, but told the manager that Mr. Bat was not right in the head. Had the manager tried to contact Mr. Bat concerning his allegations? The manager hadn't, but Mark urged him to go to the apartment building and talk to Mr. Bat, because he knew Mr. Bat would never open the door. Or talk to anyone. Furthermore, Mark said, the note was unsigned and likely a fabrication by Mr. Bat, a spiteful man who hated everyone. Not to mention that Mark was irked that the manager had called Mark to HQ under false pretences, so Mark was leaving. Right now. Mark walked out, furious with Mr. Bat's strategy of trying to get him fired. But, revenge is a dish meant to be served cold. Mark had been looking for another apartment. For the time being, he stored the waste paper in his attic and waited patiently. Mr. Bat seemed pleased that his strategy had worked in so far that the waste paper crate was now gone. Three months later, Mark moved out to another apartment. He gave the building supervisor his keys, but not before he'd made a copy of the key to the central staircase. Mark spent the next three months fixing up his new apartment and enjoying himself, then, after a late shift that ended well beyond midnight, when everyone was asleep, he went back to his old apartment building and climbed silently up to the top floor. The doors to the apartment buildings had a handle on the inside, but no handle on the outside, just a fixed doorknob and a keyhole. When someone pulled the door shut behind him, the door would latch and he'd need the key to get back into his apartment. Mark knew that the worst thing that could happen to Mr. Bat is being forced to interact with other people. So Mark walked up to Mr. Bat's apartment door and silently filled the lock with epoxy metal that would harden in minutes.  Now the house couldn't be unlocked from the outside, so when Mr. Bat went out for groceries, he'd find upon his return that his key would no longer fit the lock. Since this was at a time before people walked around with mobile phones, his inability to enter his house would require the aid of a locksmith. What would be an inconvenience to most people, would be hell for Mr. Bat, because he'd have to either find a phone and call a locksmith, or get one in person, both forcing him to interact with other people. Mark doubted if the act would be connected with him, as long as he wouldn't be found on the premises. So he left as silently as he'd come in. But he didn't left it at that. Mr. Bat had been terrorising him and the rest of the apartment building for years, so Mark found it only suitable that the Mr. Bat would be paid back in kind. There was a chance that Mr. Bat would be wary for a long time, testing his lock before he closed his door. Mark waited two months, so Mr. Bat would be lulled into the idea that this inconvenience was a one-time incident. Then he returned two months later and filled Mr. Bat's lock with metal epoxy again. Now Mr. Bat would be furious, but the old man had pissed off so many people, that it was unlikely that anyone would think Mark had something to do with it. And Mark had moved months ago, without a forwarding address. Mark left Mr. Bat alone for fourteen months, knowing that no-one could keep up his vigilance for such a long time. And then he did it a third time. Mark knew that Mr. Bat would never expect it to happen again after such a long time, so the third time would give him the terror that there was someone out there who might wait for years and do it again. Mark quit after the third time, but he knew Mr. Bat wouldn't know about that and would be paranoid about finding his lock closed again for years to come... ",

            "answer_text": "Revenge is a dish best served cold, according to The Godfather, and I trust The Godfather because the mob built Vegas and the one and only time I went to Vegas I literally can't remember. I remember the airport. I lost $5 in a slot machine there. Four days later I woke up at home. So the mob has eerie powers, and vengeance is one of them. In our modern world, there's not a lot of room for vengeance. It's generally either childish or illegal. You should be mature, people will say. Turn the other cheek. Or, God forbid, grow up. Well, I've been this size for years, so I figure I'm about as grown as I can get. Given that, I decided to try out a few classic revenge pranks on others and see not only which were most effective, but which filled me with the greatest sense of justice and well-being afterward. #4. Magazine Subscriptions Getty The bottom of the passive-aggressive vengeance barrel -- signing someone up for unwanted magazine subscriptions -- is a pretty timid method of putting them in their place. Still, it's better than a kick in the doodle. The Mark My parents. Getty Stock photo parents only embarrass you by wearing sweater vests. Sweet Revenge My parents have a lifetime of torment to make up for, so don't judge me for wanting to take vengeance upon them. Now, I wasn't beaten or anything like that, but there's more than one family photo featuring all of us in the same outfit, and I recall more than once being forced to try on pants at Kmart when I was a child while my mother held the door open and watched to make sure everything was fitting correctly. Later I'll set their house on fire, but this magazine thing is to test the waters. Turns out most magazine publishers are well aware of the hilarious prank of people randomly requesting subscriptions, so most of them expect payment in advance these days. Most. But not all. In fact, many trade magazines are more than happy to start sending copies to your place of business and will just bill you after the fact, as will vacuous entertainment magazines. My parents got their first issue of OK! Magazine, and no mention of it was made to me. In fact, they were three months into their subscription to OK! and also receiving WWE Magazine, New England Runner, All You, Practical Horseman, and 45 other periodicals before I got a phone call asking if I knew anything about it. I was hoping that they would be receiving a magazine per day before they clued in that something was up. Naturally I disavowed all knowledge and proposed a computer glitch. Anything that goes wrong in the modern world is probably the result of a computer glitch. I suggested they save all their magazines as evidence should anyone come to investigate, and I would do my best to alert Homeland Security that something was afoot. I was called an idiot and hung up on. Overall Feeling Just before I submitted this article to Cracked for editing, my parents had about 250 magazines in their house that they never asked for. It was at once the most childish and most wonderful thing I had done in years. I feel the way I imagine Nicolas Cage does when someone pays him to be in a movie. Like it's not right, but somehow it still is. #3. Upper Decker Getty A tried and true method of sticking it to someone you don't like but are on good enough terms with to use their bathroom. It's when you poop into the tank on the back of their toilet. You classy son of a bitch, you. The Mark My brother. Sweet Revenge When I was 12 years old and my brother was 17, my parents paid him to baby-sit me and he sat on my head and farted right into my eye. That sounds bad, but it's worth noting that he took his pants off to do it, so his asshole was literally right in my eye. For a second before it all went black, it was like being consumed by the Kraken, only to have it burp shit stink into your eye socket. And he got paid for it. I visited my brother over the holidays, because holidays are for uncomfortable moments with family when you're all \"Hey, remember how we share genetics? Welp, here's a box of chocolates with a map so you can tell which ones suck before you eat them!\" We had dinner and sat around in that awkward way you do when you let the old people have all the good seats and even though you're an adult you still get a shitty folding chair from the basement that feels like maybe it's possessed by the spirit of hell's masseuse. Then, when all was ready, I excused myself to go to the bathroom. Getty This is where the magic happens. The fundamentals of an upper decker are a little more complex than just shitting into the tank on the back of the toilet. For instance, you can't really just shit into the tank on the back of a toilet. I imagine some of you can, some limber shitters amongst you who can depants and balance precariously, your ass skirting the wall as you gracefully pull your cheeks apart and let your feces just swan dive into the tank. I would have broken my neck. Instead I created a net of toilet paper above the water, secured by the seat, and set about my foul task. Some few grunts later, my net had collapsed into the water, but, due to my foresight, I had left long TP arms hanging out the sides of the toilet and was able to deftly retrieve my turd and plunk it into the back of the tank. Thrilled with my accomplishment, I washed up and attempted to look suave and cool as I rejoined the family. It is currently early January, and I have still heard nothing about it. Overall Feeling Given that my brother has not discovered the upper decker, I don't know how to feel. I'm starting to wonder what's going on in his bathroom normally when family isn't around that an errant turd can survive for so long without being noticed. This is not my own experience but one of my friends told me so i have shared with you. ",
