            "answer_text": "As a Satanist I feel that some of the many benefits to being a Satanist is access to unlimited knowledge and undefiled wisdom. By this I am able to learn and grow and achieve so much in this life and don't have to feel guilty in taking pride in my successes. Another benefit is knowing that I am my own God in complete control of my life. Any decisions I make are mine to make. I don't have to feel like someone else's puppet nor do I have give thanks to anyone for doing something that I chose to do, something that caused my life to be just a little bit better. I don't have to pray when I want something, I just go get it and I don't have to confess to making a mistake I just try and learn from it. Unlike other religions that teach fear and guilt Satanism does not. As a Satanist I fear nothing except that which I cannot control which is very little and I don't feel guilty for making a mistake or doing something wrong as I know that sometimes shit just happens. I just have to make sure not to step in it. These are just a few of the benefits of being a Satanist. Any questions? ",
