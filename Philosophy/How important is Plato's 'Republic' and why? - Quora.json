            "answer_text": "Written in ancient Greece at a time of major political decay, Plato\u2019s Republic is becoming increasingly relevant for anyone who cares about justice or has an interest in restoring the political health of our communities. In fact, I can\u2019t think of anything more relevant. What we learn in the Republic is that the nature of justice depends on the nature of the city and that there are strong parallels between the city and the soul. In the Republic, just as there are five different regime types, there are also five corresponding characters of men and they each give birth to the next: aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny. These regime types can also be read in order of excellence. An aristocracy is a regime ruled by well-educated people who mix prudence and experience to become superior leaders. The leaders of this regime channel their desire and ambition through reason. There are three separate castes in an aristocratic society: (1) ruling class, defined by wisdom; (2) soldiers/guardians, defined by a pursuit of honor; and (3) the majority class, defined by the base desires of man. Considering Plato\u2019s tripartite theory of the soul, an aristocrat is a person in whom appetite, logic, and spirit work together properly. A timocracy is a system where property replaces wisdom as the highest value. In this regime, the soldier/guardian class are no longer warriors in pursuit of honor, but seek the things important to people of the middle class \u2013 moderate wealth, medicine, basic schooling, leisure, influence, etc. In this system, leaders are more \u201chigh-spirited\u201d and simple-minded than in an aristocratic regime (Crete and Sparta are Plato\u2019s examples of a timocracy). A timocratic man's nature is primarily good, but reason\u2019s preeminence has been eclipsed by appetite and spirit, which are the new highest values in a timocracy. An oligarchy is the first regime in which an actual desire for wealth rules. It is not property (or real-ty) in this system that is valued, but money. Money is desired for it\u2019s own sake whereas in previous regimes money was a means to acquire the materials necessary for the good life. In this way, money is prized over virtue or honor. The rulers in an oligarchy are warriors whose \u201cspiritedness\u201d dominates their soul. Oligarchs tend to be thrifty, hard working, and possess a superficial honesty derived from self-interest. They may seem superior to the majority, but their souls are extremely fragile. Oligarchs are scions who have forsaken their father\u2019s values because the fragility of a decaying regime could not maintain its previous orientation towards the good life. Oligarchs retreat from a life of high ambition and virtuous living. These men only appear to be good, while their desires are almost entirely self-referential and materialistic. In Plato\u2019s Republic, a democracy is a regime where one can find the most variety, which is why every character type can be found in it. Again, as found in previous regimes, the aim of democracy is not virtue, but freedom. Democracy abhors restraint, so freedom for individuals to do as they wish is the highest value. In a democracy, the ordering of the rulers and the ruled is often reversed. In this way, the lower classes grow large and society begins to cater to the lowest common denominator. In a democracy, men act more like boys, teachers fear their students, and the battle of the sexes finally commences. A democratic man is often consumed by his desires and he assigns equality to everyone regardless of merit or deed. After democracy crumbles, tyranny emerges from combining a desire for freedom and a lack of discipline. In this regime there are no remnants of civic virtue and power is seized for the purpose of maintaining order. A tyrant is the worst type of man and he is completely unjust. Naturally, he is also the man who leads the worst type of regime. The tyrant is eros incarnate. For a real life example, it\u2019s quite possible that this character type has some Trump-like qualities. Considering the state of our current political spectrum, I think we may have something important to learn from Plato\u2019s Republic. If nothing else, we could certainly benefit from a discussion about the good at a time when everything seems so relative\u2026 or democratic? ",

            "answer_text": "Plato\u2019s Republic is the single most important work in the canon of Western philosophy. It investigates the nature of justice. Many of Plato\u2019s answers are wrong, as Plato later admits implicitly in his last dialogue, the Laws, but Plato asks all the big questions that will animate the Western philosophical tradition, and this is an extraordinary achievement. In the first book, an old man, Cephalus, exits, bequeathing the argument to his self confident young son, Polemarchus. Plato\u2019s point is that all later readers, you and I, are the heirs of the argument. Plato was writing in the ruins of a defeated Athens that lost the Peloponnesian war to the Spartans. He was concerned with how such a disaster was possible and how to avoid such a fate in the future. His core claim is that societies and individual men only can conduct their affairs well and justly if they know what they are doing. He believes that Athens was destroyed by its own politicians, who were culpably arrogant, ignorant, foolish and unjust. He thinks that no individual or society can prosper in any endeavor unless guided by reason and knowledge. How does the idea of amateur brain surgery sound? If a brain surgeon is deficient in reason or in the knowledge of brain surgery the patient is doomed. Plato thinks that government cannot prosper and achieve justice while the people who rule do not know what they are doing and the people that know what they are doing do not rule. Politics requires rationality and knowledge even more than medicine does. Looking back on the rapacious halfwits who led Athens to self destruction and the gullible nitwits that voted them into power, Plato was writing the Republic in a white hot rage against the clowns, like Alcibiades and Cleon, that destroyed his home town.

That said if you care about the history of ideas it is quite important. It is the first extended discussion of political philosophy, and was written by one of the most important thinkers of all time. Some have argued, only half in jest, that Plato had the first idea, Aristotle the second, and the rest of us have been endlessly repeating versions of those ideas ever since. You can read an extensive discussion of the historical influence that one work has had at wikipedia so I won\u2019t repeat it here. Just keep in mind that the idea of a philosopher-king can be argued at work in today\u2019s Iran (the Grand Ayatollah), Tibet under the Dalai Lamas (before the Chinese takeover), or any other government with brainacs in control, supposedly for the common good. Keep in mind that the man arguing for a philosopher-king was a philosopher; perhaps not a coincidence. ",

Not laughable mind you, but when he is constructing an argument by way of \"yes\" or \"no\", closed questions, you can see his debater's minds change to favor his ideas, or why their own might be wrong. He builds his argument one step at a time, using their own, now changed views, against their original position; in the end they realize their reasons for having that position were based on a false premise at the outset.  The book, for obvious reasons, doesn't mention his failures either. But, what propaganda (good or bad) does?  Propaganda is often used in the pejorative, but that's not the whole story. ",
