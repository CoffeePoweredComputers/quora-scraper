            "answer_text": "Socrates is the individual responsible for starting the Aristotelian\u2014Platonic debate that has persisted into the modern age. The following explanation is very simplified and deserves a deeper investigation if you are truly interested in the matter; that said, here is a primitive survey: Socrates reasoned that \u201cbeing\u201d either descends from an exalted, heavenly like place, or it comes from material experience. Plato advanced the former position and Aristotle advanced the latter position. Both schools of thought have informed modern views on math and physics, yet Socrates himself seems to have remained agnostic toward either. In this way, one might argue that Socrates was a pure philosopher in the sense that he could infer that there seemed to exist this dichotomy but was not necessarily given to one view or the other. ",
