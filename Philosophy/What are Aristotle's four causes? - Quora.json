            "answer_text": "There are actually five causes according to Aristotle: 1. The material cause - answers the question, \"What is it made of?\"2. The formal cause - answers the question, \"What is it?\"3. The efficient cause - answers the question, \"Where did it come from? or What is it's origin?\"4.  The final cause - answers the question, \"What is it for?  Why does it exist?\"5.  The exemplary cause - answers the question, \"Upon what model was it made?\" An example:  A statue of Christ.  Material cause = wood. Formal cause = it's figura/figure, Christ.  Efficient Cause = where it came from = the artist who made it.Final Cause = Artistic expression - manifestation of the spiritual life of man (external finality) - perfection of the artist's craft (interior finality and fruit of the artistic process)Exemplary Cause = The model upon which the statue was made = the artist's idea.  The model the artist uses is always his own idea, even when imitating other works or nature itself, otherwise it is just a copy and not art. The causes get much more interesting when you try to look at other kinds of realities.  For example, strictly physical realities: a stone. Material cause and Formal cause are tied together in what Aristotle will call Matter-Nature and Form-Nature which together are the nature principle (physis).  Neither the form nor the matter of physical realities is absolute - nothing can exist without a determination or form, and a determination cannot be physical without matter.  Matter is the capacity of a physical reality to be transformed, the form of a physical reality is its capacity to give a determination or transform.  So a stone, if you take it as a mixture of the four elements (Aristotle will agree with the natural - philosophical - elements of fire, air, water, earth from antiquity), is mostly earth, giving it the characteristic movement of \"downwards.\"  But the matter which is stone also allows it to be transformed by the other elements, albeit more gradually than less compact earth. So what is the origin, or where does the stone come from?  The efficient cause in this case is the movement of nature itself - physical realities are moved, without talking about any movement that began physical movement - at the level of nature, the efficient cause is a movement \"ad unum,\" which means that all of the physical world contains the same movement. What is the stone for?  What is the final cause of the stone?  Aristotle will say that in the Natural world, in the physical world, no finality appears - the only thing that gives purpose or end to a stone is therefore life and ultimately man. The exemplary cause of the stone turns out to be more of a Theological question if you are willing to consider the ideas of the Creator. Other perspectives to try with the five causes - Living beings, and \"being\" itself ",

            "answer_text": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes   Aristotle held that there were four kinds of causes:[2] A thing's material cause is the material of which it consists. (For a table, that might be wood; for a statue, that might be bronze or marble.)A thing's formal cause is its form, i.e. the arrangement of that matter.A thing's efficient or moving cause[4] is \"the primary source of the change or rest.\" An efficient cause of x can be present even if x is never actually produced and so should not be confused with a sufficient cause.[5] (Aristotle argues that, for a table, this would be the art of table-making, which is the principle guiding its creation.)[2]A thing's final cause is its aim or purpose. That for the sake of which a thing is what it is. (For a seed, it might be an adult plant. For a sailboat, it might be sailing. For a ball at the top of a ramp, it might be coming to rest at the bottom.)",
