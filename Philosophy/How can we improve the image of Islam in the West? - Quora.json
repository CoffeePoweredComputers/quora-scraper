            "answer_text": "We need to acknowledge that there is not one \u201cideal model\u201d of western value for example secularism\u2014whether it is defined by the Anglo-Saxon liberalism, stressing religious freedom; or by the French republican \u201cla\u00efcit\u00e9,\u201d imposing emancipation from religion as a condition of modernity. It is possible to identify different genealogies of the secular, its cultural interpretations and habitations in the nonwestern contexts. Turkey and India provide two compelling cases of alternative formations of the secular: Turkish secularism is the product of a nation-building process, whereas Indian secularism emerged in the course of decolonization. In Turkey, secularism became the vector of westernization and homogenization of a national culture that marked the transition from a multireligious, multiethnic Ottoman Empire. So what type of secularism ideology are we talking about? ",

West stands for liberty , equality , freedom of religion and freedom of speech. Muslims should adapt the values of the host country and integrate with culture of the West. ",
