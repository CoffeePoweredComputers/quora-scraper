            "answer_text": "Yes and no! Quantum theory is built on vector spaces, which are basically sets with (two) operations defined over them (which also satisfy certain axioms). However, we also know that classical theory is a limiting case of quantum theory and the space of states in a classical theory is purely a set -- the phase space.I've briefly discussed it here before: What is quantum mechanics?
