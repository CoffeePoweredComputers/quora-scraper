            "answer_text": "Morality implies right and wrong. And right and wrong imply standards by which actions are categorized. It also implies teleology to actions. That is, all actions have an end or a purpose in mind. Western cultural morality evolved from Judeo-Christian culture and history. The standards by which actions are judged evolved in the stories of God\u2019s interactions with His chosen people, most forcefully in the 10 Comandments.

Nonmoral actions or events: those areas of interest where moral categories cannot be applied. ... such a kind as to be evil, sinful, or wrong according to some code or theory of ethics. Lander University P.S. Don't put to much into play with the term sinful because this Biblical term suggests that an evil or sinful act of God is all that can save us from the said same. ",
