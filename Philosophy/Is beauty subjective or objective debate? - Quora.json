            "answer_text": "It is both. There is truth in the claim that people who have symmetrical faces are generally considered more attractive. For example, this guy\u2019s face is not symmetrical:  Rather than Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s recommended facial proportions, where the height of the forehead is the same distance as the length of the nose and the same distance as the space between the bottom of the nose and the chin, this guy has an upper lip that is too long and a nose that is too short. His forehead is too narrow for its height, it is bulbous and his ears protrude. The distance between his nose and his chin is way too long. He is ugly, by any objective measure. There is a commonly used concept of the \u2018golden ratio\u2019, based on the idea that all beauty is mathematical. This concept is mentioned frequently in spurious articles on \u2018perfectly\u2019 proportioned faces. This is an example of an allegedly \u2018perfect\u2019 face constructed on the mathematical model of the \u2018golden principle\u2019:  Is her face perfect? I think people would have different opinions. In real life, the golden ratio doesn\u2019t work with anything really. It is a made-up idea that has somehow gained a following. Nothing in nature fits this mathematical formula in its dimensions because it is an irrational number. Just as nothing in nature is a perfect circle, so nothing in nature fits the golden ratio perfectly. While proportion and symmetry are certainly a component in physical beauty, a person does not need to meet a mathematical formula to be beautiful. Nature is notoriously slightly asymmetrical in most things, yet many of those things are beautiful. An appealing personality can totally transform the way we think of a person\u2019s attractiveness. A \u2018perfect\u2019 looking person, with no personality, soon becomes about as appealing as a department store dummy.
