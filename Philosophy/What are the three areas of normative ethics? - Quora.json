            "answer_text": "Wikipedia: 1) Utilitarianism \u2013 \u201can ethical theory that states that the best action is one that utility. Utility is defined in various ways, usually in terms of the wellbeing of sentient entities such as human beings and other animals\u201d. 2) Kant ethics \u2013 revolve \u201centirely around duty rather than emotions or end goals. All actions are performed in accordance with some underlying maxim\u2026\u201d Maxims are ground rules. 3) \u201cForms of contractualism\u201d \u2013 establishes rights of state over individualism. \u201cSocial contract argument typically posits that individuals have consented\u201d. Normative ethics appears to break down like this. If it came down to implementing the deaths of ten innocents to save the one innocent that you are devoutly dedicated to, it would be judged three different ways. Utility says save the ten. Kant says we need ground rules that derive the concept of duty before we can assess the scenario. Contractualizm says that you are agreeing to let the governing social contract tell you what to do.
