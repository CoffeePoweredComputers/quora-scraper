            "answer_text": "I have always looked at thought as a crafting tool, like a chisel and hammer, with which we work upon and chip away our observations and carve them into forms and images. We then store the chiselled images \u2013 our conclusions \u2013 in our memory. In another analogy, though is like our paintbrush and paint, with which we can become artists and paint pictures. Now, what do we chisel? What do we carve? What sort of paintings can we paint? You will say \u201canything\u201d. But have you ever seen a painter who can paint anything? No, he never does it. He only paints those types which we has learnt and with which he is acquainted to. One could be a contemporary artist, or traditional artist, or artist of any one or a few kinds. If the chisel and hammer, or the paintbrush and paint is likened to thinking, what thought works upon and can produce can be likened to the painting. In other words, rational thought or any thought can exist without language. Language is merely a verbalised version of thought and always limited. Those we have studied occultism will know that thoughts do not need a language. They are forms (called thought-forms) whereas language is physical in nature. All our communication (and thought) after death is in this non-language form. ",

            "answer_text": "This question belongs to the large class of \u201cPhilosophy of the Mind questions that can be trivially answered by having a baby\u201d. Caring for a new consciousness that is boot strapping itself up from nothing is an amazingly instructive process. Before language is even the remotest possibility you will have watched a mind acquire skills that you didn\u2019t even realize were skills, because you have no memory of the 6 or 12 or 18 months you spent without them. Before language, there is not only rational thought, there is plenty of communication. This is my daughter when she was 10 months. New video by Ben Curthoys That point and squeak might not communicate much to you but it meant enough to us that it was sometimes possible to forget that she couldn\u2019t talk. Language isn\u2019t an on or off thing, and as a person acquires language there are many stops along the way. Babies are not irrational, and they are not stupid. They just have a lot to learn, and a lot to fear. Being terrified by being left on your own for 2 minutes in a quiet room might not seem rational to you, for example, but it\u2019s a perfectly rational response for a newborn. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Anyone with pets can see other animals think and make decisions. When they must, they weigh the pros and cons of one option over another. But their weighing isn\u2019t like asking, \u201cWhich is better?\u201d They weigh their memories and feelings. They may decide based on what \u201cfeels\u201d right but there\u2019s more that goes into building that feeling than just emotion. Language allows more nuanced rational thought. An animal is likely to be wary of another who hurt them last time. As humans words allow us to distinguish one reason for hurt from another. We can separate \u201calways is nasty\u201d from \u201cnasty because I was nasty\u201d from \u201cnasty because they\u2019re hurting.\u201d That isn\u2019t the best example since some bright animals could make that distinction. It\u2019s just that words allow us to break things down into fine categories and see connection between ideas that aren\u2019t possible without words to make those subtle distinctions. ",

Language is not required here. ",

Many instincts &/or feelings may be justifiable from a rationalist perspective but without being able to put them into words how can you really know they are justifiable or not? Feelings can misguide you no matter how deeply they are felt. Even feelings of love which can also be misguided. ",
