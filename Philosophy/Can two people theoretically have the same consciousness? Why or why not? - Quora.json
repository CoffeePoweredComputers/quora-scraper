            "answer_text": "Many people will come along and state we are all \u201cOne\u201d consciousness, we are all one, etc. duality is an illusion, separation is an illusion. But on what basis, how do they indefinitely know this? Because they had an experience of pure awareness and now they believe this pure awareness is of the whole? Perhaps, but that\u2019s one experience in the bucket of 7 Billion +. I have no doubt we are all interconnected, but all one being, in separate bodies seems to me to be a bit delusional. Consciousness is a requirement of life, to know that you are alive and aware, it\u2019s a necessary attribute of life, therefore it can be called Life Energy, we each as human beings definitely have this Life energy, it\u2019s needed the same way fuel is needed to run a car. Does this oneness mean we are all pumping gas at the same gas station? If so, then they are making a killing!! But we all know your gas in your vehicle is not the gas in mine. So why would we conclude it\u2019s one in the same? If it was then when the dream ends for one, it\u2019s must end for all. Many people have claimed to awaken from the \u201cdream\u201d but for some reason the dream is still going... Therefore it\u2019s impossible for us to all be one consciousness. Parts of one overall consciousness, however is a possibility and the more likely scenario. Therefore we are not all one in the sense that we share the exact same consciousness. Nor is it possible for us to. But then again, I\u2019m just a human speaking with human logic, perhaps my consciousness of nothingness has a logic that is beyond my understanding\u2026 I\u2019ve been there, nothingness has no logic, only awareness of nothingness, therefore something must exist beyond it, beyong the individual, beyond the collective, beyond the universe.

            "answer_text": "It is necessary to differentiate in 'consciousness' the container and the content. The container is rigorously specific to the person: a brain cabled neurologically in a unique pattern, waking up and falling asleep at its own moments. To share this container between two people, it would be necessary to connect their neural networks and let them build a common organization. The content is conceptual. These are hierarchical levels of organization of the information present in the individual environment. Here again, the conscious final synthesis is rigorously specific to the person. This synthesis is even so evolutionary that each of our mental states is a different consciousness. We are not exactly the same person as an hour ago, let alone a year ago, let alone a decade ago. What connects us to our past selves and other consciousnesses are particular, shared conceptual elements that build a common vision of the world. A multitude of angles around an objectively inaccessible world. And among this crowd of conscious states flitting around the essence of reality is the sequence of yours, perpetually in motion, which temporarily resembles that of another person, which makes you feel this impression of proximity with she.

No two people could have the same consciousness as even the closest physiological similarities and proximity still allow for different experiences. Even if you accept mind reading one still has the distinct awareness of initiating the process. But, is \u201cconsciousness \u201c a purely electro-chemical process? Then, perhaps, two or more could be as similar as individual units on a production line. Still not quite identical. Is someone with multiple personalities sharing a single consciousness or does each manifestation have its own? Define \u201cconsciousness \u201c and then we\u2019ll have a start on how and what to seek for an answer. ",

If they can, why is it difficult to believe that consciousness is also shared? Is consciousness an object that belongs to any human? Oxygen, sunlight and water are all inert objects and they can be shared, but what about something that is not an object? Consciousness is a mysterious luminosity that is doing all the observations and it is utterly impossible to sneak behind consciousness and observe it as an object and that is precisely why nobody can grasp it or recognize it. The eye can see everything but itself. The most powerful camera cannot take a shot of itself. The most powerful telescope that can observe a super nova cannot observe itself. Consciousness is the eternal subject and so it can never observe itself or know itself. It can only BE ITSELF. ",

We know how neurons work, we know what different parts of the brain do, but we just don't know how it creates consciousness. We've never been able to isolate a part of the brain that does it, but obviously it does since brain damage can cause people to lose consciousness. But given the 100 billion neurons in the average brain, it's statistically unlikely that any two people on Earth would have the same neural network, let alone consciousness. ",

It's likely a sign of a deep misunderstanding of our universe(s)\u2026 Reality is really weird, and the fact the our most direct experiences don't fit our theories suggest that our theories will turn out to be wrong. As a 35yo man who has taken the normal developmental path through adolescent atheism, agnosticism, and eventual open-minded confusion and theological fuzz, this big conceptual hole in the universe is where I think the religious people may turn out to be on to something. We'll see, or not. ",
