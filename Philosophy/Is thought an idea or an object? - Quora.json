            "answer_text": " It is no longer a secret that existence of a brain cloud of neurons (nerve cell) is experienced as a \u201cthought\u201d. Neurons are fine objects and so the neuronal brain cloud may be described as a \u201cspectral reality\u201d. So, thought is sensing of a spectral object. You have to keep in mind that \u201creality\u201d is sensed epistemically as a subjective \u201cfeeling\u201d. So, we have to be careful about inadvertent mistaking of the reality for its epistemic sensing. For example, \u201cthought\u201d is the epistemic sensing, the subjective feeling about the reality called \u201cneuronal brain cloud\u201d. So, to be accurate in our speech, we can\u2019t say that \u201cthought\u201d is an \u201cobject\u201d. It is an \u201cidea\u201d. The seat of thought, that is, the seat of idea, is the aforesaid neuronal brain cloud, a spectral reality. ",

            "answer_text": "Thought - an idea or opinion produced by thinking, or occurring suddenly in the mind.\"Maggie had a sudden thought\"synonyms:idea, notion, line of thinking, belief, concept, conception, conviction, opinion, view, impression, image, perception, mental picture; More2.the action or process of thinking.Thought encompasses \u201cgoal oriented flow of ideas and associations that leads to reality-oriented conclusion.\u201d[1] Although thinking is an activity of an existential value for humans, there is no consensus as to how it is defined or understood. Because thought underlies many human actions and interactions, understanding its physical and metaphysical origins, processes, and effects has been a longstanding goal of many academic disciplines including linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, artificial intelligence, biology, sociology and cognitive science. Thinking allows humans to make sense or, interpret, represent or model the world they experience, and to make predictions about that world. It is therefore helpful to an organism with needs, objectives, and desires as it makes plans or otherwise attempts to accomplish those goals. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought#Theories Listen to this article (info/dl) MENU 0:00  This audio file was created from a revision of the article \"Thought\" dated 2010-12-04, and does not reflect subsequent edits to the article.
