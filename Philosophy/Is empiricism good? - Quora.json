            "answer_text": "This is not a well-formulated question - it\u2019s hard to know exactly what you\u2019re asking. For anything x to be \u2018good\u2019 one first has to define what he/she means by good. For example, if we take the good as a normative concept relating to ethics and metaethics (as in x is good so it \u2018should\u2019 or \u2018ought to be\u2019 practiced) this is different from looking at \u2018good\u2019 in a practical or pragmatic sense. When we ask about tasks and what is good in a delimited practical framework, such as a game, e.g. in chess it is \u2018good\u2019 to take the pieces of your opponent off the board and bad to get checkmated but there is no ethical violation involved in not playing by those rules: but you will simply be a bad chess player if you constantly end up in mate. Finally, from the perspective of general axiology or value theory, we can say that x is good because x is valuable, useful, significant to some person-group, etc. Thus, when you ask \u201cis empiricism good\u201d, it\u2019s difficult to know what sense of \u2018good\u2019 you are asking about. In any case, that said, here\u2019s my two-cents on this matter: If the question is meant in an ethical sense, it\u2019s hard to say that empiricism is ethically good in and of itself. Empiricism is usually taken to be an epistemological position relating to how humans attain knowledge (in the sense that an empiricist believes that all knowledge is attained after experience as opposed to rationalists or mystics who believe that important truths or knowledge claims can be attained independent of sense experience). Empiricism says little about what we do with that knowledge. On the other hand, if the sense of the question is whether empiricism is good in a practical sense, then empiricism might be said to be good or bad depending on context. For example empiricism might- as a method- be good for learning truths about the natural world and how it is structured or how objects exist, but probably not as good if you wanted to know strictly formal laws or truths such as found in logical, metaphysical or mathematical theorems. Finally, in an axiological sense of course empiricism is good. Empiricism is the main influence on what we call the scientific method. Science is not only \u2018good\u2019, but I would say, the best method we have for learning about how the world is organized independent of our ideas and feelings about it. So insofar as the attainment of knowledge is good and insofar as it is good to understand the world- yes, empiricism is good. Think of it this way: if we reject all empirical approaches the consequence would most likely be the bad situation of having people rely on either whimsy, authority or strictly a priori concepts and methods for understand the world. These approaches, historically, often led to incorrect and therefore bad models of reality. ",

            "answer_text": "It is neither good nor bad\u2026 it\u2019s just a modern philosophy school led by British thinkers. Empiricism\u2019s main features were expounded in particular by John Locke (our mind is like a blank slate, there\u2019s no knowledge before the experience), George Berkeley (to be is to be perceived), and David Hume (our knowledge comes from habit, it is based in beliefs and not in truths, neither does science hold the truth). It is the theory that claims all knowledge has its main source derived from sense-experience. Stimulated by the rise of experimental science, it developed in the 17th and 18th centuries. Obviously there\u2019s much to know about it, but this may be helpful as general outlook. All the best! ",
