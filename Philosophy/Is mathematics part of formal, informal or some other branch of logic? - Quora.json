            "answer_text": "The problem with your statement is the \u201cis mathematics a part of\u201d. However, this is understandable, since many of the words, expressing the concepts, as we mean them, wasn\u2019t really defined well until about the 1950s (\u201cwell\u201d of course being a subjective term). Let\u2019s unpack this question. There is a subfield of philosophy called rhetoric. There is a subfield of rhetoric called critical thinking (i.e. appeal to rational arguments). There is a subfield of critical thought called deduction. And it is from deductive methods that we get logic. Usually, when logic is approached philosophically, it retains the sentence structure (i.e. it\u2019s informal), but may become formal when discussing the logic of logic (metalogic) in philosophy. On the other hand, there is a subfield of mathematics called logic as well, and it\u2019s entirely the same field of logic as I just described from the philosophical route. The study of logic is built up of formal languages and set/type theory (or higher up to the theory of topoi). Usually, when logic is approached through mathematics, logic is formal and symbolic. Informal logic is done with sentences and applies to scenarios. Formal logic is interchangeable with \u201csymbolic logic\u201d and describes logical situations generally. However, we haven\u2019t even discussed what mathematics is yet. Mathematics is a collection of deductive arguments, starting from definitions that are entirely conceptual (\u20181\u2019 as a number doesn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s just a symbol for something conceptual). When we ask whether or not we can assume a certain hypothesis or definition in mathematics, we are only asking if it\u2019s conceptually consistent (i.e. it doesn\u2019t eventually create some kind of \u201cfalse = true\u201d scenario). At it\u2019s heart, computer science is deduction, but via the application of functions instead of implications and entailment. So, mathematics doesn\u2019t care if something exists in reality, but we scientifically decide whether or not some relationship between phenomena can be described using a particular mathematical definition (i.e. do negative numbers make sense when counting apples? what about money?). Ultimately, the fact that mathematics is this collection of deductive arguments means that it uses logic, not that it IS a branch of logic. It\u2019s the application of formal logic on these deductive arguments. So, the answer is actually no. Mathematics is neither a part of formal or informal logic. However, it makes heavy use of the methods of formal logic. However, this doesn\u2019t change the memeified (tongue-in-cheek) statement from having some kernel of truth to it that \u201cmathematics is applied logic\u201d, since the application of the deductive methods doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a part of deductive methods.
