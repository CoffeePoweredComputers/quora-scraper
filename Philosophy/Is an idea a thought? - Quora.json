            "answer_text": "Yes. Depending on context, a thought can be a kind of idea, or vice versa. They are synonymous. \u201cThought\u201d can mean any instance of conscious mental activity. Or, it can mean a statement of fact, that\u2019s a more complex thing. Similarly, \u201cidea\u201d can be defined simply, as any abstract conception of a real object, like your idea of an apple. Or, it can mean something more complex: a plan of action, like the idea to go to the movies. So, it\u2019s not helpful to use these two words in relation to each other unless you are specific about what you mean. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess that an idea is the culmination or outcome of a thought process. Some ideas work well when applied to reality. Some do not. Some are stillborn, or partly formed, and slide back into decomposition, like a song that is never heard or sung. So, we might consider that thoughts are to ideas as notes are to music; or like stepping stones or facilitators in the composition of ideas. ",
