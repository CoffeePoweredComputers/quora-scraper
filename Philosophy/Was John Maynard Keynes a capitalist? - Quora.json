            "answer_text": "No, Keynes was not a capitalist. He was, though, pro-capitalism. Like many another socialist of his day, he\u2019d come to the realization that socialism would never succeed without a strong core of free enterprise to generate wealth. To him, fascism and communism were doomed, with social democracy representing the only way forward for socialism, and that itself would be possible only if he concocted phoney-baloney rationales for political elites to control the economy rather than the productive class that actually created the wealth. With his scheme, he killed the Marxian dream of the proletariat rising to equality. He also killed the liberal dream of people free to rise according to demonstrated merit. In their place he substituted the age-old stagnant concept that the \u201cright\u201d people, a bourgeois elite, need to be in control of the reins of society. The result, thanks to Keynes, is that most of the countries of the world are in the grip of a parasitic elite long-since harboring delusions of one-world government\u2026 by them, naturally. Keynes was prescient concerning fascism and communism, but we need collectively to drive a stake in the heart of social democracy if we are to unleash the full potential of mankind. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, a sucessful investor and manager Keynes The Money Manager can fairly be called a capitalist because the \u201cism\" in \u201ccapital-ism\u201d is all about the point at which ones money starts working for one. The concept of government working to counterbalance economic cycles was Keynes legacy, and the fact that we still have a financial services industry after 2009 is pretty much because of him, so many capitalists as well as their hangers on (mentioning no names) owe a debt of gratitude. A more Keynesian version of QE might have involved physical infrastructure rather than the financial services infrastructure, but it's basically the same thing, just preferring one class of capitalists over another..
