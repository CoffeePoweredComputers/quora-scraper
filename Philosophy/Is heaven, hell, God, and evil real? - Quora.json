            "answer_text": "Consider Ecclesiastes 3:11 which appears to suggest certain concepts that were built into the DNA of all humans at Creation: \u201cHe has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.\u201c It opens with a reason for hope: that all things, no matter how hopeless, can be given beauty and purpose (an example is the cross - how a symbol of torture and cruelty was transformed into a picture of love and hope). Then, the verse affirms that the idea of life eternal is embedded into the psyche of every individual, both with a fascination of how we began and where we\u2019re headed. Now, consider this fact. Cultures from every continent, through every age from Neanderthal to contemporary, with every people group, mankind has been consumed with rituals that have developed in the hope that a higher power of some sort will give them relief from what they see as an underworld and advance them to a kind of heavenly realm after death on this earth. Such customs have been confirmed through archeology and almost all rituals involve the shedding of blood through sacrifice. IF we are mere creatures that evolved from cosmic gasses and radiation, where does such a moral code come from? Why do all people respond to the idea of good and evil? Even if it is a simple survival response to social survival, why do isolated cultures from distant lands and islands practice rituals that appear to have similar purposes? Why the intrigue about a Creator? An open minded observer would at least be moved to deep consideration of such unseen realities. ",

            "answer_text": "God is the only thing that if you want Him to be real, will become real. And also the opposite. Evil? Distinguish the difference between \u201cevil itself\u201d (independent of man) and the \u201c human experience of evil\u201d. Only the experience of evil is real. Not evil itself. There would be no evil is there wasn't someone to experience it. \u201cEvil itself\u201d, exists as a concept, an idea, not as an object. About heaven and hell, if you refer to the after dead story, it's just a question of believing. We can have no proof. If you refer to a state of mind (\u201cfeels like heaven\u201d or \u201cfeels like hell\u201d), then it's the same answer as with \u201cevil\u201d: they only exist as human experience, not as an independent object (but yes as an independent concept).
