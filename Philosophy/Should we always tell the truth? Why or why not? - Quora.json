Tell him the truth that you spent some of your quality time for him by creating a marvelous picture.With or without software,It doesn\u2019t matter as far as you have spent your time,imagination and creativity for your favorite teacher. He will even forget that as time pass by\u2026but the appreciation which he will give you at the time of revealing that you are the one that created it will last forever. Do it only if you want to be appreciated /acknowledged by your teacher for your work. Better sign the picture next time you present one to your loved one.. Adieus\u2026!!!! ",

There are many people who believe we will never forget them still will lost the memories made with them ",
