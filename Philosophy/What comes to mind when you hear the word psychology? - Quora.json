            "answer_text": "I would have to say I think of my dad when I hear the word psychology. In college, he majored in psychology and let\u2019s just say he didn\u2019t follow through with it. After four years of schooling, he was done with it and knew it wasn\u2019t the right job for him. He studied into drugs and alcohol and it left him wary of the fact if he could truly help his future clients. With learning such a harsh subject it made him realize how many people who are prone to drugs or alcohol have/are using it to numb themselves and that it\u2019s really tough to change some of their minds. He decided that it would hurt him too much to see so many people which he knew he wouldn\u2019t always be able to help. So, he went into the career of fishing. He isn\u2019t a fisher anymore, but he has told me it was a very rough job. The difference between the two was that he felt tired and fatigued very often when fishing but as a psychiatrist he would\u2019ve felt emotional drained. He made his choice between the two and he was happy with the one he made. He supports me in any ambition I have towards psychology though. He just reminds me to not go into drugs and alcohol which I will gladly do so! ",

            "answer_text": "As I read or hear the word \u201cpsychology\u201d, my mind immediately goes to Pavlov and his dog; in other words,\u201cclassical conditioning\u201d. What is classical conditioning? It's when you pair a neutral stimulus with a natural, response-triggering stimulus. Over time, and after several exposures, the neutral stimulus starts triggering, alone, that same response. Pavlov rang a bell before presenting a meal to his dog. Over time, the dog learned to associate the ringing of the bell with the meal; so salivation (the response normally triggered by the sight of the meal) is now triggered merely by the ringing of the bell. It's an interesting type of learning that immediately comes to my mind at the mention of \u201cpsychology\u201d.  Source: Google images. ",
