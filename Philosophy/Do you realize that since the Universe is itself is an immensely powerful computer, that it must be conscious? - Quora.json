            "answer_text": "Q: Do you realize that since the Universe is itself is an immensely powerful computer, that it must be conscious? I think I know where you\u2019re coming from, but that\u2019s still a bit of a nonsense on several levels. The universe may or may not be a computer (like the Earth is in Douglas Adam\u2019s book), a device employed for computation. It\u2019s basically a religious claim. Do you have evidence? Until you show some, I\u2019m skeptical of your claim. Yes, all, well, let\u2019s be pedantic and say most, systems with behaviors obeying rules (e.g. natural laws) can be thought of in terms of computation. Rocks falling down obey rules, and can be thought of as computational elements, and under specific circumstances they can actually do computation. But that doesn\u2019t make them a computer. There\u2019s a vague equivalence, and some people promote this to a metaphysical position of algorithmic idealism, but that\u2019s more of an opinion. Not everything that does some computation is a computer. Rain falling down can be viewed as doing addition. But that doesn\u2019t make it a computer. A calculator does computation, but it\u2019s not a computer. The universe can be thought of as a giant heap of calculators. Still not a computer. Nor does computational capacity automatically create consciousness. The sum of all computers on the internet have a computational power far exceeding what\u2019s needed for consciousness, yet it\u2019s not conscious (as far as anyone can tell, you could claim it does, and it would also be merely a claim, less religious, because it\u2019s more testable). On the other hand, considering that a human is considered conscious, even though only a small portion produces consciousness (e.g. you\u2019re equally conscious if your limbs are amputated). With a bit of a stretch it could be said that a single human surviving in the universe would make the entire universe conscious. The stars and galaxies contributing as much as fingernails or hair to the consciousness. With that in mind, the universe may have a multiple personality disorder, and with all the asylums, it\u2019s insane too, and very confused. The idea isn\u2019t new, and if you had not stated it as a fact, it would merely be \u201cnot a new idea\u201d. The way you phrased it, it\u2019s religion. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the universe COULD be a computer and whether it is or not, it COULD be conscious, but I doubt you have the data to justify claiming it IS one. Equally, the universe COULD be simulated, or it COULD be thought into existence by an \u201centity\u201d, or it COULD be a \u201cphysical\u201d system. Occam favours the last one. But, it\u2019s not possible to distinguish between those possibilities. They behave identically. What\u2019s worse, well, look at solipsism. ",

            "answer_text": "Do you realize that since the Universe is itself is an immensely powerful computer, that it must be conscious? Hi Adrian. I can see some parallels between the universe and a computer but I am not getting anywhere near a direct equivalency. Thanks for asking but I\u2019m not getting the realization. Must is one of those words that raises a red flag for me. The word must is often traded as a substitute for a reasonable explanation. All the power in the entire universe is a lot of power but not impressive enough to jump to this conclusion. From your profile; \u201cI decided that the quantum computer that is the Universe, while based on consciousness, is actually based on billions of separate consciousness whose humanlike characteristics are distributed along the Normal Curve. Their thoughts, memories, and feelings fill the entire Universe around us the same way Radio and Television waves do. But at the quantum level, an electromagnetic spectrum of extremely high frequencies.We just need the equivalents of antennas and tuners to read them and this is the way the Hindus found their Gods; Greeks found theirs; Siddhartha became the Buddha: Aristotle trained Alexander; Plato wrote the Republic; Zoroaster found Ahura Mazda; Moses found Jehova; Jesus found the Trinity; Mohammad found Allah; Einstein discovered Relativity in 1915; Tesla discovered the modern global electrical system based on alternating current at 60 Hz; Maxwell discovered his equations; Beethoven found his ninth symphony.\u201d I would be interested in hearing more about how humans starting to investigate the quantum scale makes the universe a computer. The humanlike part and the based on consciousness part too. I\u2019m only finding consciousness in living beings. My biggest stumbling block are human thoughts memories and feelings transmitting at what voltage, amperage, and frequencies. I can appreciate your wanting to equate the Vedas, Bible, Koran, Greek mythology, and the Pali Canon in a sociological sense but the sciences of Einstein Tesla and Maxwell don\u2019t really translate as sociology to me. I hope this answer is in any way useful to you. ",

            "answer_text": "Friends, It is ancient saying that what is ablove is below and PINDE SO BRAHMANDE(what is a man is,is universe). If you view a man-microsome-you also begin to view universe-macrosome-and vice a versa. A man is stuffed of different forms of three different forms of energy,namely,physical energy-physical body,psychic energy-psychic body and conscious energy-conscious body. Conscious body is manifested as one's own consciousness,that is,one is conscious to one own self,also called self consciousness only evolved in a man out of all living creatures. Universe as macrosome is nothing but gigantic replica of a man or a man is miniature construct of universe. Outer most of universe is physical body,formed out of all forms of physical energy,known or to be known,which are perceived by senses. Next is psychic body of universe,consists of different forms of psychic energy like thoughts,memories etc.and none of these forms is perceivable by senses and neither fulfill to be tagged as scientific. Inner most is conscious body of universe which is conscious energy and is being manifested as self consciousness,as exactly as,a man is conscious to his own existence. In context to space dimension,inner one,conscious body-consciousness-is omnipresent and it embraces both psychic body and physical body. If you look at order of creation,both in case of universe and embryo in mother womb,you will find excellent and intelligent intrinsic order which can be a good analogy with computer. Thanks Q guru ",

Whether the universe thinks in the same manner as we do, by using words or pictures to demarcate its own unfolding to itself, or whether all of its many possibilities are spread our across what we call time (much like a move, frame by frame of celluloid) who is to know? Definitely not us. We perceive thought to be sequential, but what if it is actually simultaneous in a potential that we are incapable of envisioning except as that which is unknowable. We need to accept our place in this schemata and quit trying to quantify our responsibility to ourselves by conjecture that is not relevant to us. ",

These are \u2018real\u2019 time, which equates to the present, giving us continuous updates on environment and circumstances. \u2018unreal\u2019 time, the past, allows access to the database of our knowledge via memory. and \u2018imaginary\u2019 time, the future, collating information from the others to arrive at thoughts or solutions.
