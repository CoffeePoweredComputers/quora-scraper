            "answer_text": "\u201cIs a bad government better than no government at all?\u201d I\u2019ll let Prof. Robert Higgs answer that question: \u201cAnarchists did not try to carry out genocide against the Armenians in Turkey; they did not deliberately starve millions of Ukrainians; they did not create a system of death camps to kill Jews, gypsies, and Slavs in Europe; they did not fire-bomb scores of large German and Japanese cities and drop nuclear bombs on two of them; they did not carry out a \u2018Great Leap Forward\u2019 that killed scores of millions of Chinese; they did not attempt to kill everybody with any appreciable education in Cambodia; they did not launch one aggressive war after another; they did not implement trade sanctions that killed perhaps 500,000 Iraqi children. In debates between anarchists and statists, the burden of proof clearly should rest on those who place their trust in the state. Anarchy\u2019s mayhem is wholly conjectural; the state\u2019s mayhem is undeniably, factually horrendous.\u201d \u2015 Robert Higgs And a talk of his, if you need further enlightenment:  The state is, at best, an unnecessary evil. At worst, an intolerable one. The Anarchists are right in everything; in the negation of the existing order and in the assertion that, without Authority there could not be worse violence than that of Authority under existing conditions. They are mistaken only in thinking that anarchy can be instituted by a violent revolution. But it will be instituted only by there being more and more people who do not require the protection of governmental power and by there being more and more people who will be ashamed of applying this power. \u2014- Leo Tolstoy On Anarchy ",

            "answer_text": "bad government is an oxymoron. We\u2019ve never really tried no government, but we\u2019ve tried government for thousands of years, and through all that time, government has been a failure one experiment after another. Maybe we should try Anarchy, at least give it a chance. If a man can\u2019t be trusted to govern himself, how can he be trusted to govern others? Basically I\u2019m saying that if you think people can\u2019t govern themselves because mankind is inherently evil, then how does allowing evil men to govern others make any sense? ",
