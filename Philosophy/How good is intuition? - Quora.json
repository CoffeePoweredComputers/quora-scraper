            "answer_text": "Intuition is seeing with the soul. Our intuition knows what is best for us long before our head has figured it out. Intuition has power to sense things long before our rational mind. It is kind of learning & coaching from within. It is the voice of higher power within. When we practice Spirituality or Morality we awaken the power of intuition within us more & more. Great intuition doesn't come so easily. For that we have to have good subconscious mind. Subconscious mind plays big role in our intuition. We need to feed right knowledge & wisdom in our subconscious mind to attain developed intuition. Intuition is not fixed. It changes as we learn different things on our journey in life. Steve Jobs also said that : \u201c Trust your intuition, everything else is secondary. \u201c It is always good to check with our rational intelligence the callings of intuition. Good head + Good Intuition makes an awesome combination. Feed the good & starve the bad for more developed intuition & harness the power of intuition. It is easy to say but hard to practice, but we have to pay the price for something incredible. It is worth it. Pure conscience or pure intuition is a continual joy or continuous celebration or continuous christmas or any grand happy festival. Pure conscience is heaven it self. Pure conscience is heaven on earth itself. Thanks. ",
