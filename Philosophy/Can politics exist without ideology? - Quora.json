            "answer_text": "The closest to non-ideological politics is the so-called post-left movement. They broadly level withering critique against ideologies across the entire political spectrum. The movement broadly considers itself a rejection of specific ideology. However, the key to understanding this is the word \u201cspecific\u201d. There is no politics that lacks ideology, and anyone who claims to reject ideology is either lying or they're misinformed. To understand this, one first needs to find a functional definition of ideology. We can think of this as a set of normative principles that one holds; this can be in relation to political structures, economic structures, epistemological structures, religion; even the creation of artificial intelligence. In essence, any comprehensive set of views on how some aspect of life should be organized is an ideology. We should also define politics. Politics is the process by which human beings make decisions that affect all the members of a group; this group could be as broad as the citizenry of the United States, or as narrow as the faculty of the philosophy department in a community college. People in positions of power make choices that alter the lives of people who they have power over. For example, if the President of a company decides that the company is going to outsource production instead of operate its own factories, that influences the lives of the factory workers employed to that company. If the UN decides to create a binding legal document whereby member states cannot build nuclear weapons, with penalty of sanctions for their production, it affects countries who want nuclear weapons, but don\u2019t want to face economic sanctions. So if we are to define a combination the terms \u201cpolitics\u201d and \u201cideology\u201d (that is, \u201cpolitical ideology\u201d) then the definition would approximately be the following: Political ideology is the normative values and principles one holds, in the sphere of life in which individuals make decisions that are binding upon all members of a certain group. A politician, or somebody who makes binding decisions in the sphere of life that we call \u201cthe state\u201d will always make those decisions based of off their ideal view of the world - the normative principles they hold about how the world should be. If they weren\u2019t making decisions based off of how they think the world should be, then why would they make the decisions they make? One improbable answer to that question could be that they make their decisions based off pure chance. But, if they all flipped a coin when choosing whether to vote yes or no on a piece of legislation, or whether to start a war, then the complex structures of the state would fall into disarray and cease to exist, until people built new ones based on their own utopian views. If a politician does things for the sole purpose of keeping their constituents (the people whose lives they affect directly) pacified, for the purpose of quelling discontent that would lead to their removal from power, then they\u2019re merely acting on an ideology that isn\u2019t their own. The popular ideology of the group of people is what really makes the decisions. If a politican is seen as a pragmatist rather than an ideologue, then their political ideology is \u201cpragmatism\u201d; this doesn\u2019t mean that they don't hold an ideology. If a politician\u2019s beliefs don't fall into traditional categories, then their ideology is personal. Instead of subscribing wholeheartedly to a popular ideology, they\u2019ve created their own, or synethsized several ideologies and generated a new one from their combination. But, again, they're still ideological. Now, we return to the post-Left. It\u2019s ideological. But it comes closest to non-ideology because it basically breaks down the labels between different left-wing ideologies and tries to unify the good ideas found in each one, without building a doctrinal framework of its own. Most ideologies have complex, doctrinal beliefs at their core. Post-leftism doesn't have a specific doctrine. But it\u2019s still organized around a bunch of specific normative principles. Politics without ideology would lead to the destruction of political structures, and the construction of new ones. Assuming that politicians could ever be sufficiently non-ideological, they would destabilize the systems they are a part of. So, politics without ideology is unsustainable and quite likely impossible because somehow, sometime, ideology is going to make it into the mix. ",

            "answer_text": "Politics and ideology are clearly separable. The idea that politics is a consequence of ideology is, in fact, a feature of a specific class of ideologies. Observe a troop of monkeys. They do have politics - alliances, intrigues, fights for the positions on the social ladder, you name it. But do they have ideology? Clearly not, because they lack language. Conversely, there are ideologies (anarcho-capitalism is the prime example) which consider politics and governments evil, for good reasons. Per Franz Oppenheimer, there are only two ways one can acquire wealth: by economic means (homesteading, production, trade) or by political means (political power, regulatory force, theft, violence, wars, etc). Politics of government power is indistinguishable from large-scale crime. The relationship between ideology and politics is complicated: on one hand, ideology is commonly used as a smokescreen for power grabs by politicians - ideology often serves to legitimize political power and thus reduces resistance of the population to the exercise of this power (from the divine right of kings to the numerological magic of transfiguration of private evil into public \u201cgood\u201d aka \u201cdemocracy\u201d). The dominant ideology allows a tiny minority of rulers to control the masses of their subjects. On the other hand, dominant ideology also determines tolerance of the subjects to specific applications of the political power: in Saudi Arabia most people see nothing wrong in hanging blasphemers by the government, Soviet citizens happily informed on their neighbors when they imagined subversion, and Americans revolted when a tea trade was regulated by the Parliament while apparently ignoring interests of the colonists. Post-WWII ideology became weaponised by CIA and KGB as a major instrument for effecting regime change in other countries. By now propaganda and ideology are nearly indistinguishable. Given the circular interdependency of politcs and ideology, it makes sense to distinguish between ideology and political philosophy, Political philosophy creates ideology and thus shapes elites which then create governments, and then modify and apply their ideology as a tactical weapon. Ideology is secondary, it is purposefully constructed to achieve specific goals. The political philosophy, on the other hand, shapes dominant sets of ideas in the societies in the longer term: the modern epoch is defined by the contention between various forms of socialism and classical liberalism (libertarianism, in the modern American usage).

            "answer_text": "No. Let me clarify that; it may be entirely possible to have a form of politics that has no explicit ideology or in which political actors deny having any ideology, and they may even be sincere, but all this would prove is that these political actors were unaware of their own latent ideology. You see, ideology needn\u2019t take the form of an explicit manifesto, on the contrary, some of the most powerful ideologies are those that pose as mere \u201ccommon sense\u201d. Ideologies are fundamental to our understanding of our place in the world and any notion of how the world works, or should work, how resources are distributed, or what kinds of work we should do, and how, is, a priori, ideological even if we don\u2019t know it. Ideology permeates everything. Take the entertainment industry; surely there\u2019s nothing ideological about a silly comedy or a shoot-em-up action movie\u2026is there? If you take the time to do a discourse analysis, you will quickly realise that there is, indeed, an ideology behind even the most frivolous piece of entertainment, even if the author is unaware of it and vehemently denies it. We all have attitudes, assumptions and beliefs and these form an ideology; the fact that we don\u2019t see it does not mean it isn\u2019t there. Someone attempting to engage in politics without any ideology would simply be fooling themselves and the people. ",

But politics as a study has two areas of interest that aren\u2019t particularly dependent on ideology. The first is political technique, the gaining of power and the keeping of it from the coup d\u2019etat to the modern, excessively polled, media managed election. People do study this just in itself and find things that can be applied to work towards the triumph of any ideology. There are people who take this as their profession from mercenary colonels in the Third World to \u2018professional political operatives\u2019 in the First World. The second are of study is to describe politics in all its variant forms, to catalogue their strengths and weaknesses and only after you do it to, perhaps, make recommendation which are \u2018better\u2019 in some sense. Aristotle started that study and it is still a valid area of academic enquiry that may be of use to law makers and revolutionaries. ",

His views are based on a belief that government is intrinsically unjust, and the idea of justice itself is, again, a matter of ideology. So no, there is no separation of ideology from politics.

Actually, its because the support offered is perversely counterproductive, or life-negating in its impact. i.e. Its decimating the self-esteem and identity of indigenous populations, ans setting up unreasonable expectations, culminating in mental health issues.A central banker deriding \u2018ideology\u2019 in fiscal policy settings, i.e. not spending more money on consumption during the Covid-19 crisis. In fact, its not \u2018ideology\u2019, so much as the opposite, and that is \u2018economic rationalism\u2019. Ideology is \u2018scientific\u2019. This isn\u2019t to say that \u2018ideologues can\u2019t make mistakes\u2019, but its not because of ideology, since ideology is based on science. It can only be because they are not consistent in their application, insofar as they are \u2018not omniscient\u2019. This is how I view the Austrian Economics school suspicion of \u2018Covid-19 spending\u2019 as devoid of context. In fairness, they are economics school, so you might expect them to get this wrong. The same goes for \u2018lay supporters of a better foundation for ideology, namely Objectivists, who tend to spurn \u2018govt spending\u2019. And I agree with this position. But I\u2019d sooner govts bail out a virus-threatened economy than see the collapse of an economy, and all its institutions that protect property rights. This is a context consideration that \u2018gives short term weight to \u2018bail out\u2019, knowing I\u2019d prefer a private bail out, rather than a govt initiated one, but I didn\u2019t set the context.A corporate executive who argues that \u2018they can\u2019t get involved in ideology\u2019 because business is too political. Yes, it is, but then its the type of \u2018political extortion system it is, that makes it \u2018treacherous\u2019.If I was to look at the world for \u2018signs of ideology\u2019. Oh hang on, didn\u2019t some politician express some childhood fascination for Ayn Rand when they were young. This is \u2018virtue signalling\u2019 from the Right politicians. You know they don\u2019t care about principles. No principled person would enter politics, or if so \u2018idealistic\u2019, after one term of having secured their tenure, they will betray it, and they will have a litany of reasons why. They are good reasons. They should have known before entering politics, but they didn\u2019t. They naively thought they could change the system. That one voice would matter. Its a popularity contest. Constituents are not intellectually engaged. It is soul destroying for them. Instead, rather than give up, they give in, and compromise their values. Why? What possible career can you have after politics? ",

The first thing that sprang to my mind was Cold War era Realpolitik, which explicitly reduced international politics to pragmatic, non-ideological constructs. But realpolitik itself is a kind of ideology (albeit a poor one), and the pragmatic, non-ideological actions were all ostensibly done in the name of one national ideology or another. In truth, the only two reasons to engage in politics are to achieve some immediate collective goal or to advance some collective worldview, and only the latter persist over time. So politics always has an intrinsic sense of ideology running through it.  ",

Anarchy, or the alleged euphoric state of Marxism is still an ideology and a political claim of what is and what is not acceptable. The idea of a theocratic rule is, also, an ideological and a political position. ",

Or think, for example, of the competition between states of the USA.  Different states' representatives in congress may each want a big government project located inside their own territory so that their constituents will benefit from the increase in employment opportunities.  The states may play politics against one another without differing in ideology. ",

The non-elites may serve as vote banks under the direction of some elite - like a feudal landlord. Here ideology is not that important.Gradually non-elites would get mobilised. One possibility is that this mobilisation can be based on one or other social identity - like caste, religion, and so on. Here the liking of one\u2019s own identity and the disliking of the other is the mobbing force. Political ideology is not that important here too.The other way of mobilisation of non-elites is on the basis of economic interests. Here people may vote a party based on their class interests. Moreover each party may have ideas on how to create a better or inclusive society. This is where the political ideology becomes important.",
