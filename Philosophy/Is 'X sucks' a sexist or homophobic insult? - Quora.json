            "answer_text": "Is saying \"X sucks\" sexist or inappropriate?  Sometimes it can be inappropriate. When I was a girl, my mother didn't like it when I said something \"sucks\" so it was generally inappropriate for me to use that language at home in her presence. Nowadays it would probably be inappropriate to say \"you suck\" to someone's face or to insult something they care about in front of them. Saying \"men suck\" or \"women suck\" is sexist, but there's nothing sexist about \"X sucks\" if X isn't a sex or gender.   GOD I love it when the details change after I've answered. Is saying \"X sucks\" sexist or homophobic? Is it an insult specifically because it associates fellatio (and thus implied femininity) with being bad? At least it's a better question now. Yeah, the assumption is kind of degrading in that people and things who \"suck\" are worth less than those that don't.  But I haven't seen any activists who think this is a problem. I personally don't find it a big deal but maybe that's because I haven't seen any arguments for it. ",

            "answer_text": "No, not at all. Contrary to popular thought, the phrase \"[you/he/she/this] sucks\" has no sexual connotations. The original phrase was \"[X] sucks hind teat\". What?! Wtf! Really! Yep. The phrase originated among farmers, and described nursing activities of young piglets. It was believed that the rearmost set of nipples on the sow were least nourishing, so the piglets that fed from them would grow less robust. By extension anything that \"sucks hind teat\" was inferior/less-than/bad etc. The phrase was simply shortened to \"sucks\" in common parlance. (some people also claim that it originates for sucking eggs, but that is apocryphal).
