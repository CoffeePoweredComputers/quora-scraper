            "answer_text": "Yes and No. This question is being asked that implicitly means that you are already aware that there is something that you want to change and you can\u2019t over a period of time. The term \u201cHuman Nature\u201d refers to the way we think, feel and behave. In this sense yes it definitely gets changed over a period of time and this we can certainly observe that the way we think today is way different than we used to when we were kids. However the catch is if you by reading some biographies or after watching some motivational stuffs, expect that your nature should completely transform immediately in congruence of this great personality then unfortunately it will not going to happen. According to psychologists if we divide mind into say ten parts then our conscious mind is merely 1/10th, rest is our subconscious one, the most powerful. That's why we observe that sometimes we decide say from now on I\u2019ll wake up at 5 am- this decision was of conscious mind and it will not work unless your force is so powerful that it changes the older pattern of subconscious mind because subconscious works on past imprints. Thus, if you want to change your nature permanently then at the time of making the decision assess all aspects that whether it is in congruence of your overall persona and value system and not merely out of fit of the moment but once decided then stick with it. Initially it will going to become very difficult because of your older patterns but by and by if you keep on practising then over a period of time, imperceptible change will take place. That is why we give so much importance to discipline and perseverance Good luck :) ",
