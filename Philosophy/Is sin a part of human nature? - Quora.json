            "answer_text": "\u201cIt's great to have sex, but not if it disrupts the sermon\u201d \u2014 As a pastors kid, a well educated and traveled individual, and a life-time student of the Bible, I have thought about this concept a lot in my 33 years. The construct of sin has gone through at least three stages for me. \u2014 Adolescents and teens - sin was the explanation for things we didn't do. I.e.: \u201cdon\u2019t do that, it's a SIN.\u201d This was a struggle for me. I didn't understand how someone could categorically call something a SIN, using only a loose collection of Biblical references, which could have had other interpretations. And while some were more straight forward, \u201cDon\u2019t murder\u201d, others were harder to interpret \u201cDon\u2019t touch girls you aren't married to\u201d\u2026.. where does it say that!? \u2014 Twenties - sin became the category of things that I knew were unhealthy for me, from multiple points of reference (e.g.; medical science, psychology, financial wellbeing, the Bible, family relationships). This was a very difficult time in my life. I spent a long time in this mindset, thinking that as long as I could straddle all of those competing view points, I was probably doing ok. This led me into addictions and a lot of hiding stuff from people. Because ultimately, if they didn't know I had crossed a line, I basically was fine. This also took up a lot of mental space on my hard drive, constantly trying to remember everything that may be relevant to the decision at hand, and weighting all those things to try to not commit a sin. \u2014 Thirties - sin is now the loss of control at any time in my day, where I could have chosen a better decision, but didn't. This time in my life has been very rich and fulfilling. It's not as much about the ultimate decision I make, as HOW I make that decision. Did I stop and make a conscious choice? Did I think about consequences? Did I react in anger / another emotion? Did I consult my loved ones - if it involves them? Did I use wording that was hasty and shallow? I find that the worst sins are where I choose to do something arrogantly - trusting my own judgement, when I should have consulted others. \u2014 I\u2019m still studying this and learning about it, but my current understanding goes something like this: The goal of a construct like SIN shouldn't be to stop specific behaviors - but rather to slow down decision making, so that we more often choose the optimal behavior at the time. This is difficult to calibrate, so it takes daily acts of patience, humility and compassion to be present and think clearly. But it has freed up my mind to focus 100% on the specific decision at hand, and not to rely on guilt or anxiety to make decisions for me. As King Solomon said, \u201cThere is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the sun.\u201d Including I assume - having sex in church. ",

            "answer_text": "After passing my B Tech, I joined Larsen & Toubro (L&T) in Mumbai in 1987. One of the best features of L&T was that the food quality was outstanding. They were winning the award for the best food for several years. The food was highly subsidized and we had to pay just Rs 1 for having unlimited buffet lunch/dinner. I was a vegetarian while most of my friends were non-vegetarian. So while I used to have lots of paneer dish on my plate, they used to have chicken on their plate. Some of them did not even take bread with it and ate only chicken. I too was tempted to take the non-veg food, but my conscience never allowed it. I was told since my childhood that eating meat is very bad and a grave sin. One day, I was eating a mix veg type of dish in the canteen when someone pointed out to me that I was actually eating mutton-keema. I could not identify the dish as it was mixed with black gram. I thought that maybe it was a signal that I should start eating nonveg food now. Hence, instead of leaving it, I ate the keema to my heart\u2019s content. After a few hours, I was feeling extremely uncomfortable. Then I started to vomit. I still remember that the vomiting sensation was so severe that I felt as if I was going to die. Somehow I started feeling that I was punished by God by eating meat and committing the sin. I started praying forgiveness from God and promised that I would never eat nonveg food again in my life. And I never ever touched nonveg food thereafter. Why did I get that feeling of guilt for eating meat that day while so many of my friends never felt like that in their life? What we call sin is a creation of our own consciousness which is due to the \u2018sacred\u2019 values imparted to us during our early age. When we break those sacred values, we believe that we are committing a sin. Most Hindus would consider it a sin, if they ever kill a cow or eat the meat of a cow even unknowingly. However, millions of people are doing the same thing every day without ever considering it a sin because they have not been told that such activity amounts to sin. There is no sin created by God. All sins are human creation by our Scriptures which tried to create an ordered society by prohibiting certain activities for a purpose which had great relevance during the time of their creation. Many of those activities have lost their relevance and yet we are carrying them due to our cultures and traditions.
