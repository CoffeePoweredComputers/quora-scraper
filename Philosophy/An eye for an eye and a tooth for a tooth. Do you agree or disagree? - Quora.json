If you ask for \u201can eye for an eye\u201d you want retribution for a wrong but the payment must be in exactly the same form as the original wrong. So if someone stole your pen, you get their pen; if they kicked you in the leg, you get to kick them in the leg. If they raped your wife \u2026.. well, this is why we have courts and prisons and don\u2019t just say \u201can eye for an eye\u201d. ",
