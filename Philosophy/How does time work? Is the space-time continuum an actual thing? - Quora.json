            "answer_text": "Modern day science still has a flawed understanding of time, forces, and the fundamental units of matter. These flawed understandings confuse scientists into believing theories about the universe that are wrong since they are built upon these flawed understandings. A more accurate depiction of time would be as follows. All matter has forces upon it. Those forces lead to what we call chemical reactions (reactions between matter). As the chemical reactions occur, the matter gravitates toward stability. This leads to stable layers of matter, and these layers of matter are what we observe as time. Therefore, when chemical reactions are slowed down, we slow down time for the matter that is affected by it. An example would be that food that is put in the freezer experiences time more slowly than food on the counter nearby. This contradicts the widely accepted truth that the food in the freezer and the food on the counter are experiencing time at the same rate. There is a lot more to time and how it really works but that\u2019s the short version. So as a result, this means that the space-time continuum at its core is an explanation of our universe using a flawed definition of time. It is a thing and it mostly works, but it is waaaaaaaaaay more complicated than it would be if the theory was created using a more correct definition of time in the first place. ",

            "answer_text": "Spacetime is a mathematical concept that actually doesn't exist. Time is just a measuring system, that we use between two spacial now times. Everything in the universe exists, at exactly the same spacial now time. All events at a spacial now time happen simultaneously, no matter where they happen in the universe. The only difference is that you are in a different position in space, to the other objects, at any now time. This is why you see everything in the universe as it happened in the past. That past spacial now time when that event happened is relative to the distance that the object is away from you. A spacial now time cannot be dilated. The 4th dimension called time, is a linear spacial measurement between two spacial now times. A basic example - if your first spacial now time is at point A in your car on your driveway and the second spacial now time is at point B which is where you work, the only difference between those two points, is you are in a different position in space on Earth. No matter how many times you travel between those two points, there is only one thing that remains constant and that is the distance between those two points. The time taken to travel between those two Spacial now time points, will never be exactly the same, as your velocity varies. Time is just the measuring system that we use to measure that inconsistent motion between those two spacial now time points on Earth. Your motion/velocity between those two points is always inconsistent. This is why we compare that inconsistent motion against the consistent rotational motion of planet Earth, as it has always been. We unitize that inconsistent velocity between point A and B using a clock. We then establish how many seconds between those two spacial now times. A second\u2019s consistent rate of change, is referenced against the consistent rate of rotational motion of planet Earth. You could say I just sat in my car at point A, but this time you didn't go to work. You then sat in your car for let's say 10 minutes, then declared that as your second spacial now time. You could then say but I am still at point A in space on Earth, which is basically true. You could also say I have not moved any distance at all, but time has certainly passed. This is the same illusion that fooled everyone, when Aristotle proclaimed that man was at the center of the universe. The illusion is based on the fact that we cannot perceive the constant rotational motion of planet Earth. The reason why you think only time has passed is because you forgot that you can not perceive the rotational motion or orbital motion of the Earth around the sun. When you got into your car at the first spacial now time at point A, point A was also in a position in space relative to the sun and its relative position in the Milky way galaxy. When you declared your second spacial now time 10 minutes later, you were still at point A on Earth. What has actually happened is you have moved an exact distance in space between those two spacial now time points, both called A. To find the approximate distance that the Earth has moved in orbit around the sun, take the Earth\u2019s orbital velocity which is approximately 30km per second X 600 seconds in ten minutes which then equals a distance of 18,000 km. This is only the approximate orbital distance but you have to take into account all of the motion that Earth travels during that time. This shows how going to work in your car is just moving your position in space, which is exactly the same when you were relatively stationary in your car but you also travelled an exact orbital distance in space, not time. We just measured that distance using the rotational motion of planet Earth. We can also use a spacial now time to meet someone in the future. We need to know the spacial position on Earth where we will meet and also the time of day. That time of day will only happen when the Earth\u2019s rotational and orbital position is correct relative to the sun. In other words the Earth has moved into its correct UNIVERSAL GPS location in space. The only correct frame of reference is a spacial now time frame of reference. We measure space in the universe with a ruler, using a man made measuring system. This measuring system uses a consistent unit of space called a millimetre, which we then use to measure any type of space. We measure the motion of objects in space with a clock, which is also a man made measuring system. This measuring system uses a consistent unit of motion called a second, which we use to measure any type of motion in space. In my previous posts in the science lounge, I have explained how our perception of time is based on the rotational motion of planet Earth, as it has always been. My post titled \u201cthe anomaly called gravitational time dilation\u201d, explains the reason for Einstein's gravitational anomalies that he predicted. Just tap my profile at the beginning to see these posts. We used to believe that we were at the center of the universe, until that illusion was debunked. If you now agree with what I have stated, please pass it on to others, so this Time illusion can also be debunked. ",

            "answer_text": "Space just means the distance between things. Time just means the rate and duration of actions. Both are used as metrics to measure those aspects of physical reality. Both metrics are combined together in the field equation of general relativity (GR) to calculate the degree of curvature of imaginary lines called in GR \u201cRiemannian geodesics\u201d. Geodesics are the imaginary lines representing the trajectories of objects moving in gravitational fields. Spacetime is a metric, not a material. Nothing physical bends or curves, however, the effect of the gravitational field is to alter the rate at which actions occur in the field. The stronger the field, the slower the rate of the action. One action is linear motion. When an object moves in a gravitational field, it is subjected to different degrees of gravitational pressure; the side of the object closer to the surface of the mass aggregate generating the field must move slower than the side of the same object that is closer to that surface, a different in the rate of motion which steers the object into following a geodesic. Geodesics - imaginary lines - can appear curved to us observers, hence the shorthand phrase, \u201cthe curvature of spacetime\u201d. It is meant to refer to the apparent curvature of those imaginary lines, geodesics. ",

Thats because times the boss of the universe so to speak and its got its paws into everything even at a quantum level. At the quantum level time is an absolute which means it doesn't move and does no work and has no outside, unlike all the other local size like and moving and working things .",
