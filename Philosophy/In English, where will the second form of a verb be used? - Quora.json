            "answer_text": "The second form of verb is generally used when you are talking about past actions, however, this is not correct all the time. For example, the second form will be used in present tense sentences too if it is in passive state. For example: They use this printer a lot. (Active tense simple present sentence)This printer is used a lot. (Same sentence in passive form)",

On the other hand, from The Five Verb Forms, one could infer that the \u201csecond form\u201d is the infinitive. The complete list there is: base forminfinitive formpast formpresent participlepast participleThose names describe the forms well and are understood by students and grammarians everywhere. I see no need to denote the principal parts of a verb with numbers. ",
