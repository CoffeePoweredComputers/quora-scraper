            "answer_text": "Nihilism is an absolute no,because we all know we evolved and reached this stage where we could say ourselves human.I believe our existence has meaning and it lies in our evolution. Existentialism is somewhat i agree with but not totally because it emphasizes on the existence of individual person as a free agent determining their development through acts of one\u2019s will.Problem is one\u2019s will could interfere with others will and that will create chaos. Agnosticism is an absolute no for me because the whole idea of existence of god is absurd to me.Why we should know about or existence of something which is created by we humans as per our needs. Theism is something i completely disagree with because of the definition of god we have been preached.Need not to say God is created just to create fear in peoples so that some group of peoples could rule the world.On the name of god we created religion,caste,creed.We all were just born as humans and then people give us our identity just on the basis of religion and divided the humans on the name of so called gods and then we are forced to pretend to be of certain community which we actually never even chosen. OPTIMISM is the only theory i believe in.Optimism helps us in evolving ourselves.DEATH IS BORING BUT LIFE IS FULL OF OPPURTUNITIES.Being optimistic makes us hopefull.Even though humanity degraded still we are hopefull that humanity will progress and there would be a time when everything will be fine.Life throws us oppurtunities and optimism is the beauty of it making us live.Without being hopefull we could not survive in this realistic world where everything seems wrong. Optimism and pessimism both are true in nature.We should be bit optimist and bit pessimist to balance our life.I have read it somewhere because of someone so optimsistic in life who was hopeful that we could fly invented the AEROPLANE ,then there was someone else who was pessimistic enough to think what would happen if engine of the aeroplane fails invented the PARACHUTE. I conclude with this. ",

            "answer_text": "See, God's existence is quite debatable. We don't have enough reasons or proof to justify that God surely exists and at the same time, we just can't straightforward say that the belief of \u201cGod's existence\u201d is wrong. Therefore, agnosticism is what I am choosing. I would like to mention one thing here : optimism is a good philosophy too. It should be applied in real life so that you are confident enough about your success in near future. It would always make you hopeful for something positive. ",

            "answer_text": "I would not name particular branch of philosophy as i am influenced by all branch of philosophy. it depends on you how you take it and how much extent you are able to think about philosophy. I have never read academic philosophy much. My theory of philosophy is greatly influenced by Shri Krishna, adi shankar , upanishad, buddha, osho, Diogenes(Cynic), ramkrishna and his disciple Vivekanand. Like every philosopher , i also believe in reason but my reason can not be grouped and i dont want it to be classified as well. I am open to discussion. If some thinks he/she has got good understanding on philosophy, we can discuss on it. ",
