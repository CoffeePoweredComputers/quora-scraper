(For example, consumer data, profiles, other data, previous search terms).Associations. (For example terms related to search [clicking] not obviously related to preferences).C. \u2192 Coherently.

These systems are free to use with citation of Nathan Coppedge visible in the software / product / manual: Programmable HeuristicsIncoherently.

(The labor of science is to provide detailed organizations that can be used to develop incoherent data, or the combination of coherent and incoherent data).Individual entry. (Specific specialists or organizations may provide enjoyable and also seperate fast-learning formats for phenomenally grasping various subjects, like abstracts, labels, or book descriptions, which may be suited to various personalities.

But I would use the Nate System. This categorises knowledge into four discrete and comprehensive types as follows: Things everyone knows - even people who foolishly disagree with me and don't think they are true, because these people are clearly in denial.Things only people of sufficient awareness - that is, me and people who agree with me - know.False knowledge - that is, anything which I don't think.Irrelevant knowledge - that is, facts I cannot deny, but which I refuse to let alter the more important fact that I am right anyway.I think that is all the types of knowledge. And since I don't think there are any others, any others that people think exist are false knowledge. ",
