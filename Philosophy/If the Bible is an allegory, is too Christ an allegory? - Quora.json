            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Something being allegorical doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s fictional. An actual historical event can carry an allegorical meaning. God is the Supreme Author, and able to use every means to teach and guide us \u2014 including through historical events. Certainly traditional Christian teaching allows that we have an \u2018inner Jesus Christ.\u2019 Hence, it is also a traditional understanding that the events in Christ life, in addition to being historical, symbolize events and processes associated with salvation within our souls. For example, St. Paul plainly says (I think) that we must \u2018crucify\u2019 our carnal-minded nature. Similarly, Christians are supposed to seek an inner resurrection or revivification. Likely it has been suggested over the centuries that most or all of the events in Christ\u2019s life also symbolize stages of personal advancement. When Christianity teaches as a basic doctrine the \u2018imitation of Christ\u2019 it as much as says plainly that Christs\u2019 life is both a historical fact and an allegory. ",

            "answer_text": "Is DNA an allegory? Jacob\u2019s Ladder not clear enough? You say allegorical as if it takes away from the truths of the subject. How would one describe the invisible power of the spirit? The power of Christ is as real as what is accepted of DNA. John\u2019s head on a platter and Jesus the CHRIST saying what is it to you if I leave him till I come? Follow thou me. Moses wrote of the spiral ladder of the 24 ancients long before now. Ezeikiel spoke of the winding staircase unto the midst. That pillar of salt DNA, a guiding pillar of smoke in the day and a guiding pillar of fire at night. The feathered serpent around the world. The dominant representation of the ancient Egyptians of the Maat feather, the bar serpent or crooked, the Leviathan of the scriptures. Paul speaking of the writing upon our minds and in our heart. They knew of these things that society has turned their back upon. Alzheimer\u2019s and all the mind reversing spoken of and represented in that most repeated of the Gospel parables of the killing of the inheriting son of the vinyard, live by the sword of reason shall perish with it, ie the abnormal gamma wave exhibited by those suffering those sorrows. That Gamaliel the lawyer Paul spoke of. The recording of all of humanities thoughts by that ancient representation of the diamond pointed pen of the heavens, the obelisk. Young\u2019s double light slit experiment the proof of the recording, having stupefied quantum physicists for over a hundred years. Look at any of Da Vinci\u2019s paintings and among the other things the predominant letters of DNA. His hidden symbols were for life preservation during the inquisition which ended around 1850. He could tell no one and his works are easily identifiable when one knows of the symbols. Some attributed are not his and more than a handful are completely of his hand, three in the US alone are entirely of his hand. None of his contemporaries knew of the death sentence information. Leonardo knew for lo, the kingdom of God is within you. All of his works display the symbols of Jacob\u2019s Ladder the Leviathan within. Enjoy the amazing wonders of the masters art.     The above is lower left corner in the Virgin and the Rocks as below.  And the most telling under the red cloaked ladies arm.  Leonardo knew with great understanding the language of the ancients and the angels. The most symbolized of the ancient Egyptians was the Maat feather which symbolized the pillar of salt we refer to as DNA. Leonardo also included the GCAT letters of the contemporary or so thought four letters of the DNA utilized by science today.  There is so much more, so very much. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question. The scriptures are an \u201cALL OR NOTHING\u2019 kind of thing. If one does not believe in such things as Adam and Eve, Noah and the Flood, the Exodus of the Israelite's, Moses and the 10 Commandments, being reality and not allegory, then the entire Bible must be suspect as myth and/or shepherds stories as both Jesus and the New Testament writers often referred to these people and incidents as being real and actual events. One cannot have it both ways as some churches and even the Pontiff seem to want to have it. ",
