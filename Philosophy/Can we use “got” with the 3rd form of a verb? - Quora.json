            "answer_text": "\u2018Third form' of a verb (Numbers from one to nine are spelled out.) is a term used by British ESL/EFL teachers. American ESL/EFL teachers don't use it. It's not a very useful term because it's completely abstract. Unlike terms like past participle, passive participle, or simple past, the expression 'third form' gives you absolutely no clue as to its meaning. I'm going to try to guess what you mean. The word got has many different meanings. Sometimes it means became. When it means became it is a linking verb and is followed by a subject complement. The subject complement in this case is always an adjective. Here are some examples: He got old.He got tired.He got hungry.He got mad.He got drunk.All these words are adjectives. None of them are verbs. Sometimes, in passive verb phrases, the word got means was or were. She got injured in the accident.She got eaten by a bear.She got killed by a falling piano.In this case, since these are passive constructions, the word got is followed by the passive participle. If you call the passive participle the \u201cthird form\u201d of the verb, then the answer is yes. ",

            "answer_text": "First, I hadn\u2019t heard of \u201c3rd form of a verb\u201d until i Started reading Quora, and I\u2019ve been speaking English for more than 70 years. The normal term is \u201cpast participle\u201d. It\u2019s a better term than \u201c3rd form\u201d, because it says what it means, and because some English verbs have more than 4 forms, while others have fewer. So, you can use \u201cgot\u201d with a past participle in English, but you would not use it is very formal contexts, For example: I got dressed.The house got built,He got hit by a car.She got embarrassed.These are all normal English, but I would not use these writing a formal report. There I might say: The author of this report dressed.The house was built,Mr X was hit by a car.Ms Y was embarrassed.",
