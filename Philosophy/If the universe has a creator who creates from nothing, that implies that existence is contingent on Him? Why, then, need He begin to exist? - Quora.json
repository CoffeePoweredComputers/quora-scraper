            "answer_text": "If the universe has a creator who creates from nothing, that implies that existence is contingent on Him? Why, then, need He begin to exist? You ask two questions here: If a universe created from nothing is contingent on its creator and what is the reason is for the beginning of said creator. If a universe created from nothing is contingent on its creator This depends on the nature of the creation. In some speculations on the methods of God, the universe is made by Its thought, that is to say that the creator wills it into existence and in this universe is all saturating and omnipresent. I would think that a universe made in this manner would require an active presence of the creator to maintain those creations. If it is the thought of the divine which makes reality then without the thought of the divine there is no reality but again there is perhaps an echo effect where the divine might think of an effect like fire then turn attention elsewhere but the fire burns still for some time. Or perhaps even in that case there is a passive awareness of the fire which is what allows it to continue to exist. Then there are the creation stories in which the god \u201cbreathed life into the universe\u201d or that is to say, took a simple pre-existing lifeless inert material and made it animate and complex with much variation. In this model the divine is the catalyst for existence but not by necessity that which maintains its being on a second to second basis. From conversations I have had with Christians it seems that their view is pretty clear on the issue. Hell is often referred to as being so horrible because of the absence of God. This infers that a space can exist without the will of God holding it in place or else Hell would only be \u201cthe minimum possible presence of God\u201d and not \u201cthe absence\u201d. So in this tradition it seems that God does not maintain the atom to atom existence of things but where It doesnt energize a place via its presence the conditions get very ugly very fast. As a tangent: the amount of matter in the universe is a lot less than you think. To say that the universe has been created out of nothing is nearly correct. Consider that so much of space is empty that the amount of matter to cubic lightyear is ridiculously small but EVEN IN THAT MATTER most of the area it occupies (like 99%) is also empty space (meaning the empty space between electron shell and nucleus. Even the most dense material you have ever seen- tempered steel, a uranium marble- is far and away made up of nothing with but a few dots of matter in it. what is the reason is for the beginning of said creator This is an impossible question to answer by the very physics of it. We are in the universe of Its creation. This means that the potential creation of this being must have occurred prior to Its creation of this universe. Our existence is limited to this universe and potentially the Astral or spiritual planes which, if actually, seem to only be accessible by people who have spent a lifetime learning to access. This means that they have not spent a lifetime becoming research scientists and even if they had, the only way to validate an answer to this question would be to provide proofs. Proofs can only be determined for scientists if they can be laboratory repeatable phenomenon and are objective data. From what I know of the spiritual side of being I have found that it operates mostly on a subjective level. Experiences one has had say with Astral Projection to other non material plane locales cannot be backed up in a form to present to others nor are they repeatable to demonstrate a proof. Couple that with the fact that to ask a question about a being whose origin and occurence predate the universe and then to look for evidence within the universe created by that being to support it seems a bit unlikely to come to fruition, regardless of whether the concept is true or false. Evidence of the birth of God may exist but its likely not in this universe or even in a form which we would recognize as a thing at all. While some may say that this is a cop out, it is only the logical conclusion in asking the question and has no bearing on anything but our own limitations of perception and evidence gathering. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, Guido. Thank you for referring this question to me.  The concept of a 'beginning' to anything arises from a linear view of Time. Time is not necessarily linear, although this is the way in which we tend to perceive it in everyday life. It may be circular. It may be spherical. It may be shaped like a marshmallow or a dodecahedron or anything else that you care to imagine. It may, from a human representational perspective, be formless. If there is a creator, that creator would probably not be bound by our conceptions of Time. It is also possible, from a panentheistic perspective, that a hypothetical creator transcends time, space and energy/matter. See: Panentheism. Such a creator (I hesitate to use the pronoun\"He\") would not \"need to begin to exist\".  Also, from this perspective, creation does not need to be viewed as an event in the distant past. It may be viewed as a process that is continuous from minute to minute and from one millisecond to the next. The Big Bang theory is now being seriously questioned. I have posted this video before in several different different contexts. But it raises so many important questions that it is well worth watching repeatedly to get a better understanding of all of the questions that it raises.  ---  Most of us seem fairly certain, in our daily lives, that the universe exists and that, for some reason, it appears to continue to exist. According to some interpretations of quantum mechanics there is no particular reason why it should not simply vanish at any moment. To me (subjectively) the existence of anything at all seems rather remarkable. I cannot account for it. I have read the works of many physicists on this subject, including those of Stephen Hawking.  It seems that not even they of can give a universally agreed and satisfactory account of the apparent 'facts' of existence. Best wishes, John.  ",

            "answer_text": "You as, \"If the universe has a creator who creates from nothing, that implies that existence is contingent on Him? Why, then, need He begin to exist?\" Ultimately, there is no \"universe\" and there is no \"creator.\"  Eternal Human Beings have existed forever and will exist forever.  To avoid getting bored, they use an amazingly advanced computer program that works on their brain to give them experiences that seem like exist in a real universe.  This program first lets the eternal human forget who they are and think they exist as advanced human being in a solar system created for them.  Although advanced humans in the simulated universe start out as newborns, in real truth eternal human beings who always have existed have never been other than perfect human beings at the perfect age for existing.  We never were babies there.   Once we have decided what kind of an advanced human being we want to be (in terms of the humanity type we choose for ourselves), the advanced computer program works, in effect, in our brain as advanced human beings to place us in many mortal experiences to gain just that ... new experiences.  Once our mortal experiences are over, we return to being advanced human beings and are assigned our planet that best suits our happiness. When we get bored as advanced human beings, we quit this \"Game of Life\" and return to our actual existence as eternal human beings.  We share our experiences with one another and then get ready to have more experience, by using the computer program to return us to the simulated state of being an advanced human being who has mortal experiences and then returns to be advanced human beings assigned to a planet in our solar system.  Then we return and report and prepare to start over again, when we choose to do so. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for asking To answer this I have to deconstruct the question to make the implicit assumptions explicit and then apply some logic to them If the universe has a creator who creates from nothing,  1. We assume that the universe has a creator.  2. We assume that he creates (the universes) from nothingness that implies that existence is contingent on Him?  Can we imply form just 1 and 2 that existence is contingent on Him? If we draw that conclusion then we use a few implicit assumptions  3. Nothingness does not exclude the existence of a creator  4. Existence can not be eternal except for the creator  5. Existence requires a creator, with exception for the creator himself. Why, then, need He begin to exist? The real problem is that the implicit assumptions show that the hypothesis of the creator does not help to solve the problem of origin or existence. It hides them by pushing them into implicit properties of two things we do not understand: nothingness and the creator. ",
