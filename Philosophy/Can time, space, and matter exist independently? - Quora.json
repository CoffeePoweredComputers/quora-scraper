            "answer_text": "You ask: Can time, space, and matter exist independently? First, let\u2019s address time vs. space: Yes. Time and Space could \u00abexist independently\u00bb, in a purely \u201cthought experiment\u201d sort of way: it would simply be a different sort of space plus time than we experience within our Universe. (Incidentally, the space+time of Galilean/Newtonian physics is an example of such.) OK. Let\u2019s answer the matter portion of the question within the context of the space plus time we experience within our universe: It was shown, quite a while ago, that General Relativity (GR) could yield solutions to spacetime even if the hypothetical universe was completely devoid of matter (including being devoid of all energies). Such would be a purely vacuum solution. (Special Relativity [SR], by the way, is one such purely vacuum solution.) Again, such doesn\u2019t match the Universe in which we reside. ",
