            "answer_text": "Not my story to tell, but I used to work at a Verizon call center with this dude I'll call Z. Z was your chill, run of the mill, cucumber cool dude, very smart, kinda cocky, but it was always in a joking manner and people just didn't get him when he made those jokes. He was also very open about his life experience, and good old Z had just happened to have been an Army MP. He relayed the story to me of how he ended up leaving the Army. Z was in a protection detail for saudi VIPs who had gone into some city in that hellhole, and his squad was told to wait somewhere outside the city. They had their humvee, M4A1 rifles, Beretta M9s, an M2 on the Humvee, and everything was quiet. But then they heard something, like a thousand voices shouting at the same time. Sure enough, just over the hill, an innumerable amount of derka derkas (as he put it) came charging over one of the sandy hills right towards his team. My memory is a little fuzzy so I don't remember everything, but they jumped right into the Humvee and went spinning off in another direction after fighting for a few minutes. One of their guys had been missing during the fight. They stayed so long in the hopes he would come back, but he was nowhere to be seen. This guy was MIA. So they get back to where ever they're based out at (bear with me here, it's been a year since I heard the story and I'm not in the army) and volunteered for some kind of patrol, dunno how it worked but the whole team volunteered to look for their guy I suppose. So back to that same city they went. You know that scene in American Sniper where the SEALs go on a revenge campaign in their trucks? It was like that, and Z even acknowledged to me they shouldn't have done that cuz they were too deep into grief and just angry. Then a muj sniper hits the window of the Humvee and an enemy force reveals themselves from both sides of the road. Z is one of the first out on the passenger side door and raises his M4, he's sending shots out and getting shots back, but none of the ones coming towards him are landing. He's still near the Humvee (Like an idiot, as he put it) and that sniper takes another shot. Well it smashes into the door and somehow, someway, that round shatters and a big chunk of it goes right into the ONE spot of his torso not protected by his armor; right by his underarm. And that was that, they left and he was sent home. So to answer your question, they sometimes do seek vengeance, and anger is bad for your combat effectiveness. And they never found that guy. Hope he's alright. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s the other way around. You are a trigger happy bunch of soldiers, everyone is having a blast kicking your enemy\u2019s ass until one of your buddies gets killed. Having a teammate killed always comes as a great shock. This guy was your friend and even if he wasn\u2019t yours than he was someone else\u2019s. Your motivation to continue fighting will be near zero. It will be a difficult task, especially for your leaders, to make your unit bounce back and not to despair. Even worse, when more than one of your teammates gets killed. Some units never recover from that. This is what makes the diffence between a good unit and a great one: it\u2019s all about resilience. Seeking vengeance? For what? This is war and not a private quarrel. Everybody who wears a uniform and goes into combat knows that he could be the next one who is going to die. The same goes for your enemy. If they kill some of your guys you have to accept that. Anger is also pretty pointless. Getting angry at the enemy doesn\u2019t make you a better soldier. The only anger on the battlefield that is productive is the one that your team leader has towards you, because you didn\u2019t move your ass fast enough. ",
