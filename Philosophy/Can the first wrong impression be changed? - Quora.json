            "answer_text": "It depends. If you sincerely want to establish a good relationship with someone after you\u2019ve made an unfortunate first impression, it will take time and effort to build trust with him/her. You will need to apologize, briefly and humbly explain why you were not on your best behavior the first time and then change the subject to a positive topic of mutual interest while presenting yourself as genuine and sincere. Then graciously move on and look for future opportunities to reinforce a congruent positive impression of who you truly are. Most of us are slow to trust someone after a bad first encounter, but consistent, sincere, humble behavior will eventually win in the long run. ",
