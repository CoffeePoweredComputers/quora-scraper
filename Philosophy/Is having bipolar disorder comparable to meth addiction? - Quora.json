            "answer_text": "Very interesting \u2026 Obviously no, the addiction is external and fed \u2026 while Bipolar is internal, God given, a wiring of the brain, kept under control. That said, there are uncomfortable similarities in meth high & uncontrolled mania. Lights, sounds, making bad judgements with little concern for consequence can feel exciting in the monent. An addict needs to go find another hit to reenter that space. In bipolar, you often arrive there naturally (if you are not being careful). Sleep deprevation, over stimulation, certain food or meds, stress at home or work \u2026 the loss of control creeps up on you. You find yourself in a mania, or worse find yourself the next morning not remembering the details. Controlling bipolar involves finding and taking a daily medication regimen to keep stable mood. But also keeping a regular sleep cycle, avoiding crazy situations (weekend in vegas, tequila, etc), limiting coffee, having daily exercise. Controlling mood, to enjoy normal ups & downs, means keeping the monster in a cage. Controlled Bipolar are lion tamers, always vigilent. They don't need to go looking for stimulation. ",
