            "answer_text": "He was relevant to many economists in his day, and at least two of his contributions to economics \u2014 his business cycle theory and his economic calculation argument about socialism \u2014 were well respected beyond even his circle of seminar attendees, which included Fritz Machlup, Gottfried Haberler, and F. A. Hayek. Among his admirers were Lionel Robbins. For some reason he was never given much credit for clearly spelling out an ordinalist approach to marginal utility before big names like Hicks and Allen. I have read histories of marginal utility theory that ball up the Austrian School understanding of marginal utility, from which Mises emerged and to which he contributed. So the whole approach is definitely not well understood outside the actual Misesian readership. Several economists of high fame, today \u2014 Nobel Laureates James Buchanan and Vernon Smith, prominent among them \u2014 wrote about and praised Mises\u2019 contributions. Mises engaged in a kind of formal theory that deprecated mathematical exposition, so his method ran counter to much of Anglo-American economics from World War II onward, and (rightly or wrongly) he would have regarded the bulk of the statistical work of contemporary economics as \u201chistory.\u201d That being said, there is a whole school devoted to his general approach, and only ideologues of state-worship and scientism dismiss him out of anything other than ignorance. And, let us be frank, most economists have never heard of him, much less studied The Theory of Money and Credit or Human Action. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely\u2014not! Von Mises was an ideologue that fancied himself as a theoretical economist, but he was just another highly-opinionated fruit loop.  The big problem with von Mises and his followers is they aren\u2019t really interested in any meaningful compromise with reality. They are also so far to the right that they have no useful contribution to make to economics at all. ",
