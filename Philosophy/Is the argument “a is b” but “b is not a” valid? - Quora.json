            "answer_text": "Hoooooooold on, two steps back from these other answers for a second. TL;DR: You question is posed poorly. Your phrasing here is\u2026confusing. You ask if the \u201cargument\u201d is valid, but you haven\u2019t made an argument here. You have two separate propositions. There\u2019s no therefor, and there\u2019s no conclusion. If you\u2019re asking if both of these two things can be true, then we need to ask the next important question: In which systems of logic can these two statements be true? That all comes down to, if you\u2019ll excuse my quoting a president, what your definition of \u201cis\u201d is. If you mean \u201ca = b\u201d and \u201cb =\\= a\u201d, then we\u2019re looking at most forms of mathematics or some kind of symbolic logic, and if that equals sign implies reflectivity, then those statements cannot both be true. Other answers have added other things to this: a is a member of b, but b is not a member of a, or \u201cAll squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares.\u201d In the first case, this chooses a definition of \u2018is\u2019 to bring up sets. In the second, though, you\u2019re changing the definitions of \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019. \u201cAll squares are rectangles.\u201da = All Squaresb = Rectangles \u201cAll rectangles are not squares.\u201da = Squaresb = All Rectangles And that makes this questionable as well. So in order to tell you whether both of those exist, we would need to know what system of logic you\u2019re trying to follow, your definitions of your variables (a, b, etc) and your definition of \u2018is\u2019. So to sum up my final answer: Maybe, but probably not. ",

If a is b then b must be a at least sometimes. when a is a subset of b for example Texas is a state but not all states are Texas or all Fords are cars but not all cars are Fords. Now if you are saying a is b but b is never a then you have a contradiction which invalidates things. ",
