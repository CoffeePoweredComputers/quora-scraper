            "answer_text": "They\u2019re not. I think you\u2019re thinking of the contrapositive: [math]p \\implies q[/math] is equivalent to [math]\\lnot q \\implies \\lnot p[/math]. There\u2019s a nice graphical way of justifying it.  Shown here: all poodles are dogs. In other words, \u201cpoodle\u201d implies \u201cdog\u201d. If something is not in the outer circle\u2014 if it is not \u201cdog\u201d\u2014 then it can\u2019t be in the inner circle\u2014 it is therefore not \u201cpoodle\u201d. We use this kind of logic without realizing it all the time. If I want to know if it is raining, I look out the window; if it is raining, I will see rain. If I do not see rain, then it is not raining. This is an example of the contrapositive being applied. ",
