            "answer_text": "Philosophy- the field of Knowledge; divided into three major groups: Science- knowledge gained through the scientific method of experimentation, documentation and math. Humanities- knowledge gained through the comparative and qualitative methods, for instance sociology or political science. Philosophy- in the modern era, Philosophy pertains mostly to knowledge gained purely through logic, reasoning, and thought, unconnected to the real world itself. Religion is the belief in the supernatural, therefore the un-existent. To not be of Nature is not to be. It is not a part of Philosophy, as philosophy claims knowledge where Religion demands belief. If religion were to be belief in the natural, most religions would fall under the category of political science- several, or one, rulers administrating a population of billions. The Truth, in it's purest form, is unachievable. One of the problems is that you cannot possibly be certain something is true- one plus one seems to add to two on the surface of things, but there are many mathematical tricks to prove otherwise. Of course, those are mere tricks relying on false assumptions to fool those who do not look into the equations, but if one day someone came up with a proof that 1+1 doesn't equal two, mathematics, and the truth, would change drastically forever. So is 1+1=2? Relatively, now, yes. But it is not necessarily the absolute Truth; just a step closer in it's direction. As Rene Descartes famously said, \u201cI think, therefore I am\u201d The only thing you can be certain is true is that someone, (you), is questioning the truth of it's, (your), existence. ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy is often used as a general term for the systematic inquiry into other disciplines, such as history or science. It also has some objects, such as knowledge or ethics, that fall mostly under its purview as an inquiry. One might think of philosophy as a meta-inquiry. When one studies past events, for instance, one is engaged in the the study called history. But when one asks whether history should be written as a narrative of particular groups or particular people, one is really asking questions about the techniques, hypotheses, and assumptions of the discipline we call history. One is philosophizing about history. Religion can be considered as the general label for comprehensive sets of beliefs about the origins of things such as the universe, humans, and other life. Often these narratives imply, or stipulate a set of ethics. Religions typically have complex narratives accounting for these things as the effects of the activities of deities and other, often supernatural, forces. Science is most accurately used as a term for the systematic study of categories of objects. For an inquiry to be deemed a science these days, it should make use mainly, but not exclusively, of empirical means to observe and describe its object. It should defend its hypotheses and assumptions with information and evidence available to and evaluateable by anyone. Truth is a certain kind of relationship between real things and events in the universe and our representations of them. If I drink two glasses of wine for dinner and get stopped by a police officer on the way home who asks me if I have been drinking this evening, I would have to say that I have been if I want to convey the truth. My representation of what occurred must relate in a certain way (positively) with what actually happened. There are many complications involved here, so I will leave it at that. ",
