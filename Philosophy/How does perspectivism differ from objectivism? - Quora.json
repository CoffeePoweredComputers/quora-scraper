            "answer_text": "Objectivism has nothing in common with Perspectivism - and in a crucial sense Objectivism is the opposite of perspectivism. According to Objectivism reality exists independently of any perception of it, and consciousness (which includes percepts and concepts) is identification of that objective reality. It follows from this Objectivist premise that if two conceptions or propositions about reality contradict each other, at least one of them must be wrong, i.e. they can\u2019t both be true. According to Perspectivism, on the other hand, the fact that reality can be seen from different perspectives means that truth depends on perspective, so \u201ctruth\u201d is relative to the perspective of the observer or thinker. It follows logically from this Perspectivist premise that two \u201ctruths\u201d can contradict each other and both be true. This logical step may not have been taken explicitly by the 19th century Perspectivists, but the 20th-century brought many philosophies that proudly proclaimed exactly that - that \u201ctruth\u201d for you can contradict \u201ctruth\u201c for me and both \u201ctruths\u201d are valid, because there is no Truth. Objectivism begs to differ. ",

            "answer_text": "To paraphrase Perspectivism, \u201ctruth is in the eye of the beholder\u201d. Yet it also states that not all perspectives are necessarily valid. It equates truth to value, and pits one\u2019s value judgement against another. Objectivism\u2019s point of view would be, \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d It makes the distinction between truth and value. A thing is a thing regardless of how you use it, to what extent you understand it, or how valuable it is to you. ",
