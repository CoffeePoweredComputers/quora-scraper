Our body is just a whole bunch of cells that when worked together, create a structure. but this doesn't really mean that is life. I mean\u2026 Of course it doesn't. Even if you have gained consciousness, what does that really mean? There is no \u201cmagic\u201d in living things. (credit to: Kurzgesagt \u2013 In a Nutshell ) imagine a truck that constantly needs to be repaired with random things picked from the road. they all work together, but by themselves, Nothing is really\u2026 alive. So this is saying that everything is dead. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Even on a deep philosophical level, you need to admit that there is nothing more real than life (and this cosmos). Even if it all is a simulation, you are part of it and the same laws will apply. So even if it is not \u201creal\u201d, it exactly behaves as if it were real. In short, it is real. ",
