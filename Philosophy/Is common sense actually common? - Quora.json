            "answer_text": "When someone says, \u201cIt\u2019s common sense\u201d I think they mean it is obvious. I don\u2019t think obvious is very common. That\u2019s why so many people specialize. Which is why we do have education. Using rules of thumb can make things quicker and save time (Im not always going to prove everytime that I am going to fit through a door I just assume I\u2019ll fit, but at some point when it\u2019s bucking everything that\u2019s quick, and not fitting your boxes/labels, you need to do some digging. OTOH, punching someone get\u2019s them mad at you\u2026 pretty basic. It\u2019s basic cause and effect. So, I mean, if you try going against the law of cause and effect, you lack common sense. You have to also have a good understanding of the system in which the common sense is used: Human relationships, physics, chemistry, car mechanics, making money, they have elements that are simple cause and effect. Elon Musk talked about \u201cPrincipled Thinking\u201d\u2026 it\u2019s like that\u2026 Everyone has different strengths and experiences\u2026 so what\u2019s common to someone else, is not so common to another. Even life skills. A therapist would get no where telling a patient, it\u2019s just common sense, they have to reason with them. Unless they are insane. ",

            "answer_text": "An old series of comedy sketches came to mind . In the show every ten minutes they would show a commercial entitled things money can\u2019t buy. The adds included SobrietyThriftCampingA sense of directionCommon SenseThe end of the commercials had a monologue attributing the add to the federal government campaign to make Australians feel better about being poor. I think this should be the definition of common sense. It\u2019s something great everyone thinks they have. Quick side story . The Australian Government really does this but they are sneaky about it. The wholly government owned Australian Broadcasting Commission plays loads of content from England and other countries where the standard of living is shit and even the weather sucks. It is as subtle as it is insidious but your mind goes to how great it is here . Even if you are just acknowledging it doesn\u2019t rain 24/7. So this little gem tells you even if you have common sense there are players at work to undermine you. ",
