            "answer_text": "At the very least, we have The Ultimate Warrior and arguably Jeff Jarrett.   Not gonna say much on them, they held Vince up for money and Vince hated it. They did come back but in very minor and no in-ring moments (though Jarrett would have a feud with Elias since he and WWE got together after WWE offered Jeff rehab). The middle of the pact we have someone who eventually did come back but not when negotiations started:  Kurt opened negotiations in 2014 and they were turned down outright (not even a single talk happened between him and Vince) and then in 2015, things went like this for him. And I quote: \u201cPaul [Levesque] is in charge. I found that out when I contacted Vince. I\u2019ve always had a good relationship with Paul, so I didn\u2019t consider that a problem. But he decided they had enough talent. For the Vince McMahon who I knew, enough was never enough. He always wanted more. I don\u2019t know what was going on over there, but they even canceled our meeting. I never went to see them. They didn\u2019t even sit me down and talk to me.\u201d Source: 5 Times Vince McMahon refused to rehire WWE Superstars We also have in the middle a guy WWE couldn\u2019t want to retouch with a barge pole considering his accusations and now criminal activity:  Alberto Der Rio was indicted by a grand jury this year for aggravated kidnapping in Texas. Rio was also accused of the crime after being arrested for sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping in May. Also, considering how he treated Paige according to rumours and the fact that it got him fired from Impact (and Impact had loose standards at the best of times)\u2026 yea, Rio is someone we won\u2019t be seeing in a WWE ring. We just won\u2019t. It\u2019s not gonna happen. Ironically, negotiations came close apparently\u2026 god I\u2019m glad they didn\u2019t. But if you want someone who he refused to sign regardless of the payday they\u2019d give him:  \u201cBut Daniel, he\u2019s under WWE Contract.\u201d No, he isn\u2019t. He\u2019s employed by Fox. He was contracted by them directly and he has nothing to do with Vince McMahon whatsoever because Fox own the rights to air Smackdown on Television. Vince has outright said he won\u2019t do business with Punk. After all, Punk is kinda just considered radioactive garbage by the McMahons in that they don\u2019t wanna touch him. Not to mention Punk does still jab at the company and insult them over Twitter. Never expect him back in the ring, I think he\u2019d prefer to be with Fox any day of the week. Hope this helped. ",
