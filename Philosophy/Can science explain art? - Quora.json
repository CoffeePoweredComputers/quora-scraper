            "answer_text": "In the field of anthropology, we see that a tendency towards art appears to be an essential part of human nature. We take this back to somewhere around 50\u201360,000 years ago when we begin to see the first examples of cave art and symbology, and also the development of musical instruments. These things may have preceded that date by a fair bit, but early attempts may have simply not been preserved. Musical instruments not made of bone may simply have decayed. (We have bone flutes dating to about 40,000 years\u2026) We don\u2019t know if our ancient ancestors engaged in art forms like storytelling or singing\u2026. But it seems very likely. The most primitive peoples ever discovered in modern times all do these things. We know that with the rise of the intellectual capacity of modern humans\u2026 Homo Sapiens Sapiens, our species experienced a considerable increase in general creativity. Our \u201ctool kit\u201d improved markedly. We not only used fire, we could make fire on demand. Art in general is very likely a product of the evolution of the human brain and human consciousness/sentience. We are evolved to see patterns, and perhaps to re-create them. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question! Since the appreciation of art is a mental event, I presume art could be \u201cexplained\u201d with sufficient neurological measurement while creating or appreciating it. I doubt this would a be a very satisfying causal explanation because art exists to evoke our passions which don\u2019t always allow rendering in words, which is why we make it in the first place. How we know our being can\u2019t always be explained in words, hence we turn to art to find those ineffable meanings in our lives. ",
