            "answer_text": "Warning: a teaser! A function to me, is a representation of some mathematical abstraction, perhaps involving some number crunching. How and when we use them is up to us. Many of them are fairly well known, like equations from linear algebra to compute the mortgage payment on a loan, or integrating the speed to capture the distance covered. However, in personal finance, such functions are not well publicized. Here is one real life situation for you - This is meant for a young professional in the middle class, like a school teacher, a police officer, a health care professional, or an engineer who has recently graduated with a higher degree. Lets say the job is in the San Francisco bay area, and the starting salary is in the range of $70-$110K. The problem: How can the above individual own his/her own house, valued at around $2M, in a time span of about 10 years (give or take)? Assumptions: The individual has no outstanding loans and no savings, either.S/he will not be doing anything illegal during this period.There will be no inheritance during the time required to own the home.I cannot give you the solution, someone will be suing me for giving out financial advice without a license. However, it exists, may be in slightly different variations, and I do not believe I am the only one to come up with a solution. Folks who solved this problem 10, 15 or 20 years back (housing in this area was expensive back then, too) are living in $MM homes today, more recent problem solvers are on their way to own their own homes. Those who can/do not solve it will keep bitching and moaning about how (1) the techies are getting all the houses with their stock options (2) the Chinese billionaires are buying up all available inventory (3) the demand/supply mismatches are jacking up home prices to make housing unaffordable, etc. etc. The solution involves a few equations from statistics, algebra, and some observation of the surroundings. With a little programming expertise, you can come up functions delivering fairly precise numbers, too. Have fun with functions :) ",

            "answer_text": "Functions Function is an expression, rule, or law that defines a relationship between one variable (the independent variable) and another variable (the dependent variable). For example, the position of a planet is a function of time. This relationship is commonly symbolized as y = f(x).  In the 'real-world,' functions are mathematical representations of many input-output situations. For example: A soda, snack, or stamp machine The user puts in money, punches a specific button, and a specific item drops into the output slot. Circumference of a circle is a function of diameter. Arm length is a function of height. A car's efficiency in terms of miles per gallon of gasoline is a function. The car's efficiency may be a function of the car's design (including weight, tires, and aerodynamics), speed, temperature inside and outside of the car, and other factors. A weekly salary is a function of the hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. Compound interest is a function of initial investment, interest rate, and time. Supply and demand. As price goes up, demand goes down. The length of a shadow is a function of its height and the time of day. Doing income taxes. Each tax table inputs your income and outputs your tax, and that's a function. Laying linoleum tile on a rectangular floor. The number of linoleum tiles you will need is a function of the length and width of your floor. Going scuba diving. The water pressure is a continuous function of the depth. Population is a function of time. Postage cost is a function of weight and destination. School grades are a function of hours of study. Taxi fare is a function of distance. The time to cook turkey is a function of its weight. ",
