These are just labels for styles. All styles inevitably have a historical and a non-historical aspect to them. Or even calling a city \u201cNew York\u201d. What\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d about it? Will there be a period \u201cafter postmodernism\u201d? As an aesthetic style? We\u2019re already in it. And people call it all sorts of things. As a more philosophical concern? Possibly not \u2026 postmodernism is the rejection of totalizing meta-narratives like psychoanalysis and Marxism. Maybe people will stop thinking that there has to be a grand unified cultural theory of everything, and will accept that culture is just within schools or genres that follow their own independent logics.

Very often new styles are new ideas not so strongly rejections of the current style. The next style is very likely to be new concepts not so strongly just rejections of the previous style. It will likely be named with a unique name unrelated to post modernism. ",
