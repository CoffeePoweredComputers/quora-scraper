            "answer_text": "Metaphysics is a compound word.  It implies that the first part pertains to the second part (physics) in a certain way.  Meta, though it can be used as a noun or adjective, is being used here as a combing form and that is where this implication comes from.  Meta as a combing form can denote different sorts or types of positions.  Given the use here, it denotes something of a higher or second-order kind- something positioned after, over or beyond physics With that being said, Aristotle defined metaphysics as the branch of philosophy that includes ontology (given physics, which other objects and entities validly exist, e.g. soul) and epistemology (knowledge, belief, truth) and anything else given physics, that otherwise deals with the first principles of things, including abstract concepts such as being, knowing, substance, cause, identity, time, and space.   Today, metaphysics is nearly unintelligible.  Most people, considering themselves to be postmodernists, brush aside the writings of astute philosophers and scientists who wrote extensively on metaphysics, preferring to believe that metaphysics is abstract theory or talk with no basis in reality. Now given all that, metaphysics is not intelligence or wisdom.  Relative to intelligence and wisdom, metaphysics represents first-principles without which the development of human intelligence and wisdom would as likely as not have gotten started.  There are plenty of examples of other animals with limited undeveloped (unprincipled, untrained) and thereby under-developed intelligence that prove that a recognition of first-principles are necessary to ground wisdom so that intelligence may grow and develop. Now that you have a case for under-developed and lack of growth in intelligence due to a lack of principles, we intuitively feel or know that human beings are not without principles, even if they themselves do not know what those principles are.  So, to the extent that someone examines their assumptions and considers their principles, they are practicing metaphysics-- they are doing what comes after being born into their present form with its given potentiality and intentionality. Lastly I need to mention the case of obviously great wisdom and understanding that is concretely based on first-principles that have been widely-recognized.  The fact is such cases are so obvious, as my folks would often say \"if it were a bear, and it bit you in the ass, then you would see it\" intimating it would be too late.  So I won't make you wait any longer.  The case is geometry.  The axioms of geometry worked out by Euclid a few thousand years ago are the first principles of the doctrine and the crux of geometric wisdom that grounds much of what we know and do today on the ground, in the air, above the earth and on private computer networks and on the internet. In summary, my metaphysics is the investigation of the first principles that ground wisdom in the facts of reality from which intelligence may grow,  develop and prosper given that all other conditions are equal.

            "answer_text": "As I see it, neither. Just a fact of the Universe. Meta = mental  Physics = matter.   With metaphysics, mental does not refer to intelligence but spirit/soul. I guess you wouldn't be far off considering it wisdom, but wisdom is more ofan opinion/analysis rather than fact.  Metaphysics contains karma, incarnation, soulmates, astral projection, etc.It should hold no problems for most theists/agnostics but not sure aboutatheists. ",
