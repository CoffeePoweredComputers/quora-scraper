            "answer_text": "According to Taylor (2012: 40), all versions of compatibilism (which he calls \u2018soft determinism\u2019) have three claims in common: (i) Determinism is true. (ii) We are free to perform an action A to the extent there are no obstacles that would prevent us from doing A, and we are not externally constrained (not forced by external causes) to do A. (iii) The causes of free actions are certain states, events, or conditions within the agent himself, e.g., an agent\u2019s own acts of will or volitions, or decisions, or desires, and so on. Claim (i) is made in common with hard determinism. Claims (ii) and (iii) are where the compatibilists part company with the hard determinists and attempt to explain how free will can be compatible with determinism. Taylor\u2019s objection to compatibilism is essentially a challenge to Claim (iii); that is, that the certain states, events, or conditions within the agent herself are themselves caused by external factors, consistent with determinism. My response to Taylor\u2019s objection is that the certain states or conditions within the agent could include the person\u2019s values, ethics, loyalties, priorities, and so on. Let us call these states or conditions within the agent \u2018values\u2019. These values may have external causes accumulated over the agent\u2019s lifetime. The important point is that an agent\u2019s values could give rise to more than one possible action by the agent, all of which are consistent with the agent\u2019s values. Let us call these possible consistent actions \u2018options\u2019. When faced with a decision to make, a rational agent would be likely to consider the options available to her and choose the best option. In this way, the options available to the agent stem from causes but the agent is making a free choice within the range of options available. A simple way of modelling this limited version of free will has been referred to by some philosophers as a \u2018Garden of Forking Paths\u2019 after the novel of the same name by Jorge Luis Borges (McKenna 2009:2.1; Iredale 2012: 14). In other words, there are alternative paths an agent could choose to take, but the paths available have been predetermined. Within this model, the agent meets the criterion of acting of her own free will, because she could have acted otherwise. Her ability to have acted otherwise is underwritten by her ability to have selected amongst, or chosen between, alternative courses of action (McKenna 2009:2.1).

            "answer_text": "If you have free will as defined by compatibilists, your choices are determined by your preferences, values, knowledge of the world and so on. If you have free will as defined by libertarians, your choices are undetermined, meaning they just happen for no reason. Libertarians would object to this saying that they do happen for a reason - they happen because you want to make them because of your preferences, values, knowledge of the world and so on; which would mean that they are really compatibilists rather than libertarians.
