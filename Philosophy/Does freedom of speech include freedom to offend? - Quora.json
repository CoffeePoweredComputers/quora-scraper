            "answer_text": "Absolutely. People are offended by all kinds of ridiculous things. For example abortion, gun control, taxes, standards of decency, \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d liberals, conservatives, evangelicals, atheists, Muslims, Catholics, stating opinions that are contrary to their own, secular education, handicapped people, drug users, alcoholics, unwed mothers, LGBT folks, non-heterosexual PDAs, heterosexual PDAs, promiscuous men or women, and sometimes simply the truth offends some people. So, there wouldn\u2019t be much speech at all if it did not include freedom to offend. ",
