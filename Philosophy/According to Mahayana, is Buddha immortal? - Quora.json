            "answer_text": "A person is always impermanent, but the Life of person is a cycle of Birth and Death. Birth&Death means that the current person cannot repeat, because each Rebirth is new. The word Buddha has 2 meanings: a person who attained enlightenment,a state of enlightenment of wisdom & compassion. (Buddha-state of mind)While a person is temporary, the STATE of enlightenment is eternal. Think of it as LOVE. Love existed all over the ages. No one \u201cinvents love\u201d. We experience it. The same with Enlightenment. The Buddha did not \u201cinvent\u201d Enlightenment. He did not \u201cinvent\u201d the State of Buddhahood. He just aligned his life to the life of the universe - and became in perfect harmony with the universal state of wisdom and compassion. The Buddha did not invent Compassion or Wisdom. These are eternal qualities of Life. Mahayana teaches that all you have to do is to be in harmony with your true nature (which is the Enlightened nature or the Buddhanature of compassion and wisdom). Mahayana teaches that you too has the same potential of enlightenment as the Buddha. It teaches you to trust yourself that you are not inferior and that you deserve the highest quality of a human being, which Shakyamuni manifested as our role model. The cycle of Birth&Death is eternal, and if you make your aim to attain enlightenment, then you yourself will become a Buddha in each lifetime, not that of great world-wide mission (with the media speaking about you) - but as you are, in your simple life in family or society, a happy and reasonable person leading others to happiness. This is manifesting the Buddha-state: \u201cIf we attain the state of Buddhahood in this lifetime, that state will forever pervade our lives. Throughout the cycle of birth and death in each new lifetime we will be endowed with good health, wealth and intelligence along with a supportive and comfortable environment, leading a life that overflows with good fortune. Each of us will also possess a unique mission and be born in an appropriate form to fulfil it\u201d.(Nichiren Buddhism, Ikeda: Faith into Action page 23) ",

            "answer_text": "There no only two Tradition of bhuddhism i.e Sanskrit Tradition & Pali Tradition. The Word Mahayana you referring to is a Sanskrit Tradition. The source of that institution was Nalanda in Bihar. Buddha or teacher means once you able to uproot all your mental kalesha through the direct realisation of Shunyata or emptiness and Bodhichitta. It seems your questions is, is Siddharth Gautam Buddha is immortal? According to Sanskrit Tradition bhuddhism, Siddharth Gautam Buddha is a fourth Buddha and he will remain as long as this universe exist. After that new Buddha will come once the new universes is born. Bhuddhism belive in thousands multiples of big bangs. Buddhism also believe in different millions of World like Earth and realms. So definitely, yes Siddarth Gautam Buddha is immortal now and in next universe even if may be under different Buddha as a teacher. He will still be immortal because Bhuddhism doesn't believe in Atman but in consciousness. So his consciousness will be permanent and busy helping sentient beings in some other different world. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f ",

The immortality signifies the forever existence of the conscious mind of Buddha beyond body demise. The shower signify rain of light droplets, knowledge that removes darkness of ignorance and provide enlightenment. The range power of enlightened spirit is infinite. The extent of learning until death limits the range of power of other spirits. ",
