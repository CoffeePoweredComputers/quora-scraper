            "answer_text": "Intelligence of any kind involves knowledge, and the relationship of knowledge to the real world and to abstract worlds. Philosophy, if done well, analyzes the nature of knowledge and offers insights that are useful in AI. Some parts of philosophy ask what is meaning, and that too is relevant to AI. A strong AI system has to deal with not just data but with knowledge and with how knowledge relates to things to form meaning.Some (but not all) of philosophy is useful to study because it gives the AI researcher a framework quite different from mere computer science alone.It is however also good to also study psychology, and not just philosophy alone, if you are pursuing AGI. While some philosophy tries to address the question of mind, you really need the tripod legs of AI/computer science, philosophy, and psychology to make the best progress in AI. It also is useful to have a framework in mathematics, with things like graph theory, category theory, and more, because you will be dealing with the structure of knowledge and ways to represent it. Philosophy doesn't quite handle the practical aspects of representing knowledge.There is a good author - John Sowa - who I recommend one do readings in before diving into philosophy studies with AI in mind. Sowa has written several rigorous and useful books about conceptual structures, and these tie right into philosophy of knowledge. ",

            "answer_text": "It won't. Philosophy is an enormous field, a good deal of which has nothing to do with mind.  Even those areas of philosophy that are concerned with the nature of consciousness , whilst increasingly informed by neuroscience and AI, are not themselves AI. So if your concern is to best understand AI, study AI not philosophy. ",
