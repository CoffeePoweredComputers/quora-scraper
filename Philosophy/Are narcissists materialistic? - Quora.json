            "answer_text": "Yes, they envy whoever has things better than them, even if the person worked hard to have these things and the narc just lied on the couch all day sleeping and watching TV. My narc father actually rambled whenever he saw someone with an expensive car on the street and my mother hated all the relatives who were well off because they dressed better and spent hours talking about how they dared to dress this way. Yet she just lied on the couch all day (I mean morning, afternoon and evening) and believed that working was too much effort and that she should not be expected to do so. Not only they are materialistic, they also believe that they are entitled to the life of a Maharajah without ever doing anything to deserve it, just because they exist. ",

Oddly, he himself didn't need a fancy car etc\u2026but what was funny was that he would show off my car\u2026the car he made sure he bought his wife bc \u2018she deserved the world\u2019 the house- that was completely renovated with the finest\u2026by me, his crafty, artistic wife\u2026or the neighborhood we lived in- how safe and neighborly it was\u2026 So, in essence, was he really materialistic? I think in a big, huge, gigantic way\u2026BUT\u2026who did he blame for being needy and wanty and materialistic? Yours truly\u2026 (which, btw\u2026I worked my whole life to attain nice things and can afford what I have without him bc of putting myself through school- I appreciate good things and give plenty\u2026actually, more than plenty\u2026) In short\u2026YES!!!

Better furniture. A better car. Of course the \u201cbest\u201d was impossible to reach. If I earned 50 she would ask for 80 and spend for 90. If I earned 80 she would ask for 100 and spend for 120. If I earned 100 she would claim 200 and spend for 300 - and every time she would devalue, insult and mistreat me for not measuring up to her expectations. There was always a point to compare me - higher and better than me invariably. No matter if 99 people in a hundred earned less money than me, she would always compare me with the only one who earned more - and there\u2019s always somebody that earns more than you. Also, she used to envy other people, even close friends of us, for the good or expensive things they had. ",
