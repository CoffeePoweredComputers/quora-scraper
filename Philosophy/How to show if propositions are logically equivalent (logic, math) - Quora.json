            "answer_text": "If you are looking to prove the basic foundations of Boolean Logic, then you usually want to start with truth-tables to do so. For more complicated logical expressions, you want to learn propositional calculus, and use that to demonstrate that for propositions \u2018p\u2019 and \u2018q\u2019 that you can prove both: And doing that demonstrates that . If you are not working with Boolean Logic, but are instead working with another logic system, then there is set of axioms and metatheorems that works with that logic system that will need to be studied to do the same.
