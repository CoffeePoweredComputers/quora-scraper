            "answer_text": "In my reading \u2014 The social evolution of Humanity centers on our development of Agriculture. Developing Agriculture in the first place transformed our species from wandering nomads, following herds, into settlers.After thousands of years, settlers finally established standing Armies to fight off the nomads who still believed in \u201cfinders keepers\u201d. Agricultural settlements became nations with enormous Armies. History became a matter of of gigantic Agricultural nations using their Armies to finally settle on the borders of each nation.As Agriculture developed, it didn\u2019t require 95% of the Work Force. Soon, it only required 75%. Then 50%. Then 25%. Then 10%. Today, in America, Agriculture takes about 5% of the Work Force. That is the main reason for the blossoming of a massive Consumer and Service Economy, bigger than the world has ever seen.\u2014- And without the development of Agriculture, none of that would have ever happened. There\u2019s my reading. ",

            "answer_text": "Only a few places in the world have wild food resources rich enough to allow dense populations of humans. And it is evidently only dense populations that can form large human societies\u2014achieved, sadly, largely though warfare. Agriculture is what allowed really dense populations, and really large societies, to develop in many parts of the world. I is interesting to note that the earliest really large nations and empires developed in what Robert L, Carneiro termed \u201ccircumscribed\u201d environments\u2014fertile river valleys hemmed in by mountains or deserts. These were virtually population-pressure cookers. ",
