            "answer_text": "Na\u00efve realism is also called direct realism. It is the philosophy that says the object of any mental act, such as perception, is directly present to the knower in propria persona. The thing itself is seen and known. Representative realism says that the thing known causes/creates an image of itself in the mind of the knower and it is that image that is known. Supposedly the image is isomorphic with the object known. It is much like a king sending an ambassador or a god sending a vicar, or the sheriff sending out deputies. Something is a stand-in for the original. For example when you look at your chair are you looking at and seeing the chair itself or are you looking at and seeing an imprint on your brain caused by \u2026 well, you know how science describes the working of the eye and brain? I personally am a direct realist. When I look out on the world I think I am directly seeing the things out there, including the relations between things. Representative realists call me na\u00efve, because, they say, reality is very different from my biased assessment of it. They say I am only seeing my own narcissistic view of things. They use the derogatory word \u201cna\u00efve\u201d because they think I am arrogant and I need to be more humble. Anyway, they say I often make mistakes in my seeing and that proves I am only seeing my own personal view of things. That I am representing the world to myself through representatives. I counter by saying that their representationalism is in fact solipsism and it goes against good sense. As for mistakes and illusions, I assert that mistakes and illusions are real things that I see directly. I then ask the representationalist how he sees those representations. Does he see them directly or through another representation? I assert that representationalism eventually becomes direct realism. Otherwise it is infinite viscious regress. ",

It states that we do not (and can not) perceive the external world directly; instead we know only our ideas or interpretations of objects in the world. Thus, a barrier or a veil of perception prevents first-hand knowledge of anything beyond it. The \"veil\" exists between the mind and the existing world. Representative realism ",
