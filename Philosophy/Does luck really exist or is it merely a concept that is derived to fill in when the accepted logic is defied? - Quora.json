            "answer_text": "I don't believe in the metaphysical definition for luck. For me luck is a word used to describe either: Something good happens to you that you didn't worked for, or;Something good and highly improbable happens to you.Then a lucky person would be someone who repeatedly has experienced either of the above. For bad luck, just change good for bad. Some people think luck can be given by a supernatural being, object, or determined by destiny. This can be considered as supersticious. Most of our rituals through history have been created to change someones luck. For me the word luck, and superstition overall, is used because of the fear of uncertainty and hoping that better times will come. BOOM. Religions are born. Too many people spend their lives waiting for luck to come. If you want something don't hope on luck or god. Work hard for it. Hope this answers your question. ",

            "answer_text": "Luck is a messy concept which refers to a very particular human view of reality. As Quora user Stuart Benson has stated in his answer[1] luck is the outcome of a random event So luck is a human appreciation of probability. Probability of an event is defined as the chance that the event will occur (given a certain experiment). When a person talks about or appeals to luck, what he is trying to communicate is that he hopes that the outcome of the experiment or activity is the one he wants. However, that appeal to luck is often believed to have some supernatural power that can favour the desired event over the others, that is why you wish someone luck when the odds are not very favourable (passing an exam for which you haven't studied) or the non-desirable event is specially negative (taking a plane and have an accident), but you don't wish luck when someone goes back home even if there is a small probability that his house will blow up in a gas explosion, because that is very unlikely to happen. Footnotes[1] Stuart Benson's answer to Does luck really exist or is it merely a concept that is derived to fill in when the accepted logic is defied?",

            "answer_text": "Luck has to do with wheter there is true randomness or not. If there is not, then luck is merely, as you conceived, the result of our incapacity of predict things (since, because there is no thing as a true randomness, things are predestinated). However, if there is such a thing as true randomness, then luck does exist, but its definition will be forever based in the human experience. For instance, we define \u201cgood luck\u201d as the things that are good for us, but the cosmos doesn\u2019t care about what we think. ",

            "answer_text": "Let us say that there is an exam for a highly coveted post. You have to write an essay and there are thousands others who are competing with you for the same post. What do you think are the odds that if the exact same essay was written by two of you, each would get the same grading. Pretty slim right? Your essay might be reviewed by someone who endorses the same view as the essay elaborates while the other might be reviewed by someone endorsing the divergent views. The examiner reviewing the other copy might have just had his marriage proposal accepted and be in a delightedly good mood while your examiner might have just had to pay a fine for jumping signals. It may so happen that the two examiners are sitting next to one another reviewing the same essay but one finished it in single go while the other had a call in between and got his rhythm broken, yet decided to continue reading half way with no memory of the ideas explored in the first half. Same essay. Same exam. Same time frame. Yet one will succeed and the other fail. Would you not call this luck? ",
