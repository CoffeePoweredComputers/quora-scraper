            "answer_text": "Anarchists are against states, and there are many institutions that are not states. All humans are mammals, but not all mammals are humans; all states are institutions, but not all institutions are states. An anarchist who inherently is against all institutions isn\u2019t drawing that dislike from the principles of anarchism, but from some other ideology they have. Nihilism is the anti-institution ideology (I\u2019m a Nihilistic Anarchist), but Nihilism isn\u2019t really \u201cagainst\u201d institutions as much as it is against clinging to institutions. Institutions (religious, political, educational, whatever) are human creations; the Nihilistic position is that any institution that does not serve the purpose it is supposed to serve should be torn down and replaced with one that will. Ergo, the Nihilistic position would be that we should have no particular loyalty for, fondness for, or attachment to the state, and we should instead ask ourselves whether the state sufficiently achieves the things we want it to achieve. The answer, of course, is \u201cNo,\u201d but the state is able to obfuscate that fact with political games and demagoguery, obscuring the fact that it\u2019s not Republicans or Democrats that are causing problems but the state itself. There are, of course, anarchists out there who hate any and all institutions (without respect to Nihilism), but there are people on all sides of ideologies that take things too far by extrapolating a specific idea and applying it to general areas. The state is a specific institution, and some would generalize their dislike so that they hate general institutions. This isn\u2019t inherently anarchistic, though. Just about anything is an institution. Five people getting together to form an organization that cleans up litter from the side of the highway have created an institution. Two people getting married create an institution. Enshrining one particular institution as the Ultimate Authority and granting it a license to use force, violence, and coercion to achieve its ends (e.g., a state) is what an anarchist would be against, but not the idea of institutions as a whole.

            "answer_text": "Not at all. Anarchists just oppose rulers. Those are the people who impose their will on others involuntarily. That said you will find leftists who claim to be anarchists but oppose all human interaction except gifting. They claim that trading your labor for something you value more is exploitation and somehow being ruled. They are obviously mistaken, but they are loud and so must be addressed. Anarchists simply want all interaction to be voluntary. You can trade your time and property as you see fit with anyone willing to trade their time or property with you. Anything voluntary goes and anything coercive is condemned. ",

Some institutions like religions are not bad in themselves but problems arise if there is a connection between Church and State.Institutions organised along the lines of/including (see Michel Foucault) schools, workplaces, factories, prisons and military units act like mini societies while being unrepresentative of society as a whole. As such, values can be perpetuated among them that are anti-social. For example if a Police Force is institutionally racist. ",
