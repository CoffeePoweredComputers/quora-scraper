            "answer_text": "Yes: attaining to a higher consciousness. There\u2019s no better evidence of a thing than directly observing that thing occurring. Even better is performing that thing when it\u2019s an activity one can perform. Even humans who have not achieved the highest levels of consciousness experience different levels of consciousness. Awaking from a dream, or even from a medically-induced unconsciousness, is experiencing a \u201chigher consciousness.\u201d Going from daydreaming or from being inattentive to being highly focused on a thought or task is going from a lower state of consciousness to a higher state of consciousness. And there\u2019s nothing mystical about this. It\u2019s perfectly normal and comprehensible to those who don\u2019t cloud their thinking with foolish philosophy, which is the sport of denying others\u2019 certainty about life and reality. Coming to the realization that you are not bound in the real world by the rules formally taught in colleges and universities in Philosophy classes is itself raising one\u2019s consciousness considerably. You want to raise your consciousness exponentially? Cultivate in your own character the two great attributes of being honest and principled. How does this elevate your consciousness? Because, first, it makes your mind trustworthy\u2014not only to others who come to know you, but also (and most importantly) to yourself! In a world being increasingly filled with LIARS, the best thing you can do for yourself is to make yourself an honest person. And being principled benefits you because the basis of all existence\u2014and all things in existence\u2014is law or principle. Everything is about government. Everything! Law is the basis of existence. Matter and energy are ruled by immutable natural laws. But even human relationships are rightly governed by immutable spiritual laws. These are laws that govern the immaterial and abstract aspects of human being. Learn and learn to live by these laws and all your relationships and social interactions will fare much better than they do when you violate those laws. The big difference between physical laws and spiritual laws is that physical laws work instantaneously, while spiritual laws tend to work over time\u2014though there are exceptions. For example, \u201cA soft answer turns away wrath\u201d can work instantaneously. I recall on one job, when I accidentally knocked a coworker\u2019s bottle of mouthwash off a ledge on a machine (where it had no business in the first place). And he came over yelling and cussing and making a big ruckus. I apologized profusely and offered to pay for a new bottle, wondering out loud how I could be so careless. Instantly, he quieted down and said it was no big deal. Of course, there is a level of consciousness that transcends natural human levels. And, for those who have come to the conclusion, not seeing evidence of either its existence or nonexistence, the evidence is impossible to see, though it occur right before their eyes. After all, consciousness is neither material nor visible. My answer to such a person who asks Is there any evidence of higher consciousness? is: Not for you. Because the fact is, no evidence of any kind or for any proposition you can name does its own work. It cannot break into a person\u2019s mind by force and cause what I call \u201cthe proof event\u201d to occur within that mind\u2014especially against a person\u2019s will. And typically when people ask, \u201cIs there evidence of [whatever]?\u201d what they\u2019re really asking is, \u201cIs there anything you can tell me that will force me to believe [whatever]?\u201d knowing very well that nothing you say is going to accomplish that. It\u2019s simply impossible to force the proof event to occur in a mind determined to prevent it. A higher consciousness simply won\u2019t fit inside a lower consciousness\u2014especially one that\u2019s not willing to expand. Not even if you try to cram it in with reason. Sorry.

            "answer_text": "Absolutely there is evidence of higher consciousness! And that evidence is available to virtually anyone of sound mind. Let\u2019s call the default state of consciousness for most adult humans \u201clower consciousness.\u201d That state of consciousness is associated with a range of brain waves called Beta. Think of Beta as being like a television channel that broadcasts on a specific frequency. The Beta channel is a \u201cnews\u201d channel, and the non-stop voice in our head is the program that runs virtually every waking hour. In order to turn that voice off we need to change channels. The recommended channel to switch to first is the Alpha channel. That\u2019s the \u201cmeditation\u201d channel. There are still some news segments in the Alpha channel, but with fine tuning the news can become more upbeat and at a lower volume. But the Premium channel? Well, that is the Theta channel. Think of Theta as the \u201cDisney\u201d channel. Children from the ages of two to six are tuned into Theta almost exclusively. On that channel their programming might be called \u201cThe Magic Kingdom.\u201d Most adults habitually stay tuned in to the Beta channel because the news is ALL about them. As a result, it is rare for adults to be able to tune in to the Theta channel\u2026 except a short few minutes as they are about to fall asleep\u2026 or when they are asleep and dreaming. To be sure, the dream state can be thought magical\u2026 especially if in a lucid dream when you waken within a dream before you awaken to the voice of Beta. Now imagine being able to tune into the Magic Kingdom when you\u2019re eyes are wide awake\u2026 a.k.a. become lucid awakened\u2026 within the Magic Kingdom. And, should you wonder if, likewise, when you become awakened, life begins to appear like a dream come true, you be correct. We ALL have spent years as children tuned in to the Magic Kingdom channel. Our memory of it is likely misplaced, but it\u2019s there. So spending time in the Meditation channel can help in our remembering the joy of Theta, where the magic of life flows effortlessly before our eyes\u2026 ever manifesting more and more evidence of higher consciousness. And, if you\u2019re wondering, yes, you may even find Deity there within the Kingdom.
