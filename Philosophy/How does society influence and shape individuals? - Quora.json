            "answer_text": "Unless you are raised by wolves or in a closet or basement, and even then, to the extent that genes are influenced by social evolution, everything that influences and shapes individuals comes from society. Humans seem to do better in groups (societies) than as isolated individuals. We are pretty good at cooperation, and the better we cooperate, the more powerful and successful we become as a species, and the more our genetic heritage reinforces the strength of the relationship between society and the individual. Without a society of humans, there couldn\u2019t be individual humans. We wouldn\u2019t be alive. At the very least, at least until human cloning is standard, we all need the genetic material from a man and a woman in order to come into existence. The minimum number of people to form a society seems to be two \u2014 a parent and a child (unless the wolves really can raise children, but then, that\u2019s a society, too). Most of us are born into societies made of far more than two people. So our behavior is noticed by thousands of people, directly. We get feedback from those people in many ways. Some of the feedback is directly related to us, and is provided specifically with the intention to tell us how to be human. Most other feedback we get is from the body language of strangers or people less well known to us or from their words and other reactions, and this all helps us figure out what to do in order to survive. I think it safe to say that without society, the vast majority of human beings could not survive. There might be a few \u201cMy Side of the Mountain\u201d loners who can live off the land and need no contact with other humans, but I bet they still need some kind of contact with living beings. For most of us, though, society is the life force. Being able to fit in well enough to survive is essential, and so most people learn to do that to some degree or another. And, like other animals, our ability to pass our genes on to succeeding generations depends, in part, on our status within society. The more status we have, the better we can prepare our children to survive or the more access we have to what is necessary to reproduce. I\u2019d say that we aren\u2019t human without human society. We don\u2019t make sense as isolated individuals and we can\u2019t survive as isolated individuals. In that sense, it makes sense to see humankind as an organism made up of cooperating individual humans, the same way as individual humans are made up of cooperating cells. The cells can\u2019t exist without the other cells they cooperate with. Humans can\u2019t exist without the other humans we cooperate with. If we can\u2019t cooperate with others, it\u2019s much more likely we will be excluded from society, which is a sentence to death without reproduction. So most people are completely influenced and shaped by society. There is no way to overstate the influence that society has on individuals. ",

            "answer_text": "At an early age our parents have great influence on how we behave and on our moral values. While growing up you go to kindergarten, school, etc , etc Depending where you grow up, and the things you listen and do you are building your personality, many times you emulate , copy and react to life situations depending on your closest influences, and experiences. In my native country we did joke about black people, Jewish people, Italian , etc, but when I came to USA racism took a different turn. I saw a different point of view, I understood you will be judged for your skin color, the way you walk, speak, dress and where you live. I speak and write broken English, and I understand I will be discriminated , example: When I moved from New Jersey to Florida I try to find short cuts, got lost and stopped a bar to have a drink and ask for directions the man behind the counter responded: Quote\u201d we do not serve your kind\u201d Now depending if you go to church or go to a musk or synagogue you are going to be influence in how you see the world thru \u201creligion\u201d We have people that have friends, and this friends influence them to blow themselves up in the name of Allah. I was offered the opportunity to start a business in Germany, and knowing how German people are, I declined. Don\u2019t need to be abused anymore. Regardless where you go in our world people have their own opinions of life, countries, religion some find balance some other become extremists and go killing people because they don\u2019t the other person political opinions. Depending on your personal up bringing , life experiences, religions, friends you are going to be shaped to believe in one thing or another. Example: statistically speaking people from South America believe they are entitled to Universal Health Care, but in Uruguay South America my parents always paid blue cross and Blue shield insurance, so I know Universal Health Care does not work, more over when the government takes control of your health care bone and organs transplant like they did in Uruguay , my mother was told she needed to wait 2 years for a hip transplant, so two years on painkillers ! The above is how society influence and shape individuals ",

Are they soft like tissue paper (highly absorbent or like hard steel (nothing penetrates, their mind is made up). How dramatic is the message? Is it highly impactful like a tsunami on your doorstep? Or is it low impact, like a tiny ant crawling through the back forty acres, where you don't even know of its existence. Does the person want to be open, grow and change? Or are they convinced they are always right, now and forever? Are they teachable or closed down? How novel is the concept? So new that they cannot begin to comprehend its reality? (Such as the natives who first saw Columbus' ships in the harbor and were convinced they didn't see them until the sailors were on their beach?) How many times has the message been repeated with authority? A commercial on TV watched a 1000 times or one tiny newsprint ad that you've seen only once? Does the item coordinate with your values and life purpose or is it antithetical to what you value and believe? (For instance I hate guns. I doubt any one could persuade me to buy and use one). ",

Contrary to common thought, which makes its way into \"Scripture,\" tentative-appreciation rather than love is the natural impulse between two humans. Anticipating appreciation is a civic response, meaning it happens because the two persons happen to be in the same place at the same time. If there is agreement to converse, appreciation might begin yet autonomy and fidelity are preserved. The conversation may end forever or not, without ruining civic appreciation. Sometimes, but not often, appreciative bonding, perhaps limited to the psychological, with no intimacy, is the eventual consequence. With appreciative bonding there is the potential for intimacy and beyond intimacy, love. Revised 5/19/16. PRB ",

            "answer_text": "My answer is very simple. Society shapes the life of individuals in many, many ways. How their parents think and act, how their teachers think and act, how their friends, fellow students and fellow employees think and act, how their employers think and act, how other people in their community think and act, how their local, state and national governments think and act - all these are influenced by the society as a whole and in its separate parts. Of course there are some factors in the way individuals\u2019 lives are shaped that are dependent on their genetic make-up, but even that is influenced by their social environment, because certain situations cause some genes to fire and some to remain dormant. Examples of this are seen clearly when people have to fight to defend their freedom, or flee from persecution or suffer the extreme dislocation of outright warfare. Immigration can also shape individuals to a lesser or greater extent, as they need to learn new skills in order to survive in the new country. I could go on and on, but I think that I have made my point. :-) ",

They know that their relationship will never get acceptance in their parents\u2019 eyes because of the social norms, because of \u201clog kya kahenge?\u201d See, one thing we need to understand that our society was like this for a long time, where people around us used to poke their noses in private matters, throw opinions about anything & everything. That was a standard. Once my mom told me, when she was in her early 20s, how even talking to a male friend in the neighborhood used to cause problems later on. I must say that things have definitely improved in some matters but we still need to do a lot better. Now coming to your question, I think you already understand. Yes society influences our lives at every step. To live in a society there\u2019re certain standards we\u2019ve to maintain. We just can\u2019t go about doing anything. There\u2019s this invisible rope that prevents us to go beyond certain parameters or boundaries. We\u2019re confined to a limited space but we don\u2019t realize it, because we\u2019ve learnt to live with it.  Society shapes us from our childhood to become a part of it, the larger community. The series of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts that are taught to you the moment you learn to grasp your surroundings. Why? Did you ask for it? No. These are the societal standards, a dynamic equilibrium where half your life choices are already made by the people around you. :)  Image source: Google Thanks for reading! ",

One factor in this narrative is that human persons are bundled<>clustered together by their culture/society, which can be closed or open. At this junction, it is pertinent to compare and contrast human persons and human individuals. In this context, a fundamental difference between an open and a closed society is that, in an open society there is the probability for human persons to recognise themselves as human marionettes, (functioning throughout a designed set for thinking) and to accept that, in fact, they are prompted to act by the power acquired by other persons upon them, and this probability is greater in open that in in- closed societies. If a person becomes aware of the conditioning that is applied on them, then that person might start the process towards individualization<>individuation, which alas is often reduced to person\u2019s vain desires for transcending their own conditioned images of themselves or personality, instead of pursuing what is immanent in themselves: namely, the improvement of humanity by actions devoid of antagonism that are increasingly recognised as actions with a distinct and actual value that might serve as a template for the universal response to the human universal quest that actually is being built within the human condition context.
