            "answer_text": "Does the human brain use any form of quantum entanglement? Let's be reasonable and optimistic about this question. If plants can adapt quantum coherence for photosynthesis, if birds can navigate their long migration routes and sharks can sense blood miles from its source with quantum entanglement, how less can we attribute quantum entanglement to the faculty of understanding in humans? Rather than thinking of quantum mechanics as some inaccessible eccentricity of theoretical physics, why not think of it as a intrinsic part of natural evolution? That is precisely what the promising new field of quantum biology intends to do. What is Quantum Biology? From the website of the Lindau Nobel Laureates we have the following statement: \"The beauty of Physics is mainly represented by its remarkable capability to understand any fascinating natural phenomena, from the origin of rainbows to the formation of a star, from the blue color of the sea to the changing seasons, and even the basic functioning of man-made objects and techniques such as lasers, barcodes, smartphones, computers, GPS, LEDs, transportation systems, etc., which all of us heavily use in our everyday lives. That\u2019s why physics can be seen as the foundation of many disciplines of science and also allows to understand and solve completely different problems in other fields including, among others, medicine, biology, engineering, and social sciences. It basically consists of two branches that focus on the macroscopic and microscopic world: They are called classical and quantum physics, respectively. To test and apply the latter, one usually needs to go to very sophisticated and expensive labs that make it possible to observe the fragile properties of very tiny objects like atoms and electrons or to engineer complex but very clean nanostructrures which is often only possible at temperatures that are much colder than any place on Earth. However, recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown that \u201chot and wet\u201d natural macroscopic phenomena like photosynthesis, olfaction and bird navigation can be investigated remarkably well through quantum physics.\" Quantum Entanglement and the Brain Dr. Dirk K.F. Meijer, a professor at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands published an article in the September 2017 edition of NeuroQuantology that reviews and expands upon the current theories of consciousness that arise from the meeting of neuroscience and quantum physics. A new theory based on quantum entanglement says your mind exists in another dimension Dr. Meijer \u201cOur brain is not a \u2018stand alone\u2019 information processing organ: it acts as a central part of our integral nervous system with recurrent information exchange with the entire organism and the cosmos. In this study, the brain is conceived to be embedded in a holographic structured field that interacts with resonant sensitive structures in the various cell types in our body.\u201d These resonant structures have been identified by the team of Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff as \"microtubules\", tiny helical tube structures at quantum scale that resonate with quantum vibrations. Microtubules are found inside brain neurons and vital organs of the body, as well as in all biological life forms. Roger Penrose realized that our ability to \"understand\" could not be a feature of a deterministic Turing machine or computer calculation; rather, our faculty of understanding must derive from outside any deterministic system; the quantum world immediately suggested itself so the search was on to find the relevant structure to match quantum scale. Stuart Hameroff found that scale in the brain's microtubules. These microtubules have since been shown to resonate with quantum level vibrations. They call their theory of consciousness, Orchestrated Objective Reduction, or Orch OR. Hameroff-Penrose / Review of Orch OR Theory Orch OR dovetails well with a previous brain theory developed by renowned theoretical physicist David Bohm and Stanford professor Karl Pribram called Holonomic Brain Theory, which characterizes the brain as a \"receiver\", similar to the \"reducing valve\" theory of brain advocated by Henri Bergson, William James and Aldous Huxley. The following snippets from the Dr. Meijer article above present some of his ideas about quantum brain entanglement: \"... our consciousness exists in a field surrounding the brain. This field is in another dimension. It shares information with the brain through quantum entanglement, among other methods. And it has certain similarities with a black hole. ...Information comes together and interacts in the brain more quickly than can be explained by our current understanding of neural transmissions in the brain. ...consciousness could be sharing information with the brain through quantum entanglement. ...Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which particles appear to be connected over vast distances. When actions are performed on one of the particles, corresponding changes are observed on the other simultaneously. This would allow for rapid processes like the fast exchange of information between consciousness and the brain \u2014 rapid processes which can\u2019t be explained with classical physics. ...In quantum mechanics electrons and photons exist in the form of waves, but can also behave like particles. In a manner of speaking, they are both waves and particles. ...the mental field is non-material and at the same time physically part of the brain: it is directly dependent on the brain physiology but not reducible to it. ...The implicit suggestion of a non-material and extra-corporal mental workspace, that supervenes our neural system and provides the dominant part of self-consciousness (the big \u201dI\u201d), that acts in addition to our daily experienced conscious state (called the small \u201dI\u201d), is supported by earlier and also more recent observations in fNMR studies that long term memory is not correlated with scaled sizes of the brain.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Not that we know of. It is not even clear, at least to me, whether the brain operates at the quantum level or higher. As for the brain using entanglement, why would it? What entanglement would effectively do is require two bits stored where one would suffice, and if merely wanted a copy, why not just make a copy? The problem with entanglement for this purposes is the entanglement is destroyed on an interaction of either part. So I can\u2019t see any advantage in doing it, and nature usually takes the easiest most useful route, and does not make things more complicated than they need be, since if it did it would consume a lot more resources. Entanglement is not that easy to create. ",
