            "answer_text": "Hehehe\u2026.a lovely question it is. You might be thinking why am I laughing? No offense, but I cannot help but smile on your question. Nobody can ever write a rulebook to live your life. Life is different in different continents, different geographies, different nations, different cities, different areas, different homes and with different people. Life is a gift. You are blessed to have a life in which you have a mind to think and ask this question. This mind of yours has already opened up infinite possibilities for you. Life is mostly hit and run and rarely following the predefined. Success is merely your way of thinking. Everybody is successful in some things and unsuccessful in others. Like in childhood, when you finally learn riding a bicycle, you have already become successful. Success should not be associated with life , as a whole. Instead, success should be associated with the tasks we define for ourselves. One might fail in becoming a CA, but might succeed in earning a handsome income. One might fail in making friends, but might succeed in topping a university. Evaluate yourself, you must have been successful in some things. And if u do not find those things worth celebrating your success, then work for other things. Do not stop ever. Do not take your life ever. Getting a chance to live like a human being is like getting a million dollars to spend. Remove all the toxic habits and people and situations from your life. Help others without expecting anything in return. Celebrate little achievements of yourself. Those can be any. Like if you are really short tempered, and if u remain calm for a single day, without involving in any quarrel or argument with anybody, celebrate it. You have been successful in keeping yourself calm for 1 day. Start doing something new. Get a makeover, change your appearance. Indulge in a new hobby. The newness these things will bring in you life , will open new horizons for you to test yourself. Believe me you are wonderful and so can be your life. Always give your life another chance. It is fun to explore and test yourself. Live , don't die and stop the adventure. ",

            "answer_text": "Because Life is relative. Some people find success in being able to pay more than $3000 for a $3 sports bra, just because Jennifer Lawrence wore it in Silver Linings Playbook.  While others find success in giving away their $3 shoes to someone who needs it more.  Some people see failure as not being able to achieve material value.  While some see failure as not being able to see the little things that really matter.  Some people equate happiness to the value of their assets.  While others find happiness in the value of their children\u2019s smiles.  We call it day and night, and count each as a blessing, while in reality, we\u2019re gracefully falling towards our Sun. We call it growing up, and appreciate the reward of age, while in reality, our bodies are slowly but surely, degenerating to certain death. The reward of Life depends on how you perceive it. It is not a race, with a finish line called Success. No, its a journey, and how you choose to experience it is what determines success or failure. You were not given targets to achieve when you were born. All the above people are justified in their interpretations of life. There will be hard times, and there will be good. Each will come with its challenges and rewards, but remember, when things get to the absolute worst and you think you\u2019ve failed, you\u2019ll still be alive, that\u2019s the one thing this journey can\u2019t take from you. All you can do, is start over and try and make it better, not repeating the mistakes you did. It won\u2019t get any worse than that, because when your life finally comes to an end, so does your journey. ",
