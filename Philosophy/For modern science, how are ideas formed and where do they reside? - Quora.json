            "answer_text": "Conscious thought\u2014the formation and retention of ideas\u2014resides in the prefrontal cortex, the most anterior part of the brain\u2019s frontal lobe. It\u2019s the surface gray matter of the brain just behind the forehead and above the eyes. This area is very little developed in most other mammals.  This brain region has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behavior, personality expression, decision making, and moderating social behavior. The basic activity of this brain region is considered to be orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals. The most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is executive function. Executive function relates to abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and best, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and social \"control\" (the ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes).
