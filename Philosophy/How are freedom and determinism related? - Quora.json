            "answer_text": "How are freedom and determinism related? If you look it superficially, it looks like freedom and determinism are the opposite. How can you have a freedom if everything is determined in advance? Well, this is true if you think of freedom as the ability to do anything that you want to do. But, if you can do everything that you want to do, will you experience freedom? Actually not. Think of a person that does not have any obligation, who can follow any caprice that he has. Will that person be a free person? Actually not, he will be a slave to his wimps. Now think of a person who is serving a time in jail for political \u201ccrimes\u201d. He may experience far more freedom than his fellow citizens that \u201cfollow the rules\u201d. We are used to think of freedom as something that is outside of us, that have been given to us. However, freedom is more of a being a person can have. Two people that live in the same condition can have completely different experience of freedom. To conclude, a thought: is it possible that actually understanding that our world is deterministic, allows us to experience real and complete freedom? ",

            "answer_text": "Question: How are freedom and determinism related? I have been indoctrinated with the teachings of Fate and Predestination I have spent years wondering about that issue I have analyzed the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and prayed to God to guide me to the truth. Now I can clarify that the teachings of predestination or fate are not consistent with the teachings of Prophets. God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God has enabled people to choose their own destinations. God does not predetermine plans for us. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free. The Muslim scholars who teach that the fate of people had been determined before they were born and before they had any chance to do good or bad are mistaken; they ignore the basic Qur\u2019an verses like 4:147, 4:152, 6:48, 6:54, 17:15, 45:15,43:72, 16:35, 19:63, 19:76, 20:112, 34:50, 37:39, 39:41, 39:70, 40:17, 47:17, 55:60, 56:24, and 18:107 The verses teach that God does not predestine people\u2019s fate but gives them the choice either to obey and do good deeds or to rebel and do evil deeds; there is no punishment for those who choose to obey and to thank God. The Muslim scholars who teach that Islam is the only true religion are mistaken; they have been ordered to believe in what has been revealed to Moses, Jesus and other Prophets as taught in Qur\u2019an verses 3:84, 4:136, 4:152 and 42:13 Prophets did not teach predestination. Jesus did not teach predestination or predetermination. The only exceptions are the teachings of Paul who was not educated by Jesus and who taught the distorted teachings of predestination, original sin, atonement, and salvation by grace without obedience to God\u2019s law. The teachings of predestination were taught by Paul in Romans 8 , Ephesians 1, and 1 Corinthians 2:7 The distorted teachings of predestination and election of Augustine and Calvin are not based on the teachings of Jesus but are based on the wrong teachings of Paul. Jesus did not teach that a man is justified according to God\u2019s plan or by faith without the deeds of the law; In Matthew 16:27 and John 5:29, Jesus has confirmed that God will reward each person according to his deeds; those are the basic teachings of the old testimony like the verses taught in Psalm 62:12, Ecclesiastes 12:14, and many other old testimony verses. Bad scholars do not teach the true teachings like Matthew 10:8 \u2018Freely you have received; freely give\u2019; they teach that it is o.k. to reap the financial gifts in exchange of the spiritual gifts and teach the attractive ones \u2018And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified\u2019 Romans 8:30 They try to make people feel happy with such attractive teachings in order to receive more donations. \u201cIf we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?\u201d 1 Corinthians 9:11. Most Christians do not follow the strict teachings like If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away which is taught by Jesus in Matthew 18:9, Matthew 5:29 and Mark 9:47, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018God has chosen us before the foundations of the world\u2019 - Ephesians 1:4 \u2018God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation\u2019 - 2 Thessalonians 2:13 \u2018For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation\u2019 - 1 Thessalonians 5:9 \u2018But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed!\u2019 1 Corinthians 15:51 \u2018God has saved us and called us\u2019 - 2 Timothy 1:9 \u2018We have been justified through faith\u2019 - Romans 5:1, Romans 5:9 Most Christians do not follow the strict teachings which urge us to obey God as taught by Jesus in Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Mark 12:28-34, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018We are saved by grace through faith apart from works\u2019 - Ephesians 2:8-9 \u2018Even when we were dead in sins, we are saved by grace\u2019 - Ephesians 2:5 \u2018A man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law\u2019 - Romans 3:28 \u2018A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith\u2019 - Galatians 2:16 \u2018For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse\u2019 - Galatians 3:10 Most Christians believe that Jesus\u2019 death was necessary for the forgiveness of sins. But Jesus, like all other prophets, taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. No human sacrifice is necessary for salvation. No human bloodshed is necessary for salvation. No savior should die for the salvation of others; everyone is responsible for his own salvation. Jesus has confirmed the same in Matthew 18:21-35, 6:14-15, Mark 11:25-26, Matthew 25:31-45, Luke 15:11-32, and Luke 6:36-37 https://www.quora.com/What-can-you-say-and-feel-about-Jesus-Christ-and-his-atonement/answer/Sabri-Shahin The wrong teachings about predestination, original sin, atonement, and salvation by grace without obedience to God\u2019s law were taught by Paul who was not educated by Jesus. How can you validate my claims? The best advice is to ask God to guide us to the truth. The door is open for everyone to experience divine intervention The wise and merciful father keeps his door open for his children God has more wisdom and mercy than any wise merciful father People can communicate with God at any time Prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have urged us to ask God and taught that God answers the prayers of the obedient believer. Example verses are: Psalm 107:28-30, Psalm 18:6, Psalm 145:18, 2 Chronicles 7:14, Isaiah 58:9 Matthew 7:7, Mark 11:24, Luke 6:27-28, James 4:2, Qur\u2019an 2:186, Qur\u2019an 40:60 Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. I have spent years wondering about what the purpose of life is. I have analyzed the teachings of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and prayed to God to guide me to the truth. I had some doubts about the teachings of a certain teacher, I have prayed to God to guide me to the truth I saw in a very clear dream that teacher in a form of a criminal prisoner, has committed evil, waiting for his trial. In another dream I saw a wolf hiding after attacking sheep; I understood that message as the bad teacher who try to mislead people by the bad teachings as Jesus explained in Matthew 7:15-20 \u201cBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves\u201d. I also remembered the Parable of the Weeds in which Jesus warned us about the enemy who insert false teachings into the scripture in Matthew 13:24-43 \u2018an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat\u2019 Pray and ask God to guide you about the teacher who claims that God does not exist; you will see him in a bad image Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who teaches that Jesus is God Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who claims that God tests us in this life and will reward us according to our obedience and good deeds Pray to God to know the truth about the teacher who taught original sin, atonement, salvation not based on obedience but taught free salvation by a savior to die for our sins Again, do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us. Isaiah 58:9 \u2018Then you will call, and God will answer. you will cry for help, and he will say: Here am I\u2019.

            "answer_text": "DETERMINISM AND FREEWILL DEFINED Before proceeding further, let\u2019s ensure that all readers at least superficially understand what these terms mean. Determinism is\u2026 \u201c\u2026the theory that everything that happens must happen as it does and could not have happened any other way.\u201d [determinism Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary] \u201c\u2026in philosophy, the theory that all events, including moral choices, are completely determined by previously existing causes. Determinism is usually understood to preclude free will, because it entails that humans cannot act otherwise than they do.\u201d [Determinism | philosophy] Free will is\u2026 \u201c\u2026the ability to act and make choices independent of any outside influence.\u201d [free will Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary] \u201c\u2026in humans, the power or capacity to choose among alternatives or to act in certain situations independently of natural, social, or divine restraints. Free will is denied by some proponents of determinism.\u201d [Free Will] COEXISTENCE OF PARTIAL DETERMINISM AND PARTIAL FREE WILL Freedom and determinism are mutually exclusive if, and only if, we take determinism as absolute and all-inclusive \u2014 a presumption against which I argue and present evidence in Joel Lantz's answer to If all our actions are derived from our genetics and our environment/past, is freewill an illusion?. However, if we more realistically consider the following for humans... Partial determinism \u2014 SOME (not all) human events, are determined by previously existing causes.Substantial free will \u2014 MUCH power or capacity in humans to choose among alternatives or to act in independently of natural, social, or divine restraints....then determinism and free will are not mutually exclusive. Illustration #1Some scientists and philosophers would have us believe that our inherited genomes substantially predetermine our behaviors and destinies; some even think that we should excuse criminal behavior on the basis of supposed genetic determinism. [1] Is that true? The following arguably better illustrates reality: Partial determinism \u2014 some person-specific genes we inherit may predispose us toward certain cancers and other diseases, and may make certain behaviors more likely or harder to overcome. One may say that\u2019s partially deterministic.Substantial free will \u2014 However, though faulty genetic sequences in our DNA are inherited, and may result from many generations of parentage, the expression of those genes \u2014 the epigenetics [2, 3] \u2014 is in many cases not. Most importantly, the epigenetics is affected by lifestyle choices:  \u201cThe field of epigenetics is quickly growing and with it the understanding that both the environment and individual lifestyle can also directly interact with the genome to influence epigenetic change\u2026There are numerous examples of epigenetics that show how different lifestyle choices and environmental exposures can alter marks on top of DNA and play a role in determining health outcomes.\u201d [3] <Emphases are mine.>  \u201cWhat you eat, where you live, who you interact with, when you sleep , how you exercise, even aging \u2013 all of these can eventually cause chemical modifications around the genes that will turn those genes on or off over time.\u201d [2]Illustration #2 As another example, we all make frequent choices to give in to inclinations (some of which may be harmful to us or others) or to resist. Giving in is the easy way out, and successfully resisting requires proactive free will. Situations and drives beyond our control may influence the difficulty with which we resist certain inclinations/temptations, but ultimately we must exercise free will to successfully resist them. Functional MRI (fMRI) studies of the brain, which detect blood flow in specific areas of the brain, seem widely misused these days to supposedly support the absence of genuine (vs. illusory) free will. See the rebuttal comments and reference in endnote 17 of https://www.quora.com/If-all-our-actions-are-derived-from-our-genetics-and-our-environment-past-is-freewill-an-illusion/answer/Joel-Lantz. Such studies arguably do not legitimately show the absence of free will.However, some such studies support the presence of free will. For example, one such study (performed with appropriate experimental controls) compared fMRI scans of young, healthy male volunteers as they viewed sexually-explicit videos, first before asking the men to deliberately suppress sexual arousal and then after. Some areas of the brain \u2018dimmed\u2019 and others \u2018lit up\u2019 in the fMRI scans when the subjects mentally suppressed sexual arousal \u2014 objectively suggesting free-will inhibition of strong biologically-driven inclinations. [M. Beauregard, J. L\u00e9vesque, and P. Bourgouin, Neural Correlates of Conscious Self-regulation of Emotion, Journal of Neuroscience 21 (2001): RC165 (1\u20136).] What we see here is\u2026Partial determinism \u2014 Strong biological sex drives passed down through many generations.Substantial free will \u2014 Conscious, proactive efforts to successfully suppress biological sex drives.BOTTOM LINE Degrees of determinism and free will both exist, and we are to some extent influenced by factors beyond our control. But we cannot ultimately blame our choices and destiny on determinism. Again, I suggest reviewing Joel Lantz's answer to If all our actions are derived from our genetics and our environment/past, is freewill an illusion?.

Haycock, Murderous Minds \u2014 Exploring the Criminal Psychopathic Brain: Neurological Imaging and the Manfestation of Evil, Pegasus Books, 2014.Forensic psychologist Max Wachtel, Sociopaths and Psychopaths: A Crisis of Conscience and Empathy, Cherry Creek Press, 2017, Kindle Edition.Simplest explanation of epigenetics: https://www.whatisepigenetics.com/what-is-epigenetics/Fundamentals of epigenetics and examples: https://www.whatisepigenetics.com/fundamentals/",

            "answer_text": "The relationship between freedom and determinism is that they are mutually exclusive. Determinism posits that all activity in the universe is both (i) the effect of [all] prior activity, and (ii) the only activity that can occur given the prior activity. That is what is meant by saying that everything is \u201cdetermined\u201d \u2014 it is the inexorable consequence of activity that preceded it. In a deterministic universe, everything that has ever occurred, is occurring, and will occur since the universe came into existence (however that might have occurred) can only occur exactly as it has occurred, is occurring, or will occur, and cannot possibly occur in any different manner. This mandated activity necessarily includes all human action, including all human cognition. Freedom exists when the state of affairs that exists in the universe immediately prior to a human action does not compel all by one action and permits the human to act in an unconstrained manner. Based on the foregoing, if Determinism is true, human beings lack the ability to act in a manner that is not 100% caused by prior activity that is outside of their control, and thereby lack freedom. By the same token, if humans do possess the freedom to act in a manner that is not entirely compelled by prior activity in the universe, then Determinism is false. In the final analysis, Determinism and Freedom simply cannot coexist. Indeed, to posit the coexistence of these two incompatible concepts violates the principle of non-contradiction, which is a bedrock foundation of logic. ",

Some people reflect on this and say: hang on, maybe you\u2019re not really free if you are forced to act by your brain, or by the laws of physics, or by the weight of past events. But this is silly. It is not what is meant by \u201cfreedom\u201d in normal parlance. It is like saying that the speed limit on the highway is not really a \u201climit\u201d because it is possible to exceed it, unlike a real physical limit, like the speed of light.

            "answer_text": "Determinism is the doctrine that everything that happens has a cause and is therefore inevitable. These effects become in their turn the causes of further effects. Thus chains of cause and effect extend through time and space. In science, the discovery by Isaac Newton of the laws of motion and gravitation provided the basis for an entirely mechanistic explanation of the universe. This led the French astronomer Pierre-Simon to assert that it was possible for the mind- if provided with data regarding all the forces operating in the universe, together with information about the mass, dimensions and positions of all objects that lie within it- to work out both the past and future of everything. The 18th-century Scottish philosopher David Hume suggested that causality may be no more than a habit of mind, without any logical validity. In the 20th Century, quantum mechanics has shown that in the realm of subatomic particles, indeterminacy prevails. The fact that determinism appears to deny the existence of free will, and therefore the moral responsibility of individuals for their actions, presents a central problem in ethics. In politics, those on the right tend to emphasize the individual's own responsibility for their condition while those on the left point out that an individual's condition is to a great extent determined by external factors such as environment, education and upbringing.
