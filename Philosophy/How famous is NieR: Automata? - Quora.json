            "answer_text": "I literally just finished playing this game, it's a\u2019ight, it's pretty good to play, has a lot of variation, looks good and it was interesting. There's something that just didn't gel though and it's hard to put it into words. I'm going to try and avoid it but just in case I'm gonna throw out a potential Spoilers Ahead alert. There were a lot of things I liked about Nier Automata but they were also offset by things that I didn't like. Let's start with the gameplay, there's a lot of variations in the gameplay, sidescrolling action, twin stick shooter, arcade bullet hell flight combat, free roaming exploration and different characters with very different abilities. At first the controls are incredibly busy, you've got your melee light and heavy attack combos, jump, miscellaneous action (for opportunity attacks), long range light damage that you can manually aim or auto aim (took me a while to realise you could toggle the lock on so for a few hours I was holding the lock on button constantly), a powerful time charge attack and a dodge (you really need the dodge). Putting this all together you are constantly using all four shoulder/trigger buttons and all the face buttons simultaneously. You don't really ease into this, it's just a baptism of fire and honestly my first impression was \u201cthis is overwhelming\u201d but you get used to it and it definitely makes the game exciting to control.Sorry, wasn't a fan of the music, I felt it really didn't compliment the gameplay at all, not that it was bad per se, it just didn't seem to match the action. I actually found it annoying in some areas.Didn't appreciate the random game overs, \u201cI'll just check over here for a harvest point\u2026\u201d oops, game over. \u201cNeed to head back to the shop\u201d oops, game over. Whatever you do, do NOT eat the damn fish, I didn't appreciate having to replay an hour of the game for doing what I thought was a side quest\u2026 not cool.Story is ridiculously depressing, depressing isn't really the word, there is no ray of hope, everything you're doing is completely meaningless and the revelations in the end game just make it worse. I came out the other side wondering what the point was, a futile mission against impossible odds based on a false premise. Even the happiest ending was sad and pointless.All that said, I played it for around 40 hours and even had enough interest to watch a few different endings. If nothing else it's fun to play once you get used to the controls. I did actually like the characters but the finale actually spoiled that a lot for me. Instead of finishing the game and feeling a sense of accomplishment I was just left with an overwhelming feeling why? Why did I play this, what did I accomplish? Is it trying to tell me that life is meaningless and that struggling against it is futile? ",

            "answer_text": "In an effort to update (as of July 6, 2019), NieR: Automata has surpassed over four million sales world wide across PS4, Xbox One, and PC ( Nier: Automata has sold more than 4 million copies).  Across the two years since its initial release, NieR: Automata has risen to critical acclaim winning multiple game of the year awards and nominations especially for it\u2019s story and soundtrack. See under \u201cReception\u201d \u2192 \u201cAccolades\u201d Nier: Automata - Wikipedia. Gaming review sites rate NieR at an average of 8.9\u20139.5 scores. User reviews being generally in the same range with a couple negative scores offset by 10\u2019s. That being, it\u2019s been also criticized on all fronts i.e repetitive combat and a story that only appeals to certain people. It\u2019s still viewed as a \u201cniche\u201d title. However, it has garnered a wide audience and a cult following. The main character 2B and co. have become somewhat popularized in relation to \u201clewd\u201d and \u201cobscene\u201d material (the best I can describe it as haha). On the otherhand, the characters have generated a steady stream of fanart. As such, I\u2019d wager that 2B, or at least her image and character, is highly recognizeable amongst the gaming community.  Art credit to: TheCecil NieR: Automata is still being played to this day and being discovered by many people; just look at the recent let\u2019s plays and walkthroughs on YouTube.  (Yes, that title is pretty amusing isn\u2019t it?) Perhaps more telling to it\u2019s success is how it saved the gaming company, PlatinumGames, from going financially bankrupt. (Nier director Yoko Taro saved PlatinumGames, according to Hideki Kamiya) All in all, NieR: Automata is now quite famous in the gaming community for being either a masterpiece of game design, music, and storytelling or an overrated and melodramatic story of meaningless proportions. Personally, I love viewing this game from all angles; it\u2019s faults, smooth edges and such. It\u2019s a unique game quite like none other. It\u2019s special and has definitely solidified itself within the gaming archives as a whole. ",
