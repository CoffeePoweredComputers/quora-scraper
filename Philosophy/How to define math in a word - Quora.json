            "answer_text": "Scary To be honest, I am good at math. I am capable of solving logic questions and have no problem in solving questions related to reasoning ability. Now the problem is, I dont like Maths at all. But why? I get panicked when I am unable to solve a question or understand the formula.  Story Time: Few months back, I had a Maths test in school. The topics were Trigonometry and Polynomials. I was fully prepared. I was pretty much confident in myself. Until\u2026\u2026 I saw the question paper. All hell broke loose. It seemed like I did not know any question written on that paper. I was terrified. I wanted to ace this test and pass with an A grade. And then, I had an anxiety attack. My neck and spine started aching like anything. I could feel my heartbeat growing faster every second. I was about to faint. After 15 minutes, I got up and reported my invigillator that I am sick. After a few minutes, I was sitting on a clinic bed.I remember requesting the teachers that my condition is not good, and I cannot complete the test. But they forced me to solve the paper, whatsoever my health condition was. Somehow, I managed to solve a few questions. When the test was over, I was sent back home. The next week, I heard a news which was a slap on my face. I scored 15 out of 30. C grade. And from that moment, I had sworn to myself that after passing 10th grade (which I am in right now) I would never ever study Maths. Not even a single topic.  Conclusion: I hate Maths. Maths hates me.

            "answer_text": "Motivation Why motivation? Because I am shite at it. Confuse?..Allow me to elaborate\u2026. I love maths, I get why so many people are completely obsessed with this subject, it is at the same time elegant yet ruthlessly direct, simple yet complex, impossible yet beautiful, maths is like classic poetry, the words might seem like complete garbage just men\u2019t to confuse but a good dictionary and a patient instructor can show you just how beautiful it is, how every word echoes a different emotion and is irreplaceable( forgive me for getting a bit too philosophical) . The time I fell in love with maths was when I learnt a proof for why there are infinite prime numbers. A very basic and \u2018elegant\u2019 solution first proved by Euclid in 300 BC, but I digress. Maths motivates me because I am so shit in it, even though I love the subject there is room for tremendous improvement. Maths reminds me of the fact that I can become a far better version of myself and this motivates me to work harder ;if that makes any sense. Also there is a saying that \u201cIf the universe is like an epic poem , then mathematics is the language in which it was written\u201d ;so I think if I can master this subject, I can perhaps better understand this universe ; something which has been my obsession since childhood ",

In a nutshell, he points out that you don't do Maths because you are smart; you do Maths because it makes you smarter. Thus, the concrete and abstract thinking required by Maths builds the brain's muscles which in turn prepare us for other academic pursuits and to increase overall intelligence!!! ",
