            "answer_text": "Your question requires two clearer definitions: what do you mean by: is there? Does something exist only in what is observable? Does an observation collapse a wave of probabilities, as suggested by Niels Bohr \u201cCopenhagen Interpretation?\u201dWhat is infinity? Only a mathematical symbol or a reality? If the latter, can you add infinities? Be careful, scientists like Georg Cantor and Kurt Godel almost lost their mind trying to figure out that.In the 20th century, we faced several concepts of multiple universes to answer e.g. the question of Heisenberg\u2019s Quantum Uncertainty by the \u201cMany Worlds Theory\u201d, the paradox of the \u201cFine-Tuned\u201d universe by the Multiverse theory and also by the mathematics of the String theory and its 11 dimensions. The truth is that we don\u2019t know and, most likely, we will never know other than \u2026 an equation on a piece of paper. Of course, science-fiction literature has, and will continue building up stories of \u201ctravels\u201d between different universes through \u201cwormholes\u201d etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Is there evidence of an infinite number of universes? Answer: By definition, there can\u2019t be. If we can find any evidence for / way of detecting anything outside this universe, then it becomes part of this universe. The universe is supposed to be the sum of everything we can possibly detect. There are theories of multiverses. It\u2019s certainly possible there are other universes. If they exist they stand seperate and isolated from this universe. That\u2019s the Scientific paradigm. Science treats this universe as a closed system. Nothing else gets in or out of it. Energy, mass etc are constant for the whole universe. The Scientific paradigm is consistent. It does have problems. It\u2019s a bit difficult to prove that no information is going in or out of this universe. There is the problem of inflation and 90% of dark matter / energy being missing / undetected. There are unexplained anomalies, as well as troubling matters relating to Free Will, paranormal phenomena, and issues of God / spirits / souls / ghosts etc. which don\u2019t fit within such a paradigm. How life began is still an unexplained mystery. There are a lot of sightings of \u2018intruders\u2019 with or without UFO\u2019s. So there may well be lots of stuff science doesn\u2019t know about yet, but if / when evidence of anything else interacting with this universe is scientifically confirmed, then \u2018The Universe\u2019 will be redefined to include it.
