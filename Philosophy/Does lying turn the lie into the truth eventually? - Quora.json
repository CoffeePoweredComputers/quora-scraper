            "answer_text": "Absolutely! During a particularly dark time, I was lonely enough to join a dating site. My first profile was bluntly honest, outlining all of my potential red flags, but also describing my better points in no uncertain terms. It bombed in spectacular fashion. A week or so later, I decided to really highlight my sense of humor, so I rewrote my profile, except \u2026 every single statement was a lie. It was done in such a blatant way that anyone with a functioning cerebral cortex would know it was in jest, and to understand the reality of me, all one had to do was simply reverse every statement. It started out something along the lines of \u201cI have never held a job in my life, I can\u2019t stomach children or animals, and I would never even consider raising a child on my own \u2026\u201d blah blah blah. It was actually pretty funny, and as you\u2019re probably already suspecting, it had a lot more impact than the first one did. In the end, I never did get to the dating phase, so I cancelled the account. Actually, that\u2019s not quite true. I cancelled the account because it demonstrated exactly how superficial people could be, and it was disheartening, leaving me feeling like I had even less self-worth than before I had joined. Maybe if I\u2019d hit it off with someone I would feel differently, but in today\u2019s world, everything and more relevantly, everyone is disposable, at least to certain people, and I wanted no part in it. Forgive my slight digression there. I should probably include those thoughts in a more relevant answer, should I stumble across one. To conclude, it\u2019s actually quite easy to use lies to tell the truth, so long as the audience is aware of the fact. It\u2019s when they are not that you have to be careful, lest you violate their trust. ",

As for \u201csubjective truth\u201d this question is going to make me cite a quote from someone I\u2019d really rather not quote. \u201cMake the lie big, make it simple, keep saying it, and eventually they will believe it.\u201d-Adolf Hitler Unfortunately this is one point Hitler had correct. Barring the \u201cbig lie\u201d part of the formulation, the belief of repeated assertion is an observable phenomenon known as the \u201cIllusory Truth Effect\u201d. Any number of common \u201cfacts\u201d like \u2018humans only use 10% of their brains\u2019 or \u2018porcupines can shoot quills up to 30 feet!\u2019 fall under the purview of illusory truth. Many \u201cold wives tales\u201d like these and many others are falsely believed truths created through simple reinforcement. After all, if you hear the same thing from multiple sources then there must be some grain of truth behind it (a reasonable but fallacious assumption). In general the use of illusory truth is a key backbone of any propaganda machine. You can observe this in media today where often even in the absence of any greater agenda beyond selling content, media outlets will use confirmation bias to draw user-base/viewership and thus reinforce false narratives via illusory truth in a feedback loop of polarization and thus further media consumption to confirm further bias.

            "answer_text": "All lies bear witness to truth, ironically. In a sense, lies are used by truth as proofs because in the presence of truth lies are destroyed by their own distinction. This is what it means for darkness to be swallowed up by light. Lies are apparent facts whose apparition is only present where the contrast created by truth is obscured by opacity. Evidence itself is clarity, even in its etymology. Isaiah 9:2 NIV [2] The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned. Darkness speaks of the absence of light. If this were not so we could not see darkness, because no vision would exist in the beginning. Yet we have vision. Yet we have ears to hear. Even where that vision is so minimal that we have only light perception or people walking about appear like trees still that definitive dichotomy proves that truth enlightens whereas darkness is truly invisible. Lies are used by truth to display its sovereignty. In the presence of truth lies submit their testimony by their own disintegration. Their penetration causes them to pass away such that only truth persists.  ",

That is simple enough from my point of view, but it seems very strange to me how much that question of ethics is muddled about these days. I suspect that is due to immense structural damages incurred by society's obsesive flirtations with untruth. Just STOP that already! Conversely, can the truth be used to tell lies? Absolutely yes. A shading here and a twisting there, and the truth becomes illicitly used as a shield behind which all manner of evils are camouflaged. Discernment may have gone out of fashion in this troubled age of deception, but progress \u2026 that is not. ",
