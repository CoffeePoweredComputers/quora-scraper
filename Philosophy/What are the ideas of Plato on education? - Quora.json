            "answer_text": "Plato\u2019s Theory of Education: Plato sees education the only true way to the permanent stability of the state. If the character of the people is sound, laws are unnecessary; if unsound, laws are useless. With this conviction, Plato starts to emphasize the importance of education in his ideal state. He clearly saw that education was more than the acquiring of basic facts and ideas in one\u2019s childhood and adolescence, and was the first to propose an elaborate system of adult training and education. In his Book VII of the Republic Plato sets forth the object of education, which is to turn the eye towards the light which the soul already possesses. To him, the whole function of education is not to put knowledge into the soul but to bring out the best things that are latent in the soul, and not to do so by directing it to the right objects. This will be done by bringing the soul into that environment which, in each stage of its growth, is best suited for its development. No Direct Teaching- In the Platonic system of education, the main problem of education is simply to bring the soul into a particular surrounding. Hence, nothing is said of direct teaching. He does not talk of the steps by which an object of knowledge is to be presented to the mind. Since the mind is active, objects are not presented to it, instead, it directs itself to objects. It moves towards every object of its environment because there is in it an attraction towards every object. In the words of Barker, \u201cThe true business of the teacher, is to bring out what is best in his pupil: more truly, it causes of itself in response to the right objects, and it is in setting them before his pupils that the true art of the teacher lies.Reminiscene- In his theory of Education there is something of the theory of \u201creminiscence\u201d which was propounded by Plato in his dialogue, the Meno. According to this theory of our soul has seen in a former life all things which it learns in this world, and our learning is a mere remembrance of that life. The object only gives a clue, the soul itself responds to its suggestion.Instrument of Education- Plato found in literature the main instrument of education. Every Athenian gentleman was brought up on a system of studying the standard literature of his country. Besides, there might be an elementary knowledge of some art, and the rudiments of the sciences of numbers and figures. The second instrument of education was gymnastics. In early life the main instruments for bringing out what was best in the soul were first, literature, beginning with stories for children and going on to poetry: secondly, music in our sense of the word, playing and singing; and thirdly, the plastic arts in general. All these come under the head of arts.Life long Education: Plato held in Republic that education is a matter of life-time. Being a living and developing entity, it is affected by different agencies and media at various stages of its growth. Infancy and childhood- During infancy and childhood, the soul is more susceptible to fancy and imagination. Hence, the character is trained through emotions. During this period, Education will stimulate the love of the beautiful in all its varied appearances.Adolescence- During this stage, the reasoning powers begin to develop. The soul is reached through reason. Here education means the development of understanding through science and philosophy.Youth- In youth, education would be both physical and intellectual. It would aim at the acquisition of truth.Innovations in Education- Plato\u2019s theory of education is truly innovative. He improves upon the current Athenian practice. He pleads for giving the same type of education to both boys and girls. He believes that there is no difference in kind between the native capacities of boys and girls.Plato\u2019s Scheme of Education: Plato\u2019s scheme of education represents a state-controlled system of compulsory education for both sexes. To him, every member of the state should be prepared for a particular class either for ruling, fighting or producing class. The education which is imparted in the beginning is equal for all. Thus Plato maintains the principle of equality in education at least in the beginning of it. However, education in the Republic is exclusively meant for those who are to become the rulers of the ideal state. Stages of Education: The system of education was divided into two stages, called the elementary and higher education. This distinction is based on age differences and on class differences (a) Elementary education is the training of the youth and of the military class. It is the training of the character through emotions. Besides, the cultivation of the virtues of courage, self-control and discipline. (b) Higher education is the training of the middle age. It is the training of the ruling classes or guardians. It is the training of reason and understanding through science and philosophy. Elementary Education-(i) First Stage: Upto the age of six, the lessons of good manner and good taste is given more importance than imparting of instruction. A child should learn simple religious truths as well as to hate and love things. In childhood, first impressions occupy a privileged place. The elementary education begins with the training in music. (ii) Second Stage: In the second stage of elementary education, from 6 to 18 years, it will be supplemented by music for the soul or mind and gymnastics for the body. This education should be both physical and intellectual. Music comprised of literature, poetry, singing and all finer arts and gymnastics included bodily exercise, diet and medicine. Plato has put emphasis on Music for the following reasons: (iii) Third Stage: After 18 the individual practice of music must be abandoned, through the choral singing may go on throughout life. The education at this stage was to be a general education in music and gymnastics and also in the elements of science. Something of mathematics, history and science may also be taught. But these difficult subjects should be smoothed into verse and beautified with songs. These studies should not be forced upon the mind of the child. Plato says: \u201cThe elements of instruction should be presented to the mind in childhood, but not with any compulsion; for a freeman should be a freeman too in the acquisition of knowledge. Knowledge which is acquired under compulsion has no hold on the mind. Therefore, do not use compulsion, but let early education be rather a sort of amusement; this will better enable you to find out the natural bent of the child.\u201d In the third stage of elementary education i.e., from 1 to 20 years there was to be given an exclusive training in gymnastics and military service in order to prepare them for the defence of the country in the eventuality of any war, it is mainly for military class. 2. Higher Education- (i) First Test: When they arrive at the age of twenty, they face the first great elimination test of what they have learnt in all these years of equal education. There shall be a ruthless weeding out and the examination will be both theoretical and practical. Those who fail in this elimination test will be assigned the economic work of the community - businessmen, clerks, factory workers and farmers. Those who pass this elimination test will receive ten more years of education and training in body and mind. This stage is mainly for the guardian class. It is predominantly scientific in character. Its aim is to make the selected few to become the guardians or rulers of the state. Just as the special qualification of the warrior class is courage, the special virtue of the ruling class is wisdom. The courses of study at this stage aim at making the recipients wise throughout the study of sciences like Mathematics, Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy and Logic, Mathematics trains a mind to think clearly and precisely. (ii) Second Test: At 30, a second selective test will be held. The less gifted will become the auxiliaries and executive aides and military officers of the state. It is natural that they may hesitate to go to their station in life. Plato in this connection says that \u201cwe shall tell these young people that the divisions into which they have fallen are God-decreed and irrevocable. We shall tell them the myth of the metals and appeal to them in the name of God \u201cCitizens, you are brothers, yet God has framed you differently, men of gold, men of silver and men of iron.\u201d The more gifted will undergo a further course of training for another five years i.e., from 30 to 35 years of age. Now they will study Mathematics and develop their power of dialectics. Dialectics attempts to arrive at proper definitions. It is. therefore, the instrument by which knowledge of pure ideas is attained which constitute the highest reality. The highest of these ideas is the idea of the Good. It is the cause of all living being and is the goal of knowledge. (iii) Practical Education after 35: At 35, guardians occupy positions of authority in the state. They now get practical experience through dealing with the day to day problems of administration for 15 years. Education does not come to an end here. Instead of it, so long as the individuals are receptive to knowledge they may continue education even after this period. Main functions- (i) The guardians would pass most of their time in philosophical pursuit at the age of 50. (ii) They would also devote themselves to the hard duties of public life, hold offices for their country\u2019s sake and exercise power in the best interest of the people in order to make them just and happy. (iii) After retirement from public service, the guardians had to concentrate on the realisation of the Idea of Good. Plato opines that merely a perfect type of education may create perfect state. The political authority should be blended with broadest knowledge and culture and the philosopher should be the embodiment of highest political virtue, spirit, swiftness and strength. The guardians must be given special training. The system of education would make such a selfless ruling class. Curriculum of Education- Plato\u2019s education aims at the realization of truth, a truth which is comprehensive, not limited or narrow. Plato puts emphasis on the development of the mind, body and soul. For this reason, he divides the curriculum into three parts: (i) Bodily development: To Plato bodily development is of the utmost importance in education. This bodily development is achieved not merely through exercise and gymnastic activity, but also through a regulated and controlled diet. The educator must guide and train the educand to attend to his food. He may advise the educand to take a particular kind of diet after acquainting himself with his bodily weaknesses. This must be done in order to get out of these debilities and finally to lead to complete development of the body. (ii) Educational impression: It should be kept in mind that physical development is only a means of mental development because a healthy mind resides only in a healthy body. Although much importance is attached to mental development. Plato recommended the teaching of mathematics is the teaching of arithmetic. Geometry and algebra should be taught thereafter. It is the belief of Plato that the teaching of mathematics can remove many mental defects. In addition to mathematics, teaching of astronomy is of great significance. (iii) Training in music: With a view to achieving a balance in education, Plato stresses the value of musical training as a supplement to training in gymnastics. Exercise is the source of bodily development while music helps in the development of the soul. The child\u2019s curriculum should be purged of all literature and musical epics which tend to generate such qualities as cowardice, weakness, selfishness, egoism, etc. Feature of Platonic System of Education- The main feature of the Platonic system of education are as follows: (i) State Controlled Education: Plato believed in state-controlled education. He insisted that all concerned must be imparted proper education. The education is a positive means by which the ruler could mould the character of the people and promote spirit of unselfish devotion towards their duties. (ii) Children's Education not at the Discretion of Parents: Plato did not consider it proper to leave the education of children entirely to the discretion of the parents and insisted on making it compulsory. As uneducated children were likely to be a liability for the state. Hence, education should be made compulsory for all citizens so that they may fully develop their mental faculties and become valuable units of the state. (iii) No Exclusion of Women: Plato did not favour the exclusion of the women from his scheme of education on the Athenian pattern. Instead, he pleaded that both men and women should be given education. Plato did not find any difference between the native capacities of boys and girls. He was in favour of women holding public offices like men. (iv) To the Third Category Also: Dr Vibasi has opined that Plato\u2019s education is meant for artisans as well as peasants also. Though Plato does not make a clear mention in this regard, it is quite implied from his statement that \u201cMen of copper can be made into men of silver and ever of gold, if they possess their attributes.\u201d (v) Censorship: Plato was in favour of strict censorship of all literary and artistic works to ensure that the youth did not come under the bad moral influence. Only the right type of literature should reach the hand of youth. The ultimate judge of the rightness or otherwise of the literature was the ruler. (vi) Moral and Physical Development: Plato\u2019s education aimed at moral as well as physical development of the child. He held that a healthy mind could reside only in a healthy body. Hence education should develop both these faculties. According to Plato only a perfect type of education can create a perfect State. The political authority should be blended with broadest knowledge and culture and the philosopher should be the embodiment of highest political virtue, spirit, swiftness and strength. He should represent the knowledge-in-action. Hence the guardians must be given special training. The system of education was devised to produce such a selfless ruling class.

            "answer_text": "What are the ideas of plato on education? \u201cPlato regards education as a means to achieve justice, both individual justice and social justice. According to Plato, individual justice can be obtained when each individual develops his or her ability to the fullest. In this sense, justice means excellence. For the Greeks and Plato, excellence is virtue. According to Socrates, virtue is knowledge. Thus, knowledge is required to be just. From this Plato concludes that virtue can be obtained through three stages of development of knowledge: knowledge of one's own job, self-knowledge, and knowledge of the Idea of the Good. According to Plato, social justice can be achieved when all social classes in a society, workers, warriors, and rulers are in a harmonious relationship. Plato believes that all people can easily exist in harmony when society gives them equal educational opportunity from an early age to compete fairly with each other. Without equal educational opportunity, an unjust society appears since the political system is run by unqualified people; timocracy, oligarchy, defective democracy, or tyranny will result. \u2026\u201d Plato's philosophy of education: Its implication for current education Plato held that education was a kind of remembering. The seven Liberal Arts could lead you out of the Cave of ignorance, where you \u2018saw\u2019 things not as they really were, but reflected on the wall before you, [Republic 514a-520a]. This kind of education, [ Etymologically, the word \"education\" is derived from the Latin \u0113duc\u0101ti\u014d (\"A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing\") from \u0113duc\u014d (\"I educate, I train\") which is related to the homonym \u0113d\u016bc\u014d(\"I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect\") from \u0113- (\"from, out of\") and d\u016bc\u014d (\"I lead, I conduct\".
