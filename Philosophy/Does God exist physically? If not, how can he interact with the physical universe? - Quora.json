            "answer_text": "Does God exist physically? A~~~~~~~~~~~This question would be better phrased as \"According to the particular god-centric rumors you believe--Does God exist physically?\u201dAfter all, it's not like we can turn to collected facts about an actual existing God to appeal to to get the correct or accurate answers to such questions. All we have to turn to are a gazillion unconfirmed rumors about God and gods. What they supposedly did in the past, how they supposedly behave and supposedly think, how they supposedly feel about certain topics, etc. And since many of those collected rumors contradict each other, the only answer you can get that addresses your question directly is someone else's PREFERRED rumor. Maybe the ones they were raised with~~or even ones that differ vastly from their peers. Perhaps even a combination of two or more unconfirmed rumors mashed together to create an all-new unconfirmed rumor about God or gods. It\u2019s an all-too-common occurrence that, every day, someone is making up new rumors about what God did this week. How he supposedly created and sent that hurricane for some purpose, etc. Or some other event in which \u201cGod\u201d is supposedly pulling the magical strings. These kinds of questions are fine if you're interested in the variety of superstitious beliefs out there in the real world~~that can actually be fairly interesting. But if you seek FACTS about actual existing God or gods, you won't find any. Because we don't have any. ",

If I answer that god does not exist physically, I may also argue that god does not exist at all, which I in fact do so argue. Therefore, he CAN\u2019T interact with the physical universe. I presume you mean to assume that god exists, but in some non-physical sense. If that were so, the answer to how he could influence the physical universe would be \u201cusing the same imaginary magic that he does at all other times.\u201d ",

It\u2019s just a story, which is why you asked because if God was physical, it would have been noticed by now. ",
