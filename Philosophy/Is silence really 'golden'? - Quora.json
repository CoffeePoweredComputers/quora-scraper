            "answer_text": "When I was a child, my mother often said, \u201cChildren should be seen and not heard.\u201d And that was fine with me, except for when I actually had something to say. I\u2019m just not now, nor have I ever been a big talker, except for when I feel incredibly comfortable with the person I\u2019m with. I do laugh, talk, joke around, go on about certain things quite often now that I\u2019m much older. But to talk to someone about my deepest feelings, ideas, dreams, wishes, desires; allowing that person to see who I really am inside instead of only allowing them to read between the lines, is not something I often do. That has been a great advantage at times, and also one of my biggest downfalls. I don\u2019t allow everyone I know get close enough to me to learn who I really am inside; in my heart, my soul, or my mind. Some people think they know me really well, but most people do not. I\u2019ve never felt relaxed and comfortable enough with any man other than one I felt incredibly close to when I was in high school, and another one I just met not long ago. Otherwise, I don\u2019t let any man into my heart and soul, but some get to hear me speak my mind - good, or not so good, at times. I am not one to wear my heart on my sleeve - it\u2019s too easy to get hurt that way. If someone wants to get to know me, they\u2019ll have to be prepared to dig deep - unless there seems to be an instant connection, bond, or meeting of souls. Otherwise - silence IS golden. It\u2019s also a known \u2018ism\u2019 that we all learn more by listening than by talking. That\u2019s also always been the case with me. I prefer to listen to someone else if they have something important, intelligent, sensible, honest, and/or interesting to say. Otherwise I can just as easily shut their spiel out as not. I learned how to do that when I was very young - and it allows me to concentrate on what I want to hear, think, imagine or write about. Same with television. I can do just as well without it as long as I have friends I trust to talk with and books to read, or a computer and the internet where I\u2019ve learned to find anything I could possibly ever need to ask about or learn. It also matters incredibly much when referring to speaking out about that which one is not well informed, or to share pure gossip with others without researching the source of the gossip and its content. About 15 years ago I lost a very close relationship with a niece I dearly loved for asking her some questions about the gossip I had heard about her. I was not trying to spread that piece of gossip, but to find out straight from her what, exactly was going on with her and what, if any, part of said gossip was true of if it was false in total. My dearest niece evidently misunderstood me and began to cry. I was aghast that she was crying and that it seemed to be my fault, but I did not understand why nor why she was crying since I knew I had said nothing that would have caused tears. I loved her so much; we always had a good relationship, and that was one reason I was asking her about the \u201cstory\u201d I\u2019d been told. The other reason I was asking her is because the person who was spreading the gossip told me she was going to call my niece herself and tell her off. That was something I DID NOT want to happen since I had long known what telling off by that person would entail. I did not want my wonderful niece to have to hear that MOUTH of the family at all, so I told the mouth that I would call her myself. When my niece hung up on me, I realized it had gone very badly, not at all the way I thought it would nor the way I would have wanted. I adored my niece and hated that she was so upset with me. So I called her back - and since she was at my brother\u2019s home, he answered the phone instead of her. Until I heard him scream at me to leave her alone and never call her again, I did not realize how bad, how entirely awful this phone call had turned out. And I still don\u2019t know why or what happened. I know what I said and how I said it, which was very carefully. I know what she said and how she cried and how shocked I was that she hung up on me. I also know how doubly shocked I was when my brother, her father, screamed and cussed at me over the phone and still did not know why, nor understand what had just happened when I knew if my heart of hearts that my intentions were good. My brother, my niece, and the rest of his children and in-laws, except for his son, my nephew, did not speak to me for a few years after that. I was crushed. So I know that in that case, silence would have indeed been golden. Not only did I earn my family\u2019s ire and anger, I lost the wonderful relationship I\u2019d had with my beloved niece for her entire life before that day. And then the other shoe dropped. On October 3, 2015, my beautiful, wonderful, sweet, kind, loving, full of life, fun, hard work and lots of shenanigans, was killed by a falling tree top during the last few days of the nor\u2019easter that struch the area in which she lived. That tree was across the highway on which she was driving a rented Mustang convertible. She and her husband had rented that car since it was her favorite model and they were going to drive to my area, to the city in which they were married exactly 10 years before, on a beautiful boat ride around the harbor where we all loved got to witness their wedding and them both. We danced, sang, smiled, laughed and enjoyed each others company so much that beautiful October night in 2005. I\u2019ll never forget it. But that damned tree had to snap off, the top 10 feet, and land across the road on top of her in that damned Mustang, killing her instantly. I never got to talk with her much after her wedding. Our relationship had been stiched back together, but never truly healed. My beloved niece and I never got back the closenes we once shared before she died. Because of that phone call I made trying to find out the truth rather, than allow the family gossip to go on and on about what she decided was true about the gossip she was spreading, I lost my niece that day for the most part. And then I lost her for good on the day God took her home to be with him in heaven. That\u2019s a good thing, in and of itself, but she would still have loved me as much as she had before had I never made that phone call; trying to protect her from THE mouth of the family, THE gossip, the lies and innuendos, I ended up losing her trust and her love for the most part. Nothing was ever the same from that day on. And now she is gone from me until I get to the other side and can see her again, with the rest of my beloveds. So you see, Silence truly is golden, if you know when to be silent and when to open your mouth. I thought I was doing a good thing when I opened my mouth that day I called her. As it turned out, it ruined our relationship for the rest of our lives here on earth. And as I write this, the tears are flowing again. How much I wish I had remained silent that day I called her. How much I wish I had told the family gossip to shut her mouth and stop spreading such vicsous gossip about my beloved niece. I have paid the price for not being silent that day. I pay the price for not being silent many times, but so far I have been able to handle the rest of it. Just not that day when I should have borne witness to the treausre of the saying, \u201cSilence is golden.\u201d All of us should learn to keep our mouths shut when we should. Sometimes that is a very painful thing to have to learn. ",

            "answer_text": "Speech is silver. Silence is golden. The idiom \u201csilence is golden\u201d means that it is better to be silent than to speak. On some occasions, silence is not always a bad thing. In fact, it is equal to that of speech. It is no good to have too much of either, there needs to be a balance. Putting aside those instances of awkward silence or other instances in which the silence leads to a frenzy of flushed faces of utter embarrassment, it truly is a beautiful virtue which may be a reason why many call it \u201cgolden\u201d. I personally had found the idiom to be very accurate through numerous circumstances. With that in mind, here was what first helped me come to the understanding of the idiom \u201csilence is golden\u201d. Silence brings about reflection. The truth is that most of us fear it. When there is silence in a conversation or even in some friendly banter, we fill it up with endless chatter to avoid an awkward scenario. Similarly to when there is silence in our environment, we turn on the television or fill the area with music just so that there would be sound. That would be me. I hated being alone with my thoughts. I did not want to face my stress or think about the reason why. One day; however, I got on a bus and forgot to bring headphones. I usually listened to the same songs on repeat when I took public transport or did anything else that required me to be alone so I thus felt a little discomforted. It was then, when the bus took off, I was left to do nothing but stare at the scenery outside and look at the surroundings. The bus was empty apart from an old Asian man humming a tune in dialect as well as a mother cradling a baby in her arms, in which she winced a little every time the bus jerked. Having found my surroundings uninteresting, including the dull blue buildings that littered the sides of the narrow road, I was left with my thoughts. It was during those moments of realization that I really was stripped of all distractions and had to face myself. My mind wandered to the start to finish of my troubles and I got to ask myself numerous questions, which allowed me to reflect. I got off the bus feeling more at ease and content. It wasn\u2019t the norm for me to confront my problems but after doing so, I realized it should be. I also realized that the reason why I was uncomfortable with silence was because I did not feel secure about how I truly felt at that moment in time. But because of silence, i understood more about myself and reasoned out what feelings I had and dealt with them. Silence is gold in a metaphorical sense as it is definitely something that is precious and and something that needs to be relished upon more often. Whether alone or with people, comfortable silence is the best kind. Say you are with someone such as a close friend or lover. Sitting or doing anything alone with them in comfortable silence allows one to feel at ease and calm. Unlike when you\u2019re with your mother in law, there would not be any \u201cawkward silence\u201d and that nagging fear at the back of your head about them disapproving of you should you do something \u201cwrong\u201d. Putting that aside, in many ways, silence is rare in today\u2019s modern world. Whether it be the noise pollution from cars or the many other distractions around us, it is important that more people set aside a few minutes a day to reflect and put their work and mobile devices aside. It does wonders to the mind and soul. Gold is hard to come by similar to silence and with money, you are able to get gold. The \u201cmoney\u201d in this case is a representation for time. Put enough time each day to enjoy the silence, and you are going to be able to get more understanding about yourself overtime. Therefore, silence really IS golden in allowing one\u2019s self to understand certain things better as well as become wiser. It allows one to be freed from others\u2019 words.  ",
