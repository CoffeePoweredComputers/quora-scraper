            "answer_text": "This would be the most common answer to this question i guess but i just love the fibonacci series so much that i can\u2019t stop myself from mentioning it. The Fibonacci sequence starts like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 and so on forever. Each number is the sum of the two numbers that precede it Its the most common number you\u2019d find in the nature cause almost everything you see definitely has a fibonacci number in it. Before i mention the examples i\u2019d like to also add something called the golden ration(phi). You can read about it but the interesting point is When you divide two consecutive fibonacci numbers (say 5/3 , 13,8 ) they all have almost a same value close to 1.6 . This is known as the golden ratio. For eg : Flower petals : The number of petals in a flower consistently follows the Fibonacci sequence. Famous examples include the lily, which has three petals, buttercups, which have five.Tree branches : The Fibonacci sequence can also be seen in the way tree branches form or split. A main trunk will grow until it produces a branch, which creates two growth points. Then, one of the new stems branches into two, while the other one lies dormant. This pattern of branching is repeated for each of the new stemsFingers : Looking at the length of our fingers, each section \u2014 from the tip of the base to the wrist \u2014 is larger than the preceding one by roughly the ratio of phi.DNA moleculesEven the microscopic realm is not immune to Fibonacci. The DNA molecule measures 34 angstroms long by 21 angstroms wide for each full cycle of its double helix spiral. These numbers, 34 and 21, are numbers in the Fibonacci series, and their ratio 1.6190476 closely approximates Phi, 1.6180339. Even the spiral galaxies display the fibonacci sequence.
