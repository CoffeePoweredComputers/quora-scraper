            "answer_text": "He is not THE antiChrist but for certain he is antiChrist. \"To make war against the Pope is to make war against God, seeing the Pope is God, and God is the Pope.\" -Moreri's History. ( Louis Mor\u00e9ri (25 March 1643 - 10 July 1680) was a French priest and encyclopedist.) \"The leader of the Catholic church is defined by the faith as the Vicar of Jesus Christ (and is accepted as such by believers). The Pope is considered the man on earth who takes the place of the Second Person of the omnipotent God of the Trinity.\" (John Paul II, Crossing the Threshold of Hope, p. 3, 1994). \"The Pope is not simply the representative of Jesus Christ. On the contrary, he is Jesus Christ Himself, under the veil of the flesh, and who by means of a being common to humanity continues His ministry amongst men ... Does the Pope speak? It is Jesus Christ Who is speaking. Does he teach? It is Jesus Christ Who teaches. Does he confer grace or pronounce an anathema? It is Jesus Christ Himself Who is pronouncing the anathema and conferring the grace. Hence consequently, when one speaks of the Pope, it is not necessary to examine, but to obey: there must be no limiting the bounds of the command, in order to suit the purpose of the individual whose obedience is demanded: there must be no caviling at the declared will of the Pope, and so invest it with quite another than that which he has put upon it: no preconceived opinions must be brought to bear upon it: no rights must be set up against the rights of the Holy Father to teach and command; his decisions are not to be criticized, or his ordinances disputed. Therefore by Divine ordination, all, no matter how august the person may be - whether he wear a crown or be invested with the purple, or be clothed in the sacred vestments: all must be subject to Him Who has had all things put under Him.\" -Evangelical Christendom, January 1, 1895, pg. 15, published in London by J. S. Phillips. -These words appeared in the Roman Canon Law: \"To believe that our Lord God the Pope has not the power to decree as he is decreed, is to be deemed heretical.-I?i the Gloss \"Extravagantes\" o.f Pope John XXII Cum inter, Tit. XIV, Cap. IV. Ad Callem Sexti Decretalium, Paris, 1685. (See actual document here) ",

            "answer_text": "hard to answer without being polite, but i will try. Yes. The papacy, is, of course, an Antichrist, while the religious machinery of the Vatican itself is the Whore of Babylon (as it derives its rituals and symbolism from the Babylonian religion of the seductive Semiramis). The Beast is the political structure of the so called \"Holy Roman Empire of the Vatican, which will eventually amalgamate into a One World Religion and Government. If we look at the Bible, the attributes of satan are eerily reminiscent of the papacy. \u201cSon of man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord God; Because thine heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas; yet thou art a man, and not God, though thou set thine heart as the heart of God:\u201d the popes assume the roll of God and even His name, Holy Father. Pope Nicholas assumed the title of God. His words are:\u2014\u2018I am all in all and above all, so that God Himself, and I, the Vicar of God, hath both one consistory, and I am able to do almost all that God can do . . . Wherefore, if those things that I do be said not to be done of man, but of God. WHAT CAN YOU MAKE ME BUT GOD? Again, if prelates of the Church be called and counted of Constantine for gods, I then, being above all prelates, seem by this reason to be ABOVE ALL GODS. Wherefore, no marvel if it be in my power to dispense with all things, yea, with the precepts of Christ.\u2019 See Decret. Par Distinct 96 Ch. 7 Edit Lugd. 1661. \"All names which in the Scriptures are applied to Christ, by virtue of which it is established that He is over the church, all the same names are applied to the Pope.\" On the Authority of the Councils, book 2, chapter 17 \"The Pope takes the place of Jesus Christ on earth...by divine right the Pope has supreme and full power in faith, in morals over each and every pastor and his flock. He is the true vicar, the head of the entire church, the father and teacher of all Christians. He is the infallible ruler, the founder of dogmas, the author of and the judge of councils; the universal ruler of truth, the arbiter of the world, the supreme judge of heaven and earth, the judge of all, being judged by no one, God himself on earth.\" Quoted in the New York Catechism. Father A. Pereira says: \"It is quite certain that Popes have never approved or rejected this title 'Lord God the Pope,' for the passage in the gloss referred to appears in the edition of the Canon Law published in Rome in 1580 by Gregory XIII.\" Writers on the Canon Law say, \"The Pope and God are the same, so he has all power in heaven and earth.\" Barclay Cap. XXVII, p. 218. Cities Petrus Bertrandus, Pius V. - Cardinal Cusa supports his statement. Pope Nicholas I declared: \"the appellation of God had been confirmed by Constantine on the Pope, who, being God, cannot be judged by man.\" Labb IX Dist.: 96 Can. 7, Satis evidentur, Decret Gratian Primer Para \"For thou art the shepherd, thou art the physician, thou art the director, thou art the husbandman, finally thou art another God on earth.\" Labbe and Cossart's 'History of the Councils' Vol. XIV, col. 109 These words appeared in the Roman Canon Law: \"To believe that our Lord God the Pope has not the power to decree as he is decreed, is to be deemed heretical.-I?i the Gloss \"Extravagantes\" o.f Pope John XXII Cum inter, Tit.

Pope Leo XIII Encyclical Letter of June 20, 1894 \"The pope is of so great dignity and so exalted that he is not a mere man (...) he is as it were God on earth, sole sovereign of the faithful of Christ, chief of kings, having plenitude of power.\" -Lucius Ferraris, \u00abPrompta Bibliotheca\u00bb, 1763, Volume VI, 'Papa II', pp.25-29 Roman Catholic Canon Law stipulates through Pope Innocent III that the Roman pontiff is \"the vicegerent upon earth, not a mere man, but of a very God;\" and in a gloss on the passage it is explained that this is because he is the vicegerent of Christ, who is \"very God and very man.\" Decretales Domini Gregorii translatione Episcoporum, (on the transference of Bishops), title 7, chapter 3; Corpus Juris Canonice (2nd Leipzig ed., 1881), col. 99; (Paris, 1612), tom. 2, Devretales, col. 205 \"And God himself is obliged to abide by the judgment of his priest and either not to pardon or to pardon, according as they refuse to give absolution, provided the penitent is capable of it.\" -Liguori, \u00abDuties and Dignities of the Priest\u00bb, p.27      ",
