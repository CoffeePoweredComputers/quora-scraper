            "answer_text": "Are toxic leftist ideologies overtaking Democrat politics? I don\u2019t think leftist ideologies are overtaking the Democratic party and its policies. There is a move leftward from the conservative economics of the Clinton administration, and similar policies of the Obama administration. Some people may call any move leftward as being leftist, but there is nobody who support traditional socialism. ",
