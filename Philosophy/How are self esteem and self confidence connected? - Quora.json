            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s start off by defining both: I believe that self-esteem is highly over-rated. Just think about the word, \u201cesteem\u201d. It basically means to hold in high respect. For example, you might say \u201cI hold (name a great person you admire) in high esteem\u201d. \u201cI really esteem (name). Now say the same thing about yourself. \u201cI hold myself in high esteem\u201d. \u201cI really esteem myself\u201d. When you say it this way it doesn\u2019t sound quite right does it? Sounds arrogant or conceited. I suppose we all should have a certain level of respect for ourselves, but an elevated esteem for oneself is also known by another name\u2026narcissism. Confidence on the other hand has two basic definitions. 1 - a FEELING of certainty or assurance (most common and thought of definition) 2 - an ACT trust or reliance So how do these definitions correlate? Must you have a high respect for yourself to feel confident? It probably doesn\u2019t hurt but an overly inflated self-esteem will make confidence come off as cocky and arrogant. Must one have high respect for oneself to take the actions of confidence? I don\u2019t think so. It is my assertion that self-acceptance is much more important than self-esteem. A healthy self acceptance feeds confidence in a much more healthy and productive way. ",

            "answer_text": "Wow!!! What an amazing question! Ironically the answer is in their connected word self. What is self-esteem? \u201ca confidence and satisfaction in oneself\u201d Definition of SELF-ESTEEM What about self-confidence? \u201cconfidence in oneself and in one's powers and abilities\u201d Definition of SELF-CONFIDENCE That seems very similar and I don\u2019t feel it does justice to the subtleties. I tend to think of one as \u201ccontentment\u201d and the other one as \u201ccapability\u201d. In self-esteem I am happy about who I am, I am my own friend, I can even believe myself to be incompetent and be okay with it. In self-confidence I can hate myself. I can despise the person I am and the place within my mind that I exist, however I have total confidence in my ability to execute my evil schemes. ",

The essence of both of these terms is simple to feel self - worth towards thyself what is then projected to the others. Most of people get their self - worth from identification from their achievements, possessions or titles. On the collective level, like let's say nationwise, people are identified and proud on their culture, language, GDP or bottles of liquor, I do not know. One thing is foe sure, is that everything is so temporal it is crazy. I believe that only true self - esteem can come from the love. Love for people for instance. And that strong, I want to even label it like democractic feeling that all of us are equal. Elon Musk might be doing so much more than me or you, but he is not a more valuable person in conscious speaking. He is more valuable marketwise, oh yeah therewe can put a numbers on each other and to see what we are really worth - for the market, for the other people. But out of the market, out of the numners, out of the market, in the essence, we are all equal. On the essence level we cannot put a numbers at each other. And a beggar is worth just like Elon Musk. All bad people must be somehow the product of an errant, astray system. Had we lived in kingdoms of heaven, would we have experienced poverty, rape, murder or different fallacies? Is that special skill to see that inside people are created from the source and from the oneness sort to speak. I do not want to get into spirituality here, but for the true self - worth you have to reason or experience that you are like anybody else. You may have a different background or a destiny. But you ate no better or worse my friend. From that essence comes the true self - worth. Not from theidentification with statues. Please challenge thia thought process www.inex.life ",

If I put a person with self-confidence, with no previous experience, in charge of the executive branch of a country, is that a good thing? I don\u2019t think so. Better to put a person in charge who knows how to take information in, test it, and then recognize when confidence is high or when confidence is low. This is not SELF-confidence, because it did not come from within. Rather it came from experience in testing outside information. If a person can show the ability to recognize when they should feel high confidence or low confidence, and then act accordingly, then that person can be trusted to lead, regardless of how much self-esteem they hold for themselves. A person with high self-esteem believes they are worthy of respect. They may not be highly skilled in any particular area, but that\u2019s okay. They hold themselves in high esteem, regardless of how they compare to others. ",

Of course, I am speaking my own truth. Just for an example, I have been unable to work a job for over 18 months now due to back problems. Just standing at the kitchen sink for 5 minutes sends me into pain that renders me useless. I have never felt incapable , or been incapacitated in any way before. So needless to say my self esteem has dropped to an all time low. I cannot even support or take care of myself. Hence there goes my confidence! I am hesitant to even take a job because I worry that I fail\u2026I am NOT that girl! I am unable to (fully) accept that I am disabled, and I tell myself I can do it, I will not wither and die!
