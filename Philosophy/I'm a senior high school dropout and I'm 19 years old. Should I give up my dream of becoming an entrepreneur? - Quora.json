Get comfortable living on a rollercoaster or step off the ride, it's got to be one or the other. 90% Of Startups Fail: Here's What You Need To Know About The 10%. If you're doubting yourself enough to pose this question, then I imagine you're focused on the 90% above. I started my career playing it safe out of college, going to work for a big prestigious bank. The whole time I was there, I was 1-foot out the door, ready to make it 2 on my way to my startup dream. But then I'd let doubt creep in and allow myself to believe that \"90% of Startups Fail\" is good enough reason to go back to \"a real job\" (my Mother's words).  Eventually though, I jumped. 2-feet in. While I certainly miss the old paychecks and benefits, I couldn't be happier living the wild life of an entrepreneur. I write this response without any significant start-up achievements to date. But having lived the comfortable life in corporate America, and questioning whether or not I can afford the guacamole at Chipotle, I would take the poor life of a dreamer every time. It would be a shame to one day die full of dreams you never tried. Might as well get them out of your system while you're young. Plenty of life to learn and grow from any mistakes you make in the entrepreneur life. ",

If it's not in your dreams, and doesn't help you achieve them, don't do it.  When you are doing what feels right to you, you will gain almost superhuman stamina, because your work is in alignment with your beliefs.     Robert D Allen MBA, Tim Kidd have it wrong in my mind.    Skip the GEDconsider college (but only if the program is short, affordable, learner driven and most importantly skill based)begin to work in the industry that you want to enter when you go the entrepeneur route so that you can evaluate your options and build a network.  If you've already got a plan, find a well-informed person who is doing something related to your plan, and ask them to criticize it as harshly as they can.Use their criticism to improve your plan.Build yourself a network of mentors and take their advice to heart while at the same time never comprimising your values & core concepts.Remember that long before there was universal public education, there were billions of people who learned complex tasks from others and lived exciting, productive and satisfying lives because of their unique skills. It is OK to give up on being educated in a formal environment.  It is never okay to go even one day without learning.  If you're going to pursue entrepeneurship, please know that well-informed critics who give actionable advice are utterly priceless.  They can save you from endless trouble. ",
