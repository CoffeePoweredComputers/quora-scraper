            "answer_text": "First, what you mean by God. According to mythology, God is the energy that is inside you and arround you..everything in this universe consists of energy. This question is just like \u201cCan a man live without any form of energy\u201d.. How Silly..right !? The life energy inside you is also the energy of god. God can be easily defined as \u201cthe one who can not be seen or can not be touched\u201d but can be felt by the ones who believes in the presence of him.. There are many theists & atheists in the world.but these theists are in many groups like Hindhuism,jainism,islam,christianism,budhism..etc These all religions believes god but they quarrel among themselves because they believe that only their path(religion) to reach god right.but this fighting is immature When they become mature enough to understand about god.they do not fight among themselves.. By the way..lets come to the point.. I\u2019ve told you that the life energy inside you&me and inside all the living beings in the world is also the form of god. You are living because he is present in your body.When you dont realize that he is not in you then you will see yourself as a pile of flesh & bones & blood. But it is more than that..when you realize this you can start the journey of knowing the god. You can not make a dead man live with his pile of blood & flesh & bones. you can not make life energy(god) enter into his body..because you are in control of god but god is not under your control.. Physics says that \u201c Energy neither be created nor destroyed but it will change from one form to another\u201d Can anyone say \u201cHow was this energy took its origin, and from where it was originated ?\u201d No..right I say that this energy is the God..It is presence in many forms but it is one.. Life of all the living beings is depends on this Energy.Every human those who have said that they can live without god in the previous answers given for your question.. You can ask them that \u201c anyone of them is capable of creating the energy without using other forms of energy (or) can anyone live without using this energy in the universe(i mean they should not take energy like ..not eating, not inhaling air ,not drinking water..because these are also some forms of energy in the universe) None of them are able to do.. So, i can conclude this.. Any one can live without seeing or experiencing god..but no one can live without God.. Hope this is helpful.. ",

            "answer_text": "Without doubt people live without God, Although you would have to ask yourself the question; What do you mean by the word \u2018live\u2019 ? I was a very unhappy individual so many years ago until the age of 22 when I discovered a peace that passes all understanding. Life is filled with burdens and cares and the presence of evil, Many people are alive but unable to really live the life that they were intended to live because of skewed conceptions about what life is and who God is. I had many questions when I was younger and believed in God but didn\u2019t realize the life he desires us to have is not oftentimes like the life we think we should have, People on this planet can so often complicate life by evil intentions, pride and ego and selfish ambitions. Real life should reflect the life of heaven, which is meant to be simple and enjoyable but life on earth because of evil, suffering, sickness and our lack of trust in God because of these things, makes our life so often filled with fear, sadness, dread, and anxiety, life is never meant to be this way ! I used to worry ( and still tend to ) about a lot of things but it is a daily thing to leave all my anxieties on Gods altar, the Bible says \u2018have no anxiety about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God which passes all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus\u2019 None of us can avoid the evil and suffering and terrible tragedies of this world, but in spite of these things they do not have to rob us of the peace that passes all understanding that the Bible is talking about, I have suffered two benign brain tumor operations and other traumatic events in my life the past 38 years since I became a Christian, but I have been fortunate to survive. I don\u2019t know why some people pass away early and others ( seemingly evil ) tend to prosper. The fact is that in the end death comes to everyone but we do not have to live in a state of foreboding and despair because of a lack of purpose, That\u2019s exactly how I was 38 years ago but my life changed for the better You can live your life on your own terms without God, but there will be so many questions unanswered and eternity will be something you\u2019ll never be sure of or have peace about, Real faith in God causes you to trust, be joyful and be thankful for a REAL life that is worth living and so much more fulfilling than just an existence ! I hope this is of some help to someone. ",

            "answer_text": "Been there.. Tried that.. but I wouldn't advise it. I never ever knew how desperately empty my life was before I gave my life to Jesus Christ. There's just NO COMPARISON. Emptiness is what my life was. There's also definately something to be said for being part of the larger fraternity of the Family of God and having a Father relationship with God. Jesus Christ said He is the way, The TRUTH and THE Life\u2026but without Him there is no way to the Father. It's completely true. (Romans 10/9:10) At one time (after I had been a believer for a number of years) I went through a tough time when everything went really bad on me, so silly me thought it was because God didn't love me anymore\u2026so I thought that if God could drop me like that then this wasn't what I expected of God Who said He would never leave me or forsake me (Jesus) and so I put my Bible away and turned my back on Him. It was ME Who had the problem after that \u2026because if I thought I had problems before, when I was WITH God, they weren't problems at all, compared to the following 14 years. I almost lost my life.. And I'm still carrying the remnants of that with me today. So then my life returned in 2011 when I came back to God.. The ONE Lesson I learned was\u2026 \u201cDont even THINK ABOUT LIFE WITHOUT GOD\u201d because not only do you have no Spiritual protection (no cover), but you are not under any Pastoral authority and protection either. ESPECIALLY if you are or were a believer\u2026that is Spiritually extremely dangerous. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. In the physical sense, no. God sustains all life, so nothing can come into being or continue to exist without Him. Apart from His sovereign will and power nothing can live, including human beings. In the spiritual sense, no. Without the Spirit of God in a man there can be no spiritual unity or fellowship with God, which is the essence of spiritual life. Man lives forever no matter where he goes after this life; it is not eternal existence that unity with God gives him, but eternity with God. Spiritually unregenerate men will spend eternity apart from Him. God did not create humankind to be able to function optimally without subjection to Him, although He gave us free will to live otherwise. The moral dilemmas of mankind and the failures of governments and various social movements and human ideologies are evidence of that. Our consciences and our logic alone are not sufficient to achieve a perfectly just and peaceful world. Man is not competent to be his own god; he needs a higher moral authority than himself. Humanity can and does exist without subjection to that authority, but as we can all see, from human history and the events of the present day, the results are perverse and tragic. ",

            "answer_text": "Till date, I have lived with God. And in future too. But, I think man can live without God. To explain it further, I would like to know what is living with God means. If living with God means walking on the path shown by Him. Then, one can say, one can live with God. And, if living with God means not walking on the path shown by Him. Then, that is what most of the people are doing nowadays. Anyway, A man can live without God. Of which the great example was a living legend till last year was none but an epitome of courage and hope who was left paralysed on the wheelchair at the age 17 due to an extremely rare disease \u2014 ALS or LOU. Even the doctors said they could not do much. Still, he lived till the age of 76. Did you guess the man? If not, then, another hint is there. The man who was equal to Einstein in intelligence, a legend of Cosmology and studied 'Black Holes' was none other than Dr Stephen Hawking. More importantly, he was atheist or non believer of God.  In the world, there is an unaffiliated group who are non believers of God. In some communist country like China and Russia, most of the people are atheists. This shows that man can live without God. Thank you. ",

            "answer_text": " What we call god is actually the seven stage muscle tone based default human thinking mechanism.  However, gods of different religions use different number of stages, which makes people of different religions think different and thus incompatible. It is for this reason that it is supposed that religions divide people.  Therefore, attempts are made time and again to unite people of all religions.  What if all gods vanish into thin air? Then will all human beings become one homogenous pool? No, when there are no gods and no seven stage thinking, then let alone two human beings, not even two of our thoughts would be compatible with each other. Life will keep on changing endlessly. Do communits counties prove that god is not a must? Communism is based on the fact that under ideal condtions we don\u2019t need god. Therefore, these contries create an illusion of reality that its citizens are leading an almost ideal life. Thus, media control by the rulers is a must here. There wasn\u2019t even one single day in the entire history of mankind on which non believers became more than believers. There won\u2019t be a day in the future also. ",

For me,I don't need any faith in God because I believe in myself,I lead myself and I make my own choices,I know what is right and wrong so no one can misguide me and god is not the one giving us air to breathe and land and water to live,it's our mother Earth which is giving this all to us and there is no proof that god made mother Earth. So I choose to respect and follow mother Earth in place of god, people spend millions on god every year but only few spend to help our earth, I believe in doing good deeds instead of sitting at a place and praying to God because that's the stupidest thing a person can do. Another reason I don't believe in God is that if he/she is actually real then why millions of innocents die every month and why do our earth has to suffer even though it has done only good deeds and is providing life to billions of people,if the god is that much almighty then why does he let innocent beings suffer. In the end,u really don't need god to live your life peacefully,u just need faith in yourselves and do good deeds and that will make your life an happier one, god is just an individual created by people to impose their failures and shortcomings on, people who fail to do something say that god is not with me,so I can't do anything, terrorists can't justify their lust for killing people so they justify it by saying that we are doing it in the name of Allah (their god). So have faith in yourselves and do good deeds and no god can even touch you then. ",

This has profound theological implications. The exemplary lives of the saints who faithfully followed Christ show us the way to God the Father. And the perfect example of holiness is Christ himself. Saint Therese of Lisieux, France who died at the age of twenty-six is an example of true humility and child-like trust in God. Her biography can be heard on-line as an audio-book. Holiness is a child-like humility in the presence of God. During the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima, Portugal in 1917, the three children Jacinta, Lucia and Francisco had a vision of Hell which terrified them. This vision showed the children the fate of souls who reject God. Our Lady told the children to continually pray and do penance for the salvation of souls and to spread the message of prayer and penance so that many souls can be saved. The messages of Fatima remain true now as they were in 1917. ",

Although God is typically capitalized to signify the Christian God, I'll see this as a more generic God. And at least for me, that definition means to have a belief in a higher power. Now, I consider myself an atheist, although I still visit Church on Sunday as its a tradition that my family demands. But I do have a belief in something that can be seen as a higher power: SCIENCE!  Forgive me for the image, I just immediately think of him when I yell science. Anyway, although I don\u2019t believe in the God or a god, I still believe in a higher power. I imagine that\u2019s how it works with everyone, even if you don\u2019t believe something, that\u2019s a belief. It\u2019s like that one Socrates comic;  Everyone believes in something, and as I consider god to be a belief in a higher power; you can\u2019t exist without god. And if you don\u2019t believe in anything, are you were even human? ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not sure how well my answer will fit, being that I\u2019m not religious, and answering a question under a religious category. But I\u2019ll give it a go anyways, all the while remaining as unbiased as I can. I am an atheist, and even for the short time that I was religious, I never developed what truly religious people call \u201ca connection with god\u201d so essentially, I have \u201clived a life without god\u201d but not in such a way that I have succumbed to meaninglessness and despair. You see, I believe (like most atheists) that mankind created religion to serve very specific social needs within humanity. Perhaps the most significant of these, is the human need for a construct of higher ideals and hopes to believe in, otherwise one can find himself/herself wallowing in a pit of existential madness, such as the strife and chaos that can now be witnessed in most of western civilization, where everyone is known to drink/drug themselves into unconsciousness while the whole world crumbles around them. Nobody, even the most skeptical atheist, has the ability to completely deprive themselves of this need, it has become an innate component of human nature. When most religious people quote the great German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, who coined his very infamous phrase \u201cgod is dead\u201d they neglect to include the very revealing second half of the quote: \u201cgod is dead\u2026 and we have killed him\u201d it is absolutely NOT a celebration of the decline of Christianity, nor is Nietzsche promoting Nihilism. He is operating as a diagnostician. Nietzsche feared that the decline of Christianity in the West would result in a society-wide plunge into nihilistic hopelessness, and it seems time has proven him right. But he proposed that rather than using religion to serve these philosophical needs, which he believed to be a short cut that is actually detrimentally unhealthy for the human mind, that the true solution is to create your own source of this meaning through your own philosophical rationalization. This I have done, being a musician/artist, I use my works to bring this meaning into my life. but to answer your question, as an atheist, I believe it is possible to live a life without god. But to live a life without the philosophical ideas and meanings that religion represents? Of that, I am not so sure. If so, it likely won\u2019t be possible for thousands of years, until we reach the next stage of consciousness. ",

Many atheists here on Quora will tell you actually, everything is super-awesome, if you don\u2019t believe in God, much better than it is for you loser theists. But that\u2019s not what I think. I think it would be comforting, if somewhat perplexing, to believe in God. Without that belief, you have no assurance that the good guys are going to win, and things are going to work out in the end. That can be very difficult to live with. But that\u2019s how the world is. The truth, in general, is not very easy to live with. But if things *are* going to work out well, we had better start with the truth. God isn\u2019t going to save the world, or each other, from our decisions, so we had better make them well. ",

I try not to be afraid of anything, not to hate anybody and not to be envious My wife said once than I am more religious then most who proclaim they have faith. Because so many of them act quite the opposite. I knew that is not really true as there are still many good religious people, but I got her point. And was flattered. Some would say there is an act of God right there, but I resent that. It takes effort not to be pulled to the dark side. And I am selfish in a way I believe all the credit is solely mine. ",

Just as with Satan\u2019s deceptive lie to Eve in the Garden of Eden, so organized religion and their \u201ceducators\u201d attempt to trick and deceive students into an alternate vision of godliness and devotion. Unfortunately, that vision is contrary to God\u2019s will. Be aware, students of theology, the Almighty God Jehovah has not changed. He is the same God since the beginning. His written message is not in conflict with itself. If you are led to believe that it is, study more thoroughly and continue in your prayers for truth. Do not let those who claim superior knowledge lead you astray. The truth is not far off from any one of us - neither is God. ",
