            "answer_text": "No, consciousness (as in qualia, awake, aware, sensitive, &c.) is not an illusion.  And here is why:  First, lets define consciousness. If we define consciousness as a phenomena produced by evolution, then certainly it comes to us as a formal illusion, in that it is merely a perception generated by the brain. This view, however popular today, is not the correct view of consciousness in my view. How can I say that? Don't you know... Science!!! If science does not say something is so, it does not exist. Well, I disagree.  I, and others like me (Max Plank, Spinoza, Tom Campbell, et al) define consciousness as a fundamental force of nature-- the first mover unmoved as Schopenhauer said.  Thus, evolution is a product of consciousness (as a background force, gradually evolving as matter evolves), reality is a relationship between consciousness and information (matter) ; and being so intertwined, as matter evolves into life, so too consciousness integrates more deeply into that avatar.  When life evolved into mind, a quantum leap of integration took place, where the avatar (material organism) and the player (consciousness) are one and the same. We identify with this body, but we also identify with our awareness, and more deeply with the awareness, but because awareness is so in our face, and obvious, we take it for granted; but which is more illusory, the avatar or the awareness? Any rational person, from this perspective, would say the avatar for sure has a more illusory quality, but because our perceptions fail us, so too we may perceive consciousness as illusory. However, this is more to do with our ego, our perspective and knowledge, than it does with any outstanding reality.  In reality, consciousness is the only non-temporal and actually real thing that exists. ",

            "answer_text": "Consciousness is like a 2 dimensional shadow casted by your 3 dimensional reality. Consciousness is nothing more than a delayed experience of our realities based on a strictly need to know basis. At the conscious level of re-experience there is no need to be made aware of all the nitty gritty of life itself. Without the enlightenment of consciousness your shadow of consciousness would simply disappear leaving you in the dark to live the life of a zombie, literally and figuratively. Consciousness is like the final cut of a movie, you simply cannot change it afterwards other than now experiencing it as if a moment of reality itself. And believe it or not! When you slap your hand on a table and experience it as the moment ,you have actually done so more or less SIX SECONDS AGO depending on how conscious you are. Quite often the most simplistic things in life such as consciousness itself becomes the most difficult to conceptualize due to the nature thereof. Consciousness is merely an experience at a different dimension of reality during a different moment in time. The more enlightent we become the more we are blinded to the true nature of our realities. Gravity is a perfect example thereof, the heavier a planet becomes the lesser chance you have to escape from it. No more than it is possible of experiencing completely darkness and complete light during the same moment in time, is it possible to experience the conscious and the subconscious level simultaneously. You are the editor of the outcome of your own reality, but then only so based on the decisions which you made at the subconscious level of occurrence of your physical realities. Only you can choose to focus on the good or the evil which surrounds us. Maybe you cannot change the world on your own, but you can certainly change the way you navigate through it. And how you then get to experience your conscious level of awareness is entirely up to you. The Herd Mentality which people so easily become subjected to is when they enter a zombie like state of mind now subjected to the conscious level of the masses. Even the animal world, even flies and bacteria are subjected to some form of consciousness albeit at a lesser level. ",
