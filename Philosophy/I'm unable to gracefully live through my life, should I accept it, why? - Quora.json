If life has come to a point where you don't like it for one reason or another\u2026well only you have the power to change it and make your life more enjoyable. You getting to a point where you are able to \u201cgracefully\u201d live through your life may come quickly or could take some time depending on your situation. But until you are willing to do what is necessary to get yourself living gracefully things will remain as they are. If you accept the way your life is\u2026honestly you are the only one who can make that decision. For me to accept something I don't like or want in my life is the same as giving up and admit defeat. I'm the type of person where \u201ccan't\u201d is not in my vocabulary, neither is \u201cdefeat\u201d. ",
