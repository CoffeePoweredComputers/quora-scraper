            "answer_text": "Can you ask me a question that has never been asked before? Yes. I ask: \u201cWhy did you intend that I, Joe Andros, king of misanthropic optimism, bewitch you with another one of my stunning questions given that we all know humanity\u2019s search for meaning and belonging is in large part quite vain?\u201dWell, it is. If not always \u201cvain\u201d in the fruitless sense, it\u2019s pretty arrogantly self-centering. To think we command or determine or descry (true) meaning? To think we are so important that the fit of reality must adjust to our presence, such that we belong? I call that quite vain. At least a little. Vain on the sly, perhaps. We all do it, arguably. DON\u2019T JUDGEI didn\u2019t say it would be a good question. I would say in some senses, it is \u201cany good.\u201d It isn\u2019t a no good question, but when you sound the call for novelty, you shouldn\u2019t expect any good to come of it. Novelty is not a virtue. Novelty is just some really particular crap the world has thus far seen fit to have left as yet undone, and for the most part: wisely. Disclaimer: there is no sense in which I am \u201cking of misanthropic optimism.\u201d Unless one can attain to such lofty station while being oneself neither misanthropic nor optimistic. Pretty knotty, if so. Yet as we have seen on Quora, some questions may contain deceptive elements - and these elements do not disqualify them as questions! Their validity as questions inheres, and it incumbs upon the answerer to point out any little points of invalidity or falsity, should they wish. If they think it\u2019s pertinent to the best answer they\u2019ve got to give. Hey that was fun! Thanks for the question! Yarinail Zaki, cool name! Exclamation mark. ",

The nature of time is such that \u2018what time is it now\u2019 is always an original question, because the present it refers to is always novel. Questions which remain relevant despite the passage of time are likely those which pertain to things that really matter. What is love? Such a question is an eternal enterprise. Hence, I could ask you \u2018what is the temperature of David Moore\u2019s Chai Latte this morning?\u2019 No-one has ever asked that - because no-one cares. Things that a lot of people care about will be the subjects of questions that keep being asked.  ",
