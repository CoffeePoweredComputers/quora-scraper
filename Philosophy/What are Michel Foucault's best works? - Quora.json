            "answer_text": "Michel Foucault has based his entire corpus of history on the premise that society has been waging a battle between those at the center of society who wield power and those who live at the periphery and lack it. In The History of Sexuality, Volume I, (1990) he does not present a history of sexuality so much as yet another opportunity to delineate another marginalized sub-group, those who wish to succumb to their inner sexual desires but feel refrained by society. Ironically enough, Foucault notes that until the Victorian Age, prudery more often reigned over licentiousness throughout history. It was not until the 19th century, that society began to allow greater freedom for those who wished to explore their own sexuality. There is an inner irony here that is not present explicitly in the book. Foucault himself was a total sexual hedonist who frequented San Francisco's bathhouses where he may have caught the AIDS virus that killed him in 1984. Further, he openly expressed his belief that adults should feel perfectly free to have sex with children. He alludes to this in the book as he writes of a simple minded country youth who shares a \"milk curdling\" experience with a prepubescent girl. Foucault saw the 19th century as a true explosion of discourses on sexuality, the totality of which was to demolish the then emphasis on keeping sex and the topic of sex behind closed doors. The struggle for power shifted from a repressive state controlling the environment in which sex might reasonably be expected to thrive to one in which those who had been previously bereft of the right to deal openly with sex to now having an overabundance of that very right. The History of Sexuality then is a minor variation on Foucault's obsession with accusing the center of massed power of first identifying, then declaring aberrant, then ultimately marginalizing those on the fringes. Oddly enough, this book is one of Foucault's more coherent explorations of those on the fringe. By the time that Michel Foucault published Discipline and Punish in 1975, he had already made a reputation as the champion of the downtrodden. In his earlier pseudo-historian-fictional texts Madness and Civilization (1967), The Birth of the Clinic (1975), The Order of Things (1974), and The Archaeology of Knowledge (1972), he had attracted a great deal of attention in France as one who offered a politically correct alternative to mainstream society's insistence that the locus of interest in any culture must lie in the center. Those who did not fit in this center--the outcasts, the insane, the incarcerated--must be relegated to the marginalized periphery of that culture where they would simply languish in a morass that the center insisted was eminently justified. Along came Foucault to state that the truest way to judge the ethics of any society was to examine how those in the center treated those on the periphery. In a not unsurprising conclusion, he asserted that the further one was from the center, the more likely it was that one would be first stigmatized as aberrant, then isolated, and ultimately reduced to a miserable self who existed only as the object of a dehumanizing exercise of power by those who symbolized this system. In fact, if one examines the entire corpus of Foucault, one will learn that he sees society locked in a bear hug of power exercises, with those in the center who have it and exercise it over those on the marginalized periphery who lack it. Before 1975, Foucault was known mostly only in France where his earlier texts had not yet reached beyond the borders. When Discipline and Punish was translated into English, Foucault became an instant celebrity. It seemed that every subgroup that saw itself as marginalized--gays, the insane, radical feminists, and the incarcerated--could directly and immediately relate to his premise that the exercise of power by the powerful over the powerless was not unlike Orwell's O'Brien from 1984 telling a tormented Winston Smith that power exists for its own sake. Foucault saw a link between power and knowledge. Power could not be exercised without the knowledge needed to control inmates in a manner that had to wait until technology had advanced sufficiently by the Industrial Revolution to order the lives of inmates every minute of the day. It was no coincidence that the predecessors of the prison--the monastic orders, hospitals, and schools--all were built around the same basic mold: identify each candidate by rank, isolate him, and reduce his capacity to operate as a free-thinking individual. The more advanced that a society became, the more likely that it would punish an inmate who persisted in his original world view--hence the \"punish\" of the title. When Foucault begins his text with the graphic dismemberment of the inmate Damiens in Paris in 1757, he makes it clear that penology was still heavily invested in torture for the sake of torture. It was not until a century later that wardens would use physical coercion for what was to them a higher purpose--to create a new and presumably higher order of human, one who was more moral for his incarceration. Foucault agrees that such an overly optimistic view of the efficacy of prison reform was nonsense. Released inmates were very likely to commit further crimes and hence return to prison. What then do we today make of Foucault? Unfortunately, an objective view of Foucault shows numerous and grievous flaws in both his basic assumptions and methodologies. He makes constant errors of fact, date, time, and place. Events that he assigns to one century happen in another. His bibliography is rife with sources that are so obscure and out of date that it is impossible to verify Foucault's veracity. Further, his personal habits of indulging in sado-masochism all too often crop up in his works to suggest that his true agenda is to bare his tormented soul rather than to explicate how the modern prison system came to be. Ultimately, his many readers are left with taking his word that it was only the interlocking relation between power and the marginalized that can explain the source of the marginalization. I do not take his word for it so I do not recommend Michel Foucault as a true and unbiased critic of anything let alone so complicated a system as the modern prison. With the publication of Madness and Civilization in French in 1961, Michel Foucault established his reputation as the newest darling of the academic left. Foucault\u2019s sense of timing was impeccable; the political winds of change were just then starting to evince a tectonic shift of philosophical and critical thought. Foucault\u2019s basic premise that western society was rooted in indeterminacies, gaps, excesses, and oppression of marginalized groups ran counter to the current tenets of the Structuralists who envisioned all of society as fitting neatly into some overarching and predictable series of structures. With this book, Foucault began a lifelong assault on the benign notion that the Age of Reason was a boon for mankind. There was nothing benign, Foucault argued, in the ideology of the Age of Reason. Foucault took the premise from Adorno and Horkheimer in their Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947) that the Enlightenment, rather than being an age that ushered in reason as the panacea for the ills of humanity, instead saw advances in science, technology, and medicine as no more than handy tools of the Entrenched Powers That Be to identify, to marginalize, and ultimately to repress a wide range of marginalized victims like criminals, gays, the insane, and women. Madness and Civilization was Foucault\u2019s opening salvo on western culture. The book was an instant bestseller that propelled him to the vanguard of those rioting French students during the heady days when France was splitting down the middle and French intellectuals, fed by Camus, Sartre, and now Foucault saw a means to overturn centuries of oppression that included, oddly enough, the now despised pseudo-humanism of the repressive Age of Reason.
