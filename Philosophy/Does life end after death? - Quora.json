            "answer_text": "Before I answer your question, I\u2019d like to say that a belief in the afterlife is just fine because it serves a purpose. All lifeforms including humans are programmed to fear death so that each living organism will struggle to survive in order to fulfill the purpose of life: the preservation of genes. So the fear of death is programmed at the root level of all lifeforms. If a belief in the afterlife can alleviate this fear, then it serves a purpose. In fact, that is the most likely reason why such beliefs exist in the first place. At the same time, it reveals something else about the nature of death. There is no inherent reason for any organism to age and die since the genetic material themselves don\u2019t age at all. But all organisms do. And it tells you that death serves an essential and integral function in Life. There are basically two but I will only explain one here. Have you heard a saying that you can\u2019t teach an old dog a new trick? There is no inherent reason, mechanical or otherwise, for the correlation between aging and learning abilities. But they do and why? In nature, uncertainty leads to delay in decisions and actions which is detrimental, and often fatal, to survival. Learning, by its nature, implies unknowns and uncertainty. Therefore, learning needs to be limited to a certain phase of an organism\u2019s lifecycle so that it can make quick and necessary decisions rather than being paralyzed by uncertainty and indecision. Because of this, most living organisms go through a development phase, usually under the protection of their parents, to learn and adapt to their survival environment. Once this development phase is over, the organism lives the rest of its life making decisions and actions based on what it has learned and came to believe from that phase. The environment and its survival conditions do change regardless of how slow or gradual they may be. And the change requires living organisms to relearn and readapt to their new survival environment. Life\u2019s brilliant solution to this problem is aging and death. Instead of the old generation constantly relearning and readapting, Nature has solved it by retiring it. You can think of aging and death as a phased decommissioning of outdated units, that completed their purpose and no longer needed, in order to make a room for newer units. And there is nothing to fear about death. If you understand the nature of our universe, even time and space are a mere construct, neither infinite nor eternal, and depends entirely on awareness or observation. In other words, there is no space and time without some form of consciousness being aware of it. Have you ever heard the Double-slit experiment? In essence, light behaves like a wave when not observed, but behaves like particles when observed. I suppose the easiest way to explain this is to explain how the graphics are processed in a graphics-intensive computer game. In general, graphic games only render graphics as needed on the screen. The rest of the scenes, not appearing on the screen, are processed in the background as calculations. Only when the camera angle changes or moves, the computer renders the background calculations as graphics. In other words, whatever you see on the screen or reality is entirely depended on where the observer sees or goes. It is not an exact analogy but similar enough to understand the basic principles. Let me put it in another way. Before you were born, our universe existed for roughly 14 billion years. But you probably never felt that waiting for 14 billion years to be born was a really really long wait. That is because, for you, no universe or time-space ever existed until the moment of your birth. And the passage of time, whether one year, a billion years, or a quadrillion years, is utterly meaningless. Likewise, death brings you back to the state prior to your birth. And you can think of it as standing at the beginning and the end of time, space, and all existence. ",
