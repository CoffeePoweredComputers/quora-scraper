You can identify and judge and evaluate the methods, the technique and tools being used. But they can be employed to create both good, bad, or excellent work that are non-contradictory, insightful, coherent, etc. Then you must select the domain of philosophy you are interested in and probably put them in groups or categories according to their -isms is they are idealism, rationalism, modern, post-modern etc. In this way you might find more meaningful ontologies, epistemologies, ethics etc. here are questions to ask to obtain insights, make judgments and evaluations for FREE download. PHILOSOPHY \u2013 Aims, Methods, Rationale In this meta-philosophical study I commence with an investigation of Wisdom. I then continue with an exploration of the institutionalization of the subject and the professionalization of those involved in it. This I contrast with original and creative philosophizing. In then sows that philosophizing resembles and attempts to do theorizing. The 9 questions, etc of the Socratic Method and details of the Philosophical Toolkit occur throughout different stages of theorizing as one level and one dimension of it.

            "answer_text": "All of us are born philosophers, since the search for meaning at some stage haunts us.We start in Hedonism, eat, drink and be merry. Then we follow Pragmatism taking only cash value. Accept or reject any issue on the basis if it gives you utility. After some time, we apply reasoning-Okcham's Razor-to filtrate only those subject to reasoning constructed out of 5 senses. Longing for something beyond, our Humean skepticism gives way to Kantian Rational Faith- the practical Reason. By the time, you become senior citizen, you start chanting Bhaja govindam and derives mental comfort in Maya vada of Advaita-Sankara. Once we depart, people around us declare: Poor chap! May his soul rest in Peace! He wanted to achieve so many issues. At least in his next birth, let him realize that!Others end your life seemingly in Sunyavada of Buddhism but puts you back in: punarapi jananam, punarapi maranam...!So not some, not many, but pluralistic philosophies, since loko bhinna ruchi:Go with Reasoning by designing your senses!
