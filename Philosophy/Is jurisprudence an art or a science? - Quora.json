            "answer_text": "In Italy \u201cgiurisprudenza\u201d (in English \u201cjurisprudence\u201d) is a Latin therm meaning \u201cexperience of law\u201d. It derives from two therms: juris + prudens, that is \u201can expert of law\u201d. It\u2019s not a philosophy, but one experience, a thorough study of the law. We use the jurisprudence (or \u201cgiurisprudenza\u201d) to indicate the activity of interpretation by judges, lawyers and legal experts. Jurisprudence is a compass that helps us to orient ourselves in the world of law. Jurisprudence is, therefore, a science that is being studied at university. We study cases, various interpretation of the law, the philosophy of law, the Roman Law, the European Law, etc\u2026 But I think that jurisprudence is also an art, mostly for the doctors of law. They must be good at interpreting the law and adapting it to modern needs. It is not easy to know the law, but like artists, doctors of the law must know how to draw reality through principles, duties and new legal institutions. ",

            "answer_text": "Neither, both. Jurisprudence is what Plato or Aristotle would have called a techn\u00ea. A craft. The practical application of an art. Jurisprudence is the study of law - of what it is and what it should be. As \u2018legal theory\u2019 we know jurisprudence cannot be just a science - scientific theories aim only to tell us how things are, and not how they should be. It is neither simply art. The artistic pursuits are concerned with values inherent to the art - they are not generative, not practical value creators. Jurisprudence is not a science or an art, but a craft. A techn\u00ea. ",
