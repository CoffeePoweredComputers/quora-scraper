            "answer_text": "Human beings can be amazingly inconsistent! Formal or Essential Nihilism is the belief that: \u201c Nihilism; from Latin: nihil, lit. 'nothing'), refers to a number of different views in philosophy, all of which express some form of philosophical pessimism about the nature of human life. Different forms of nihilism hold variously that human values are baseless, that life is meaningless, that knowledge is impossible, or that some set of entities does not exist. Most commonly, nihilism refers to existential nihilism, according to which life is believed to be without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Moral nihilism asserts that nothing is morally right or wrong. Among others, nihilism may also take the form of epistemological nihilism, according to which knowledge is impossible, and a number of metaphysical forms of nihilism, which assert that composite objects do not exist, that necessary objects do not exist, or even that reality itself does not exist. The term is sometimes used in association with anomie to explain the general mood of despair at a perceived pointlessness of existence that one may develop upon realising there are no necessary norms, rules, or laws.Nihilism has also been described as conspicuous in or constitutive of certain historical periods. For example, Jean Baudrillard and others have characterized postmodernity as a nihilistic epoch or mode of thought. Likewise, some theologians and figures of religious authority have asserted that postmodernity and many aspects of modernity represent a rejection of theism, and that such rejection of theistic doctrine entails nihilism.\u201d Nihilism - Wikipedia Essential Nihilism, life is without purpose or meaning, leaves one with only suicide as an option! Since there is no reason to believe in Nihilism, there is no reason to kill oneself. At some point someone may realize that there is a reason for life\u2019 a reason that Nihilism fails to point out, and thus we can come to the realization that Essential Nihilism isfalse, and keep alive within us that life carries hope within us.

It can\u2019t quite be a truth (because that would be self-contradictory); it is instead a challenge to meet. I would argue that there are four responses to the challenge: Refuse to acknowledge it, either intentionally or for lack of ever considering it. (No books written about nihilism, as this person has nothing to write about there.)Surrender to it, and spend your life in meaningless escapism or mere survival. (No books written about nihilism, as this person sees no point in it.)Accept and embrace it fully, and work to end the illusion of self\u2014the Buddhist approach, if I am not mistaken. (Books written about it, out of compassion for others.)Recognize and acknowledge it, and work to overcome it\u2014Nietzsche\u2019s approach, if I have understood his writings at all. (Books written about nihilism, because it is meaningful to write them\u2014not to the universe, but to the author.)",

            "answer_text": "To the first question I would say no, not necessarily, and to the second question I would say that humans are complex things, no single ideology or philosophy ever defines a person's whole existence from cradle to grave. Nihilism is mostly accepting that there is no special plan for you, no great reason you exist, it's more akin to humility than it is to disinterest. Waiting for some force to give your life meaning is like waiting for a fish to jump in your net. Life is what you make of it, if that makes you sad that sucks for you. ",

I have read enough western philosophy in the last 30 years to know that what they are trying to sell you is a large smelly pile of feces of a male bovine nature. Don't take my word for it. Expand your horizons and read both sides of a philosophical debate before you condemn yourself to an unsatisfactory life based on some kind of false belief system. ",
