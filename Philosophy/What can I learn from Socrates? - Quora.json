            "answer_text": "Before beginning, I should say that the historical Socrates does not seem to have been a skeptic in the modern sense at all, and the Socrates of the Platonic dialogues most definitely is not a skeptic, even though he goes gently (but unyieldingly) to the root of whatever topic or issue he is discussing. This process of interrogating an issue collaboratively with others is often very uncomfortable when others hold a view of speech that makes it all about persuasion rather than dialogue, or when they hold an idea of truth that is basically fictionalist (vi&., anti-realist, or: they don\u2019t think that truth is real), or when they turn out to be more interested in clinging to mistaken apprehensions of what virtue is or what justice is or what anything is than they are interested in being vulnerable to the process of the dialogue, and vulnerable to where it leads if they ask fundamental questions collaboratively with others who love the truth in good will \u2014 even if these others aren\u2019t sure what the truth is. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d was Socrates big question. Ask about courage: \u201cWhat is courage?\u201d ask about justice, \u201cWhat is justice?\u201d, &c. Socrates was like his contemporaries the Sophists in being primarily concerned with human life and the concerns of life lived well, and lived with others, rather than the majority of presocratics who were asking the \u201cWhat is it?\u201d question about the natural world. He was, however, unlike the Sophists in that he did think there was a singular answer to the question \u201cWhat is justice?\u201d &c., whereas the Sophists were what one might call relativists about it. Unlike many of the people who have responded to you, Socrates was not a skeptic, and certainly not an atheist, though his idea of the gods was quite different from his contemporaries, and his idea of God, or the Good or the One, isn\u2019t really an object of worship, as it doesn\u2019t change, but is an \u201cobject\u201d (the Good seems to have no limit, so can\u2019t really be said to be an object) that is the most lovely, is the loveliness of lovely things, and is to be loved \u2014 even if it doesn\u2019t love you back. _____________________ Socrates wrote nothing; his students wrote about him, or just wrote him. Plato is the chief avenue for learning about Socrates, but the quest for the historical Socrates, though interesting in its own way, is not really where one will get the most mileage in terms of enriching one\u2019s own life. One must read Plato\u2019s dialogues for that. The dialogues are usually broken down into three periods, the early, middle, and late dialogues. There are letters that Plato ostensibly wrote that are attributed to him. The earlier dialogues are widely thought to represent much of the \u201cWhat is it?\u201d method and spirit of Socrates, whereas in the middle dialogues, we see Socrates\u2019 questions and methods developed with some of Plato\u2019s more mature themes and concerns spun out from the Socratic core. What will you learn from Socrates? \u2014your humanity. Everything. When is speech not speech, but a pressure hose? Are we really lovers of truth or wisdom, or no? What is virtue? What does it mean to know something? What is power? Friendship? Love? Justice? Piety? What corrupts individuals and cities and civilizations? What is the one in the many, and what is the stable in the changing? I can\u2019t even begin to get into the issues. Dive into some of the dialogues, and you\u2019ll see why his name means \u201csafe/saving keeping\u201d; Socrates will do no violence to you, but will recruit you into a dialogue that will be a great help toward making you whole, if you can suffer it without fear or power.

            "answer_text": "From the early Socratic dialogues, one learns that claim to knowing what is virtuous in human drives most often hinges on the fragility of a single word that by its\u2019 very fragility makes wisdom\u2019s pursuit as a topic of conversation a losing proposition. In these works, the wisest person \u2014 aka Socrates \u2014 stakes no claim to understanding variable and bias-weighted word s\u2014 like love or courage \u2014 while through his claim of not knowing he makes the two-fold point that 1) most people buy into a world of pre-cooked ideas with simple and 2) that they are all wrong and existence is not as simple as picking one particular code of living regardless of the particularities of a specific circumstance. Though Socrates teachings (or the fiction of Socrates) may act as the muse/explorer for Plato\u2019s middle dialogues, those works are Plato\u2019s post-Socratic consideration and, as such, are largely remote from Socrates teachings despite fragments like the cave analogy that may date back to Socrates broader considerations. The later Socratic dialogues affirm Socrates position that what truth exists in philosophy can only affirm a validity by its\u2019 performance in a particular context where words drive a commitment to action where the believer actions serve as the ultimate proof of that philosophical position\u2019s validity. Right or wrong, Socrates ultimately teaches that philosophical truths are only understood where the rubber hits the road in a particular context such that philosophies\u2019 test is not a dialogue but rather an individual\u2019s choices in life which only time can mebbe confirm as valid.
