            "answer_text": "Yeah, he kind of was. Something to note about Socrates is Socrates did not write Socrates, Plato did. Plato loved him some Socrates, and thought he was an incredibly wise seeker of truth. The Sophists in his dialogues are a bit like the Washington Generals are to the Harlem Globetrotters. They were people set up for Socrates to beat to illustrate how incredibly commanding and dominant Socrates is in these debates. It was also used to illustrate Socrates style of tangling his opponents in knots. In Plato\u2019s own work something is pretty clear: Socrates is a bit of a pompous dick. He probably was one of the most learned men and intelligent at a time when a lot of people couldn\u2019t even speak, let alone read and write. Because he knew a lot and knowledge was scarce he had a huge advantage when arguing with people. Socrates was commanded by the Oracle at Delphi to \u201cknow thyself\u201d, and he sort of works from the premise of \u201cyou really know only a few things, so you can leverage all these doubts people have about themselves into doubts about positions or beliefs that they hold.\u201d So he had a very effective style of debate. I imagine if Socrates were around today he\u2019d have videos on Youtube saying how he \u201cREKT Muslim apologists\u201d and \u201cPWNS SJWs!\u201d That\u2019s sort of his brand, was going around pwning people before twitter made it famous. I take Plato\u2019s view that Socrates was the one seeker of truth in a sea of verbal pugilists with a grain of salt. I don\u2019t necessarily think that Socrates was any more or less of one than the others. What I do believe is he provided some more valued insights that lived on in Plato\u2019s writings, and therefore he gets this label of \u201cthe father of modern thought.\u201d In a way though, he\u2019s also sort of an act.

            "answer_text": "Our sources differ. According to Aristophanes, he was not only a sophist but the highest-ranking of the sophists, the head of the sophistic gang, so to speak. According to Plato, he was the arch-enemy of the sophists. We can begin to resolve this contradiction simply by realizing that such labels are always subjective. Think of the term \u201csocialist\u201d as used in the 1930s. Was politician X a socialist or not? If no word directly from politician X on the subject has come down to us, and if the sources we do have include two acute observers with diametrically opposed opinions on the subject, then we have to abandon the issue of \u201cis he or isn\u2019t he\u201d and simply understand the ambiguities of such terms in the particular context. In our 1930s example: perhaps X was a Trotskyite. Perhaps one of our sources was a Stalinist who insisted that all real socialists support \u201csocialism in one country,\u201d also known as \u201cactually existing socialism,\u201d in the Soviet Union. So he said X was not a socialist. Perhaps another of our sources was a disciple of X, who learned about socialism FROM X, and who saw his own political philosophy largely as one of expanding on Xism. He would say X was a socialist. In the case of Socrates, the situation would obviously be different. But the general sense is the same. Get a sense of who Aristophanes was, and what sophist meant to him, then get a sense of who Plato was and what sophist meant to him, and the confusion about whether Socrates was a sophist may be dispelled.
