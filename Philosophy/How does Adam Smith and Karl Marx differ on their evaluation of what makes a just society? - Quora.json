            "answer_text": "I submit a case has already been made that Sean\u2019s premise is half right: Adam Smith believed landowners should govern society because they had a stake in their country and he believed they made better decisions than what he considered to be the then newly-emerging ruthless industrialists which would skew government policy in favor of benefiting their sectional interests at the expense of the poor. Smith was quoted by Marx so often it is remarkably easy to trick libertarians who have never read either. I am certainly not suggesting he hasn\u2019t read Smith. He most certainly has, and could never be \u201ctricked.\u201d Nor am I suggesting Sean is a libertarian, vulgar or otherwise. Sean is a very smart young man. Smith was a very conflicted man. Einstein was conflicted when his own research suggested things that prompted him to state his firm belief that, \u201cGod does not play dice with the universe.\u201d Quantum mechanics and its implications made him \u201cuncomfortable\u201d. Smith may have had more than one intent. Most people do, and are not so single-minded, like a fanatic who has \u201credoubled his efforts and forgotten his aim.\u201d A Libertarian Tricked \u201cIt is a far, far better thing to have a firm anchor in nonsense than to put out on the troubled seas of thought.\u201d -- John Kenneth Galbraith The problem with Sean\u2019s answer is that he does not take into account that Adam Smith, like John Locke, and every other educated woman and man of the period believed in God and the Bible. And the Bible teaches that the earth belongs to God and he created it to be enjoyed IN COMMON by all Mankind. And if this question is about justice, and ethical behavior, morality comes into play. The first objection I can hear is \u201cWait a minute, how do you know Smith was even religious, Marx was not!\u201d Just do a find search for the phrase,\u201dearth\u201d and \u201cin common\u201d in Locke\u2019s Second Treatise on Property. That includes land. The Earth. It is clear to a blind man what Locke is saying. He repeats this mantra over and over and over. The Earth belongs to all mankind in common. None other than Franklin and Jefferson and most of the founding generation believed and said the same many times. And Adam Smith did not believe otherwise. In those days, you could lose your head or be burned at the stake for openly doing so in some places. List of people executed for witchcraft - Wikipedia To suggest such a thing is tantamount to calling the great thinkers of the Enlightenment \u201cDevil Worshippers.\u201d But they were only privately closet Deists. To speak such heresy loudly at that time could get still you roasted at the stake or deemed a witch, and roasted at the stake. Ironically, it always the physicists. Newton was devoutly, obsessively religious. His Newtonian Universe is now only taught as an introduction. That model falls apart at the subatomic level. All 4 wheels come off, and the spare is flat. But this does help one understand why the Divine Right of Kings had to go. Today there are more false christians around than at any time in human history. Smith was actually a \u201cprogressive.\u201d A conflicted one, but a progressive nonetheless. He was hoping to end feudalism. Vestigial feudalism is everywhere in America today. And it is about the failure to remember that no one actually owns the earth, but God. I\u2019m an agnostic and it makes perfect sense to me based on the purely ethical point of view, beautiful sense. If you believe taxation is theft, but sole ownership of any land that was or was not stolen at any time in history, you are suffering from the King Kong of cognitive dissonance on steroids. Just before he committed suicide, Garrett Hardin confessed he wished he had titled his famous essay, \u201cThe Tragedy of the UNMANAGED Commons.\u201d John Locke, Second Treatise, \u00a7\u00a7 25--51, 123--26 Furthermore, after reading Sean\u2019s retelling carefully it strikes me that the historical context he is traveling with has yet to catch up with the economic interpretation of history and the Constitution, (and Smith did influence the Framers and Founders), and this interpretation that replaced the debunked, (by Forrest McDonald), economical interpretation of the \u201cprogressive\u201d historians of over 100 years ago, like Charles Beard. Very confusing - the term \u201cprogressive\u201d here, I know. But this is why historians are important. This is another debate, however. Ric Beall's answer to How do Democrats and Republicans differ in how they plan to reduce the US national debt? Who wrote this, Karl Marx or Adam Smith? The labour and time of the poor is in civilized countries sacrificed to the maintaining of the rich in ease and luxury. The landlord is maintained in idleness and luxury by the labour of his tenants. The moneyed man is supported by his exactions from the industrious merchant and the needy who are obliged to support him in ease by a return for the use of his money.

Man walking along a road in the countryside comes across a shepherd and a huge flock of sheep.

            "answer_text": "Adam Smith and liberalized markets Adam Smith believed landowners should govern society because they had a stake in their country by virtue of owning real estate, and he therefore believed they made better decisions than what he considered to be ruthless industrialists who would skew government policy in favor of benefiting their sectional interests at the expense of the poor. In order to counteract the effects of industrialization on the human condition, which he described as creating a \u201crace of laborers\u201d whose humanity was crushed, he called for widespread public education. In the context of 18th century Europe this was a very radical idea. Smith generally opposed government intervention in market transactions on the grounds that government was not a neutral representative of the public (the concept of the \u201cpublic good\u201d wasn\u2019t well developed at this point in history) and would almost always favor vested aristocratic or business interests and interfere with what be believed was humanity\u2019s natural propensity to trade. His advocacy of what later came to be called \u201cfree markets\u201d was based on a recognition of the economic fallacies underpinning mercantilism and the belief that free markets would generate liberty and equality by removing the influences of the upper classes, particularly with respect to price-fixing. The result would be a natural order of liberty where people interacted with each other as equals in the marketplace. Smith wrote his magnum opus An Inquiry into the Wealth of Nations in an earlier phase of industrialization where the main object of criticism was the economic thinking that dominated Europe since the commercial revolution. His analysis of market relations revolved around product markets in the context of individual producers exchanging their wares through a process of mutual negotiation. In these scenarios it is easy to see liberty and equality in market relations, but he gave scant attention to the suppression of individual agency and autonomy resulting from labor markets and the power dynamics they generate and reinforce.  Karl Marx and socialism Karl Marx is completely different in that he rejects any notion of a just or moral society as an idealistic bourgeois notion that relies upon subjective value judgements rather than an analysis of concrete material conditions. Marx\u2019s objective was understanding the dynamics of capitalism and taking them to their logical conclusion; thus socialism is not a prescriptive ideal but merely the result of an analysis of capitalism\u2019s laws of motion as well as a more general historical framework where technological development is the prime mover of socioeconomic development. Socialism isn\u2019t a \u201cjust\u201d system and Marx vigorously condemned early socialist thinkers interested in projecting their subjective notions of morality and organizing movements to achieve said ideals, which he and later socialists lambasted as \u201cUtopian socialists\u201d. Marx\u2019s views are postulated on the historical trend of technological development freeing humans from mundane activities necessary for bare survival to focus on more complex tasks and human needs through increasing productivity. In the Marxist framework, once technological development reaches a certain point it renders existing social relationships insufficient for further progress, creating a contradiction between what is technologically feasible and the old stifling forms of social organization. To simplify greatly, Marx saw that economic activity was becoming increasingly socialized and capital inputs were becoming an ever larger composition in the production of economic value relative to human labor. As constant capital - the means of production - became an ever larger component in the production of economic value, their returns increase while labor\u2019s share decreases. Eventually development would reach a point where shared ownership of the means of production is necessitated to provide the entire society with a source of income (this need not take the form of money and can take the form of labor vouchers or in-kind allotments), thereby coming full circle by socializing the return on the means of production. Eventually technological development reaches a point where human labor plays a marginal role in the production of value, leading to a state where labor is reduced to a bare minimum and people are truly free to pursue their own interests. This would eliminate social hierarchy and inequality because everyone would have an equal relationship to the social means of production and could no longer be easily compelled to submit to any other individual; it would also engender genuine freedom where people\u2019s lives are defined by their own interests, passions and desires as opposed to being forced to work as a prerequisite for receiving material necessities. While this might sound like a paradise from the perspective of a worker living in a capitalist society, it is not intended to be any form of ideal society nor is it presented as being a morally just social arrangement - it is merely the result of technological progress and socioeconomic evolution. To put it in perspective, to an average European living in the 18th century, early-21st century Europe for the average European would appear to be a utopia with its productivity, life expectancy, and widespread of material necessities now taken for granted. Karl Marx believed the working class would be the agent of social change required for the socialization of the means of production. Keeping in line with his materialist outlook, this had nothing to do with moral outrage over the treatment of workers or their living conditions under capitalism, it simply had to do with the material interests of different classes. Marx assumed that people are primarily driven by material interests rather than ideals. Logically, the capitalist class as the ruling class under capitalism wouldn\u2019t be interested in abdicating their ownership of the means of production and losing their social prestige, power and wealth during the transition to socialism. The working class, on the other hand, would stand to benefit most from the transition to socialism. Hence the slogan \u201cworkers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains!\u201d.
