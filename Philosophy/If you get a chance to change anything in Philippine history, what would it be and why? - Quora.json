            "answer_text": "The Truth is that, History is not simple like reading a book. Just continue reading for example If the story of the 10datus from Borneo were true and u want to eliminate it, do you think you or your parents or grand parents were even born.? You urself wouldn't exist. But as 4 myself, I do not hate my life so, why would I asked to be unborn. Even the dictatorship of Marcos, unlike one answer here, actually matters. During his time, many things happened not only in the economy of the Philippines but also in personal lives of people. My maternal grandparents move to another newly opened mountainous jungle area designated for harvest of timber. It is where my mother met my father, and together with many people from different parts of the Philippines, it has become our hometown and is now a first class municipality. The history of my hometown is not unique in the history of the Philippines, for example: many unpopulated places in Mindanao were also asked to be settled during the Marcos era. That is why there are a lot of ilocanos and tagalogs in there. Of course, and many people from the visayas region too. You an only wish to change history if it doesn't happen yet, whether u like it or not, u might be vanishing urself in the face of the earth (it's okay, if for example, only you, will be gone, but history is owned by many people). But history is called history bec it happens already. You see, as I already stated, history is not as simple as flipping the pages of whatever book you are reading and choose to keep the pages you want and tear or remove those pages that you don't want.

I would wish for the pre-colonial culture to have been better preserved than its current state now\u2026 I want people to be knowledgeable and proud of this period just as much as any other period in our history.I see some people who are interested in this topic, but since they are ignorant of this period, they instead spread misinformation, whether on purpose or not, but it doesn\u2019t really matter because both are equally damaging. By the way, I politely invite anyone interested to learn more about our history to read my articles and watch the videos below.
