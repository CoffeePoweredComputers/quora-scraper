            "answer_text": "Art and science can co-mingle, art can utilize science, and science can be used to study art. Art and science can go together like an Oreo cookie where both biscuit and cream are needed to make the whole, but art and science themselves are immiscible. This is to my understanding of art and science. Why do I say this? Science is the study of what is, what things are, and how they have come to be. Art is the activity of making choices about the stimuli and content thereof to communicate a message within a society. The galaxy is full of constellations and galactic constructions, and you would think that the Pillars of Creation would be an ideal example of something that is both art and science, and I am here to tell you that it has both, but is not both.  The formation itself may be a result of scientific research, but the choices for composition, lighting, possibly the use of the starburst filter on only two stars, the orientation to make the rightmost pillar look like a puppy howling at the sky, the choice to keep the sharp edge on the excluded area in the upper right sharp, cropping the photo so the upper leftmost star is in the picture, the subtle tones \u2014 the decision aspect of the medium of deep space telescope images \u2014 those are the art. Those are the decisions that shaped the messaging. Science is the study of what was, what is, and what will be.Art is the process of decisions to enhance communication.Art and Science are distinctly different, can be wound tightly together, but are always immiscible. You can always find the decisions introduced for the purpose of communication. You can always find the aspects that are the immutable truth of what was, is, or will be. You cannot choose what was, is, or will be. You can only choose how to communicate that and what message to deliver with it. ",

Likewise, at the frontiers of research and concepts Science can have qualities that approach art. While one can assert their respective differences nevertheless the borders dividing them are nebulous. This also includes mathematics as well. ",

Photography mixes technology with art to make images. In older days there was also chemistry as well. Sculpture demands a high amount of knowledge on how materials can be worked with. For just a few examples. ",
