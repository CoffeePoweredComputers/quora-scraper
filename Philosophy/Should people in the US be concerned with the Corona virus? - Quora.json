            "answer_text": "Doih!! Of course. From history we can see what happens when an alien disease hits a virgin population that has no immunity. The Indian Massacre in the 1800\u2019s was not due to war - but disease. Also what happened when Cortez and 1500 sick Spaniards coughed all over their Aztec and later Inca hosts. Now, Coronavirus comes to virgin Americans who have little to no immunity. Since COVID-19 is lethal to immune compromised seniors whose regenerative systems are at low ebb - and they help with the buoyant attitude toward spending which has kept the American economy above the floodwaters encroaching on Europe, the UK and now China - their deaths as a result of the confusion and fear generated by not having a clue on how widespread the disease spread is will cause state governments one by one to start programs of isolation that hit the news each night. I for one amy not counting on economic growth this year and am preparing for a recession. So - should the US be concerned - Yes. Should we fear the disease - No. Should we fear the people we have put in charge of managing our response to the disease will make a mistake - prioritizing their financial positions over public safety - Yes - be afraid, be very afraid.

Your pets aren\u2019t going to get infected and they don\u2019t infect you! Stay away from large gatherings, anyplace where people congregate! Avoid touching doorknobs elevator buttons grocery carts etc. Wash your hands often! For those of you who think wearing a mask will keep you from getting sick? Yea sorry not gonna happen that\u2019s impossible you see! Why? Simply because you\u2019re still exposed thru your eyes your skin any injury or open cut! Those mask don\u2019t keep out airborne mist! Just pollen and dander and dirt! If you\u2019re that afraid get a biohazard suit and your own supply of oxygen! Look is it deadly? Yes but unless you\u2019re in poor health or really run down you\u2019ll recover unless of course it\u2019s your time to go then it really doesn\u2019t matter! ",
