Many of us do understand that a few extremists do not represent the whole. What we would like to be understood is that these extremists are justifying their actions using the same holy text (albeit cherry picked). Due to this, we start hearing the \u2018oh, they just don\u2019t understand the Word\u2019 and apparently neither do all the different versions of Abrahamic Religion. I don\u2019t point out extremists to tell you religion is bad. I point out extremists to demonstrate that your Holy Text is not infallible and it is not inerrant. ",

            "answer_text": "How can we make people understand that a few evil people doing bad things do not represent the whole religion? This is a big problem. Here is the perception you have to change: For example, people who don\u2019t support pedophilia, bestiality, slavery, clerical murder, misogyny, and hatred of gays will tend to blame the evil people and the religion both. This double whammy is hard to counter. Even when you point out the atrocities the bad people are committing are shameful, a lot of those same perpetrators publicly admit that they are only being faithful adherents of the religion. This is why it is very difficult for the rest of the world to understand. ",

In a very similar manner to things like climate-change related science denial, certain people in certain groups make it part of their political and personal identity to literally identify with such incorrect information. This is especially true when it comes to conservatives and conservative groups in Western countries who are frightened by immigrants, and who therefore believe carefully crafted lies about Muslims as a result.

Do they take action to stop the evil from continuing? Or do they look the other way, keep their mouth closed, make excuses for the behavior. How the majority react (or lack of action) can make it a much harder sell to convince people a particular religion is benevolent. ",

The right question is, why do most of the people who sign up to a religion not blame themselves when the minority of followers of that religion act on the hate in the holy texts and do the horrible things that it tells them to do? If you endorse a vehicle of hate and refuse to strip the hate out of it, you are responsible for feeding that hate to the fragile minds that are attracted to the hate and who act on it. ",
