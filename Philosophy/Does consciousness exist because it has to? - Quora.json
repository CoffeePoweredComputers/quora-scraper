            "answer_text": "This is a really interesting question to be honest.I like to take a little different approach to this question.We cannot directly experience silence since it's the absence of sound. Yet even though we cannot directly experience it we can experience it indirectly, we can know it's silence because there is no sound. The same applies to deep dreamless sleep. We cannot directly experience it yet we can remember afterwards we were sleeping.This also applies to cases of unconsciousness, either by lack of brain activity or by too much brain activity (epileptic episode). This last one is interesting. It shows that with huge brain activity there is no conscious experience, the brain cannot handle all information. And what might even be more important, it cannot store the experience in memory.Memory in fact might even be all we can experience 'conscious'. There is a sense impression which we 'store' in memory, directly retrieve afterwards and we able this 'stored impression'. If we would be aware of every direct sense impression we would go nuts because there is no filtering of the massive onslaught of impressions. Consciousness is in this case the 'process' that retrieves from memory. This could give an indication why we can only be conscious, there needs to be an 'object' stored in our mind to be conscious about. When there is nothing (silence is also an object in our mind) we cannot label it and thus we cannot be conscious about it. ",

            "answer_text": "This question contains a lot of assumptions. \"It's impossible to experience not being conscious\" Really? So, an amoeba is conscious? Or a bacteria? Or a tree? How can there be a mind without a brain? How can there be counsciousness without a mind?  A tree has no brain, no mind, no counsciousness, but it experiences. It changes information with its enviornment. If it didn't, it wouldn't be able to survive and evolve into more complex forms, as it certainaly does, all the time. Counsciousness exists because we have reached the necessary level of complexity in our brains for it to be possible, not because it was necessary. Life existed on this planet for billions of years, just fine, without any level of counsciousness - which is limited, as far as we know, to mammals and some birds (maybe other species will be included in the future).

            "answer_text": "some studies show that consciousness actually is developed in our brain in the first years of our lives. There are studies being done on children, where the consciousness of a child is measured at different ages, and it seem that this process begins around the age of two.   ",
