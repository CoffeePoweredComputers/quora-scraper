            "answer_text": "The word jealousy is one of most mis-used in the English language. Dictionary definitions are not very enlightening. It\u2019s how the words are used in everyday language and activity that tell you what they really mean to people. But let\u2019s start with envy. Envy refers to covetousness. When you envy someone it means they have something (an object, a talent, a friend, a personal quality\u2026) that you would like to have for yourself. You might envy someone her gorgeous coat, her ability to lay the piano, her awesome best friend or boyfriend, her charm with people - to give just a few examples. The envy you feel could go one of two ways. It might be benign: you admire this thing about the other person and wish you had it, but you like the person and wish them no harm. On the other hand, it could be malignant: you detest the fact that this other person has something that you feel rightfully belongs to you and you wish that you could take it away from them, or at least destroy their pleasure in it. Jealousy, true jealousy, is quite different to envy. People who are jealous do not necessarily want anything that the other person has. Neither are they afraid of loss or abandonment. But they see the world in terms of their set of own values and are unable to cope when this system is upset. A couple of examples might help to illustrate. A gym instructor is very good at his job but is a little overweight, or maybe getting a little older than the average instructor. People notice this - of course - but it\u2019s not an issue. He does his job well and is just a little different from the norm. However, a couple of people are extremely offended that the gym employs someone who does not match their criteria of what they think a gym instructor should be (young and fit). It really bugs them and they hate having him around. They treat him with disdain. They bitch about him. They find fault with his work. They complain. They do not rest until they have tried everything to get rid of this man. And if they succeed then the world as they believe it should be it is restored to order.A working class married couple no longer have any love or respect for each other. The woman was a stay-at-home mother and the husband was a traditional breadwinner. After the children grow up and leave home, tensions set in that are unresolved by counselling, and the couple divorce. Neither wants to get back together. But after they have gone their separate ways, the husband cannot stand to hear that his ex-wife has taken up study and is planning to go to university. He pesters her on the phone telling her she is being a fool - she is not \u2018that type of person\u2019 - she should stop right now. It is nothing to do with him and she is no longer his wife but he feels she should live according to his standards and values.The man did not want the ex-wife that he harassed. The gym members did not \u2018covet\u2019 anything about the gym instructor that they victimised. They all wanted the world set back in order they way they were used to and the way they felt comfortable with. They wanted their own values restored. They were jealous - hence the bitching and the undermining. On Quora, however, and in life generally, the issue of jealousy most often comes up in regard to romantic and sexual relationships. We read people describing their confusion over a partner\u2019s behaviour as \u2018jealousy\u2019. When they describe being hurt that a partner seems to spend more time with others than with them, for example, they ask \u201cHow can I stop being jealous?\u2019 It would, in fact be a little more accurate to describe their feelings as \u2018covetousness\u2019 or envy - since it is about wanting something (time, attention, affection) that is apparently being given elsewhere. However, even this doesn\u2019t really describe what\u2019s going on. Most often the two partners simply haven\u2019t talked about their expectations within the relationship. They have different ideas about what\u2019s okay and what isn\u2019t. Talking about things may help to clarify but it may also show that they are simply a mismatch - they just have incompatible expectations of how they want to live together. Nothing to do with jealousy at all. But \u2018jealousy\u2019 has become the buzz word to use in so many questions about relationships. Sometimes insecurity may play a part, as when one person feels unsure about the affections of the partner and so, for example, flirts with others in order to make their partner \u2018fonder\u2019. This might be described as trying to induce a form of jealousy - i.e. to make the partner behave according to your set of values, which places you at the centre of the universe! Envy wants and desires, either with admiration or with bitterness. Jealousy wants to control. It is possessive. It wants to remake the world (household, workplace, marriage\u2026) entirely according to ones own value system and sense of \u2018rightness\u2019. It is not about love and desire at all. It often enjoys inflicting harm. It is destructive and it is often close to hatred. ",

            "answer_text": "Jealousy is defined as: Feeling or showing envy of someone for their achievements or advantages. the definition of jealously Envy is defined as: Feeling of discontent or a growing resentful want of the possessions, ideas or qualities of someone else. Definition of ENVY Desire is defined as: A strong feeling of wanting to have something or wishing something would happen. Definition of DESIRE You can desire something without associating that something with another person or organization. Jealousy and envy, however, involve the want of something another has in their possession. The two words have basically the same definitions. Desire is the word not belonging in the definition of jealousy or envy. These are wants for something already achieved by another. Desire is wanting something that may be in a store, online, or a want for notoriety in your occupation or hobby. You can desire to be your own boss. You may think you envy a friend who is his own boss, but you cannot take his experience. You can desire an experience similar or as successful as his. If you envy a neighbor\u2019s new car, your buying the same model will not ease the feeling of envy because they bought it first. You want to be the trend setter, the first to have a new car or the experience of the neighbor when he brought the new car home. You can desire a family. By finding a person with a like mind, you marry and have children, which fulfills your desire. If you are envious or jealous of the family life your brother has, you want an experience identical to your brother\u2019s or your brother\u2019s actual life, but not your own experience. It is easier to fulfill a desire than achieve the objects of your envy or jealousy. ",
