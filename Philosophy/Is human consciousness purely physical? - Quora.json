            "answer_text": "No, human consciousness is not purely physical. We know this because the contents of conscious experience are not physical. For instance, mathematics is not a physical phenomena but rather an idea phenomena. For consciousness to occur, two things must happen simultaneously. Physical phenomena and non-physical phenomena must co-occur. the physical organism must instantiate non-physical representations. Things like color, sound, smell, and other qualia and also thoughts, ideas, meanings must exist and be instantiated in some kind of physical form. Put another way, organisms that embody representations with their nervous systems are conscious. Representations are the content of experience. without representations there can be no experiences, and hence no consciousness. without physical processes that instantiate representations there can be no awareness, and no experiences - and hence no consciousness. For someone to argue that consciousness is purely physical requires they demonstrate how the contents of consciousness, things like the square root of -1 are physical phenomena, as well as things like the color magenta, or fear, or danceability in music. let alone things like errors, empty sets, illusions, or regrets. None of these are physical phenomena, but they are phenomena. We live in a universe that is made of particles and most of the local particles are in the form of molecules; that is the physical part of the universe. But we also live in a universe with ideas, concepts, meanings, feelings, and qualia; that is the non-physical part of the universe. This non-physical part is representational. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes consciousness is entirely caused by physical processes. Physical processes are the only type of causes that can be understood scientifically. However, physical processes can be used to model and represent various abstract ideas, such as a center of gravity, which could be defined as being non-physical. So it all depends on how you define the terms physical and non-physical. (However please don\u2019t define your terms as Calvin Tolman does because its preferable to avoid contradictory concepts when possible). Consider a flag after image (after staring at inverted colors). The after image appears to be out there on the white screen you are now staring at. We can say the after image is not physical because it is not where it seems to be. The physical cause is not out there where it seems to be. However, we can also say that the after image is indeed physical because it is generated by physical processes in the brain. So for an intuitive answer, its ok to imagine that sometimes things are real and non-physical. However, for a more rigorous understanding, it always comes down to some physical cause. That\u2019s why the full and proper answer is \u201cyes, consciousness is caused by pure physical processes\u201d (the same goes for qualia). Here is where Calvin goes off track : \u201cthe physical organism must instantiate non-physical representations.\u201d That\u2019s wrong! Instead the physical organisms represent non-physical concepts,ideas and sensations, but the representations themselves are physical. Here is where Calvin gets it right ! \u201cwithout physical processes that instantiate representations there can be no awareness, and no experiences - and hence no consciousness.\u201d Good! We agree! Calvin says : \u201cBut we also live in a universe with ideas, concepts, meanings, feelings, and qualia; that is the non-physical part of the universe\u201d I\u2019m willing to accept that claim (as I hinted above). Just remember that these \u201cnon-physical part of the universe\u201d are caused by physical representations in the brain. Likewise numbers and mathematics are also caused by physical representations whether it be symbols written on paper or beads on an abacus or brain processes. Without any physical representation the operations on the numbers cannot be performed. If the numbers are not able to accomplish their operations (and properties such as identity) then they are not numbers. Hence they depend on the physical representations. ",
