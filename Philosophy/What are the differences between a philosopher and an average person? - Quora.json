            "answer_text": "In Plato\u2019s writings and that of other ancient philosophers you find the view that there are basically three kinds of people. There are people who are driven by pleasure and self-gratification, and these people are consumed with making money. There are people, a smaller number, who are driven by \u2018honor\u2019 or (we would say) the desire for status and recognition. Those are the manipulative people climbing up in the hierarchy or seeking political office. Then there is a very small number of people who love truth and goodness for their own sakes, and they are the philosophers. The hardest but the best thing to be is a true philosopher (not the same as somebody who teaches philosophy for a living). This is a conception of philosopher that has various problems, the chief one being an unjustified contempt for people living ordinary lives and earning money because they love their families and want to support them. This makes people think philosophers are just arrogant so-and-sos who are blind to their own forms of status-seeking. Aristotle\u2019s solution to this problem in the Ethics is to use the wisdom of the philosophers, their discoveries about truth and goodness, to guide ordinary people living a family and civic life. In other words everyone can bring some philosophy into their lives. There is also a more illiberal version of this approach in Plato\u2019s Laws, where philosophical wisdom takes more authoritarian forms. ",

            "answer_text": "(1) The Academic Life. We do piecework. I teach 9 hours a week and am obliged to keep 5 hours of office hours. The trade-off is that I\u2019m expected to work all the time\u2014which is what I\u2019m doing today, Sunday, and from which I\u2019m right now taking a short break. I spend my \u2018off-hours\u2019 during the week preparing for classes and doing research. I spend my \u2018vacations\u2019 doing research heavy-duty because I\u2019m expected to publish and be professionally active. I take my laptop with me everywhere, access journal articles online, and just work on and off all the time. That\u2019s the life I wanted\u2014to \u2018live over the store\u2019. I\u2019m blessed\u2014this to me is the best possible life. But it\u2019s not what everyone would want. And it's very, very hard to get. (2) No Package Deals. We are into consistency and entailment. The Folk, in my experience, including students, think in terms of package deals\u2014liberal or conservative or whatever. Our aim is to determine what entails what, to question whether the package deals are consistent, and whether one can consistently hold positions that are at odds with the standard, conventional cultural packages. So, e.g. I\u2019m a socialist as regards domestic policy but a hawk on foreign policy (and currently hoping that we will bomb ISIS into kingdom come!). That isn\u2019t the conventional view, but it is (arguably) consistent.  And we want to see arguments for everything\u2014or the admission that something is a fundamental bedrock assumption for which there can\u2019t be arguments. So, e.g., I believe that the only intrinsic good is the satisfaction of sentient beings\u2019 preferences and, therefore, that \u2018the environment\u2019, non-sentient Nature, (\u2018The Earth\u2019) has no intrinsic value. There\u2019s no argument for that. That\u2019s where I start. We start in different places, and the game is to see where, given our starting places, where we should go from there. So we flush out fundamental assumptions and determine what they entail. I, and most of us, are faithful to Our Founder\u2019s doctrine: the unexamined life is not worth living. OK, this was my break\u2014back to work. ",
