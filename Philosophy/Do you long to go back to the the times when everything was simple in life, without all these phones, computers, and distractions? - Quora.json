            "answer_text": "Absolutely. There's the famous Stanford marshmallow experiment, testing the correlation between innate ability for delayed tolerance, and it's link to success in life. I grew up in the 1980s. I had an answering machine that I checked when I got home at night after work. My news was on TV, having been filtered through editors and their job was to fact-check it before publishing it. Shops were closed on the weekend, so you either bought your toilet paper on thursday night shopping (they stayed open until 9pm on thursdays, closed at 5pm every other weekday) or you found some other option to wipe your butt until monday. Our mortgages were 30-year agreements, and we worked that long to own our homes, and when that day came, we know the gift had been earned. All this waiting stuff was totally normal in my generation. Strength and resilience was encouraged. My generation seems to be easy to interact with, reacts reasonably and are generally mature. Of course there's exceptions, but the predictable, safe world we live in today was built by that generation. It's the last decade or so - and especially since both the victimhood thing and the metoo thing - has been spectacularly different. The patterns of previous generations were creative, this current pattern seems to be combatative and destructive. Why? Who knows. One reason: there's nothing left to create, so that energy is being mis-directed. Or humans just love to fight. That's something I only have opinions about, not solutions for. So yeah, I wish we went back to the days when delayed gratification was a valued and taught life skill. Instant gratification breeds narcissism, and narcisissm is destructive to everyone, even the narcissist. ",
