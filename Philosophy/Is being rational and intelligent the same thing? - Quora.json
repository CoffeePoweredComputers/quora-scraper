            "answer_text": "No, in fact, in scientific studies, there doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a connection between the two. Being rational means being objective \u2014 honestly assessing a situation without regard to one\u2019s feelings or beliefs, and acting on that assessment without regard to emotionality. Think Mr. Spock. Being intelligent means being able to understand and solve complex problems that are new to you, in other words, that require you to use your own mind rather than skill or knowledge that you\u2019ve learned from somebody else. There are many examples of extremely intelligent people who aren\u2019t particularly rational. ",

They overlap is all Emotions are subconscious thought complexes and draw on all available data and experience in an irrational yet often highly insightful and intelligent way.
