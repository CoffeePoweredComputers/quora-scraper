            "answer_text": "This is a great question and I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re thinking out your passions and balancing them with the impact you want to have. So I\u2019m going to hone in on two important things you said, First, you said you are interested in how the human mind works and understanding human behavior. So based on this, you are narrowing yourself down to Psychology, primarily, and Economics, secondary. The other thing you said was that you wanted a career where you impact public policy and the political sphere. This is usually most directly impacted by Economists and sometimes Psychologists. Based on your stated preferences, I would say that Behavioral Economics or Neuroeconomics would be best for you. Now, these two fields of economics have a lot of crossover, but their perspective and approach is rather different. Behavioral Economics would involve going the the economics route and specializing in behavioral economics. Typically, neuroeconomics are more of a biology/neuropsychology persuasion. Behavioral Economics is the typical blend of Psychology with Economics for economists. Now, this isn\u2019t to say that Psychology does not impact policy, but it is usually a bit more common for economics related fields. Both fields have quite a bit of statistical theory and applcation (psychometrics and econometrics), but Economics is more math heavy overall. At the graduate level, there is going to be intermediate and higher level mathematics at pretty much every turn if you are studying economics because it is all about modeling behavior and using those models to optimize scenarios. Hopefully I have given you a good starting point to thing about, but I would, perhaps with bias, recommend behavioral economics. If you want to follow your passions though, go psychology route. One of my colleagues actually did his M.S. in Psychology and switched to Economics for his Ph.D. ",

            "answer_text": "How good is the college program that you\u2019re interested in? Are they known for Psychology or Sociology or Economics? What does your gut tell you? What are you most interested in? Ideally, sociology would contain both psychology and economics because both psychology and economics are directly related to sociology. However, if it\u2019s not a leading program for sociology then I wouldn\u2019t recommend it because it can be badly butchered - seeing as there is (should be) a good amount of philosophy considered in sociology, along with solid quantitative methods like statistics and social research. Economics will likely be heavier on math. Psychology will likely be heavier on applied research. Sociology will likely be heavier on social theory. Again, the program and professors make a big difference. No matter which path you go, you should probably learn a decent amount about the others. Maybe minoring or double-majoring. Much of what is important these days is interdisciplinary because some things you simply cannot detach from each other. Sociology, psychology, and economics are all highly related. (One or two philosophy courses thrown in will be good as well) ",
