            "answer_text": "The answer always lies on thought. Listen to thought. Anyone who is trained to use thought (which is not an academic class, and it should be) can cope with any kind of negativity. Do the narcissist thinks of trying to cope with self-criticism? Because if he/she doesn\u2019t, then only external stimuli can raise such consideration into mind, and of course, if he/she has a negative impact with others then he/she will receive this external stimuli (people have their consequences in front of their eyes, always, but as I said in the first paragraph, we weren\u2019t taught how to think, so these opportunities of changing pass by). But if the narcissist already thinks of trying to cope with self-criticism, then he/she needs to listen very carefully not to the critic, but to the thoughts that say the critics are bad. Those thoughts are the ones who make the self-criticism feel unpleasant. Detaching of those thoughts will make the narcissist open to self-criticism. Now, while he/she is in there, he/she will have to apply logic, i.e. to think objectivelly. ",
