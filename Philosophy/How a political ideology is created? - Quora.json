            "answer_text": "Considering your precise question to be \u201cHow an individual forms his/her political ideology/view?\u201d in my opinions there are multiple factors which help an individual to from her political ideology. Family Environment:- Political views are more or less like a religious views where you will see that a person born in Christian family will always be inclined towards it and hence will defend it, same with the person born in other religions. Same way a person born in a family inclined towards left ideology will also be inclined towards leftism. There are very limited exceptions to this where our opinions and ideologies are not influenced by our family. Education and educational institutions:- Our education influences us more than our family influences us because what we study in school or college leaves greater mark on our personality. Why most people in Bengal had and still have leftist views? If you will read the history book of WB board, you will get the answer of it. Why most people passed out from Vidya Sishu Madir are rightest? Well take one-two session of history class and again you will get the answer of it. Why the one who get education in madrasa will put Islam over everything else? Because of the content they are taught in there. So the kind of education plays an important role in forming the political ideology. Experiences and event and accidents:- Some incidences not only change our life but also play an important role in forming our political ideology as well. A person who have faced or seen a religious prosecution will hardly be right winger and anyone who will come under his/her influence will also chose the path of leftism. A person or families who have seen destruction of their happy life in the hands of communist will rebuke it. Religious Belief:- I see a very close relationship between politics and religion. If your religion ask full submission then you would want the politics and entire system to be influenced by religious beliefs. If you look at past, politicians have extensively used religion to garner votes. In fact new religions were formed to influence the people by using their weaknesses. There are some other factors as well but as per my opinion these are the primary ones. ",

            "answer_text": "Political ideology is the reflection of the existing economic, social, cultural conditions, which again is the continuation & development of the past. The society is divided into classes, the ruling class, which is essentially in extreme minority and the ruled, the majority of the population. The political ideology evolves as per the need of the class & sub-class, sections of the society. They are meant to serve that class or sections of the society. The development of science, technology, art, literature, religion, languages, war, etc have effect on the ideologies, while the base, the economy influences them in turn. ",
