            "answer_text": "I see your point and I welcome it. Lots of people see your point, some make your point, like that song John Lennon composed / sang: Imagine. It\u2019s a welcome sentiment if there ever was one, don\u2019t you think? So, for something that doesn\u2019t physically exist, it sure does occupy a large slice of the thinking pie, along with clothes (why we even wear them) and other appearance based \u201cdifferences\u201d. I put \u201cdifferences\u201d in quotes because, if you compare those perceived differences to the real, what we all have in common (alive, animal, human, survivor) seems like Mt. Everest to the bump on the ground of our putative physical differences. So what must be the real culprit behind this false notion of race is culture, because the physical differences between humans are negligible. So, what is it about culture and identity that we find so captivating that we, well, we all know what history has recorded of our doings motivated by this false notion called race; what is so compelling? There are sociologists focused on this question because of its impact on our lives. It\u2019s long been a subject of interest, what is it about us humans that causes us to magnify the significance of these minute differences in culture / identity, to the point of violence. One can only conclude that some of us just like violence and are bored by a peaceful existence, and that race is just an excuse to indulge in that putative pleasure. By identifying something as superficial and insignificant as skin color / body morphology as a kind of visible marker for the \u201calien\u201d culture, it is easy to justify the crimes committed against the \u201cother\u201d whatever that \u201cother\u201d happens to look like, etc. What other cultural elements can we find examples of persecutory attention? Cuisine? Music? Dance? Plastic arts? I don\u2019t think so; these are causes for celebration. Many writers point out the obvious, that this fantastical notion of significant differences among human beings that are visible, is based on fear, fear of the strange, the unknown, the \u201cother\u201d. Other peoples\u2019 other-ness is frightening, so goes that narrative. OK, we can start there, but now the question is, why? Perhaps it seems self evident, but exactly what is the chain of cause and effect in this socially disruptive reasoning? I ask because we all can cite examples of the opposite, in which many delight in the details of other peoples\u2019 \u201cother-ness\u201d so that reasoning isn\u2019t organic to us all. It must be a learned reflex, it must be taught. The fear of other-ness is not innate, it is inculcated, although the propensity for being thus inculcated is innate. If that is the case, then any parent who inculcates this unnecessary fear of other-ness based on appearance and or cultural differences, is committing something akin to child abuse, or at least, an unethical breach of trust by promoting an agenda based on an irrational fear. We teach our kids to be wary of all strangers, not some. That rational fear is not discriminatory, if you see what I mean. But the fear of differences that qualify for the race label, that is an irrational fear which does damage to our children, it seems. So, I think we should take a careful look at what we hold to be most important, and see if it\u2019s possible to adjust our attitudes and behavior accordingly. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cIs there no such thing as race?\u201d Yes, race is a social construct, but that is why it lends itself to such surprising passions. Geffrey Werbock successfuly interrogates the rationality of the ideas this construct engenders; but social constructs do not only serve our conscious rational needs. In \u201cCivilisation and it's Discontents\u201d (1930), Freud near the end of his life, pessimistically suggests that the greater part of all our psychological problems stems from the intense, and potentially self-destructive, effects of our awkward adaptation to living in civilised society. We must suffer an internal critic and the imposition of guilt (psychic pain), in the form of a moral conscience, lest our powerful genetic instincts - aggression (survival), sex (procreation), curiosity (?) - prove too anti-social in their expression. The weight of this burden, the force of our constant attacks against the self and its natural instincts, are balanced out in our psychic economy, by our capacity to imaginatively and unconsciously re-direct these chronic criticisms outward, away from our selves, away from our families, away from our tribal affiliations, out into the world, and into our representations of 'suitable' others - into our social constructions (projection and projective processes). To illustrate the complexities of this reality, with regard to the issue of race and rationality, I give an example of extreme racial politics, which espouses ideas such as the \u2018purity\u2019 of a fictional group. Rational observers will note that \u2018purity\u2019, rather like in-breeding, is a dubious choice; they may, being rational themselves, suspect an association with genetically based diseases or even fears of pollution in general. They may be right, as far as that goes, but there is a deeper unconscious logic (which the rational mind characterises anxiously as irrational). The idea of \u2018purity\u2019 derives from our earliest psychic struggles in infancy, where we believe that our inevitable frustrated rages against our mother - our anger in other words - must inevitably destroy the one we love - as they have in the mental fantasies that attend such feelings. To avoid the experience of a mutilated mother in our minds, we employ the same projective processes that haunt our racial hatreds - we construct a representation of a \u2018good mother\u2019 - pure goodness - to host all our grateful positive moods, and a \u2018witch\u2019 - pure evil - who will be blamed for the negatives. With one danger solved, another arises - how to keep a hold on external \u2018reality\u2019, which is undivided, whilst still preventing the contamination of the imaginary \u2018pure/good mother\u2019 by the equally imaginary evil witch, which would threaten us with the depression such attacks on our loved objects incur. Thus race as a construct serves several rational functions, such as enabling us to tolerate the formation of large social groupings, as if we were all brothers and sisters, (see Harare, \u201cSapiens\u201d, and 'fictions'), but it also serves some powerful irrational - in the sense of 'unconscious' - ones also. We should understand that many murders, especially mass murders, are failed attempts to avoid suicide. ",
