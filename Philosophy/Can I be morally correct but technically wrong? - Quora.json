            "answer_text": "In people eyes, they\u2019re always morally right. That\u2019s because they\u2019re doing what they sincerely believe to be right. If you ask me though, being morally right doesn\u2019t mean or worth anything. That\u2019s because morality is a subjective thing. Meaning that they\u2019re not facts but opinions. Now being technically right, that\u2019s something that I can vouch for. Cause being technically right means being accord to the facts and the truth. Meaning that your actions isn\u2019t for the sake of what you think is right but for the sake of what is actually right. ",
