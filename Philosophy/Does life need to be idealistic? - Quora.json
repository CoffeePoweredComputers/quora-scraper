I use these as my values: Transcendent love: a free gift of hoping for the virtuous betterment of ourselves and others. It is unconditional with no expectations in return and frees us and others of our fears so we can gain confidence, understanding and skill without being angry or defensive. Virtue: truthful, wise, logical, prudent, trustworthy, praiseworthy, just, self-restraint, lacking corruption, forgiving, organized, clean, caring, principled, wisely generous, intelligent, humble, courageous. Wisdom: allows us to avoid traps and guides us to success using accumulated insights into what works and what doesn\u2019t work in life and relationships.  ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks Diamay for A2A. Life is a flow. It is an inert occurrence. It has life within. There are living actors. We wade through difficulties. We make realities around us. We inject life in other things, even if these fall under the head \u2018technology\u2019. Idealism is basically \u2018living at the extreme end\u2019. As a norm, it is not possible for practical reasons. Living is a in fact a struggle; struggle to exist. Ideal situations elude and realities set in. WE EARN AND LEARN LESSONS FROM EXPERIENCES. Idealism does not provide opportunities to make that happen. These are my feelings, and answer to this question. ",
