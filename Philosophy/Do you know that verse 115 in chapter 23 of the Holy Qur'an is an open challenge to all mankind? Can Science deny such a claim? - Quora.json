            "answer_text": "The going principle in science is: \u201cThat which is asserted without evidence can be rejected without evidence\u201d. Basically, the obligation to prove any assertion immediately falls onto one that makes it. Firstly, I\u2019d like someone to prove to me unambiguously that this specific verse was the literal words of God, but not an invention of some medieval theologian. Of course, that would require one to prove with a properly set up controlled scientific experiment not only that God exists, but this specific God of Qur\u2019an exists. Then one would need to prove via a properly set up controlled scientific experiment that this exact God (and not some other entity) communicated with the Prophet, and that God gave the Prophet these words precisely. Having established the above we can go into analysing the words of that verse on their scientific merit. You don\u2019t get to do this the other way around starting from the verse and then invite science to refute/deny it without having established the proper scientific credibility of the source for the assertion in the first place. Some homework needs to get done before we get to that place of discussing it in a scientific context. If we were to look at the verse in question it makes/implies several important scientific assertions: A. There exists a God; B. That God created the Universe; C. That God created humans; D. There exists a Heaven; E. That God created humans with a purpose in mind; F. A mechanism by which humans may return to God exists; G. That God communicated that purpose to humans. etc. Now, you see there is a hierarchy here. Without having unambiguously proven the assertion A. via a properly set up controlled scientific experiment we can\u2019t even begin to meaningfully discuss the assertion B. It is just pointless/lacks scientific merit without this. That\u2019s because the assertion B is contingent on the assertion A. being (proven) true. Same applies to any downstream assertion above - they lack merit without having proven the upstream ones: you can\u2019t discuss/entertain the assertion E. without having unambiguously proven the assertion C. Simply put, if one can\u2019t properly prove the assertion A. to be true, any downstream assertion from it can be just outright rejected without the need for any further justification/action. That\u2019s the line of thought that science takes in relation to any topic. I mean no disrespect, but Qur\u2019an is a compilation of Middle-Eastern folk lore and oral tradition that was codified several centuries after the death of the Prophet. Meaning, we can\u2019t know for certain what the precise words of the Prophet were and what He meant by them. Or even whether He uttered these words at all to begin with or had they been a later invention by His followers. We can\u2019t go back and ask for clarification and we can\u2019t verify them independently from the Quran. The veracity of the accounts in the Qur\u2019an can\u2019t be established in principle (as with most other Holy Books). So there is nothing for science to study and scrutinise there, maybe apart from the historical/cultural significance of this work. But certainly not from the POV of cosmology or biogenesis the areas that this verse goes into. And we do know the people who were behind the effort of collecting and systematising the folk lore/oral tradition that made Qur\u2019an and their process for doing it. Going around villages recording their folk lore does not meet the definition of scientific discovery in the slightest and can\u2019t amount to evidence of anything. Apart from the fact that this certain folk lore did exist in the region and people went about collecting codifying it. Qur\u2019an seems to contain significant personal input from those who were behind the project of writing it down. Why they used certain words, how they structured the text, what stories they chose to include or not include. That may be an interesting area of study. But trying to reconcile that text with the modern scientific developments, IMHO, is an exercise in futility. Largely because Qur\u2019an was never intended to be a work of science, but rather a work on philosophy. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Do you know that verse 115 in chapter 23 of the Holy Qur'an is an open challenge to all mankind? Can Science deny such a claim? A: first I could easily argue anyone following the Quran Hadith Bible or The Vedas is either mentally unstable or superbly ignorant. But to the verse in question: (23:115) Did you imagine that We created you without any purpose, 102 and that you will not be brought back to Us?\" 102. The Arabic word abathan in the text also means \u201cfor the sake of sport\u201d. Then the verse will mean: Did you think that We had created you merely for the sake of sport and there was no purpose behind your creation? Therefore you may eat, drink, be merry and enjoy yourself as you please. Surah Al-Mu'minun 23:93-115 - Towards Understanding the Quran - Quran Translation Commentary - Tafheem ul Quran What challenge? What science? All I see is a claim that an unspecified entity created humans and they had a purpose for doing so. Given the context assuming that it's meant to say Allah created humans. When? how? Given that we already know we have a common ancestor with chimpanzees and share 98% of our DNA with chimpanzees we already know that we evolved from that common ancestor. Humans are part of the ape family and the evolution taking place from the common ancestor around 7 million years ago. Two chromosomes fused allowing humans to have a larger brain and hip shaped differently to allow for easier walking upright. As an atheist I see no reason to believe in anything Supernatural and it found natural causes for humans to exist without any deity. Religion teaches people to accept nonsense as valid answers to the biggest questions ever asked. Believing in imaginary characters with supernatural magic teaches scientific illiteracy dampening curiosity and killing critical thinking causing issues on a global scale. ",

This page shows seven parallel translations in English for the 115th verse of chapter 23 (s\u016brat l-mu'min\u016bn). Click on the Arabic text to below to see word by word details of the verse's morphology. Chapter (23) s\u016brat l-mu'min\u016bn (The Believers)  Sahih International: Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?\" Pickthall: Deemed ye then that We had created you for naught, and that ye would not be returned unto Us? Yusuf Ali: \"Did ye then think that We had created you in jest, and that ye would not be brought back to Us (for account)?\" Shakir: What! did you then think that We had created you in vain and that you shall not be returned to Us? Muhammad Sarwar: Did you think that We had created you for a playful purpose and that you were not to return to Us?\" Mohsin Khan: \"Did you think that We had created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us?\" Arberry: What, did you think that We created you only for sport, and that you would not be returned to Us?'  Now here is the REAL UNIVERSAL QUESTION, not the subjective Islamic doctrine: What is the \u201cwe\u201d that is discussed? I would suggest that, much to the chagrin of a great number of Muslims, that the process that caused the emergence of the human experience sought experience, expression, and evolution, rather than any other purpose. The subjective need for judgement is a human attribute given to God or Allah. Universal Human Truth Universal Human Truth will be defined here as truth that is applicable to all humans who have ever lived on Earth, no matter when they lived, where they lived, what they believed, or what they did. It is inclusive of all hominids who have inhabited Earth over the passage of time or will inhabit this marvelous planet and regions of space beyond it in the future. This baseline is critical to a process driven narrative of humanity and building a constructive view of why we are here. Presence Tradition The irony, brutal as it is, lays in the phrase \u201c returned to Us\u201d. Wherein those humans who appoint themselves to be the official officers of Allah, can and most assuredly will cast wrath down upon you if at all possible, in Allah\u2019s name. This is not a veiled threat, but a promise of man made retribution. ",

Nobody has to deny anything. You have to positively demonstrate something. Your citation of that verse demonstrates your ability to connect current scientific facts to random sentences with no scientific intent or content from an ancient book. Such demonstrations of connecting the utterly unrelated are common, very very common. The usual example is Nostradamus and his Les Proph\u00e9ties. If you\u2019re interested to learn about your quite human error (which I doubt), you should ask and I\u2019ll give you reading materials and a list of topics to look up (which would pleasantly surprise me). And, again, nobody needs to dispute what you\u2019ve not demonstrated. And that verse is not a challenge, merely a Rhetorical device. Or do you believe you can get me the phone number of God who will personally answer my challenge? Or do you expect me to answer it to you and separately to every single Muslim out there?

When I read these verses, however, I think I see what you mean.  I write a lot about the problem of time. All of what we call \u2018science\u2019 is conducted in time, and the mathematical logic used in parts of scientific reasoning is paradoxically independent of time. In this way, all seconds are the same (in that they are identical units) and the only way of telling one second from another is by periodic motion which (by definition) is repetitive. Therefore, there is indeed a problem with our measurement of time, since humans live in the present and every sense in which we can determine our history depends on recollection of symbols (writing and pictures, for example) which are repetitively re-interpreted in a way that revises their relevance in every instant. Thus, well may God say \u2018if only you knew!\u2019. The one thing we cannot have is a coherent sense of time. We must separate past, present and future in a way that makes each of them independent of the others. Of course, doing so is erroneous - yet it is what happens every time we nominate \u2018Now\u2019. For this reason, one of my heroes (St Augustine) says similarly: What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know. Truthfully, Science is silent regarding the essential nature of time, since every subject of scientia depends upon it a priori. ",

Here is this verse: \u0623\u064e\u0641\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0633\u0650\u0628\u0652\u062a\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0627 \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0639\u064e\u0628\u064e\u062b\u064b\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0646\u0651\u064e\u0643\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u062a\u064f\u0631\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0639\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e - 23:115 Then did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?\" Muminun 23:115 Belief? Belief is something that is directly linked to your heart. You can\u2019t force someone to believe a certain idea. That\u2019s why Quran says: \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064e \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0651\u0650\u064a\u0646\u0650 \u06d6 \u0642\u064e\u062f \u062a\u0651\u064e\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0651\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0651\u064f\u0634\u0652\u062f\u064f \u0645\u0650\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0652\u063a\u064e\u064a\u0651\u0650 \u06da \u0641\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646 \u064a\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0631\u0652 \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0651\u064e\u0627\u063a\u064f\u0648\u062a\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u064a\u064f\u0624\u0652\u0645\u0650\u0646 \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u0641\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u0650 \u0627\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0643\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064f\u0631\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0629\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064f\u062b\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0649\u0670 \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u0627\u0646\u0641\u0650\u0635\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e \u0644\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u06d7 \u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0633\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0639\u064c \u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064c - 2:256 There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. Baqarah 2:256 There is no compulsion in faith. Right and wrong has been made clear so it\u2019s your choice to adopt a way. However, taking the right path will lead you to the right destination. Science and Faith: Faith has nothing to do with Science. It doesn\u2019t mean that Faith doesn\u2019t believe in Science. In fact Science follows Faith, not vice versa. Just ponder upon a small parable. A child was told by his mother when he was playing close to fire place in winter that don\u2019t touch fire , it will hurt you. It was hard for the child to understand. So he decided to test. When his mother went away, he tried to grab a burning coal in his hand and hurt himself. Analysis: Mother had awareness about the burning fact of fire due to her vast knowledge. So she didn\u2019t need an experiment to verify it. Child had lack of awareness due to his short vision and attempted to experiment the law that \u201cfire burns\u201d. He got the answer but at the cost of injury on hand. Choice: Now, it\u2019s our choice to believe in what our Creator tells us or go for an experiment. No one is going to stop such explorer. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cThen did you think that We created you uselessly and that to Us you would not be returned?\" Is this the right verse? I\u2019m confused as to how this is a challenge. But I\u2019ll give it a shot anyway. It\u2019s claiming that \u201cwe\u201d created people. What evidence is there to support this? This is a claim that must be substantiated with evidence, and to my knowledge has not met its burden of proof. Science has nothing to do with it. If you make a claim then you have to supply evidence for that claim before people should take it seriously. Until that can be done, quoting from the book making the claim is just a big circle jerk.

The verse says: [Then did you think that We created you uselessly] and that [to Us you would not be returned?\"] Part I: Even the very primitive human beings knew that all the creatures die. Yeah, we know that we're gonna die, Buddhists also know this, Pagans also know this fact. And? Part II: We weren't created uselessly, right? Islamicly speaking, we're just useful when we worship \u2018\u2019Allah\u2018\u2019, that's the purpose of our existence in Islam: to Pray and fast and worship. Doesn't make too much sense, does it?
