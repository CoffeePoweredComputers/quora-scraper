            "answer_text": "Enlightenment is very individual experience. Everyone has the right to achieve it. Morality is decided by society to run it beacuse for semi consciousness humans it is required to decide beforehand that what is right or wrong but this is not applicable in spiritual journey. Meditator (Sadhak in Hindi) has to follow its own path to know the ultimate truth. As Self consciousness is increased which gives direction to what act is wrong or right irrespective of what society thinks. Every thing given by society is left behind in the journey of enlightenment. ",
