            "answer_text": "Absolute certainty exists, but I doubt it\u2019s justified. I.e. many people are absolutely certain of some things, yet other people are absolutely certain of the opposite. Let\u2019s consider justified absolute certainty. I doubt it\u2019s justified and here is why Any conclusion I make can be in error, which includes 1+1=? and it includes my conclusion about justified absolute certainty.I could be a robot-like entity deliberately programmed to come to the wrong conclusions, how could I know? You could be programmed to find the idea ridiculous, or you could be programmed to find the idea intriguing or your programming has led you to realize or learn about this possibility.I can\u2019t know for sure that ALL my memories are false, so all the basis of my conclusions aren\u2019t false, thus my conclusion.Some of this is solipsism and other is the simple fact of errors, so I don\u2019t know to justify absolute certainty. Unless you can guarantee that you never make an error AND that solipsism\u2019s basic claim is provably invalid, you can\u2019t either. HOWEVER. As far as practical life is concerned, certainty should be substituted by \u201coverwhelming confidence\u201d, which means instead of 100% you\u2019ll have 99.99999% or some such figure, e.g. 100% minus epsilon, to be mathematical about it. If you accept the practical equivalence of certainty and overwhelming confidence, then there\u2019s a lot we can justifiably be overwhelmingly confident about. This is confined to mathematics, where all information is available. In physics (and all sciences and disciplines describing external things we didn\u2019t create) the confidence goes down rapidly since we can never know the observations are complete, or if you have a solipsistic bent, even that they actually describe an actual reality. However, even with a solipsistic approach you must admit that if the sensory data is fake, it\u2019s remarkably consistent and there\u2019s no good reason to actually doubt it, just not accept it as 100%. The difference between math (and other disciplines of manipulating symbols and data with rules we\u2019ve fully created) and physics (trying to understand external reality based on observations [measurements]) is very similar to the difference between chess and poker. Anyway, overwhelming confidence (semi-absolute certainty) in mathematics is achieved by proving a theorem. High confidence in physics is achieved by trying to prove each other wrong and collecting more data in the hope of finding something we didn\u2019t expect, so we can explain it, much less certain. ",

            "answer_text": "What about the law of logic called the excluded middle? It says that a statement is either true or false and that it can\u2019t be both true and false at the same time. How could it be true and false in the same respect, at the same time that apples both exist and don\u2019t exist? So you can say that what is logically true is absolutely certain. What is illogical can\u2019t exist since it is not coherent (a square circle for instance). In fact what is illogical isn\u2019t even a thing, that is you can\u2019t identify it and so saying that it can\u2019t exist is just saying that some imagined thing can\u2019t exist or like saying a word that doesn\u2019t have a meaning has a physical counterpart in reality. What is logical is perhaps always possible, but where it coincides with physical impossibility while being logically possible makes one question whether physical possibility boils down to logical possibility in some sense. If not, then perhaps things can be logically possible while not being physically possible, something to investigate. Then there are things that must exist due to being logically or even physically unavoidable. You see this when you have only two options for a thing to be. For instance, an object is either infinite or finite. Since an infinite object is logically incoherent, then it it is a logical truth that all objects are finite. ",

            "answer_text": "I'm absolutely certain it does or it doesn't It seems you are looking for absolute truth Truth, that being what we hold to be true, is true simply because we understand something That something acts in a manner and from said manner we can predict future acts Hence it obtains the title - true However the title is only provisional. One prediction made - which does not occur - can create a new \u201ctruth\u201d The new truth becomes \u201csuch and such acts like such and such MOST of the time\u201d However the exception maybe a extremely rare event. So us observant minions may go our whole lifetime under the true understanding that such and such ALWAYS acts in a particular way when there is another truth \u201csometimes it doesn't\u201d It boils down to - we are absolutely certain about many many activities and other stuff UNTIL the activities or other stuff act unpredictable Hence the \u201cI'm absolutely certain it does or it doesn't\u201d It does because we think it does. And who knows there may be such a deep seated reality which never ever deviates It doesn't because we don't know if that extremely rare event lurks in the background ",

            "answer_text": "No. The only people I know that ever say they are really certain about anything important are religious people. And then, Christians for instance, will say you have to have faith to hear Jesus and let him into your heart. Even if they then say they are certain Jesus entered their heart, they never reconcile that with the fact that they had to take their leap of faith in the first place in order to have that experience. It's all very silly. Scientists, on the other hand, never say they are absolutely certain of anything. Everything they know is open to challenge. This is what makes science credible, beside that fact that it works and changes as new knowledge is gained, sometimes easily, sometimes stubbornly. And science actually explains things, whereas knowledge of gods and the things they purportedly do requires faith in them first. ",
