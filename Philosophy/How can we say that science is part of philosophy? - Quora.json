            "answer_text": "To help you better grasp the reality here, let's rephrase the question. \u201cIs there any philosophy in science\u201d ? Obviously, yes! The reality is that all fields of knowledge whatsoever are dependent on philosophy including all of Science. Philosopy is essentially a metaphysical enterprise of theoretics. All fields of knowledge whatsoever are rooted and founded on metaphysical axioms or foundational principles which are the necessary prerequisites in order to have any said field of knowledge. For example, try putting the empirical method of science under a microscope to observe it. Now this obviously isn't possible because the empirical method itself is a metaphysical theory of determining how the natural world works via observation, experimentation and prediction based on the above. Ultimately, Philosopy and Science are connected at the hip even though Philosopy is the Mother of all knowledge in general. There is way to much to go into here, but you will never find two professionals who will agree on everything within their own respective fields of knowledge regardless of what fields you look. And this is because there is no escape from the metaphysics of belief or theory in any realm of thought or fields of knowledge whatsoever. For every layer of the universal onion that Man pulls back in discovery ten new layers spring up with even more philosophical questions with each new discovery. Truth and Reality are always waiting for Man over the next horizon and the next horizon after that perpetually. It's a perpetual game of hide and seek. No matter what Man discovers in any realm of thought or fields of knowledge, he cannot escape from further metaphysical speculations simply because you cannot exhaust or outstrip the theoretics in any realm of thought or field of knowledge. All knowledge evolves over time but we never come to the absolute Truth of things because knowledge itself is the eternal science of Metaphysics. There is much more to this but you would do well to contemplate it for yourself. ",

            "answer_text": "Philosophy used to cover areas that science now dominates. As science advances, philosophy retreats. Yet whatever is left for philosophers to speculate about, they have to accept science in the now non-philosophical areas. Philosophy still discusses God\u2019s existence, but in doing so respects scientific theories. Philosophers also discuss Maxwell\u2019s Demon, solipcism and whether other minds exist. They come close to contemplating their navel. Descartes would sit in bed and contemplate a wax candle melting, thinking deep thoughts. Socrates was certain of only thing, that he was uncertain of everything. Descartes was only certain that he thinks therefore he exists. Continental philosophy is about \u201cbig\u201d questions, like existentialism. American philosophy is more into logical minutia, and largely irrelevant theories, to just about anyone. Einstein said God doesn\u2019t roll dice, as if that was his philosophical response to quantum physics. We learned he was wrong. Oddly, he never received a Nobel for his relativity. Someone asked him what would he do if experiments showed relativity wrong. He responded the evidence doesn\u2019t matter as he knows he\u2019s right. Still, he predicted gravity waves, and a century later, they are no where to be seen. gravity is still a mystery in so far as it\u2019s a force that can\u2019t be unified with other forces. It acts at a distance, seemingly instantaneously, beyond the speed of light. It\u2019s these types of empirical problems that leave the philosophers room to inject their speculation and philosophizing. quantum physics is the most confirmed theory short of the 2nd law of thermodynamics, yet it contradicts Einstein\u2019s relativity. The macro & micro don\u2019t jive. Hugh Everett, argued the multiple universe theory of quantum physics, that we go on living in a parallel universe after our biological death in our current universe. That leaves endless room for philosophy, at least in Europe. American philosophers are so empirical, they won\u2019t speculate about really big questions. Is nothing something? Big philosophy question at a symposium couple years ago. Physicists weighed in too though. What is empirical about the absence of anything empirical? ",

There\u2019s enough justification for that bold step. These days we spurn Socrates and Plato. Aristotle\u2026 well, not really respectable science, we feel, but he did get the ball rolling. I say, \u201cWait a minute; aren\u2019t we bad students?\u201d Actually Aristotle is considered a poor student of his mentor Plato, who was a pure idealist, and Aristotle less so. Plato told the famous \u201cAllegory of the Cave\u201d, teaching in parable about the Scientific Method, with his \u201cupward path\u201d (identifiable as induction) and \u201cdownward path\u201d (deduction no doubt). I am a physicist in the line of the quest of the Unified Field Theory. What we find is that the solution is not forthcoming unless we acknowledge and include the metaphysical realm in our model of reality and in our equations. So we\u2019ve done it. In other words, at the end of this Great Circle of history, over 2,000 years, we find ourselves back where we started from, but having a much better foundation to finally appreciate it for what it is really telling us. What is the quantum wave, really? How is time regulated so precisely? What is this elusive \u201cconsciousness\u201d after all? Of what are dreams made? Socrates, the great Sage, preached to his death to seek inwardly, where we shall find the answers to all things. Anamnesis he called it: recollection. Yes, coming around at last to our great and original Teacher: Philosophy is indeed the King of the Sciences! ",

            "answer_text": "In ancient Greece, particularly, the city-nation state of Athens, the Greeks attempted to find answers to the nature of the universe, the problem of truth, and the meaning and purpose of life. The magnitude of their philosophical accomplishment through investigation, experience in which rationality and logic were applied to acquire whatever irreducible minimum of faulty knowledge, self-conceited pretension were eliminated. During Socrates\u2019 days the practice of what we call today as the \u201cSocratic irony\u201d which is profession of ignorance while questioning another in order to arrived at the truth. Plato\u2019s Socrates had claimed in his Apology that he was the wisest of Athens, not because he was so incredibly wise, but because his fellow Athenians were so stupid, especially those who claimed they knew what in fact they did not know, while Socrates was the only one who acknowledge to himself that he knew nothing. And Socrates accused of impiety and corrupting the youth Athens, argued that he was the city\u2019s greatest benefactor and deserving of its highest honors. After all, what Socrates had claimed of was perfectly true. He had taken pleasure in humiliating Athens reputed and conceited men before the crowd that gathered in the Agora, often by using clever debater\u2019s tricks. He had a wicked sense of humor and found this to be very funny. Those he bested certain did not. The dimension of the ancient Greek philosopher both, the pre-Socratic and the post Socratic philosophical accomplishment is attested by the fact that philosophy ever since has been largely a debate over the validity of their conclusions, to paraphrase Nietzsche through his Twilight of the Idols, section 18.

Philosophy is thus not a science, even though originally all natural science was philosophy.
