            "answer_text": "I hope my answer doesn\u2019t cause any offence Cecelia since I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t personally hold either of the above in very high regard. In fact I am one of a growing number - it would seem - who suspect that the triumvirate (as they are often - falsely - considered, of Socrates, Plato and Aristotle) led philosophy from the extremely rich world of the pre-Socratics to that of the highly speculative realm of the religioso, and when adopted by the early Christian church resulted in the so-called \u2018dark ages\u2019 that effectively lasted til the Renaissance. On a rather more benign level both were what could only be described as - in today\u2019s language - snobs. Aristotle took this to a rather ludicrous level when describing his ideal of the \u2018magnanimous\u2019 man, who despite his \u2018magnanimity\u2019 cannot be friends with a slave.\u2019\u2019There is nothing in common between the two; the slave is a living tool qua slave then one cannot be friends with him\u2019. As for Plato he comes across as what could only be described as \u2018arrogant\u2019. In The Republic he advises that society should be organised into three tiers, the lowest level is the people, then the soldiers and the leaders, the upper classes who are trained in philosophy. Like Plato himself in other words. ",
