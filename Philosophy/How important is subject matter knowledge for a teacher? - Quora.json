            "answer_text": "Teaching is part actor, part subject nerd, part technocrat and part artist. If you want to teach high school you need a very strong content knowledge of that area, you will have to pass teaching classes, a content test and student teaching which will prep you for that area. I majored in history from a top 40 college in America in history and was woefully prepared to teach it, you need to be a life long learner in both content, methods and technology to get better each year. So in the end you need to feel passionate about your content and feel like you want to help kids, all kinds of kids from super nerds, special learners, blind kids, deaf kids, drug addicts and artist types, they all will be in your classes at some point and won't want to learn history, so how do you get through. Be real, be passionate, be prepared and be energetic\u2026not all are suited for this, so intern in a class and see if you like it? ",

            "answer_text": "My maths teacher told me that content knowledge trumps pedagogy. He is by far my favourite maths teacher and so I have taken his advice while I was training to become a teacher. I guess this is mostly true for the higher levela where there aren\u2019t much behavioural problems and so you can just focus on lecturing the material to the class. Whereas with the younger ones you have to plan different activities and use different strategies to engage the students. ",

Without a strong and abiding love for the subject the teacher is just a supervisor enforcing rules and deadlines. For older students subject mastery is the only way to productively and effectively manage student behavior. ",

If I do not know that content, with supporting skills, I cannot teach it any more than I could remove someone\u2019s appendix. ",
