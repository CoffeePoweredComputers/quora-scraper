            "answer_text": "Is the scientific method scientific? The scientific method is neither scientific nor not scientific. This is because scientific method applies to testable statements about reality. A scientific method is not a testable statement about reality. Therefore, asking whether scientific method is itself scientific would be a category error. To demonstrate that, one can ask whether the method of writing text that rhymes is itself a poem. And the answer would be that the method is neither a poem nor a not a poem, since the method is not a literary text at all. It is a concept. Having said that, when people ask this, they might mean to ask whether scientific method is reliable and whether it is possible to test the efficacy of science itself. One can thus ask whether a statement \u201cIs scientific method the best way to learn about reality\u201d scientific, and it might be. This depends on the definition of \u201cbest\u201d and \u201creality\u201d, but in the normal understanding of the sentence such a statement would definitely be scientific, and testable, and we can show that science consistently produces reliable knowledge about how the world works.

So while past science is a strong source on the state of modern scientific methods, it is philosophy, not a scientific theory.
