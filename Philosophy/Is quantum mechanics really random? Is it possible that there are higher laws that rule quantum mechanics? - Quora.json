            "answer_text": "Is quantum mechanics really random? Is it possible that there are higher laws that rule quantum mechanics? Technically we do not know if it is really random yet, and the possibility exists that it isn\u2019t. A majority of physicists do think it is truly random though. There is a famous result Bell\u2019s inequalities which (together with the experimental verification of its result) heavily restricts the possible ways we can have non-random QM. I would say there are three ideas which are compatible with Bell\u2019s inequality QM is truly random. Particle probabilities (in some way) only collapse when the measurement is made. Note this does NOT mean consciousness is involved in any way. Theories compatible with this include many-worlds, Copenhagen etc,QM is non-random, but also non-local. What I mean by this is that while it is not random the results depend on information (somehow) travelling faster than light. So the result of my measurement depends on exactly what that electron in say Alpha Centauri is doing right now. This is almost (but maybe not quite?) a contradiction with special relativity. Examples of interpretations with this are the pilot wave theory. Bell himself favoured this family of interpretations. It should be noted though that there are a series of objections to the basic pilot wave interpretations and perhaps for that reason they are not commonly accepted.The universe could be super-deterministic. What this would mean is that every single action of any particle in the universe throughout time, was determined at the moment of the big bang. This idea was originally (mischievously) suggested by Bell, however most physicists do not like it (perhaps because it feels like the universe is deliberately trying to trick us). The notable exception is Gerard t\u2019Hooft who has been working on this idea recently. Interestingly it is he who closest matches your search for \u201chigher laws that rule quantum mechanics\u201d as he is looking for a cellular automaton process to do just that*.So we don\u2019t really know is the answer. We can hope one day to have experimental evidence, but without that - its really undecidable. There are multiple arguments in favour of each view, and much reading to be done if you are interested. *It should be noted that Bohm (who developed the primary version of the pilot wave interpretation) was also looking for \u201chigher laws\u201d, so the idea is not unheard of.

            "answer_text": "It is possible there are deterministic laws behind the randomness, but the only way we\u2019ll ever be able to prove that is if we can find those higher laws. Conversely, we aren\u2019t going to be able to prove that the universe really is fundamentally random when it comes to quantum outcomes, so that best we can say is that as far as established physics at the moment goes, they\u2019re random. There are a whole bunch of interpretations of quantum theory and some of them argue that the universe is not random. None of them can be proven via experiment. It seems to have become disturbingly popular (more among science fans than physicists as far as I can tell) to argue that one or other interpretation is definitely correct, but that we can\u2019t test that and there isn\u2019t any need. That isn\u2019t science; it\u2019s just faith (in my view anyway). The scientific method is fundamentally about experiment. Only the experimental method has given us things that actually definitely work, and if experiment isn\u2019t involved, it isn\u2019t science in any normal sense. Chains of reasoning have a way of convincing people that they are irrefutable, but it\u2019s only when you can put them to the test of experiment that you can find out how strong they really are. Unless, that is, you\u2019re dealing with the abstract world of pure mathematics. So the most \u201cscientific\u201d answer to this question at the moment is to say we don\u2019t know, and maybe further research can resolve the matter. If you want to get into asking what physicists themselves think, the only poll I can find is the following, and even its authors admit it\u2019s \u201cnot very scientific\u201d: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.1069.pdf According to this, at least almost half and possibly a majority of physicists think the randomness is real and not governed by deterministic laws. This survey itself seems a bit ambiguous, and at a pinch you could argue that physicists are just very divided on the matter, which is probably true. ",
