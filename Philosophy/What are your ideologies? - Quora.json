            "answer_text": "I like Kantian ethics, Classical Liberalism, American Republicanism, and Autarchism. Kant's reasoning on ethics and rights are very important and form a very good foundation for any attempt at absolutist objective morality. I despise subjective or relative morality theories. They are useless for determining the rightness or wrongness of anything. Classical Liberalism and American Republicanism combine to form the basis of the ideal of the American system. It combines individual liberty with personal responsibility and self sacrifice as a civic duty. Both of these are needed for the US to function (note: the lack of modern republicanist values is what ruins the American system today). Autarchy is what I believe a perfect government would be. Each person governing itself. Though I never expect this system to work in our human reality, it is in figuring out how to get closest to this ideal without creating chaos that I think such utopian ideas are important. (Note: Autarchism is a form of individualist anarchism, which is not synonymous with chaos and in direct contrast to communo-anarchism which I don't think is anarchism at all.) ",
