            "answer_text": "As Peter Townsend\u2019s answer suggests, the answer to this question can go very, very deep. But one simple way of dealing with it is in terms of purpose. The purpose of communication is to transfer information from one being to another. Any information may be transferred, from the history of philosophy to a lunch order in a restaurant. The purpose of philosophy is to gain wisdom, to seek answers to life\u2019s \u201cbig questions,\u201d like \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d and \u201cIs the Universe rational?\u201d We use communication to gather the insights of others into these sorts of questions, to offer our own insights, and to minimize our misunderstandings of each other.

            "answer_text": "There is a direct relationship which clearly elucidates their differences as well. The relationship is one of methodology. Philosophy is an argot for the religion of Pagan Mysticism. It communicates its message through a codec which must be unravelled through certain hermeneutic rules which are supplied in the texts. Communication studies the methods of transmitting information and philosophy transmits information via the method of secret or mysterious language. Philosophy transmits religious, historical, astrological, and other information. ",
