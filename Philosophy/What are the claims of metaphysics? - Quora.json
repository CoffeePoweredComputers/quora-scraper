            "answer_text": "In contemporary use, the term \u201cmetaphysics\u201d is generally applied to that large body of things we might lump under \u201cNew Age\u201d ideas, or even \u201cparanormal\u201d ideas. Things like notions of \u201chigher planes of existence\u201d and \u201ctranscendentalism\u201d and whatever you care to lump in there. This is not the same as the more classical ideas of the term. My favorite definition of the term is as follows: \u201cMetaphysics is like a man without a lantern, descending into a dark basement to look for a black cat\u2026That isn\u2019t there.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Metaphysics is a field of inquiry. It concerns questions about the basic nature of reality. It doesn\u2019t have claims. People make claims concerning metaphysics. So, one might ask how Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics differ from Plato\u2019s. ",
