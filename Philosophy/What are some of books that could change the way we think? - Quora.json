            "answer_text": "Thinking, Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman  Take everything you think you know about people being rational and throw it out the window. Through decades of research, this book exposes how humans are really a spaghetti of biases, obviously illogical decisions and contradictions, and that our inability to make rational decisions is not only prevalent, it\u2019s also quite predictable. Kahneman lists a long list of different biases that are painfully recognizable, but that it takes a conscious effort to avoid. He demonstrates that we can answer questions wildly different simply by changing the framing, that even professional statisticians have a horrendously lack of understanding for statistical probabilities in real life, that so-called experts in most complex field such as macro economics, finance and politics really are no more correct in their prediction than a pair of dice. How the Mind Works - Steven Pinker  Steven Pinker is a cognitive psychologist at Harvard, and is known for his work on evolutionary psychology and the theory that the mind is computational. How the Mind Works takes on a lot of aspects of human nature and combines the fields of cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology to provide explanations on why we behave as we do. The Singularity is Near - Ray Kurzweil  The term \u201cfuturist\u201d can make one cringe. We don\u2019t have to look further than the predictions of the 50\u2019s through the 70\u2019s to see that the predictions rarely, if ever, turn out the way the futurists expected. We expected flying cars and an office on the moon, and got the internet, cell phones and machine learning. Kurzweil is no lightweight however, and what\u2019s most fascinating about this book is actually not whether he\u2019s right or wrong (he will probably be right about some things and wrong about lots of things), but the sheer scope of his futuristic vision. While other futurists look at the possibilities of evolving technology and biology and increasing physical and cognitive abilities, Kurzweil takes it to a level that outplays them all, arguing that technology will be the next evolutionary step, and eventually take us in a direction where we are no longer physical beings, but rather a singularity of infinite complexity, intelligence and ability, completely unrecognizable from the human form of today. E=mc2: A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation - David Bodanis  This book takes the unusual approach of being a biography not about a person, but about Eintein\u2019s famous equation, and how it came to be. As is always the case in science, it did not evolve out of isolation. What this book does an excellent job at, is to explain the workings of the equation in terms that are understandable and even entertaining for laymen. The realization that Einstein had, that energy and matter are intertwined, is arguably one of the most important discoveries in the history of science, and it has affected the world in staggering ways that most people are completely unaware of. Most of our modern technology, like computers, cell phones, microwaves and satellites simply would not exist were it not for the insights of Einstein and his peers. Highlight: Bodanis explains, written like a thriller, how the chain of physical reactions on an atomic level, resulting in small leaks of energy in the form of radiation, combines in the billions to become the gruesome spectacle of an atomic bomb explosion. You don\u2019t only learn to respect the atomic bomb - you actually understand how it works. Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind - Yuval Noah Harari  I started reading this book expecting a history lesson, and closed it having my mind blown and my understanding of the world completely changed. Harari, for those who did not have an interest in military history, came completely out of nowhere to write a book that not only explains the history of how humans became the dominant species of our planet, but more importantly: why. Harari\u2019s mix of scientific and philosophical perspectives provides arguments that are both immensely intriguing, somewhat controversial and first and foremost very convincing. Harari\u2019s premise that man\u2019s ability to believe in myths (it being religions, modern corporations, empires or the value of money) has been necessary for our ability to cooperate is an insight that has changed the way I see the world. Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst - Robert Sapolsky  Robert Sapolsky\u2019s takes the questions discussed by Steven Pinker, Yuval Harari, Daniel Kahneman and several other prominent scientists and authors to a new level. Behave [\u2026] is more or less an encyclopedia of the mind, and why we behave as we do, backed up by vast amounts of evidence from decades of research into the brain. If this book does not convince you that free will is an illusion, you will never be convinced. The theme of the book is interesting enough as it is, but Sapolsky also happens to be a very entertaining writer, making the material both understandable and enjoyable. One of the best science book of the last decades, and an absolute must-read. ",

            "answer_text": "Almost any book can change the way a person thinks by simply introducing ideas or perspectives on ideas that are new to them. The \"better\" the book, the greater the potential that book has in changing in a dramatically greater fashion the way a person thinks than another , \"more inferior\" book would. (The way one assesses quality in a book can vary from person to person, but \"history tends to favour better\" books by their continued printing, circulation, and recommendations by authorities on literature.) I have found that the books I've read which have most greatly influenced my thinking however, are books which \"continue to live on within me\" - in that I often entertain thoughts and views which remind me of that book and its role in fashioning structure within my thinking. I believe that \"changing the way a person thinks\" is ultimately what a book is supposed to do. If you're not sure what books you would want to read to change the way you think, then I would suggest choosing fiction books which involve genres you like and non-fiction books on subjects which interest you; and then read several to determine which of them you find influence your thinking in ways you like. Then read other books by those authors because the odds of your thinking becoming more influenced in ways you would want will increase - because it's not just the books that influence one's thinking, it's the mind behind the book which is responsible for engendering that change.
