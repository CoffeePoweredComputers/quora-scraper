            "answer_text": "Whichever one is presenting the greater hazard to traffic safety. If one\u2019s going 73 in a 65 in an open fast lane, while another\u2019s going 90 and weaving around traffic through all lanes, the 90mph offender is the greater threat, and somewhat cynically, the more expensive and harder-to-fight ticket.Whichever one he guns first. If both cars are at a totally unsafe speed (e.g. 90 in a 65), he will gun one of them, see that car is way over the speed limit, and start preparations to pull that car over. The other car, he won\u2019t know its exact speed and so won\u2019t have the probable cause to pull it over. No matter, he got one of them, and if the other person keeps driving like that he won\u2019t get far.Both. The officer doesn\u2019t have to get in his vehicle and chase down a violator; if he sees you coming far enough away, all he has to do is signal you to pull over from where he stands on the side of the road. He can do that to both cars. If he sees that you see him and you do not pull over, that\u2019s evading detention or arrest which can be a felony in some states because you\u2019re doing so in a motor vehicle. All he has to do is take down your plate, make, model and a brief description of you (gender, approximate age, race, hair color) to single you out from among potential registered drivers of that vehicle, and bingo, you now have a warrant for your arrest.In addition, many speed traps are run with more than one vehicle, forming a gun and chase team. If there\u2019s more than one vehicle on hand to find and chase down speeders, then either two chase vehicles or the chaser and the gunner will pick a car each and pull it over.Neither. If the cars are going a moderate amount over the speed limit (<10mph) and not posing any other imminent hazard to other drivers like weaving or tailgating, the officer might let both of them go and look for a driver behaving badly enough that the ticket will be more warranted (and harder to fight).",

Or, the officer may choose the fastest car. If one car is running steadily in a lane and signaling lane changes, but the second is herky-jerking left and right, trying to exploit every possible lane opening for that extra foot of space, you can bet your sweet bippy I\u2019ll go after the second car. Or, the red car. (Just kidding\u2026 Why do red cars get more speeding tickets?) ",

I\u2019ve noticed that people on Quora frequently want to believe that there is a standard, consistent playbook for all law enforcement officers in the United States. This is not remotely true. Every one of the 50 states has a different basic and in-service training requirement. Of those states, most provide law enforcement training through multiple law enforcement academies run by individual law enforcement agencies, community colleges, tech schools, or the state training agency itself. The curriculum for any one of those academies may change from class to class, depending on who is available to teach. Further, each officer has considerable discretion on when and in what circumstances he will make a traffic stop. One of my academy classmates was proud of the fact that he had served ten years, and had still not used up the book of 25 traffic citation blanks we had been issued in the academy. Patrol officers were under zero pressure to write citations. An officer assigned to a purely traffic function might be more inclined to make stops. Even then, he will have days he works aggressively, and others where he finds other things to fill his time. So, to sum up: Either. Both. Neither. If you don\u2019t want to get stopped, don\u2019t exceed the posted speed limit. ",

Damn, what the hell happen here, i was a bit confused, the cop was polite telling me i was doing i believe 78 in 65, i told him i was going with the traffic and everyone around me was going about the same speed or even a bit more for a few, and his response was, well maybe, but i can only stop one car at the time.. I guess it was my lucky day.. But in your case i depends what the cop is doing, i\u2019m sure he will go for the one going 54, unless he had used the laser gun on the one doing 48 mph.. So its mostly random, unless the other car speed is significantly higher.. ",

For your question, he would most likely pull over the more egregious speeder, but he could pull over either or both as both are speeding. The 3 mph over speeder is going to ask why me? The cop is going to say, you were speeding. The judge is going to ask if you were speeding and you will truthfully answer yes, the judge says guilty. That there was a more egregious speeder at the same time is irrelevant. ",
