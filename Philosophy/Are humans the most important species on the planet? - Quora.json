            "answer_text": "Who is supposed to assign \u201cimportance\u201d to things, you mean? \u201cImportant\u201d is a relative term, it requires that you specify some criteria by which to judge it. The human population makes up effectively 0% of the total population of living things on Earth, as nearly everything is bacteria. There are 7 billion humans, which may sound like a lot, but there are something like 10^30 bacteria, which makes non-bacteria some very, very tiny fraction of a percent of the life of Earth. So, effectively zero. Humans surely have the most impact on the Earth, in terms of changing the environment, at least in very recent history. But humans have existed for only about 2.5 million years, while life has existed for around 4 billion years, so humans haven\u2019t been around for more than a moment, and we haven\u2019t had an impact on the Earth for more than a tiny moment. In the future, we\u2019ll defnitely continue affecting the world like no other species currently does, and like no other species ever has. Currently, we are the greatest disaster ever known to life on Earth, as we\u2019re killing life faster than any disaster ever has, including what we call \u201cthe great dying\u201d, which was otherwise the largest catastrophe that life has ever seen. We are killing things faster than that, because of how we\u2019re changing the Earth. So we will absolutely be an important factor for how the world will change in the future, but we also cannot forget that we\u2019re newcomers, and that bacteria still remain the dominant force on Earth, as they basically always have been, and that we live by their mercy (metaphorically), still.

I suppose, although that I don't know that humans aren't doing more harm than good with our current level of meddling with things we don't understand.  I don't know if we're that important, but I'd certainly say that we're that selfish. Self preservation is the highest law for any species, although there are many examples of people martyring themselves, I don't think it will ever become the norm.  ",

We\u2019re not at the center of the universe. We\u2019re not the product of a special creation event. We\u2019re not that different from the other animals, we\u2019re not as good and perceiving and understanding the world around us as we thought\u2026 But I\u2019m going to say yes. We\u2019re having a huge impact on the planet. We\u2019re changing the climate. We currently move more rock and soil around than all the natural processes combined. While we haven\u2019t created new species yet, we will soon, and we\u2019ve certainly altered some beyond recognition. There is an extinction event underway, and we\u2019re at the center of it. I think that makes us pretty important, but not in a good way. More in the way that the Plague was important to European history. ",
