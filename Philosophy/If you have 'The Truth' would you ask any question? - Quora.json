Knowing all would place one in such a high level of consciousness that they might not know what a question even is, since they've never had any need for one...perhaps THAT would be the only question they might ask? I.E.:\"What is a question?\"Just sayin'... ",

Do others love me ? I am I capable of love ? How should love look like ? Maybe there is not one, but many truths when it comes down to ways to get the same end results. Also, what truth you are looking for ? If your view is selective, the truth does not matter, because you will be only looking for that what confirms what you are thinking.We just have to take a leap of faith. ",
