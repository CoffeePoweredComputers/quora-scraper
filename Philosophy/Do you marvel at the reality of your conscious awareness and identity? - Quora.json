            "answer_text": "No. How does the physical world bring subjective sensations to consciousness? I don't know but the words in which we report subjective consciousness sensations owes its meaning to their connections with the physical world. Without connections with the physical world there isn't independent criteria for the re-identification of subjective consciousness sensations. Without independent criteria there aren't correct and wrong concepts, and therefore subjective consciousness sensations cannot be conceptualized. Checking our own consciousness to see if we are following subjective sensations concepts correctly, without independent criteria, it is like we correct our own school test, without external correction what seems correct is correct, there isn't wrong concepts. It is unverifiable performance by us.  If what exactly constitute a supposed subjective consciousness is in principle incapable of translation into ordinary language concepts, then the person is unable to make sense of it for us and for himself too. Understanding is only possible on the basis of similar forms of life and  a supposed radical difference between subjective consciousness experiences would therefore also preclude any correct or incorrect independent concepts for us and for the person. Theories of consciousness need to be a  matter of public empirical investigation. Sometimes when the situation in question is particularly bizarre, involving peculiar drugs, brain operations, other animals, and so on, we might well feel, not merely that we do not know what is being experienced, but that there is no determinate fact of the matter. It does not matter that one cannot experience other people's subjective consciousness sensations. Unless the talk of such subjective experience is learned through public experience the actual content is irrelevant; all we can discuss is what is available in our public language meanings. To know the meaning of a word is to know how to use it rightly; and where there can be no check on how a man uses a word there is no room to talk of \"right\" and \"wrong\" use. To understand the meaning of words like \"mind,\" \"thought,\" \"love,\" \"belief,\" and so forth, we must attend to how these words are actually learned in the first place. ",
