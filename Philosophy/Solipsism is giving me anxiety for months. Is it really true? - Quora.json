            "answer_text": "According to two answers, both answering the same, the answer is no. Science by itself can not disprove solipsism, however, science can not prove the existence of solipsism. What that means is that science can not prove the existence of philosophical theories and ideas. This means that God can not be proven or disproven, solipsism can not be proven or disproven, and or any other philosophical theories your brain can come up with during your time on this physical world known as Earth. You can come up with the philosophical idea that you are God or that everyone on this planet is God. You can even come up with the philosophical idea that everyone will one day join their conscious minds together. None of those things I just mentioned can be disproven by science but it can not be proven by science either way, so that is why I say science itself would say \u201cno\u201d. The observable world (which is also the scientific world) says \u201cno\u201d and the second answer saying no is me. I say no because I know damn well that I am conscious of my own mind. I know damn well that I exist, and though you have to believe me when I say that, I too have to believe you when you say you\u2019ve got a conscious mind. The Earth realm will always tell you that others have a conscious mind so long as they are alive (or not brain dead), but remember that if it can\u2019t be proven by science, it is only considered a theory. It doesn\u2019t mean science can disprove it, or prove it. Now, I will say on a philosophical note, that others have claimed to have experienced \u201cGod\u201d, and that there more alarming signs of \u201cGod\u201d than you can conceive of being the only one to exist as a conscious mind (which you aren\u2019t cause I am conscious as of the moment I am writing this, and hopefully still conscious after death, but that is a philosophical hope). What I\u2019m saying is if you want to play the philosophical game, try playing a philosophical game that is healthier, by believing in something more powerful and enjoyable (God, Heaven and Jesus, or some other religious afterlife) because it is in my opinion to be a healthier alternative. With that, I end this answer with what you need to know and that is \u201cNo\u201d, you\u2019re not the only conscious mind that exists and \u201cNo\u201d, solipsism is not true. Some how, some way, \u201cyou know my answer to be true\u201d, and you\u2019ll be okay. ",

            "answer_text": "J M E McTaggart is not well known now but he was quite a philosopher in his day. He was also an Idealist (which is to say, a Solipsist with a bit of imagination). His solution to the Solipsist question is quite elegant: It doesn't matter. Assume you are standing in the road and a bus is hurtling towards you. If 'reality' is 'real', then you get out of the way. If it is all 'illusion' (all in your head), you may, if you choose, do nothing. However, if the bus, the road, and your body are all illusions, so is the illusion of death, and you may choose to ignore it. But you will still experience the illusion of death if you don't get out of the way.  He also points out the inevitable circularity of Solipsism. If all is an illusion, is the illusion itself illusory? What if it is an illusion that the illusion of all being an illusion is itself an illusion? The belief in Solipsism leads to a vicious regression. In other words, 'it's turtles all the way down'. Then there's the problem of self-contradiction: Is the idea that everything 'real' is an illusion itself a 'real' illusion? If it is a 'real' illusion then there is at least one thing which is real, so not everything is an illusion. If it is not a 'real' illusion, then, by the rule of double negatives, it must be 'real' and not an illusion. So it makes no difference. McTaggart was trying to point out that Solipsism gets you nowhere - you can't do anything useful with it, logical or practically. Some Buddhists might feel similarly. If it were true, you are still trapped in the illusion, so you are obliged to continue pretending it is not an illusion whether it is or not. ",
