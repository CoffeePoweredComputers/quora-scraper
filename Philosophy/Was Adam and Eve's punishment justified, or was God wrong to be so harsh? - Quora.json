            "answer_text": "Well, first of all, Adam and Eve were NOT punished. There was no punishment stated, whatsoever. If you read what God says to them, He nit once uses to word \u201cpunish\u201d. Hod only tells them what life for them will be like from then on. Think about it\u2026. As a parent you admonishe your child not to ever cross the street without an adult or they could be killed. But one day a neighbor child tells them about all the fun they can have playing on the slide in the park on the other side of the street. Of course, your child says \u201cno, my parents said if I cross the street, I will die.\u201d The neighbor tells them that it is perfectly safe. That you just don't want your child to actually have all the fun they will find across the street, and to prove it they cross and begin goading your child to do the same. Your child, seeing that nothing bad happened to the neighbor child when they crossed the street and all the fun they are having, decides to cross. However, on the way across, they are hit by a car. They survive the accident. After speaking with the doctors, you inform your child of what is now in store for them that they disobeyed you\u2026 They will need to spend some weeks in the hospital while their injuries heal. They have also lost their lower arm and will most likely have a prominent scar across their face for the rest of their life. Now, are you punishing your child? Or are you just informing them of the consequences of their disobedience? So it was with the first humans. The trees in the center of the garden were there for them to eat from. But not until the man and woman were mature enough to handle the knowledge they would gain. Just like sex is a good and postive thing, but we do not want our young ones to really experience it, or even think about it until they are mature enough to handle the complications. So you see, what happened after Adam and Eve ate of the fruit, and gained knowledge of things they were not ready to learn, was neither harsh nir even a punishment. It was just the natural outcome for doing something they never should have done. ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible has been modified several times throughout history and is full of contradictions. the Quran which god promised at the start of the book that it will not be modified by humans like it happened with his bible, does not ascribe mankind's life on earth as a punishment, rather as part of God's plan. God had already decided before the creation of Adam that mankind (Adam and his progeny) would be placed on earth. \"'Verily, I am going to place mankind generations after generations on earth.' They (the angels) said: 'Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, while we (the angels) glorify You with praises and thanks and sanctify You?' God said: 'I know that which you do not know.'\" God then teaches Adam the names of all things and assembles the angels in front of Adam so as to show them that there is more to Adam than they know, particularly the high intellectual capacity of Adam: \"And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then He showed them to the angels and said, \"Inform Me of the names of these, if you are truthful.\" They said: \"Glory to Thee (said the angels), of knowledge We have none, save what Thou Hast taught us: In truth it is Thou Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom.\" He said: \"O Adam! Tell them their names.\" When he had told them, God said (to the angels): \"Did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and I know what ye reveal and what ye conceal?\" God commands the angels to bow down to Adam. All obey, except for Iblis, who feels that he being made from fire, should not be bowing to Adam who was made from earth. His disobedience of God's command followed by his pride caused him to fall out of God's favor: \"And behold, We said to the angels: \"Bow down to Adam\" and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject faith (those who are disobedient).\" (2:34) God later places Adam and Eve in the garden and tells them that they are free to enjoy of its fruits except not to come near a certain tree: (2:35) \"We said: \"O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden; and eat of the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression.\" Satan then deceives Adam and Eve into eating of the fruits of the tree: (2:36) \"Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been. We said: \"Get ye down, all (ye people), with some of you having enmity towards others. On earth will be your dwelling-place and your means of livelihood - for a time.\" Adam and Eve feel a lot of remorse for their actions, but God turns to Adam in mercy and consoles him: (2:37) \"Then learnt Adam from his Lord words of inspiration, and his Lord Turned towards him; for He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.\" God then informs Adam that God will send his guidance to Adam and his progeny: (2:38) \"We said: \"Get down all of you from this place (the garden), then whenever there comes to you Guidance from Me, and whoever follows My Guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.\" ",
