            "answer_text": "Personally, I feel that the number one issue is the growing divide between the wealthy and the middle and lower economic classes. The wealth gap is increasing with the wealthy gaining more money than can be accounted for by simple inflation. The average worker, however, has actually seen a decline in relative wealth. Given the growing wealth gap, it would seem that there may be a greater need for a social safety net. As this need grows, however, we are seeing constant calls for shrinking this lifeline. As such, more people are under increasing stresses just to try to make ends meet. Racial inequality and the lack of access to opportunities and resources because of the color of one\u2019s skin is a major problem. The media have been introducing so many people to this issue, but people of color have been forced to endure this for centuries. That alone suggests a major problem in our society. Those who have privilege, whether White privilege, male privilege, Christian privilege, heterosexual privilege, age privilege, et cetera tend to fail to see that they have privilege, that they doors open to them that are closed tightly to others without these advantages. As such, they too often fail to realize the very existence of their privilege. Many of these issues are related to economics, to the accumulation of wealth by the few. In our capitalistic society, wealth equals goodness and the lack of wealth equals personal failure. It is this very wealth, however, that perpetuates itself, allowing the wealthy to gain and the lower income people to fall further behind while the wealthy look down on them for their \u201cfailure\u201d.
