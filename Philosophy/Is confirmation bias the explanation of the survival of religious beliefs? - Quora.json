            "answer_text": "No. A religious belief has two essential attributes: It pertains to the metaphysical.It is a belief that you give primacy and priority to in guiding your beliefs and choices during your life.This usually means that the belief has some relationship to a truth claim about morality: that belief or act X is moral or immoral. A religion that is based on reason will start with some rational basis for a belief in the metaphysical, and some way of relating the \u201cis\u201d to the \u201cought.\u201d Or, to put that another way: will reason from the observable to the proper. For Christians, this is the Natural Law. Confirmation bias can cause you to hold on to a belief that has little or no effect on your ability to flourish. The moment a belief demonstrates a strong enough negative effect on your flourishing, however, you will quickly abandon it. So, fundamentally, religious beliefs survive either because they have not been fully or properly tested, or because they have demonstrated the ability to help one flourish in the fullest sense of the word. In a very real and measurable way, religious beliefs can be tested, and Jesus tells us how to do this: Matthew 7:15-20 15 \u201cBeware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but underneath are ravenous wolves. 16 By their fruits you will know them. Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles? 17 Just so, every good tree bears good fruit, and a rotten tree bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a rotten tree bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire. 20 So by their fruits you will know them. That said, people can make all kinds of mistakes, like thinking that \u201cflourishing\u201d means \u201cmore pleasure\u201d or \u201cless suffering.\u201d Sometimes, to flourish one must go through suffering. Sometimes, to flourish literally requires you to die. ",

            "answer_text": "That might be the explanation of someone who have no empathy for religious belief. I prefer my definition. Religious people hold that certain statements about reality are immutably and indisputably true. These are the religion's core beliefs or credo. They also interpret their interactions with reality in such a way as to maintain their belief in their credo. The experience reality through the lens of their beliefs. You might call it confirmatory bias but I prefer to think genuinely religious people hold a different paradigm. For more read The Fundamental Difference between Religion and Science. ",
