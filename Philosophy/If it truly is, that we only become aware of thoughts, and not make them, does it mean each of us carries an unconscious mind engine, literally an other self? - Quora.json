            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. If we merely become aware of thoughts and do not generate them, does that mean that each of us carries an unconscious mind engine, literally another self? That carries two suggestions: that I (for example) do not generate thoughts, and that the process of generating them is unconscious. To begin with, then, I think that both suggestions are questionable. > I see no reason to deny that I generate thoughts. For example, I generated the thought that it is the neuroscientist at the screen of a brain monitor, studying the so-called neural correlate of your experience as you take in the fragrance of a rose, and not you, who experience that fragrance, who understands that experience to the bottom. That thought was original to me\u2014I came up with it, in common parlance\u2014even if it is to be found somewhere in the literature. > I would say, furthermore, that the process by which I generated that thought was about as conscious as any other part of my active life. But that, of course, does not answer your question, for you ask as to the truth of the following conditional (\u201cif \u2026 then\u201d statement): If you merely become aware of thoughts and do not generate them, then there is a second you that generates them unconsciously. I have several questions for you: Which is the real you, the one that generates a thought, unconsciously you say, or the one that becomes aware of it once it has been generated? And how do you distinguish the one you and the other numerically? Why not say that there is only one you, who generates the thought, and then considers it? Here is my account: There is only one you, that entity is an organism, a tangible physical object, and that organism both generates thoughts and considers them once they are at hand. There is a very simple idea that even professional philosophers are prone to miss, I think: There is no such thing as a thinking soul, Cartesian ego, or subject of experience (entity that has experiences), but there is, nevertheless, such a thing as I, this thinking thing, to borrow a phrase from Descartes, and such as thing as you, that thinking thing. It is just that I, and you, are organisms, not souls, Cartesian egos, or so on. In other words, it is simply a mistake to reason as follows: X There is no such thing as a soul, Cartesian ego, or subject of experience, and hence no such thing as I. The truth, rather, is this: O There is no such thing as a soul, Cartesian ego, or subject of experience, but there is such a thing as I, and I am an organism, a tangible physical object. ",

            "answer_text": "How about all of us together have a 'collective unconscious' (c.u.). Not individual but collective, that keep us all tied to our societal thought structures. And how about it is every single story and history our human kind has ever told itself from time immemorial, when the human kind evolved on Earth? Carl Jung, the Swiss Psychologist has spoken about this. This thing keeps us mentally tied in it's strong hold for ever, with the scary thoughts, perspectives, and concepts. Remember before we used to fight wild animals, barbarians, as well as religious, social and racial persecution. All these fear are embedded in the c.u. and that keeps coming up as scary thoughts. It is a courageous person who breaks these shackles of fear and come out after a lot of mental thought and contemplation. Then they taste the 'true freedom' of individuality. All the very best!

            "answer_text": "I posit that we are three selves, each with its own will. A physical self exists in non-conscious mental functions, a psychological self that is expressed in conscious mental functions and a spiritual self that emerges as consciousness of self expands to include things thought of as not being part of one\u2019s self. The conscious self, like the tip of an iceberg, is an extension of the non-conscious self; that is its existence is dependent upon the body\u2019s physiological processes. The spiritual self is the highest function of consciousness that also like an iceberg\u2019s tip emerges from conscious functions; it too, is the product of physiological processes. ",
