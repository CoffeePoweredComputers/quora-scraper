            "answer_text": " The central counterargument I hear from supporters of dangerous AGW is that there is a 97% consensus among scientists \u2014 this is repeated by them ad nauseum as though they were in a hypnotic trance impervious to facts and reason alike. But if anyone does the smallest amount of research into these studies they always turn out to be fallacious and manipulated. And they never quantify AGW. All sceptics agree with the factual reality of AGW, but disagree with its magnitude. These 97% studies always ask questions such as \u2018Is AGW real?\u2019 without quantifying the degree and even skeptics agree AGW is real, so it doesn\u2019t tell us anything we don\u2019t already know. Let\u2019s go through some of the consensus studies and pick them apart. Let\u2019s start with the most popular, John Cook (2013) and explain why it was essentially meaningless. One of the most cited papers purporting to demonstrate a 97% consensus on AGW was John Cook (2013). This paper referenced a total of 12,271 papers and these papers were split up into 7 categories. Category 1 included 65 papers that claimed humans were the \u201cprimary cause\u201d of global warming. Category 2 included 934 papers that acknowledged AGW was a \u201cknown fact\u201d. Category 3 included 2,933 papers that acknowledged \u201cgreenhouse gases cause warming\u201d. Category 4 took no position and 5, 6, 7, either implicitly or explicitly rejected AGW. The 97% consensus was arrived at by taking the first 4 categories (which had around 12,000 papers) and counting them as \u201cfor\u201d AGW. However, most skeptics would agree that AGW is a \u201cknown fact\u201d and that \u201cgreenhouse gases cause warming\u201d and therefore skeptics could be included in the 97%. Category 1 was the only one which included papers that claimed that humans were the \u201cprimary cause\u201d of global warming (i.e. over 50%) and that included only 65 papers. The 97% consensus that humans are the \u201cprimary cause\u201d of global warming is really a 0.5% consensus (i.e. 65 papers of 12,271) because category 1 was the only category that explicitly endorsed the idea that humans were the \u201cprimary cause\u201d of global warming. Also, Cook\u2019s study was so skewed he included various well-known AGW-skeptics in the 97% (see here). Click on the image below from John Cook (2013) to enlarge (red and yellow highlights added by me). The next one is Doran and Zimmerman (2009). This pair of researchers from the University of Illinois sent out an online survey to 10,000 Earth scientists asking them two questions: 1) \u201cDo you agree that global temperatures have generally risen since the pre-1800s?\u201d and 2) \u201cDo you think that human activity is a significant contributing factor?\u201d Out of the 10,000 Earth scientists, 3146 responded. Of these respondents, 90% said yes to the first question and 82% said yes to the second question. However the 97% figure came from only 77 scientists (of unknown credentials) of which Zimmerman (2009) essentially handpicked, out of which 75 agreed to both questions. The ratio of 75:77 thus produced the 97% consensus. 75 scientists hardly constitutes a \u201cworldwide consensus\u201d and the questions that Zimmerman (2009) asked were pretty silly too. Terms like \u201csignificant contributing factor\u201d is vague and apparently many of the scientists who were asked the question protested on the grounds of the unscientific and subjective question style.The next study is from James Lawrence Powell (2014) who claimed there was a 99% consensus on anthropogenic global warming. Powell scoured the web for scientific articles under the search-terms \u201cglobal warming\u201d and \u201cclimate change\u201d and supposedly reviewed a grand total of 25,182 articles. He then claimed that based on these articles he had found a 99% consensus based on \u201cwhatever combination of titles, abstracts, and entire articles was necessary to identify articles that \u2018reject\u2019 human-caused global warming\u201d. After apparently searching through thousands of articles, Powell claims to have found only 24 articles that rejected AGW or observed a better cause for the warming than CO2 (out of 13,950 articles). But the problem is, AGW-skeptics do not reject the factual reality of AGW and agree that anthropogenic CO2 might be causing some warming, even if that warming is very small. We do not reject AGW. I think warmists must have been reminded of this fact over a thousand times and yet still refuse to accept it and insist on painting skeptics as \u201cdeniers of AGW\u201d. By obtaining a 99% consensus through those who reject AGW, Powell (2014) conveniently and illegitimately disregarded the colossal amount of AGW-skeptic papers that would have otherwise massively deflated the 99% figure.Then there\u2019s the study by Naomi Oreskes (2004). This was an unattributed \u201canalysis\u201d of 928 peer-reviewed papers which allegedly showed that 75% of those papers agreed with the \u201cconsensus position\u201d on AGW while the remaining 25% neither agreed nor disagreed with it. Like John Cook (2013), it was not a survey of scientists, but papers (published between 1993 and 2003). Oreskes used the Web of Science engine using the keyword phrase \u201cglobal climate change\u201d to search through peer-reviewed papers to see whether they endorsed the IPCC\u2019s consensus view that \u201cEarth\u2019s climate is being affected by human activities\u201d and that \u201cmost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations\u201d. Oreskes\u2019 study was later misrepresented by Al Gore. Some media outlets claim her study showed a 100% consensus. This was based on her claim that she had found no papers that rejected the idea that \u201cglobal climate change is occuring and human activities are at least part of the reason why\u201d. Of course, AGW-skeptics do not disagree with this and thus could be included in the 100% figure. It\u2019s perhaps important to point out that Oreskes\u2019 \u201canalysis\u201d was unattributed and when Peiser (2005) re-ran her survey he found dramatically different results. Instead of a 75% consensus he found only a 1.2%. Oreskes\u2019 survey was also based on papers that are now 17 to 27 years old (as of 2020) and climate science has made vast improvements in climate sensitivity estimates since, with seemingly more and more scientists finding lower values (see graph below). All the 97% consensus studies are meaningless for one reason or another. ",

            "answer_text": " Scientific consensus is not achieved democratically. The process is more like gladiatorial combat: last one standing wins the \u201cconsensus.\u2019 The combat takes place in dueling research papers published in peer-reviewed journals and attacked and defended at professional conferences. More accurately, it\u2019s like dozens or even hundreds of such combats going on with the publishing of many different avenues of research, with different methodolical tools and models, different data sets. When all those avenues converge on one underlying theory, that theory wins acceptance. This is called \u201cconsilience.\u201d It\u2019s the most fault-tolerant way of proving something, because even if one of those avenues turns out to be a dead end, it doesn\u2019t touch the validity of those other ones\u2014and it also doesn\u2019t affect the validity of the overall conclusion. But another kind of combat takes place when the research threatens the profits of major industries. The industries invariably fight back with ferocious propaganda campaigns that seek not only to discredit the research but if possible to destroy the careers of the scientists involved. This combat is not conducted in the scientific journals and conferences, but in the public and political spheres. And the purpose is not to advance a competing theory, but simply to cast doubt on the real one. Here the methods are not scientific but propagandistic, lifted from the playbooks of two governments that honed their propaganda tools to a fine art: the Third Reich and the USSR. More recently the Russian government and the Republican Party in the USA have adopted these tools and integrated them with Internet-based social media. These forces have spent decades grooming voters to fear and distrust government and \u201celites\u201d\u2014by which they don\u2019t mean rich people; they mean smart, educated people\u2014topped by scientists. Conversely they\u2019ve groomed voters to trust big business; for every American, no matter how lowly, to think of himself as a \u201ctemporarily embarassed millionaire.\u201d A big part of this campaign is the production and dissemination of fake science\u2014produced by real scientists who lack the skills or the discipline to produce real science. They crank out prodigious amounts of this chaff\u2014over 193 denial myths are listed and debunked by one climate scientists\u2019 site ( Global Warming and Climate Change skepticism examined ). These are disseminated by astroturf websites\u2014those that pretend to be represented \u201cconcerned private citizen\u201d efforts but are in fact funded and directed by the fossil fuel industry through money laundering cutouts with anodyne patriotic names. The amount spent in this century alone approaches a billion dollars. Dangerous, man-caused global warming via greenhouse gases was first speculated about in the 1820s, but there was no way to prove or disprove it them. Late in the 19th century saw the beginnings of good, continuous data collection. By the late 1970s, a majority of climate scientists had accepted AGW (anthropogenic global warming) as what was happening to the climate. It took a few decades more for the general science community to buy off on it. By 2005, only 3% of climate scientists were challenging AGW (hence the 97% part), and practically every national science association of every developed nation had agreed and published supporting statement of their own, like this one from the AAAS: \u201cThe overwhelming evidence of human-caused climate change documents both current impacts with significant costs and extraordinary future risks to society and natural systems. The scientific community has convened conferences, published reports, spoken out at forums and proclaimed, through statements by virtually every national scientific academy and relevant major scientific organization \u2014 including the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) \u2014 that climate change puts the well-being of people of all nations at risk.\u201d http://whatweknow.aaas.org/get-the-facts/ A few years ago the Pew Foundation polled AAAS member scientists (the cream of the crop\u2014no lab techs with pretensions) and found that 87% accepted AGW. But meanwhile the Merchants of Doubt were working their mojo on the American public, with the result that only 50% (mostly Democrats) accepted the following statement: \u201cThe earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity\u201d Major Gaps Between the Public, Scientists on Key Issues The truth will out, though, as it did against the lead industry\u2019s campaign to keep lead in paints and fuels, and the tobacco industry\u2019s campaign to keep cancer sticks in our mouths:  But even as the general public moves toward agreeing with the science, the Republican deniers double down on their fantasy version of reality. And the deniers aren\u2019t bland about this. They\u2019re angry. Steamed. Those double-domed egghead so-shul-ists are evil people trying to turn \u2018merica into the Soviet Union. And other countres. Look at the lengthy screed here by Canadian lawyer James Matkin. He has zero training in science, yet he\u2019s 100% certain that AGW is a hoax perpetrated by scientists (I\u2019m guessing he doesn\u2019t know a single scientist personally) and socialists who want to cheat the public and steal their God-given rights. He\u2019s mad as hell and he isn\u2019t gonna take it anymore. And look at all those facts and charts and charts and facts! He must be right, right? Only it\u2019s all a house of cards. But you have to know something about the science to knock it all down. And scientists are not, as a rule, crusaders willing and eager to mix it up in the public forums. Only a handful of actual climate scientists are active on Quora\u2014like Katherine Hayhoe. But the Merchants of Doubt crank out dozens of denier-questions every day, and the scientists have day jobs. Plus they\u2019re daunted by the fury of the deniers and weight and authority of the Republican politicians backing them up. The 4th Annual Climate Assessment, by 13 federal science agencies, released the day after Thanksgiving in hopes of burying it, gives us the state of the art regarding AGW and America in 2019. The science is solid, and utterly consilient. 4th National Climate Assessment report Yet the Denier In Chief, when asked about it, said simply \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d And that was good enough for the fossil fuel industry\u2019s tools and fools. Our only solution, here in America, is to vote out every single Republican officeholder. Their party has been completely corrupted by the fossil fuel industry, and they will do nothing\u2014absolutely nothing\u2014about this crucial issue as long as they\u2019re in power.  Factio Republicanus nulla est. ",
