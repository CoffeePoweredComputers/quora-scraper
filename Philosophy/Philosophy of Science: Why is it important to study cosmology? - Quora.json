            "answer_text": "The answer to the question depends on what is meant by \"important\".  If \"important\" means \"have a near term, positive, practical effect in everyday life here on Earth\", then if is difficult to see how the study of cosmology is important. In fact, I would say it is NOT important in that sense. I know people talk about \"spin-offs\" from scientific research or a technological program such as going to the Moon, but in my opinion these spin-offs are relatively insignificant and could have been achieved at much lower cost with more practical technology directed research programs. However, I think one thing that is important for us humans is the development of more knowledge. If developing more knowledge is \"important\" for humans, then studying and doing research in cosmology is important. A great book I've read, David Deutsch's \"The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World\" has the best explanation or definition of knowledge that I've ever read.  He \"explains\" that knowledge is about finding explanations for how the world or universe works.  Here are a few quotes from the book:  Scientific theories are explanations: assertions about what is out there and how it behaves....But, in reality, scientific theories are not \u2018derived\u2019 from anything. We do not read them in nature, nor does nature write them into us. They are guesses \u2013 bold conjectures....Discovering a new explanation is inherently an act of creativity....Then a powerful new mode of discovery and explanation emerged, which later became known as science. Its emergence is known as the scientific revolution, because it succeeded almost immediately in creating knowledge at a noticeable rate, which has increased ever since....The quest for good explanations is, I believe, the basic regulating principle not only of science, but of the Enlightenment generally. It is the feature that distinguishes those approaches to knowledge from all others, and it implies all those other conditions for scientific progress I have discussed: It trivially implies that prediction alone is insufficient. Somewhat less trivially, it leads to the rejection of authority, because if we adopt a theory on authority, that means that we would also have accepted a range of different theories on authority. And hence it also implies the need for a tradition of criticism. It also implies a methodological rule \u2013 a criterion for reality \u2013 namely that we should conclude that a particular thing is real if and only if it figures in our best explanation of something. I could go on and on with quotes from this book, but to really understand it I would recommend that everybody reads the book. The bottom line is that, with: the development of language, which enabled science, which is the work of creating better and better explanations for what is out there and how it behaveswhich is knowlegewe humans have become universal explainers that are now capable explaining anything - even the universe.  (That is one of the meanings of \"beginning of infinity\" that Deutsch'd book is about.) Since the universe as a whole is certainly an important part of what is out there, it certainly is important to study cosmology.  By studying cosmology you get to understand and explain things like this:  The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation - a snapshot of the universe from 13.7 billion years ago when the universe was only 379,000 years old. See Frank Heile's answer to If we look at a star millions of light-years away, which we have done, the light takes millions of years to get to us, so we are looking millions of years backwards in time. Using this reasoning, what is the furthest we could look backwards in time? for more information. You can also understand and explain this:  Hubble Deep Field  Besides being important, I think that studying and understanding cosmology is interesting, fun and is mind-blowing.  Imagine getting an understanding for the whole structure of the universe from shortly after the Big Bang to a googol years from now. It is incredible and fascinating to begin to have an understanding of cosmolgy. In fact I am writing this answer during a break in the UC Davis Cosmic Frontiers Conference in May 2013.  It has been really interesting and FUN! Having interesting and fun things to do is important to me! ",

            "answer_text": "Cosmology, physics, and really all of science is the story of who we are and where and when we come from. I find that a profound and enlightening story. I always wonder when people ask about things like this. Some of them wonder if it will give them a new drug or consumer yummy. To be sure, not dying just yet is an important goal, but there are two ways to die. One is simply to die. The other is not to live. Being a part of the universe that can understand and enjoy itself is what makes me feel most alive, most human. Eating and sleeping and having sex and eliminating and breathing are all great pleasures, and I don't look down on them. But you don't have to be human to do that. Frogs do it. There is a special wonder in being born human, and I feel I would be wasting it if I did not participate, albeit weakly, in such a grand adventure. I agree with Neill deGrasse Tyson. When I contemplate the universe, it doesn't make me feel insignificant. It makes me feel huge. My senses, augmented with the inventions of my species, extend to the farthest reaches of the visible universe, back in time almost to the beginning. What other species on Earth can claim that grandeur? Shall I waste that human condition and become little but a money-making, pill-popping robot? I don't think so. ",
