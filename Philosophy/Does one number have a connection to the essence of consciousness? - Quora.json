            "answer_text": "The number One and infinity work together as one infinitely intelligent creator of one universe of potential infinitely intelligent creations. Consciousness is the one spectrum of infinite connections with the infinitely intelligent creator. Lots of words running around in a circle but infinity has to start from One and it needs to be conscious of the One so that many can be produced.If there was only One then there would be no infinity and no need for consciousness. If there is One producing the many infinitely and consciously then a desire needs to motivate the production of the many. There also needs to be an infinite substance of the many. The substance is light and the desire is love. So that what is created is different from each creation free will can be used to distort the intelligent infinity of love which gives a medium of consciousness and a force of mind. ",

            "answer_text": "Well if you consider that a number is a form of a pattern then you could possibly reason that consciousness is also a type of pattern, meaning that if you would know the pattern that consciousness follows you might be able to express that in a certain amount of numbers. I do not know which number it corresponds to, but with future technology they might be able to figure this out. ",
