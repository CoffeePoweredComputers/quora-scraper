            "answer_text": "Before entering this discussion, it is necessary to emphasize Aristotle's view of a 'good life' was limited exclusively to men (but not just any men, they had to be of correct social status.) Aristotle acknowledges that luck has a role to play in the good life, but to what extent does luck effect the good life? If the good life is dependent on external factors, then it would appear that it could not be considered self-sufficient. However, Aristotle argues that the good life is self-sufficient, and communally self-sufficient. Luck's effect on the good life was much greater than what Aristotle was prepared to acknowledge. Clear thinking about crucial issues.. Aristotle also believed that good for humans is the maximum realization of what was unique to humans. It followed the good for humans was to reason well. The task of reason was to teach humans how to act virtuously, and the exercise faculties in accordance with virtue. The good life, then, was defined by Aristotle as the activity of the soul in accordance with virtue. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Virtue consisted of intellectual virtue and moral virtue. Intellectual virtue was comprised of theoretical wisdom, practical wisdom and understanding. Experience and time were necessary requirements for the development of intellectual virtue. Moral virtue was controlled by practical wisdom and owed its development to how one nurtured it as habit. Today's Most Popular Study Guides. Aristotle identified many that could not lead the good life. Women, slaves and the lower classes (trades people and farmers) were unable to lead the good life since they could not make their own decisions, nor could they choose an action for its own sake. Therefore they were unable to practice the virtues Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews. Animals were excluded from the good life as they could not exercise rationality. Children were excluded as they had not yet had occasion to practice the virtues, particularly intellectual virtues. Those who had experienced great loss were unable to lead the good life since it would be difficult to learn new friendships and friendship was a necessary requirement for leading the good life. Quodlibet Journal . The chronically ill would find it difficult to learn the desires of a healthy person, and since health was a requirement of leading the good life, this group was also excluded. Even the gods, according to Aristotle, could not lead the good life since they found their own lack of limit restricting. Isolated persons were incapable of leading the good life because virtues necessitated action and required an object to be acted upon. In brief, Aristotle excluded groups from leading the good life even there were issues outside their control. An encyclopedia of philosophy articles written by professional philosophers.. Therefore, to live the good life, one had to be born into the acceptable family, social class, he had to be a Greek male and be thirty to forty years old. He should never have experienced any unfortunate circumstances, bereavement or isolation. Besides having the opportunity to act on the virtues, he must familiar with what he was doing; chosen to act for its own sake; with a firm and unchangeable determination. Putting it together, the good life depended on favorable external factors which may be outside the person's control. Class Action. Aristotle acknowledged that luck played a role in leading the good life: \"most people suppose that the eudemon [benevolent spirit] life is a fortunate life, for without these external gods who control of luck, it would be impossible to enjoy a 'good life!\" On the one hand Aristotle maintains 'luck' or 'chance' is needed for a 'good life'. The other claim is that good fortune is a subspecies of luck. The question that defies his statements is: Aristotle did not consider good fortune to be any kind of luck at all. Dent NonFun at the University of California, Irvine. Aristotle argued against leaving everything to lady luck, \"to turn what is greatest and best over to luck would strike too false a note.\" If everything was left up to luck for all the needed and necessary conditions for leading the good life, good life would be outside one's control. Aristotle argued that limiting the scope of the external factors that affected the good life would make the good life too limited and filled with frailty. Priam in the Trojan war encountered such misfortunes that he ended in a wretched condition. Priam was considered to be living the good life until he experienced the loss of family, children, friends, power, and freedom through war. Aristotle considered Priam's capacity to act well diminish; and concluded that Priam could no longer live the good life. Encyclopedia Britannica. The Greek acknowledged as did Aristotle that forces that controlled human destiny were the gods, \" ... the other-than-human powers that supervise the order of the world on occasions make use of humans in the performance of this supervision.\" Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

            "answer_text": "Aristotle's thoughts about life and its meaning are basically to be found in his work Nicomachean Ethics (\u1f28\u03b8\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u1f71\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1; \u0112thika Nikomakheia), which is about ethics (as the title suggests), human virtues, the golden mean etc. His initial argumentation about the meaning of life is the following one: Every purposeful action in this world pursues a certain desirable aim.There are a lot of aims, but the highest one is eudaimonia (\u03b5\u1f50\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u1f77\u03b1). The term means \"happiness\" or \"welfare\", but also transcents this meaning; it is a philosophical term that had been used by other philosophers before Aristotle; it refers to a certain way of life.Since eudaimonia is the highest aim and also a practical one (it has to do with one's actions and life), it is essential that politics care about it; besides, the part (every single human being alone) is less necessary than the whole (society). Eudaimonia is connected to politics.The problem is that people do not agree on the exact meaning of eudaimonia. There are even some who believe that living a hedonistic life is a kind of happiness.Since people tend to pursue virtues for their own sake and not only for their practical usefuleness or for the happiness they cause, we can infer that virtue human life and eudaimonia are profoundly connected with being virtuous.To understand what man's true eudaimonia really is, one has also to inspect what man's uniqueness and specialized work (ergon; \u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd) are about.Man's uniqueness emanates from his logos (\u03bb\u1f79\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2; speach and/or reason). Reason has a role to play in man's good life too.Good life is not only about contemplation, but also about acting/doing.INFERENCE: The Good of man is the active exercise of his soul's faculties in conformity with excellence or virtue, or if there be several human excellences or virtues, in conformity with the best and most perfect among them.
