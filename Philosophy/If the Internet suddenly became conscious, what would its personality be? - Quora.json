            "answer_text": "It would probably have some sort of psychotic multiple personality syndrome, I\u2019m sure. You\u2019ve got the \u201cbenevolent\u201d side of the internet where people are legitimately trying to change the world through social media, \u201csave the animals\u201d, etc, etc. THEN you have your general trolls from reddit, tumblr, facebook, 4chan (is that still a thing?), and various forums and chatboards who would post pictures of a guy beating someone to death with a baseball bat, and titling it with the caption \u201cgay bashing\u201d JUST to get a rise out of everyone, or who would drive someone to suicide and then continue to mock them even after the fact. THEN you have all the self-important, over-opinionated pricks on sites like Quora who absolutely MUST make sure that not only are their voices heard, but they won\u2019t leave until you\u2019re convinced that they know EVERYTHING, and no one in the world can compare to their amazing intellect. And yes, this includes ALL quorans. Anyone who says otherwise is probably just lying to themselves. THEN you have the general porn crowd who frequents sites like REDACTED, REDACTED, and REDACTED, and who are into strange-but-not-overtly-harmful sexual fetishes like REDACTED or REDACTED. And then, even after ALL THAT, you STILL have the really scary side of the internet, the Dark Web, where all sorts of horrible stories abound of Pay-to-Kill Pay-Per-View webcam sessions, women being simultaneously raped and murdered for the amusement of others, assassins who advertise their wares openly, hackers who stalk people for a lifetime simply because they think it\u2019s funny, etc. So the internet would likely be a very evil personality, consistently angering, depressing, or even outright KILLING everyone it encountered, and it would be so evil because WE made it that way. Every comment, video, or flame war we posted online, every single line of code, every emoji, every action we took would become the newly sentient internet\u2019s genetic makeup. It would have no choice BUT to be evil. It would have to be completely destroyed, and a new, non-conscious internet would have to be built in its place. This would be done in order to save lives, but at the core, it would be to save us from the mirror monster made of ourselves. ",
