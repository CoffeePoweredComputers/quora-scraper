There isn\u2019t one, but they are all linked through the words of Carl Marx. They are either known as Marxism, Socialism, Communism etc - each is a subset of the other, with subtle differences. The aim seems to be that Marxism is used to create a more socialist society which will eventually become a communist one. They have been practicing for 150 years, and killed over 100 million people but there still isn\u2019t a working utopia anywhere in the world that isn\u2019t held up by a capitalistic funding stream somewhere or just outright lying in the accounting department!
