            "answer_text": "The question is not if they can. The question is when will they become self-aware.  For example, this robot passed a 'self-awareness' test that only humans could handle until now. Not the one above. The one in the link provided. Although, Boston Dynamics is at quite an advanced stage. Although the video above is a glimpse of what they have been trying to achieve and was created with special effects, I believe they are not too far from that reality. Experts think the singularity (the point at which artificial intelligence can match, and then overtake human intelligence) might happen in just 16 years: Intelligent Robots Will Overtake Humans by 2100, Experts Say ",

            "answer_text": "That is 2 questions\u2026 Can computers become conscious? Maybe, they sure are spending a lot of time/ money/research to see if they can make that happen. I personally doubt it as their seems to be a bio mechanical component that is necessary to the process. That is, there is an encased mass that creates and energy field that is associated with the emergence of consciousness in life forms.If they do become conscious they will have to compete with everything else, if they are fit they will be selected for by the environment, if they are not fit they will become extinct an historically viewed as parasitic extensions of the human population.",

That would be the highest crime in the Universe. Unfortunately, it seems that \u201cScientist\u201d are already working on this.  Humanity must wake up before it is too late.
