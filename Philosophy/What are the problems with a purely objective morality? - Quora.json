            "answer_text": "The fundamental problems with a purely objective morality are: agreeing what it isestablishing that it even existsthe belligerence of moral absolutists imposing their \u2018objective morality\u2019 on othersThere are a great many moral systems which claim to objectively correct. This includes Abrahamic religious belief systems where morality comes from an absolute authority, Dharmic religions where morality is an impersonal law of nature (karma) that rewards good behaviour and punishes bad behaviour, political ideologies where morality corresponds to beliefs about class conflict, racial superiority or a favoured economic model, and moral systems based on axioms about natural rights, duties or a moral imperative to optimise consequences for the greatest number of people. Not only do these competing systems contradict one another, but they all claim to be - or to be founded on - objective morality. They certainly cannot all be correct. A maximum of one could be correct. And even so, none of them is able to demonstrate their correctness in an objective way - meaning a demonstration that does not depend on cultural or subjective value judgements, unproven axioms (assumptions) or beliefs or religious faith. The problem here is that, while is is possible to objectively show that some action is likely to lead to a certain outcome, or that an outcome is likely to be appreciated by many humans, there is no way to demonstrate that an outcome is good without making a value judgement. Some philosophies have it that optimising human welfare is good. Others have it that loving and obeying God or having faith in the divinity of Jesus is good. Others that overthrowing capitalism, furthering the interests of the \u2018superior race\u2019, freeing individuals and businesses from state interference, or adhering to some list of rights that they believe in constitute goodness. Saying something is good or bad is a value judgement, not an objective fact. What we value comes down to what we care about, which is subjective, cultural, ideological and emotional. Related to the above issue, the fact that adherents of many of these contradictory moral systems / ideologies, believe that they are objectively correct, gives them an unjustified sense of authority to impose themselves on others, in spite of the fact that others have their own value systems, which may themselves be believed to be objectively correct. And of course there are also, all sorts of self-serving biases built into these moral systems about the superiority of one\u2019s own culture or ethnic group. And if you have exclusive access to the \u2018correct\u2019 objective morality then you can justify almost any means to bring about that \u2018objective good\u2019 - you have a moral duty to impose your morality on others, including via the use of extreme force. Here are some examples of where the belief in objective morality has led to a sort of crusading moral imperialism and substantial suffering: The CrusadesThe Inquisition\u2018Witch trials\u2019 in Europe and North AmericaNazi GermanyStalinism/Pol Pot etcThe TalibanAl QaedaThe Iraq WarISIS",

            "answer_text": "Diversity is a pretty obvious way of maximizing the sources of solving any problem. We want to draw on as many possible solutions and information as we can, even from unexpected sources. This is a way to innovate and make the best use of available resources. The English language incorporates words and concepts from many other languages, giving it an astounding number of words. This borrowing gives it an astounding number of words and degree of expressiveness. When a solution to a problem is found from all that input, we need to decide on a course to take in order, as well, to focus the team on the chosen plan to similarly maximize the probability of success for the community team, which is taking advantage of the diversity of strengths and resources. Note that eventually a decision should be made at least until the solution is implemented and the goal met. If members of the team or community simply continue to follow their individual plans, the result is wasted effort, chaos and more likely failure. Further planning can still be done by individuals using all their diversity for future goals. If, for example, the goal is for communication and some participants decide to speak their own language, that language could have wonderful qualities, but the team communication will be a failure. This is how Diversity is misused by requiring all choices and all people to participate not only in the source of choices, but in simply being present. Just as a cook has all the ingredients available in a kitchen and requires that they all be used regardless of the dish. As the saying goes, \u201cKeep an open mind, but not so open your brains fall out.\u201d A sports team might allow every person in the community to try out for the basketball team, but requiring representation from candidates over 300 pounds that are under five feet tall maximizes diversity of resources but will likely not serve the goals of the final team. Good intentions are not enough. ",
