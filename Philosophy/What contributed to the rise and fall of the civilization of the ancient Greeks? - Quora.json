            "answer_text": "The rise of Hellenic Civilisation can really be attributed to three things: grapes, olives, and trade See, Greece isn't exactly prime real estate. It is very mountainous, has very poor soil, and has very hot summers. However, Greece was blessed with being able to grow abundant olives and grapes, and having natural harbours. In the ancient world, olives and grapes were very important commodities. Olive oil became very important in culinary arts, and grapes can be used to make wine. With these two trade goods, many Greek states became commercial powers. Honestly, when we talk about Ancient Greece, we're talking about Athens. It was after all Athens that developed democracy, the Parthenon, the philosophy of Socrates, the writings of Plato and Aristotle, et cetera. With the grape and the olive, Athens made enough money to import grain from Asia Minor. It established colonies across the Mediterranean. It, along with Sparta, defeated the seemingly unbeatable Persian Empire.  Yet Athens was never able to establish true hegemony over the other Greeks. The Peloponnesian War ended in disaster for Athens and left Sparta in control, but Sparta didn't have the population or money to maintain control over the Greeks. The failure of Sparta to achieve hegemony allowed the Macedonians, under Phillip II, to conqueror almost all of Greece. His son Alexander would then defeat the Persians and spread Greek culture over much of the known world. Yet Alexander's death without a suitable heir naturally meant his empire would collapse, and within a generation the Greeks were again split. This of course allowed the Romans to muscle in. However, although the Greeks were militarily defeated by the Romans, Greek culture largely conquered Rome and survived even the fall of the Western Roman Empire, surviving the Eastern (Byzantine) Empire where Greek remained the dominant language.

            "answer_text": "Actually the greek civilization did not fall that easy as I read the answers bellow. While Romans tried to invade Greece, they where defeated by King Pirrhus and the greeks counter invaded Rome, won a lot of battles in Roman lands but eventually they couldn\u2019t capture Rome because of war fatigue and loses. After Pirrhus\u2019 army was eventually deafeted, the Romans did capture Greece with their military. Romans won by military force but they lost by culture. Greek culture defeated Rome, the Romans were very interested in sharing the greek culture to their lands, they took greek slaves such as teachers and architects to build the basis of the Roman Empire. That\u2019s why you see greek architecture in Roman lands (Italy). Greek teacher slaves taught the children of caesars, and of the wealthy. Some even say that the roots of Latin was also from Greece, but it\u2019s hard to think about any proof right now to mention, I need to research this again. Greeks lost by military, but since your question is about civilization, the civilization continued to Rome through culture. So while the Roman Empire controlled the Greek lands, later on in Roman history, while Christianism begun to rise, they seperated into the Western Roman Empire, and the Eastern Roman Empire. The Eastern Roman Empire, became the Byzantine Empire. Greek culture was the basis of the Byzantine Empire until it\u2019s fall in 1453 when the Ottomans eventually captured Constantinople (today\u2019s Istanbul, Turkey). So the Greek civilization did survive for all this long time. The real decline was during the Ottoman rule. Both Ottoman and Greek cultures mixed until Greece gained it\u2019s independence 1827 after a 400 year Ottoman rule. Greece, Egypt, and some other few countries, are the only ones that survived since ancient times. So it eventually did survive through time. ",
