            "answer_text": "Every philosophy of life claims that a) its goal is valuable and worth pursuing, and b) that following it is an effective way of achieving that goal (for some people, at least). a) Stoicism is one of a few philosophies that claims that the most valuable thing you can have in life if tranquility (peace, happiness, joy), and that it\u2019s the most worthy thing of being pursued. If you fundamentally disagree with that, and feel that indulging in the pleasures of life would lead to the best life, for example, then Stoicism is the wrong philosophy for you. b) Stoicism also is posits one way of pursuing tranquility, but other philosophies (Zen Buddhism, Epicureanism, Skepticism) map out different paths to tranquility. Any one of those may be easier to follow for you, or might jive better with your personality and natural tendencies. If they help you achieve tranquility more effectively than Stoicism, Stoicism is the wrong philosophy for you. Stoicism is great for some people, but not so great for others. It all depends on what you personally think it valuable in life and how you\u2019re best able to achieve that. If for some reason Stoicism doesn\u2019t get you where you want to go, it would most definitely be considered the wrong philosophical idea to follow. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t consider Stoicism wrong so much as incomplete. Modern interpretations of Stoic philosophy, in particular, seem potentially too narrowly rationalistic. Platonism, it seems to me, contains all of what\u2019s good in Stoicism, plus greater awareness of religion and love of God. ",
