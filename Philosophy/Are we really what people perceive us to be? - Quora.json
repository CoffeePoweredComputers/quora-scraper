            "answer_text": "The great masquerade At least this is what I have come to see our world to be. We hide. All the time. Beginning with ourselves. We are often bombarded with suggestions of how to be in order to be perceived a certain way. We are ever concerned about how people see us, seldom reflecting on the more urgent question of who we really are. Most of us wear different masks, be it lifestlyes we cannot afford but must have to fit in, wearing makeups and perfumes and these days there are even filters to mask that raw \u201cunsightly\u201d selfie\u2026 Why? Fear. Our hearts crave unconditional love and acceptance, just as we are but the terror of rejection haunts our souls till oft it snuffs out the embers of who we really are and were called to be. First impressions blah blah blah they say\u2026only because humans tend to imprison others into neat little boxes that make sense for us. We refuse to extend freedom of transformation to each other in favour of branding others with our ignorant, arrogant and corrupt perceptions. No. You are not only what I perceive you to be. You are a miracle. A whole life with a past, many battles raging within and without every present moment and a heart full of dreams and hopes for your unique. You are not your today's outfit, car, house, bank account or attitude. Why? All these things are fleeting. You can decide this moment to become a completely new creation. But if I hold you hostage to yesterday's perception, will you choose to allow me to enslave you so? No. You MUST NOT be only what I perceive you as, for every day is a gift to step into freedom of transform from a caterpillar into the butterfly you were created to be. So tear off the mask, painful it will be- for it has been a companion for too long. Embrace the pain and tear it off anyway. Let the Son shine his face upon you and transform you into his likeness \u2014 love, for that is who you are! And his opinion of you, eternally beloved, is ALL that matters, and this is eternal. A worthy pursuit indeed You are fearfully and wonderfully made dear friend :) hide not your exquisite beauty from self or the world, God knows the world needs more bravehearts who would break free from mortal minds' opinions and perceptions and reflect his incorruptible perception for all humankind. With Love, NN ",

            "answer_text": "Not necessarily. Certainly not at the outset of interaction, when you\u2019re roughly a tabula rasa (a misleading term) in the eyes of others. Do you have a list of things you consider to be parts of your identity? If there are aspects of yourself which you consider fundamental, and those aspects aren\u2019t readily perceived by others, then you have your answer. If you consider identity to be mostly situational, constantly in flux, then a significant part of what you \u201care\u201d might more closely match others\u2019 perception of you. In The Long Run: Based on the socialization that occurs as a result of this perception, you may well become something close to what people perceive you to be - a \u201ccaricature\u201d informed totally by reinforcement from the interactions you\u2019ve had. As a social being, you do not exist in a vacuum, and continually permute others just as they permute you. ",

            "answer_text": "There are no absolutes when it comes to our perceptions of one another or the world around us. We all see the world through a different lens, and none of these lenses can be said to be an objective reality. Our perceptions of ourselves are often even more distorted, as they are the most emotionally loaded. People walk around telling themselves a narrative that started taking shape at birth or possibly before that. Our lives may change dramatically as we enter adulthood, but often the narrative is an evolved variation the one we had as children. What makes this all the more complicated is our perceptions, like our mental state is changing all the time. It is not fixed in stone. In conclusion, no, you are not the person I perceive you to be, nor are you the person you perceive you to be. ",

BUT when I think about it more it seems that it all also depends on the person perceiving you. They might not understand your humor, feelings, actions or even your tone. So if they misunderstand any of those things then NO, you aren\u2019t what people perceive us to be. It\u2019s not that simple but i believe it\u2019s all in how people think about others. ",
