Here\u2019s a blast from the past by JFK targeted here at Grades 3\u20136, with thought questions planting a seed for lifelong and even multi-generational applications: \"Ask not what your country can do for you...\" Can YOU, questioner, significantly alter the collective consciousness? I don\u2019t know. Maybe. Or maybe in union with a critical mass of others of like mind. Show us what you\u2019ve got! Let the cynics wish they had come up with your idea. ",

At best, it describes something more like zeitgeist. It\u2019s not consciousess, just that there is a set of ideas that are commonly held. Totally passive, which contradicts the defining characteristic of a consciousness (which is activity). It\u2019s just new-age woo to imagine that there is some kind of ongoing \u201cconsciousness field\u201d that everyone\u2019s thoughts are connected to (the physics of this are laughable!) So lots of famous meme contributors have significantly altered the collective zeitgeist, in fields like science and religion (and perhaps music, painting, etc). ",

And since thoughts, intentions represent the most powerful forces in reality - which we know with the help of quantum physics - with every thought, intention we influence the whole system! And since inherently we make calculations decisions in a self-serving, subjective manner, we intend only for our own sake, we are by default constantly harming everything and anybody around us all over the world! Thus it is not surprising that our world is in a terrible crisis, chaos. So we urgently need the right, purposeful and practical educational method to help us adjust, adapt ourselves to the integral system so so the influence, interference we \u201cbroadcast\u201d, project would become positive, constructive got the whole system.

The Collective Unconscious therefore relates more to the FEELING - OR EMOTIONAL dimension of life. Jung answered this question when he was asked about whether or not people could control their dreams. He said that, in his experience, it was like \u201chandling an unruly dog\u201d - if we saw it sitting we would say \u201csit\u201d \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 and so on.
