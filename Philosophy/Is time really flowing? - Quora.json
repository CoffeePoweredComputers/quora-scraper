            "answer_text": "No, \"time\" does not flow. Very nicely explained here. Time is not tangible - like a particle or a wave etc. Scientists still do not know precisely what \"time\" is; it has no definition - so far. Strong reasons to believe that it is only an illusion. We usually think of time as having three parts - Past, Present, Future. But the Past is only a collection of memories. We can't experience the Past or alter it, we can only *remember* it, though not in its entirety. On top of that, we know that our memories are unreliable. And we can only remember it in the Present. There is no objective thing that we can call the Past; it can't be measured in any way; our only contact with the past is in the Present. And the Future - is only a mental construct, also in the Present. We can't experience the Future until it \"becomes\" the Present. Until then it only a hope and dream. We can predict what the Future may be like, but we know that it may not be accurate. There is no objective thing that we can call the Future; it can't be measured in any way; and again, our only contact with it is in the Present. That leaves us with only the Present - the ever changing Present. Time is something we created to measure the rate of the ongoing change in the Present. It's always NOW - but an ever changing NOW. In a effort to keep track of the change, we have invented time. How the Brain Constructs the Past and the Future This may help us understand what Einstein said - that the past, the present, and the future, ALL already exist, and are complete as a seamless continuum and our perception of \"the present moment\" is a subjective viewpoint.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think anyone knows enough about time to answer this with certainty. On the one hand, people and many other animals can\u2019t make much sense of the world without the idea that the past has \u201cgone by\u201d and the future is \u201cyet to come\u201d, so we have a general \u201cyes\u201d from the point of view of an agent, but this may be entirely due to our psychological make-up rather than the nature of time itself. On the other hand, the basic laws of nature (with a tiny exception for [math]\\beta[/math] decay) seem to be quite symmetrical with respect to time, so in a world devoid of agents there wouldn\u2019t be any fundamental difference between forward and backward points of view.
