            "answer_text": "90s/00s Hollywood-Elite is pretty much gone. If and when meaningful movies get made now, then really only because the elite gets nostalgic and decides to get back together for another gig. There are no new people following in their footsteps. Reason is kinda twofold: On one hand real-life notable social and scientific progress has stagnated. There are no new things. Progress is all about getting everyone else on the same level now, it\u2019s about \u201cincluding\u201d everybody as they say. Hollywoods movies have always been themed with social and scientific progress issues however. Now there is nothing to talk about that people dont already know, haven\u2019t seen. The talk about \u201cincluding\u201d people etc kinda didn\u2019t work out so well and may even have had its role in getting Trump elected. The other reason is that movies no longer lead pop-cultural discussions. The internet has outpaced, outgrown and gone way beyond. Movies now already feel dated and the first trailer hasn\u2019t even dropped yet. Netflix & Co. did not \u201cwin\u201d over Hollywood btw. It\u2019s just that movies are no longer valuable enough to be screened at theaters or sold on blue-ray/dvd. They have reached \u201ctrash-status\u201d where Netflix merely stepped in as discounter, selling them in bulk at a discounted price. This was a thing during the transition period, but people are waking up and cancelling their subscriptions. I guess it will all have to die, before newcomer creatives can begin to carve out a new path for the industry. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say yes. To me Hollywood used to mean making movies for the general public. Now it seems that they are making films to send a message. I go to movies to be entertained not lectured to by a director. Also, acceptance speeches should be under 3 minutes, say thank you to significant industry people. Not your mechanic, hairdresser, etc. . I am being sarcastic but people seem to be thanking everyone they can think of. Enough. Another way to fix it. Have a block 2 to 3 hours. Once it goes over have the channels stop broadcasting!!!!. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure. A global thermonuwar would probably do it, as would another KT sized event, or a plague or zombie apocalypse\u2026 Even a slow evolution away from the present global social order might do it, as might a slow dispersion of content production that reaches a threshold where large concentrations of production services and assets are no longer profitable\u2026 But if any of those things happen, we\u2019re going to have much more to be concerned with than the relevance of \u201cHollywood\u201d.
