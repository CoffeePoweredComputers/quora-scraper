            "answer_text": "Lots of good answers on here already, but I\u2019ll try to give you a few that your 20\u201321 year old self should definitely appreciate, seeing as my current self would have appreciated that advice. First, household and daily stuff. And that means more than doing your bed and taking out the trash. I come from a country that is labor intensive, we have people come over and wash our dishes and clean our floors, as such I grew up not knowing how to use a washing machine or how to fix minor problems in household life that could very easily be fixed. At 17, you might possibly be contemplating moving out for college in a year\u2019s time. It\u2019s the perfect time to learn small and handy things that we just rely on our parents or siblings to do. Learn to sow (no, I\u2019m serious), at least minor tears, learn to deal with electric and electronic items (I\u2019m not saying become a technician or something, but at least have a working knowledge of how to fix stuff), learn (or improve) your driving skills (I still can\u2019t drive and I regret it). Second, cook. This has already been mentioned before by others, but please, please learn to cook your own food. It is so helpful for you when you\u2019re living on your own. I understand not everyone may enjoy cooking to the same degree I do, but at least learn to make something simple and don\u2019t rely on cup noodles all the time as some have the tendency to do. Third, learn to be mature. I might get some disagreements on this, but I\u2019ve seen a general perception in some societies where it\u2019s almost expected for teen boys and girls to be absolute assholes, where the excuse given is, \u201cOh, s/he\u2019s just a kid, s/he\u2019ll grow out of it\u201d. I know this isn\u2019t everyone, but it\u2019s quite a few people from what I see. Don\u2019t fall in with that. The years you have from 17 onwards are going to be the years you remember even when you\u2019re 45 and have a very different life. Don\u2019t do stupid stuff, have common sense, don\u2019t be afraid to do things that make you happy, don\u2019t fall into things just because your friends or those you want to become your friends are doing it. Fourth, develop communication and people skills. By 17, it\u2019s possible that you already do, if maybe you work part time somewhere. But learn people skills, how to network, how to socialize professionally and formally. For a recluse like myself this stuff sounds awful, but in most professional fields these days, these skills often matter as much as, if not more than your grades and degrees. Fifth, critical thinking (and critical judgement). As a teen, I often thought this was stupid, or that was so dumb and so on and so forth. That is not critical thinking, learn to question what your parents are saying but don\u2019t just be like, \u2018Mom doesn\u2019t understand me\u2019 or \u2018Dad is so dumb\u2019. Try to look at things from other people\u2019s perspectives, and understand them, and then make a decision. You\u2019ll be entering a phase of life soon where there won\u2019t be parents or school teachers to spoon feed things to you, you\u2019ll have to take decisions for yourself, and it\u2019s easy to let that get to your head. Think calmly (and coldly) about things, weight stuff against each other and then take decisions, whether it\u2019s something like which college (or any) you want to go to, or even if you want to dye your hair hot pink. \u2026and finally Responsibility. As a 17 year old, you\u2019re at a threshold between adolescence and early adulthood, I\u2019ve seen plenty of 19, 20, 21 year old people who are just absolute messes because they have no sense of responsibility to themselves and the people around them. Perhaps this won\u2019t come across cultural differences but basically what I\u2019m trying to say is have a discipline to your life as you enter your early adulthood. This is the period where you\u2019re most vulnerable to go astray, have a vision for yourself, and strive towards that vision singularly. Understand yourself, associate with the right kind of people and learn to be responsible to others, but most importantly to yourself. Then ten years later, hopefully you\u2019ll be able to look back at your track record with positivity. ",

            "answer_text": "Sex Ed. This should be pretty self-explanatory but for those of you who were forced to go to religious schools like me or simply attend a school that doesnt tell you jackshit about how the hell to slip a condom on then this is for you. Consent. Oh lord I cannot stress this enough. I know so many people my age who have been in these situations, myself included, because they or someone they were with just didnt know or in most cases, ignored the rules regarding consent. Do not have sex with someone who says no or cannot physically give you consent over their body.If you\u2019re going to have sex, make sure to use a condom. This isn't just to stop you from becoming a teen mom (or dad) but also to prevent unwanted STD\u2019s and potential skin infections.Know where to get contraception. I\u2019m not sure about American high schools but here in the England, most high schools and colleges are obliged to provide free contraception at the nurses office or at the front desk. However, if you attend a catholic school then you\u2019ll need to find your \u201cmethods\u201d elsewhere at local walk-in centres or a place called \u201cConnect\u201d, a centre for young people found all over England.Cooking & Cleaning. I was lucky to be taught these skills as I was growing up, but so many young people out there dont even know how to something as simple as boiling an egg or ironing a shirt because their parents never ask for their help with household chores. Seriously it doesn't take long to watch a youtube video on how to cook something or ask for help with laundry. Your parents wont be able to mollycoddle you forever. Managing money. When I was 17, I used to spend my wages the day I got them on the most ridiculous stuff. One example of this is the time I spent \u00a380 on a kaneki costume I never even wore plus various other cosplay attire that probably added up to nearly \u00a3200 in total. Damn I wish I could go back and slap the hell out of my weeb ass for wasting so much money on pointless things. I get it, that new manga collection may look enticing but saving your leftover money will give you the opportunity to buy a new car, go on holiday with friends etc. You will definitely thank yourself in the long run. Time management. I think its pretty obvious what I\u2019m going to say here but I\u2019ll go ahead and say it anyway. If you have an exam within the next week, do not procrastinate to the point where you have no time left just because you know you\u2019ll pass. Honestly, the amount of times I didn't study because I knew I would manage to scrape through was awful. I took advantage of my natural intelligence instead of enhancing it to achieve higher grades and ended up leaving with a C in maths instead of the B I wanted. I know everyone is different so just remember this one thing, studying pays off. That should hopefully motivate you to study to the best of your ability. And lastly the most important one in my opinion. Always be honest. Now this can range from various different things from not wanting to continue a relationship, opening up to someone about mental issues etc. Yeah its hard breaking up with someone, but if you arent happy being in the relationship then get the hell out of there. As for mental issues, that's also a tough one and I do understand how it feels, but the longer you leave something like that the worst it gets so please do yourself a favour and see that therapist who hangs around school.
