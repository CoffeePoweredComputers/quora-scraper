            "answer_text": "Well, it depends on why it happened. And if everyone is depending on you and you can't give it back or share the responsibility with someone, then at least seek the advice of an adult you know, trust and feel safe with. It's a lot of pressure and burden, but that's also why your mom chose you, knowing you would make the right decision based on not just your own selfish wants or desires but the good of the group. If you could get them all to write down their advice or opinion and you could choose from among the best or a combination of them. Or if you dont even read them it will give them something to do while you can have a bit of time to be mindful, and be alone and possibly realize the answer. I guess those are three ways you can go about it, thers probably more ways, but I would tell them all you need peace calm quiet and not drama and chaos, to figure it all out. And the more they pressure you for an answer the harder it becomes. And if they want the best answer they must step back and give you space to find the answer. It is in you. When I need answer I go by myself, vape a bit of weed and the answer comes from deep within if I'm courageous to look. Best Regards. P. S. I'm not saying to do it that way i less you already do. That inner voice is what you need to hear, not everyone's inner child, but the inner u iversal conscience mind. It will always lead you the balanced way to go. It may not always be popular with everyone, but in the end its always the true guiding light you should follow. And vapung is not the only way to get there. You can meditate also. That's really what it is for me anyway. The vapung Mery relaxes me quickly into that state where I hear and see clearly. Best Regards ",

            "answer_text": "l am curious as to why or how you are the one responsible for so many. Did your father leave or pass away? Also you must be the oldest of your siblings or the most responsible or your mom wouldn't have placed it on you. That is a lot of responsible for anyone let alone a teenager. That is not fair to place all that on you, Specially when you yourself are still maturing and growing as a young man. Im sorry but its not your responsibility to raise and guide a family your not the parent here. Don't think you are letting everyone down by not having answers when you yourself are searching for answers for life. Listen lm not saying don't help your family or be there for them do all those things. A family needs to work together and help one another not place all the responsible on one person which is you in this case. Plus there needs to be an adult a parent doing this. lm sure the status of your mom either but either way l feel so much for your situation. l want to help more but l can see you need some outside assistance. There are resources like food, shelters, government assistance. The main thing is your still a minor so its not right for you to be forced to grow up so fast. If you need outside help seek a relative possibly to offer some assistance. Dont be afraid to ask someone for help relatives or whomever. ",
