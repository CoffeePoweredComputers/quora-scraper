            "answer_text": "Sure, if there is an objective reality independent of our conscious awareness. That is to say, a world which is indifferent to our specific awareness, and there are other awarenesses, not telecommuting from ours, or others, then there is an objective reality. If there is life, conditional life, then there are requirements, and there are things, with a nature, as opposed to random action. There is intelligibility. We know this. There are humans with a nature, so whilst there is a context in which humans act, and make choices, there is still an immutable nature that in some shape frames people\u2019s lives. i.e. Not having wings doesn\u2019t mean humans are defined by \u2018no wings\u2019, but it is a constraint. Overcome by application of thinking. So we fly. What ideology serves as the most life-affirming\u2019. In my estimate, it is Ayn Rand\u2019s Objectivism, up until the point where she betrays it, by recommending in politics, minarchism, as opposed to personal sovereignty. i.e. Anarcho-objectivism. ",

Objects cannot have ideas; only subjects can, and best is a matter of personal taste or judgment. Nature does not award trophies or gold stars. ",
