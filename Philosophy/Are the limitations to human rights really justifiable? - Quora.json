            "answer_text": "Nope. When I was growing up, my father said to me more than once \u201cyou have many rights in this country, and they all end at the tip of my nose.\u201d It means that here in the United States, there are many wonderful freedoms we have that are not at all guaranteed in any other nation on earth. As the metaphor goes, I have the right to swing my fists in all directions as I walk down the street and no one can say or do anything to stop me \u2014 until my fist connects with another person's nose (or any other body part). At that instant, my rights have directly collided with their rights, and now we have a problem. Human rights are those rights that cannot (or should not) be infringed in any way without Due Process by a Jury of one's peers. The State has no business interfering with those rights in any way, shape or form unless and until an individual has demonstrated that their exercise of their freedom has in some way interfered with another person and the State can prove it.

            "answer_text": "The current limitations to human rights are justifiable (justifiable in philosophy means that it is coherent with the other knowledge of a particular world conception) because the agreements that are made between rational persons, which are the actual \u2018being\u2019 of \u2018human rights\u2019, (which necessarily imply human obligations) are limited, to the extent that the possible potential, such agreements, have not all been made yet.
