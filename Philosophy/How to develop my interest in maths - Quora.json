            "answer_text": "This question is gonna be my one of the favorite :) Do you know all my life i had one fear in me that is of mathematics. My parents and relatives wherever i go, everyone used to say me mathematics is extremely tough subject. And from the fourth - fifth class i believed that yes i can't do mathematics and i will fail in this subject. As i grew this fear keeps on increasing because whenever i face this subject either i skip the classes or i used to cheat. You won't believe i used to by heart almost every questions and their answers including all the steps and write exactly in the exams, this is how i used to get passing marks in mathematics till my class 10th. It was my belief that i can do any subject, i can by heart any book you give me but i can't do mathematics. And because of that i thought i can't fight government exams because every exam include some maths in it. One fine day i started to fight against my false belief and start questioning myself why can't i? Is there anytime in my life i had given one single try to understand mathematics? Answer was no. That day itself i decided i don't want to do anything but destroy that belief and i did. It was really hard for me when i faced mathematics after these many years, i bought RS aggarwal book and start solving it, i was again doing the same mistake which i was used to do in school that is seeing answers and copying them in solution just to satisfy i had done this, then i asked myself this is how you are going to improve? I keep on solving without seeing solution, and start getting something that feeling was really awesome. You won't believe i solved percentage chapter for one and half month continously , and after sometime i realized i was able to make my own so called tricks and shortcuts. Mathematics is as transparent as water, it's just that you have to practice it without fail till you don't get right answer. Just have some patience and don't see solution try 100 times for the single problem if you have to, you will surely get everything you want just believe in yourself and start practicing. Never be ashamed of asking problems to your teachers, not matter how small the problem is just ask it. Don't do the same mistake which i had done in my school time. Best of luck :) ",

            "answer_text": "First and foremost, mathematics is interesting all by itself. Check out some YouTube videos from Numberphile and VSauce. I think those will give you interesting things to think about. The importance of maths: Everything you use came about because we have maths. Phones, computers, cars, etc. But honestly, that\u2019s the boring stuff. Being reasonably skilled in mathematics opens up a lot of interesting things. Engineers, physicists, chemists, biologists: They all have one thing in common. They\u2019re reasonably good at math (at least computations). I think the most important thing about math though, is that it teaches you discipline and critical thinking skills. There are multiple studies that suggest that practicing math makes you \u201csmarter\u201d, because it sharpens your mind and helps you be more analytic. To develop the skills, simply do it. Start with numbers. Add, subtract, divide, multiply. Do them in your head, too! Once you\u2019ve mastered arithmetic (make sure you read a little about set theory too), you can learn about Geometry and Algebra. Once you\u2019ve mastered these things, you can learn Calculus. Calculus is about as far as the careers above I mentioned will go (There is some linear algebra dabbled in as well). You can certainly go well beyond Calculus, as everything up to this point is largely computational mathematics. To get to the good stuff, you\u2019ve got to go farther. Beyond Calculus lies things like abstract algebra, real analysis, number theory, set theory, complex analysis, combinatorics, graph theory, algebraic geometry, applied mathematics, etc. The list goes on for quite a while, but gets a little less broad the farther you venture into more specialized areas. Think of mathematics like a spiral of knowledge. The really good stuff is on the inside, but to get there, you\u2019ve got to ride the spiral down to the center. On your way down, you\u2019ll learn all the basics. The more you ask \u201cWhy\u201d and find answers to those questions, the more you\u2019ll learn and love mathematics. It\u2019s really quite beautiful. ",
