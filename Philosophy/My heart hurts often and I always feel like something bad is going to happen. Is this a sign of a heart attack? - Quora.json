            "answer_text": "As others have told you, this is NOT something for internet advice. Go see a physician. You did NOT describe how you know it is your \u201cheart\u201d that hurts. Chest pain can be caused by all sorts of body parts and actions besides the heart. For example, I have a condition called \u201cCostal Chondritis\u201d (or \u201cIntercostal Chondritis\u201d). Inflammation of the cartilage between my ribs. Depending on the weather, it can be VERY painful and, YES, in my CHEST. Particularly terrifying for someone who has had a heart attack until I learned to differentiate this pain! BTW, until I learned (with the help of my cardiologist), this pain often threw me into PANIC ATTACKS. Panic attacks can feel JUST LIKE a heart attack, too! Sometimes, you can feel the movement of gas in your intestines in your CHEST. Sometimes, gall bladder pain can be felt in your CHEST. There are numerous other possibilities. The feeling that something bad is going to happen is simply anxiety. There are all sorts of ways to address this issue with and WITHOUT drugs. YOU CANNOT DIFFERENTIATE ON YOUR OWN initially. You NEED a physician or cardiologist to check out your heart and other causes of the pain! ",
