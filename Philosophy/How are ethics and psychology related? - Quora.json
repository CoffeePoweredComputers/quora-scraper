            "answer_text": "You ask: \u201cHow are ethics and psychology related?\u201d As a layperson with an interest in the applications of both fields of knowledge, I suggest that the two fields are related in that both examine the actions of an individual in the context of other actions and patterns of action and motivation of the individual. They differ in that psychology examines the relationship of those actions to the actor (considering specific components, character traits, or the whole person), while ethics examines those actions in the context of phenomena external to the actor (e.g., community, society, or an abstract system).

            "answer_text": "In both cases the students are examining the human mind and attempting to assist it developing practical heuristics in the face of novel situations. In both cases they often develop artificial situations, designed to illuminate the under-workings of human motivations and drives. In both cases they attempt to answer the question of what is right and wrong in a given situation. As to differences, after decades of studying both, I would have to say that ethics tends to the abstract, e.g. mind experiments whereas psychology often does actual experiments on real people and even does lab work. I wouldn\u2019t say that this makes psychology better or worse. There are many situations that ethics considers that you would dare try as an experiment on real humans. I would have say that psychology is also much more diverse in its interests than I have found ethics to be. That is something that I deplore and am actively working to rectify. ",
