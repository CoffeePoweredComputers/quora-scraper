            "answer_text": "Philosophy can only be learned by doing it. Even learning \u201cabout\u201d philosophy has to be done by doing it, or at least seeing what it\u2019s like to do it. One problem, though, is that there are many ways to do philosophy. All have in common that they question assumptions about things we think we know, exposing those assumptions to be flawed, half-baked, or at least in need of more thinking and refinement. It\u2019s very hard to show how this happens, but let me give you some suggestions. One of the oldest pieces of philosophy in action is in \u201cEuthypro,\u201d written by Plato about a conversation between his teacher Socrates and someone named Euthyphro. They meet outside a law court. Socrates is about to be tried for impiety \u2013 he is said to disrespect the gods \u2013 while Euthyphro is about to prosecute his father. Socrates expresses surprise, and Euthyphro tells him that it\u2019s the pious thing to do. Socrates says, that\u2019s wonderful, I\u2019m about to be prosecuted for impiety, so given that you know what it is tell me! Euthyphro gives a definition. Socrates says, thank you thank you that\u2019s wonderful I now know how to defend myself \u2026 but \u2026 there\u2019s something a little fishy in the definition. And Socrates points out something about the definition that is pretty clearly false if you stop to think about it. Euthyphro says, easily fixable, and offers another definition, which Socrates then shows is better, but also flawed. And so on. That\u2019s how the dialogue goes. Each time the definition gets better, but there\u2019s something amiss. At the end, they still don\u2019t agree on a definition, and Euthyphro goes off to try his father. To a reader this is frustrating. It sure looks like Socrates and Euthyphro have failed in their philosophical quest. But that\u2019s not so. They have done something incredibly positive \u2013 they have seen what an adequate definition would look like. That\u2019s philosophy at work \u2013 questioning what we think we know. Isn\u2019t the value of doing that questioning \u2014 again and again, in different areas \u2014 obvious? Otherwise we\u2019re just stuck with what our parents or peers have told us. Such questioning frees us from preconceptions. Philosophy is actually \u2026 liberating. But let me give you some other things you can read that show philosophy at work. These things are more current, and about more modern topics, so you might like them better. One is Thomas Kuhn\u2019s Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Science looks like it\u2019s a matter of piling up more and more information about the world, right? Kuhn shows that that\u2019s not so \u2013 most importantly, it has a structure that sometimes radically changes. These radical changes are usually covered up so that they are invisible to new practitioners. This book is easy to read and \u2013 unlike a lot of philosophy books \u2013 has many clear and understandable examples. Another piece of philosophy that will probably startle you is Iris Young\u2019s essay \u201cThrowing Like a Girl: a Phenomenology of Female Body Comportment, Motility, and Spatiality.\u201d You can easily find this online. It\u2019s about the differences between the ways males and females move their bodies, and how and why this came about. Of course, Young\u2019s article ends up being about much, much more than bodily movement, but also about cultural assumptions and norms that affect it. You might also try Learning From My Daughter: the Value and Care of Disabled Minds, by my former colleague Eva Kittay. Each of these, in different ways, is an accessible illustration of philosophy at work, engaged with a specific topic. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot of the popular writing about philosophy is not high quality, including some rather lucid books by Bertrand Russell, who was a famous philosopher. These low-quality books are published every year (although they are improving). It would be best to immerse yourself in the best stuff first, so that you have a standard to uphold later on when you try to do work in the subject. The best introduction I have found to the whole field of philosophy is Baggini and Fosl's The Philosopher's Toolkit, which has content on many, perhaps all major categories native to philosophy, such as how to argue, traditional debates, fallacies, metaphysics, ethics, etc. Amazon.com: The Philosopher's Toolkit: A Compendium of Philosophical Concepts and Methods (9781405190183): Julian Baggini, Peter S. Fosl: Books Here are some other books that are especially good:  The Dimensional Philosopher's Toolkit (which is a different book) I wrote in 2012 - 2013, and it gives rare glimpses of objective knowledge via the new theory of axiometry: The Dimensional Philosopher's Toolkit: or, The Essential Criticism; The Dimensional Encyclopedia, First Volume: Nathan Coppedge: 9781481704571: Amazon.com: Books  Philosophical Writings by Novalis is one of the best books of philosophical aphorisms. Amazon.com: Novalis: Philosophical Writings (9780791432723): Novalis, Margaret Mahony Stoljar: Books Likewise for Lichtenberg's The Waste Books (surprisingly) The Waste Books (New York Review Books Classics): Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, R.J. Hollingdale: 9780940322509: Amazon.com: Books , and Canetti's The Secret Heart of the Clock. Amazon.com: The Secret Heart of the Clock: Notes, Aphorisms, Fragments, 1973-1985 (9780374256944): Elias Canetti, Joel Agee: Books These books are often under-studied because they are considered difficult to interpret (Canetti is a Nobel Prize winner). Basically, however, these figures are brilliant and it is a pity they are not included in the curriculum out of their sheer capacity to teach original thinking. If any of these three books is ignored, it is because of blindness. Metametaphysics by David Chalmers and David Manley Amazon.com: Metametaphysics: New Essays on the Foundations of Ontology (9780199546008): David Chalmers, David Manley, Ryan Wasserman: Books this gives you a sense of where metaphysics is now for real philosophers. It may be hard to grasp for beginners, but is easier to understand than Immanuel Kant. A more introductory text is Palmer's Does the Center Hold: An Introduction to Western Philosophy. It has a theme of covering major debates in depth in a relatively approachable way, but the cartoons are annoying in my opinion. Amazon.com: Does the Center Hold? An Introduction to Western Philosophy (9780078038372): Donald Palmer: Books If you are desperate for examples of philosophical genius throughout Western history, go to: Welcome | Philosophy Ideas Database . It is rather intimidating. The ideas are hard to find anywhere else. On the softer side, I recommend my webpage on Systems Theory, although I admit my father who has a PhD. found it difficult to interpret. At least it is available for free: Systems Theory (Formal-, applied-, rubric-, etc.) More recently I've started a series of systems designed to be coherent, on Quora: Nathan Coppedge's post in Nathan Coppedge Blog It will eventually be available as a book.
