            "answer_text": "There's no way of absolutely proving assertions about this, so I can only say what I think .... There's no clear reason why we could not be completely insentient machines, that do all the processing we do, but never feel anything. A digital computer, no matter how complex, has no need of emotions to do what it does, nor could an inner sense of emotion or free will possibly influence the operation of the machine. With the brain, it's a different situation. To predict what a brain is going to do next, we'd have to get into quantum mechanics. There, we'd run up against not only the Uncertainty Principle, but the Measurement Problem also. To cut it short, we don't really understand fully the ultimate nature of matter. To a large extent, our perception of matter is something we create ourselves; what there is of it \"out there\", is unclear. So I think that at least \"consciousness\" has to be taken to be some kind of primary aspect of the universe, which we would never have predicted if we weren't conscious ourselves. It isn't material; but it appears to be tightly correlated with the operations of our brains, as far as we can observe.  Whether that means that consciousness in some sort of form can exist without a brain at all, I don't know. Our memories and all of our human characteristics seem to be tied to the brain; but where this consciousness comes from, why we perceive it to be associated with brains, and whether it exists before or after we die, in some form, to me is unclear. I think Plato and Descartes were right, except that both had unsustainable theories on the matter; especially Descartes. (But even this seems a little unclear to me, when I read their writings -- neither of them are completely clear, in a scientific way, about what exactly they mean).  It's not that consciousness is a separate thing that grabs hold of our brains and makes them do what they do. It's more like consciousness is a thing that, along with experiencing emotion, also creates an experience of the physical world. Why it does this, or how, is unclear at the moment. These are really speculations; I think a definite, falsifiable solution to the Measurement Problem in quantum mechanics might get us closer to the answer. There's a great bit in Descartes' Discourse on Method where he jumps from saying \"I think, therefore I am\" to asserting that the physical world must be \"real\", because God would not deceive us. We're still wrestling with the best way to make that jump, without invoking God and avoiding having to figure out the details. Modern materialism makes a similar jump, asserting that only things that we can observe in the physical world are \"real\", because that's how it is. But we also observe that we have emotions, and materialist interpretations of this fact always end up being unprovable and untestable. ",

            "answer_text": "I would question all those answers which imply that mind is a function of a brain. It's like saying that software is a function of a microchip (some would argue that it is technically). It's vice versa, because hardware is just a tool - means for software to function. Can we say software is material thing? We can't hold it, but we know it's there, we see something on computer screen. How do we know? Through mind which is reflected in consciousness. Without consciousness there is no cognition. Mind is not of the physical realm. All those attempts to find mind in the brain are futile. It's like debugging software with oscilloscope. We know it's there but we are using wrong tools. Mind is subjective so we can't use objective tools to explore subjective realm. That's the root of the problem, current scientific objective approach which is unusable for primary phenomenon, which are subjective. So, current scientific dogma of objective materialism will tell you that mind is product of the brain and thus it is somehow physical. By looking for yourself you will see that there is only subjectivity. Nobody has seen objective world. Never. All measurements are just better eyes and ears and senses. All we peceive and  see is in consciousness. It's primary. What we take for granted, that there is objective reality out there is just a theory, dogma, like belief in god. Nobody has seen it, but many believe in him. Like belief in objective material world. Nobody has ever seen it, but most believe it exists. ",
