            "answer_text": "As Erik Anson says, there are baryonic resonances that contain three up quarks and also ones that have three down quarks. These particles are unstable to strong interactions and decay with a lifetime of10\u221223seconds.10\u221223seconds. The reason why these particles are so unstable is that they are a baryon is made up of three fermions. The wave function for the quarks must be totally antisymmetric, meaning that if you exchange any two quarks, you get a minus 1.  |\u03c8\u27e9=Tabc\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3tijk|qa\u03b1i\u27e9|qb\u03b2j\u27e9|qc\u03b3k\u27e9|\u03c8\u27e9=Tabc\u03c4\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3tijk|qa\u03b1i\u27e9|qb\u03b2j\u27e9|qc\u03b3k\u27e9 where a,b,ca,b,c run over the quark color, \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 run over the quark flavor indices, and i,j,ki,j,k run over spin.  Color indices have to be totally antisymmetric in order for the baryon to be color neutral. Thus in order for the baryon's quark wave function to be totally antisymmetric,  the spin and flavor have to be totally symmetric. When all the flavors of the quarks are the same, the flavor wave function is totally symmetric. So, thus, the spin wave function needs to be totally symmetric -- which means that there is a state where all three quark's spin point in the same direction, resulting in a spin 3/2 state.  So the states involving three up quarks or three down quarks are spin 3/2 particles and are called\u0394++\u0394++ for the three up quark state and a \u0394\u2212\u0394\u2212 for the three down quark state.  Having spin 3/2 means the chromomagnetic spin-spin interaction between the quarks results in additional interaction energy proportional to the spin squared, resulting in the spin 3/2 state being heavier than the spin 1/2 state.   It's possible to calculate (easily) from first principle how much additional energy this results, in, but it results in the \u0394++\u0394++ mass (and \u0394\u2212\u0394\u2212 mass) being 1230 MeV, compared with the proton mass of 938 MeV.  The key thing about the mass difference is that it is greater than the pion mass meaning that the decay mode \u0394++\u2192p+\u03c0+\u0394++\u2192p+\u03c0+ and similarly  \u0394\u2212\u2192n+\u03c0\u2212\u0394\u2212\u2192n+\u03c0\u2212 are kinematically allowed and the decay rate is proportional to the energy released \u0393\u223cm\u0394++\u2212mp\u2212m\u03c0+\u223c150\u00a0MeV\u223c10\u221223\u00a0seconds\u0393\u223cm\u0394++\u2212mp\u2212m\u03c0+\u223c150\u00a0MeV\u223c10\u221223\u00a0seconds Thus while these resonances exist, they don't exist as long-lived states.

Quarks are the constituents of composite particles labeled as hadrons - the proton and neutron are prime examples. A baryon composed of three up quarks is known as the delta particle - denoted as \u0394++ . The two positive signs indicate two units of positive charge (since one up quark has a fractional charge of +2/3). The \u0394++ has a mass of ~ 1232 MeV/c^2. It is unstable, with a mean life time of ~ 5.63 x 10^-24 sec, and usually decays into a proton and a positive pion. (See Delta baryon  for more details). ",
