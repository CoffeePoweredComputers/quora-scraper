            "answer_text": "We need freedom of speech because of the shortsightedness of people who think they know which religion deserves protection from criticism, people who think that their God is so petty that he destroys whole cities for challenging him, as though he's a big dumb alpha gorilla and not an infinite wellspring of light and mercy and invincibility.  So here in full below is my reply to such people, which I hope can hereby serve also as a public revelation of a different god and creed than theirs, a god who cannot be \"respected\" with blasphemy laws, who is in fact blasphemed by such laws as those to which such people would yoke us all: \"Hahahahaha. Oh Inquisitor.  You are a profoundly arrogant man who thinks he speaks for God.  And who thinks he knows which calamities are the will of God!  Oh my.  You don't deserve the hospitality this community shows you!  Because you do not reciprocate that hospitality! You are allowed here to say things that offend others deeply and then demand that your feelings be cradled like a fetus, because you cleverly call what you love \"God\".  Well my god is Truth, and nobody gets to claim my god's favor, for that itself is blasphemy to the god of Truth.  Truth favors no human being.  None.   My creed is simple: There is no god but Truth, and anyone can be his prophet, if they but speak freely, and ask freely, and listen freely, and change their mind freely!   \"And you, Inquisitor, you dare blaspheme my god with your saying nobody has spoken for Truth in centuries!  As though Truth ran out of things to say after Jesus or Paul or Mohammed died!  As though Truth could fit in a book small enough to be memorized by a single human being!   \"For that insult to Truth, you deserve the same punishment that you would heap on blasphemers of your little shadow. No?  \"Doesn't feel too good, does it?  So please, climb down off your tiny horse and rejoin us.  Welcome to the world where your god isn't the only one!  And where blasphemy doesn't mean whatever you say it does!  You might come to like it, when you realize it's a world where I don't get to throw you in jail the moment I decide you've offended my god.  Pretty cool perk, huh?  Do you like not being in jail right now?  Or would you like us to write up some blasphemy laws?\" I hope that this revelation of al-Haqq is useful to someone reading this.  :)  Especially the would-be Inquisitors.  May the Truth hound them and court them and hurt them and finally cheer them and make them laugh. ",

            "answer_text": "What is freedom of speech for? There are numerous ways to interpret history. One way to see the evolution of our species, not by examining wars, but by correlating human discovery and invention with our ability to communicate unrestricted by geography or time. When we were hunters and gatherers we could communicate verbally and locally. During this stage progress was close to stagnant. The invention of writing then the printing press provided the ground for the reformation age of enlightenment. Then, of course, telegraph, radio, and TV changed reality for most of us. The innovation we call the internet gave us even greater ability to develop what Carl Jung would call the \u2018Universal consciousness\u2019. However, without freedom of speech we would only have the ability to communicate what the current bureaucracy approves. We would be without Galileo and Martin Luther. The list of people who were persecuted for advancing humanity is quite long. It was the bureaucrat\u2019s inability to suppress free speech which allowed the work of these people to be integrated into our universal being. Free speech is absolutely necessary for the human spirit to advance. ",

            "answer_text": "Freedom of speech is important. It's not a licence to be a douchebag. Particularly in these difficult times of 2020 the value of freedom of speech is paramount, but speech is just speech. It's a fine line to suggest that the actions we do are a form of free speech. We must be able to express our thoughts in the language we feel most comfortable speaking without threat of persecution. We need to be careful though, because what we say can have an impact upon our reputation. Protesters have been restricted from gathering during these recent times, so would we consider that a violation of freedom of speech? Perhaps, but more concisely I would consider it a violation of freedom of movement and freedom of peaceful enjoyment of our environment which are concepts that seem to get lost whenever the freedom of speech brigade bark up. We also need to be respectful that not everything we should feel free to say is appropriate in every forum. The USA, the country that most vigorously defends freedom of speech has some of the most restrictive censorship in some forums, like the broadcast industry and least restrictive in others, like the cinema. Some things are just far too contemptuous to accept as free speech. I don't object to some nations outlawing Nazi symbols, for example. The broadcast industry has produced some of the best content ever made, but in this age of digital free to air television there are high profile channels and low profile channels provided by each broadcaster. If the broadcasting sector is completely censored from expressing itself their content output would skew towards being lame is what I would say. It should be more about spaces where parents and consumers of the services are aware of what to expect. Freedom of speech is important but it's not the silver bullet argument that protects our right to protest, which is more accurately the fundamental idea behind the free speech concept. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a vile bigoted narcissist who probably broke laws to take control of our country:  OK, wait. Do you hear the jackboots kicking down my door? Me neither. Without freedom of speech, we have nothing at all. It is more important to me than all of the other freedoms combined. Go ahead and remove my right to assemble, burn down all the churches, take my guns, quarter soldiers in my home, search me without a warrant, throw me in jail without a trial, or make that trial really slow, or with no jury, then hang me by my toenails after no trial, and then have absolutely no demarcation between state and local powers and just make new laws however you like. You know, throw out the whole Bill of Rights. Because speech is the foundation for all of these other rights. Today, in America, children are being detained away from their parents, despite the fact that the children have committed no crimes and their parents might be guilty of a misdemeanor, in some cases. That\u2019s pretty horrible. And it\u2019s entirely the fault of the syphillitic rapist in an ill-fitting suit up there. Wait\u2026nope, no stormtroopers. But we got rid of that policy of throwing toddlers into baby jail because we have the freedom of speech. And when it comes time to elect a new leader, (hopefully) someone who isn\u2019t an awful, sexist, steaming pile of elephant feces with butterscotch frosting, the person who replaces him will be allowed by that freedom of speech to mention all of the thing her opponent did.

            "answer_text": "I love reading Dave Consiglio and he keeps me entertained with his post . But let\u2019s talk freedom of speech. I dont care whether Donald Trump goes home and goes masochistic on Melania Trump with a plunger. I get cross when any group is being tarred with a brush of criminality just for being foreign. But the sheer fact that I can say that sentence .. suggests i\u2019m working in an environment where free speech is still king. Dave calls Trump a vile bigoted narcissist? Guess what .. in a free society .. HE CAN ! Never get worried about people who grumble and stick it in public. If they can do that .. they still have their freedom to do so. It\u2019s when they cant possibly do that \u2018for fear to offend\u2019 that you should be worried. Offense in a free society is something that comes with both confrontation and attitudes and allows people to explore, discuss, negotiate and compromise on situations. Not allowed to get offended? Not allowed to solve a problem = no progress.  I should remind people who are worried about detentions at the border is that in having a series of free-for-all situations demeands the value of American citizenship. In the same phrase that people put a value on American citizenship and its \u2018privelege\u2019 they fail to realise that the safety, responsibility and liberty that was fought for over many seperate occasions created a value on American citizenship that in itself makes it a prized asset. A refugee is not a criminal. Myself I am only 2 generations from a very lucky situation where my grandmother and her sister got saved by a kind uncle who stumped up 2000 pounds assurity to guarantee that they wouldnt be a burden on England\u2019s fine shores. My great aunt ended up working as a lousy cleaner (she wasnt trained and she was no good) for people who basically took care of her despite her fallibilities. My father grew up with memories of living in a dark Victorian house with an orange box as furniture. He had a real hate for Victorian houses.  I get cross when I look over the oceans to European lands and see avenues where both legitimate complaint and deprecation of local issues is being done under the banner of \u2018welcoming refugees\u2019 and turning locals into criminals and \u2018right-wingers\u2019 for the idea of speaking out. You want to know why the world is getting mad and supposedly \u2018right wing\u2019 ? Because in their own countries they are being told not only to f^&k off, but more importantly to keep silent as chaos and lack of security erupts around them. Citizenry and nationality was done on most occasions to ensure that the groups who remained within the societies had safety and security within those borders. Without the right to speak up on key issues, and more importantly being silenced because these issues are being raised .. promotes people moving to situations where they will vote for people who will at least allocate their collective voice. As I stated when a previous president was elected to protests. \u2018I\u2019m not worried about the protests .. thats healthy .. i\u2019m worried about the oncoming silence\u2019 Enjoy your freedoms for speech .. because losing it is the first effort towards self imprisonment within your own societies .. and that turns nice places into places with one set opinion, one set of talking points and framework = hellholes.

Democrats are proving to be anti-free speech at University & College campuses. They use hecklers veto and physically obstruct people from attending free speech events. This is an obvious authoritarian mindset. There are 1000\u2019s of examples of this on the web, it\u2019s that easy to find. For example, Google: SJW free speech college .. You\u2019ll get tons & tons & tons of hits citing examples. If the DNC cared about free speech, they\u2019d condemn this behavior and get their supporters under control, but they don\u2019t give a damn.Social media like Twitter, Facebook & Youtube are run by leftists & Democrats. Every CEO of these social media companies support Democrats. How do they run their social media platform? Extreme anti-free speech rules. A lot of right wing people are getting their accounts banned and their voice silenced on these platforms. These platforms have hate speech rules. Hate speech rules & laws are bad, I explain why below.Democrats allies are progressives from UK & Canada. Both UK & Canada are plagued with progressives which has led to the removal of free speech in these countries. There are hate speech laws in the UK & Canada. There are also hate speech rules across social media. What is wrong with hate speech rules/laws? In theory it sounds good, but in reality it\u2019s abused by one group to silence opposing groups with valid criticisms: Whoever supports more free speech is who I vote for. I judge a political parties free speech stance based upon the actions and behaviors of their supporters. Too many Democrats are anti-free speech and I could not support that. ",

            "answer_text": "For any writer, freedom of speech is paramount. But is it really desirable across the board? The problem is, with freedom comes responsibility. Let us examine a few examples\u2026 A racist gets up on a soap-box in a predominantly immigrant neighbourhood and begins a diatribe of racist philosophising. Now in an ideal World he would be ignored, laughed at, or invited to stick his head up his arse. But we do not LIVE in an ideal World \u2013 and the PRACTICAL result of allowing him his freedom of speech would likely be mayhem, during which property and PEOPLE could be seriously DAMAGED. Or a film director creates a work portraying some atrocity or other, to make a point about The Human Condition. Intelligent people view the work and absorb its message \u2013 but one NUT who is unable to separate fantasy from reality goes and COMMITS the atrocity. You see the problem. Individual freedom is fine \u2013 so long as it does not interfere with someone ELSE\u2019S freedom. If I want to play my stereo LOUDLY, that\u2019s great \u2013 unless my neighbour is trying to sleep. Ideally, one should be free to buy dynamite. But the REALITY of allowing such freedom would be that NO-ONE would be SAFE. Only an IDIOT would sanction the over-the-counter sale of dynamite. That would be like allowing ordinary people to buy GUNS. Wouldn\u2019t it? N.R.A. ",

            "answer_text": "The immediate pro should be self evident. Freedom of speech doesn't merely mean, \"you can say what you want.\" It means \"you can say what you want without fear of aggression or violence.\" Too often the implied part is overlooked. So the first pro is anyone has the freedom to say anything without fear of aggression. Running through this definition may seem irrelevant but this is important to mention because restraining unjustified aggression is really the only reason one should need to accept this bit of moral technology as valid and valuable.  The benefit to the individual to be treated fairly (after all it wouldn't be fair to return violence to words) is the important moral benefit. Freedom of speech is not merely the means to greater ends for society, it is the end in and of itself. Freedom of speech does however have side benefits. The main one that I can think of is the advancement of dialogue. When people are in dialogue they're at times disagreeing with each other, their biases and prejudices are challenged and the end result is those that are willing inevitably correct errors in their thinking and learn new things. Just as scientific journals coordinate knowledge, free and open dialogue too helps society produce accurate models of the world. Free speech also allows people to find and associate with people or organizations they agree with and want to learn from. It also allows people to identify those people, organizations and mentalities they wish to avoid. Free speech also regulates itself. Can you imagine what a mess the government would have on its hands if it had to regulate speech? Companies have PR departments for a reason so they don't say anything that casts them in a bad light. If everyone has free speech everyone has the ability to ridicule and make life difficult for those the public deems as racist or bigots. Think of the harsh mass reactions to things said on twitter. Entire careers have been unjustly ended by the twitter mob. That may seem like over regulation, but consider this: we only have that term because people used their freedom of speech to criticize the twitter mob superiority complex. Its not perfect but like so many systems free of unjustified aggression, its regulation processes are self-correcting. I'm sure the list could go on and on, but the other very important pro that comes to mind is that free speech serves as a check on political power. Having said all this, freedom of speech is necessarily an end in and of itself, not merely a means to an end because free speech is a hard won moral technology. ",

            "answer_text": "Freedom of speech needs to have the smallest of limitations. It needs to go hand in hand with all other law on the same issue: Crime. One should not be able to use ones speech to commit crimes. Threatening people with physical or mental violence, severely disturbing people physically with ones speech(not from a far), hailing violent crimes, make plans for crime and encourage violence. All non-violent and non-criminal speech MUST be allowed. The border between criminal and non-criminal hate-speech goes where I say: I hate white people and I hate white people and I want to do something about it. (I am white and its ok to be white, so dont worry) Hating or disliking or discriminating is ok, but when you go from your emotions to action against those who you hate, it needs to be clarified what action you seek. If its mental or physical violence, your speech is criminal. This subject is huge, but actually easy to understand for a rational person. Its just a little hard to be precise in general, so one has to use examples to really chew the different situations. Freedom of speech is EXTREMELY important. For me the four primary human rights are: The right to life, the right to voluntary exchange(so you can eat/clothe yourself), the right to arm yourself and freedom of speech, so you can address immoral behaviour or errors of thought. Once you are alive, fed and armed to protect yourself, I can see no other right come before freedom of speech. Freedom of speech means is the basis for freedom of thought, because without speech/books/thinking/philosophy/teaching, you can not think properly and there is no moving forward practically or ethically.

            "answer_text": "Free expression is the cornerstone of Freedom. You\u2019re not actually free if you can\u2019t express yourself freely. To understand this, you first have to grasp one thing which we all know but often don\u2019t understand. There is no absolute truth. There is always your truth and my truth. But we cannot create a society based on subjective truths. The Law is the wheel on which the society runs, governments functions and chaos is kept at bay. If we do not allow people of every single opinion to express themselves without prosecution, then there is no way we can create a system which is fair to everyone. I may not get my way in everything but I should at least have the right to make people see things my way. Some will see it some will not. I still might not get my way. But the important thing is that I got to try. No one can make a 100 % unbiased judgement. We judge things based on our world view. No one thought that women deserved the right to vote before feminists pointed it out. The value systems, the sensibilities all deterred them from seeing something so logical that today it seems like the most natural state of things. People at that time started to see things only when someone decided to voice an opinion out of the mainstream thought i.e. an unpopular opinion. I am not saying that every dissenting voice is constructive. There will always be some people who will make noise just for the sake of it. But we have no way of objectively judge whether the dissenter is a visionary or an idiot. The only way too find out is to let him speak. ",

The police response was not that they are liars, but that I was some sort of dubious diabolical genius of the 007 Bond type with a 180 IQ. (I got a chuckle out of that one and so did the jury). So how important is the first amendment? Well there is a reason our founding fathers made it the very FIRST amendant. If you don't have the freedom to speak your mind then no one will be able to improve the many defects in our government because they will not be allowed to talk about it. Just the act of crying out of despair for the want of a better government will be cause to arrest you were it not for freedom of speech. ",

Your freedom ends where that of someone else's rights begins.Claiming that you have the right to blaspheme in the name of freedom of speech is putting yourself above others and spitting on them from your pedestal: that is arrogant, ignorant, vulgar, uncivilized and savage.

But we shouldn\u2019t be cracking down on critics who have legitimate criticisms or people who say things we don\u2019t want to hear. Freedom of speech allows us to express how we feel and not be legally prosecuted just because we said something. So if I didn\u2019t like a restaurant\u2019s food, I am able to say it\u2019s terrible and not be arrested for it (just an example, I rarely say that). Imagine what would happen if we knew we needed to criticize an action to show that it\u2019s wrong, but we can\u2019t? Every time we did, the people in power would silence it. That\u2019s not a recipe for success. You need dissenting opinions because\u2026and this sucks to say\u2026no one is ever 100% right. We need the voices of others to improve and grow. Yes, there are always opinions you can safely ignore (ie. racism, prejudiced comments, false information) but you shouldn\u2019t try to silence people just because they have a point. Perfection may be impossible to achieve, but better results are achieved when people can freely voice their opinion and possibly plant the seeds for change. ",

            "answer_text": "Freedom of speech is the inalienable right of all humans to make their beliefs and political preferences and ideas known. It overarches all other rights except the right to LIFE. Here in the USA it is widely cherished as a core principle of our Constitutional Republic system of government. It includes the vocal, written, pictoral, and displayed opinions and beliefs. When those freedoms are in any way curtailed (except for the classic example of yelling \u201cfire\u201d in a full theater WHEN THERE IS NO FIRE) then eventually those individual beliefs and ideas are suppressed. THAT is the reason why impinging on another\u2019s right to speak their beliefs and ideas should never be tolerated. If one\u2019s \u201cFirst Amendment\u201d right to free expression is curtailed, then eventually that person\u2019s voice is silenced. That is a key concept of totalitarian and authoritarian political theories. If dissent is silenced, whether through criminal convictions or through destruction of communication means and methods, it sets the stage for deprivation of further rights. THAT is why some believe the Second Amendment, the right of the people to \u201ckeep and bear arms\u201d IS the Second Amendment\u2014because if the First is impinged upon or limited, the Second will at least help to prevent the voiceless from also being defenseless.

Freedom of speech allows you to point on that. You are allowed to say \"Hei, there is something wrong which needs to be changed.\" and no one has the right to punish you for saying that.  I don't know the reason why you ask but I would like to add a discussable example: Charlie Hebdo. A magazin pointing to problems in society, politics and religion by creating caricatures. A caricature is a way to point on things. It wants to provoke people to think about problems. It also wants to provoke people to think about behaviours which are seen as wrong by others. Is this allowed? YES! And it is important to have people pointing to problems. I know that this statement can be a start of a long and emotional discussion, but thing about the following: Everyone is allowed and has the opportunity to state his/her arguments for or against something. Also regarding this statement. You are allowed to do that. You will not be punished to have a different point of view. Isn't it great? What if you would be arrested if you don't agree?  Freedom of speach is something with a very high value. It helps us to change our society into something good by pointing on problems without fear. ",

            "answer_text": "One of the most fundamental things that needs to be protected. There are a lot of things in this world that is hard, unfair, and just plain inconvenient. These things tend to be quite a sensitive issues. You can see tons of negative comments and takedowns of answers regarding topics like LGBTQ+, gender equality, developmental disorders, ethnic minorities, etc. that dares to challenge what may be a commonly accepted opinion. Some answers a blatantly bad, but some of them have good points, but they all get taken down altogether. To give you a perspective, I\u2019ll talk about heights. I\u2019m a pretty short Asian guy (5\u20323\u2033) and height used to be a sensitive issue for me when I was a child. There are TONS of inconvenient truths about short people: higher risk of mental illness, higher rate of suicide, lower average income, bottom of the dating market, physically inferior to most people, some people just blatantly hate short people, and target of bullying etc. Statistics shows it clearly that short people are at a disadvantage in so many different respect. But I rarely hear anyone advocating for giving quotas for short people. So why is it that entire race, LGBTQ+, gender, disorders, ethnic minorities, etc. deserve quotas, instead of individual assessment? At the same time, why is it hard to understand that there is a certain limit to changing individuals in terms of discrimination of certain group of people due to postjudice (not prejudice), especially in things like job recruitment where you have limited time to assess individuals? These are all part of human dynamics that have certain level of survival rationality. For example, black people making up 53% of all homicides despite making up only 13% of the population in the US is a clear indication that something is wrong within the black community, not to mention 93% of those victims are also black people. Surely the police is going to be more cautious when approaching suspicious black people than other races. All these discussions are extremely important to tackle social issues. Sure they may be a sensitive issue, but it\u2019s something that you can\u2019t ignore. All of the sudden, no one is talking about the elephant in the room because of the possible repercussions by \u201ccompassionate good people\u201d (aka Social Justice Warriors). Freedom of speech is important and must be protected. World changes quite fast these days, so what was valid few decades ago may not be valid today. All things things have to be discussed and we can\u2019t do that without freedom of speech. By the way, I am not white. I\u2019m not even an American. I\u2019m some random short Japanese scientist.

This makes you glad that the government has the power to take kids away from their parents, because it protects kids from evil adults. But the next day, the news shows that a child was taken away from a family without any real cause, only some flimsy excuse that anyone can see through. The father of the child, however, has public ally criticized their states Governor. This makes you upset that the government has this power. But because of the news, the public was outraged, and a judge ordered the child to be reunited with her family. The politician is soon voted out of office. Why should the government have this power? It\u2019s because the people make sure it is used appropriately. If a government privledge is abused, people will protest. But what if the government can restrict speech. What if the governor could order the local news not to report the incident. Then there is no outcry, and no change. Freedom of speech is on another level of importants in comparison to other freedoms. An unjust jail sentence or illegal seizure of property can be judged nor by the government, but by the people. All rights have restrictions in our country, but Freedom of Speech is unlimited for true statements (and there is a very high burden of truth for slander). So long as you can say what you want, all other rights fall into place.  ",

We could have a physical fight and whoever wins we'll consider his views to be right?   Or we can agree not to fight, not to use or threaten physical force,  and argue the point verbally. Once we've agreed to non-violence as a reasonable starting point, I would then point out that free speech is a presupposition of our argument, that neither one of us can prevent the other from engaging in free speech, or appeal to a 3rd party to constrain the debate, without violating the agreement to resolve by argument rather than by force. Therefore, one cannot argue that free speech is unnecessary without contradicting the inherent assumptions of having an argument in the first place.   Yes, it is possible that my opponent will show his true colors and admit that he cannot argue his point consistently, but can only apply it via forceful edict.   But then we're at least clear what we're talking about. Free speech is the only basis on which we can debate free speech, or any other topic, free from the threat of violence. This is a variations on Hoppe's Argumentation ethics. ",

It is a privileged allowed by the powerful. The fact that a lot of my comments gets deleted in Quora and there is nothing I can do about it is proof that freedom of speech is not a divine right. As for the question of whether or not we need free speech. Fact is, we don\u2019t need it. People who can\u2019t communicate like blind, deaf, and mute people don\u2019t just roll over and die simply because they can\u2019t communicate freely. We don\u2019t need free speech. We want it. It isn\u2019t a necessity. It is a luxury. And free speech is simply a tool that we use. It doesn\u2019t guarantee the goodness or evil of anything. We can either use it to spread propaganda like Fox News or use it to publish scientific papers of facts and truth. The problem isn\u2019t whether or not we have free speech. It lies with us, the perpetrator. If we live in a world where people always speak the truth and people never harm others, it wouldn\u2019t matter if we have free speech or not, there would be no problem because nobody will harm anybody else and nobody can deceive anyone else because they always speak the truth. As you can see, the problem lies with us. Not something else. We need to fix ourselves. Not the system. But because we are egotistic and denial to our own flaws, we blame everything else but ourselves. Which is why no government system or method can ever fix humanity.

Pythagorean mathematicians considered math as religion. One of their religious belief was that everything in universe could be represented by numbers, and could be represented by ratio of whole numbers. And we know that irrational numbers could not be represented by ratios of whole numbers, aka in fraction, Hippassus proved this.  Now pythagoreans were angry on this discovery. Guess what they did next ? It\u2019s believed that they Executed him.[1] He died, but his discovery revolutionized mathematics.Why did this happen though ? Because of lack of freedom of speech.One of greatest mathematicians of universe died because of lack of freedom of speech. Now, we\u2019re lucky that his idea was still protected and passed on to future even after his death. But, we don\u2019t know how many such revolutionary ideas were denied and buried because of someone who just didn\u2019t understand or agree, just imagine what kind of idea, inventions, discoveries are we missing !

Freedom of speech is the right to speak without censorship or restraint by the government. \u201cAbsolute\u201d freedom of speech would mean no exceptions to this. Common limitations to freedom of speech relate to libel, slander, obscenity, pornography, sedition, incitement, fighting words, classified information,copyright violation, trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements, the right to privacy, the right to be forgotten, public security, and perjury. While one may not agree with all of those exceptions, very few people would not agree to at least one of them, particularly those around incitement and fighting words. I can\u2019t see any particular benefit to a society to not place any limits in terms of incitement to violence, nor can I see any great benefit to the individual (except as far as it would be beneficial to not face a fine or jail time).

So we have to ask: who has the right to stop you? Or punish you? Or, more specifically, what form of speech should properly be punishable? My answer is that the only kind of speech you don\u2019t have the right to, is to tell lies about someone, to destroy their reputation without their consent. Which means slander and libel. And those are already punishable by law. So we\u2019re good. Which leads into the question: what are rights in the first place? And how do you know? #1 Inalienable Rights, Where Do They Come From?

Freedom of speech helps to prevent Govt and others from suppressing information and allows, within limits, the press and individuals to find and publish information. Sometimes whistleblowers have resorted to publication when their concerns have not been addressed to their satisfaction. Investigative journalism has had many wins. The individuals of the press involved in Watergate are a good example. And it should be noted that the Govt set about tightening up and restricting the press freedom soon afterwards. Such freedom does have proscribed limits however such as condemning hate speech and treasonous pronouncements. In Australia there was one radio announcer who was jailed for not respecting privacy of individuals. He claimed a history of childhood abuse and proceeded to crucify alleged and convicted paedophiles on radio. Libel, defamation and slander are punishable. What we really need is a device that will tell us all when a poly (politician) is lying. Let\u2019s call it freedom from the lie. ",

It\u2019s also your right, but it comes with an obligation. I don\u2019t believe that true speech is possible without free speech, because in general people aren\u2019t very good at thinking. To think, you have to divide yourself into at least two different persons. One who formulates ideas, and one who exposes them to critic so you can come to a conclusion about whether they are true or false or good or bad. But doing this without being extremely bias, is hard to to do, and I think we highly overestimate the degree of which people do it. A more accurate way of describing what people do when they say they think is that thoughts appear in their heads and they believe them. Instead of criticizing your own thoughts, you can express them and let them be subjects to the reactions and corrections of the world. When you first are formulating ideas, you will probably stumble around, be bias, and be a fool, and a way to improve your thoughts is observing carefully the reactions of the world and have a dialog around it so you can start to sharpen up your arguments or even change your ideas completely. You have to have the freedom to make mistakes, you are probably not going to do it right the first time. If you say things that are too stupid or too hateful, the world will let you know. So practically speaking, the more you are allowed to say stupid things and express your opinions (even your darker ones) the higher the probability that you and the world will realize that they are stupid and move a little bit closer to the truth.

As indicated this is a restriction on federal power. In that context we have complete freedom of speech. Now, after that it gets a bit messy. That is in part because: Amendment XIV Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. The following categories of \u201cspeech\u201d are in some fashion regulated by state laws. Slander, libel, defamation, commercial speech, obscenity, or advocacy of illegal action are all subject to a variety of state laws. The 1st amendment at its writing was likely not intended to cover these sorts of speech since it was a considered a restriction of the federal, not state governments until the 14th amendment came along. Since the 14th amendment the general interpretation of the when the 1st amendment applies has generally been weighted towards political speech. Even in cases of slander or defamation there is a broader definition of what constitutes protected speech. Or take for example obscenity, obscenity in and of itself is not considered protected speech but the courts have in some cases ruled that even a film or book that is overtly sexual and perhaps in and of itself obscene may be protected due to some political content. Fact is the founders and writers of the 1st amendment did not want the federal government interfering in political thought or speech. So, it would be my view that within the context of political speech that citizens should be able to exercise that right without government constraint. ",

Man is a social being and we all have to be able to interact with each other to live as happily as we deserve. ",

We can plot against thegovernment here, we can disagree with it, we can sue the government if we feel we are wronged, and the government is required to come to court with its lawyers and defend its position, just as if they were some little citizen in Bakersfield, California. If we did not have the right to criticize anyone who we think deserves it, we would not have meaningful rights at all. ",

The limits on speech in the USA are not limits on the speech itself, but limits on criminal activity or imminent lawless action.

If you are performing on stage in that same theater and yell fire as part of your performance, there is no crime and therefore no restriction on you yelling fire. For another example, if Chris Rock says on stage, \u201cI hate n*gg*rs, we need to get rid of them,\u201d every reasonable person will know he is not calling for a killing spree to be waged against African Americans. If David Duke makes the same statement, given sometimes violent history of the KKK, it can be assumed that he is either calling for a killing spree or that members of his audience will believe he is calling for a killing spree and he knows that is a likely outcome, therefore this is imminent lawless action.
