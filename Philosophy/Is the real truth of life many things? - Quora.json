            "answer_text": "The truth is a relative experience to people. For example christians believe in Jesus because some of them experienced him, alien fanatics believe in aliens because they have experienced them and so forth. the truth then is hidden in a sense that people can't understand. So the truth then can be disguised by multiple experiences of people's different beliefs. Where then is the truth if everyone is experiencing different things they believe to be true? What I have experienced leads me to believe in a creator but this could simply be something else making me experience an illusion therefore hiding the truth. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cReal truth of life?\u201d I\u2019m assuming you mean when we strip away all the extras and come to the bottom line the spiritual aspects of ourselves. The complete answer and explanation would take a book, so I\u2019ll do what I can here. This is what my books are about. Bottom line first. We are the Source of all there is experiencing what it is like to be human. Please note, we ARE the Source creating this existence moment by moment while at the same time enjoying our reactions and choices through free will. Science has found that our consciousness is connected in some way to the universe. We have the ability to have our requests responded to at the quantum level. Studies on our brain have found that we get advanced signals coming into our brain seconds before we even know what we\u2019re reacting to. Where is that advanced message coming from? How does it know what is coming before the event has happened? I believe it is that part of us that is the Source and the base of our reality. That part of us we call soul is in fact, the Source, being, experiencing, and learning. ",
