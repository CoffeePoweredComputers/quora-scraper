            "answer_text": "God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God has enabled people to choose their own destinations. God does not predetermine plans for us. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free. Prophets did not teach predestination. Jesus did not teach predestination or predetermination. The only exceptions are the teachings of Paul who was not educated by Jesus and who taught the distorted teachings of predestination, original sin, atonement, and salvation by grace without obedience to God\u2019s law. The teachings of predestination were taught by Paul in Romans 8 , Ephesians 1, and 1 Corinthians 2:7 The distorted teachings of predestination and election of Augustine and Calvin are not based on the teachings of Jesus but are based on the wrong teachings of Paul. Jesus did not teach that a man is justified according to God\u2019s plan or by faith without the deeds of the law; In Matthew 16:27 and John 5:29, Jesus has confirmed that God will reward each person according to his deeds; those are the basic teachings of the old testimony like the verses taught in Psalm 62:12, Ecclesiastes 12:14, and many other old testimony verses. Bad scholars do not teach the true teachings like Matthew 10:8 \u2018Freely you have received; freely give\u2019; they teach that it is o.k. to reap the financial gifts in exchange of the spiritual gifts and teach the attractive ones \u2018And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified\u2019 Romans 8:30 They try to make people feel happy by such attractive teachings in order to receive more donations. \u201cIf we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?\u201d 1 Corinthians 9:11. Most Christians do not follow the harsh teachings like If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away which is taught by Jesus in Matthew 18:9, Matthew 5:29 and Mark 9:47, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018God has chosen us before the foundations of the world\u2019 - Ephesians 1:4 \u2018God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation\u2019 - 2 Thessalonians 2:13 \u2018For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation\u2019 - 1 Thessalonians 5:9 \u2018But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed!\u2019 1 Corinthians 15:51 \u2018God has saved us and called us\u2019 - 2 Timothy 1:9 \u2018we have been justified through faith\u2019 - Romans 5:1, Romans 5:9 Most Christians do not follow the harsh teachings which urge us to obey God as taught by Jesus in Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Mark 12:28-34, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018We are saved by grace through faith apart from works\u2019 - Ephesians 2:8-9 \u2018Even when we were dead in sins, we are saved by grace\u2019 - Ephesians 2:5 \u2018A man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law\u2019 - Romans 3:28 \u2018A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith\u2019 - Galatians 2:16 \u2018For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse\u2019 - Galatians 3:10 Most Christians believe that Jesus death was necessary for the forgiveness of sins. But Jesus, like all other prophets, taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. No sacrifice is necessary for salvation. No bloodshed is necessary for salvation. No savior should die for the salvation of others; everyone is responsible for his own salvation. Jesus has confirmed the same in Matthew 18:21-35, 6:14-15, Mark 11:25-26, Matthew 25:31-45, Luke 15:11-32 , and Luke 6:36-37 When the scribes wanted to support the doctrine of atonement, they have added verses like Matthew 18:11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost The bible footnotes explain that verse Matthew 18:11 was not in the original old scriptures Hebrews 9:22 \u201cwithout the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness\u201d is a misunderstanding of verse Leviticus 17:11 which is not about atonement but is about dietary laws. God has clarified that blood in meat is not good for health; that clarification was necessary to the people who do not have advanced medical tools to know that eating the meat with the blood still in it is bad for health The true word of God is not what is written by the unknown writer of Hebrews; it is what has been taught by Moses, Jesus and the Prophets who taught the forgiveness is possible by obedience, repentance, and prayers Proverbs 16:6 teaches that \u201cIn mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity.\u201d Psalm 69:30-31 teach that praise worship is better than sacrifice 2 Chronicles 7:14 teaches that forgiveness is obtainable without blood sacrifice \u2018If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin\u2019 Jonah 3 teach that people are forgiven when they repented and fasted, without offering any sacrifice and without shedding any blood Jesus taught the parable of The Prodigal Son in Luke 15:11-32 to highlight the importance of obedience and repentance as the main prerequisites for salvation Jesus has confirmed the teachings of the Old Testimony \u2018in repentance and obedience is your salvation\u2019 as taught in Isaiah 30:15 In Matthew 25:31-45 Jesus described the final judgment as being based on good works; he clarified that those who obey the law will be saved In Luke 13:3 and 13:5, Jesus taught that repentance is necessary for salvation But unless you repent, you too will all perish Mark 12:33 teaches: And to love one\u2019s neighbor as himself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices What Jesus taught here is not different from the wisdom taught by the old testimony Hosea 6:6 \u2018For I desire mercy and not sacrifice, And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings\u2019 That verse teaches us that forgiveness is possible by repentance and obedience; no sacrifice is necessary Matthew 9:13 teaches that Jesus came to call the sinner to repentance \u2018I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance\u2019 The wrong teachings about predestination, original sin, atonement, and salvation by grace without obedience to God\u2019s law were taught by Paul who was not educated by Jesus.

            "answer_text": "I was with my wife from the beginning of the end to the end. The beginning of the end was in a hospital in the cancer ward while we were on vacation. You could hear people in other rooms screaming at the staff, \u201cYou are going to kill me\" and other nasty things. My wife on the other hand apologized to the nurses for troubling them to take care of basic body functions. She stated simply, \u201cI want to go home. I want to see my daddy.\u201d It was the same at the end. Different hospital. Same pain. Same screaming at staff from other rooms. From my wife, \u201cTake care of the kids.\u201d It was something similar with my mom. When she realized Jesus would forgive her she laid down in peace. Death is the natural consequence of life. People without Christ have nothing to look forward to when their body ceases to function. They will be afraid. There are people, regrettably, who may have asked God for forgiveness and then continued to live like the devil in their own will. They may very well be afraid. ",
