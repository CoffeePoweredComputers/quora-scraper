            "answer_text": "Interesting question! Kudos & thanks for asking! If I understand it correctly, your question juxtaposes two pairs of property types (also known as 2nd-order properties) \u2014 essential vs. accidental and intrinsic vs. extrinsic as shown, where the \u201c?\u201d indicates the examples you\u2019re requesting:  If this is correct, I would interpret your question as asking whether or not accidental intrinsic and essential extrinsic properties are physically possible. Here\u2019s the thing, however \u2014 if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking, the best answer must come from a different perspective. As I see it, physical properties are best understood as causal outcomes. Entities and events (\u2018things\u2019) acquire their properties through as the effects or outcomes brought about by the causal laws of the universe. Hence all the physical properties of all the things in the universe are the historical record of causality throughout all history up to the present moment. Depending on the future contexts and conditions in which those objects exist, those same causal laws may or may not bring about changes in their properties. Some of those changes may actually transform the object into an entirely different form, or even alter its material substance. Some of the changes may be incidental or trivial, while others may be, as suggested, transformative or metamorphic. This leads to a crucial question, which your question implicitly raises. Consider this scenario: At time T1 object O has as set of properties P. At time T2 , object O\u2019 has properties P\u2019. If no change occurs between T1 and T2, then O\u2019=O and P\u2019=P. But if change does occur during that interval, then P\u2019=P will no longer be true, and \u2014 if the change is drastic enough \u2014 it may no longer even be true that O\u2019=O. If change does occur, we know 3 things are involved \u2014 Causal laws bring about the change.A temporal instant (of 0 duration) or period (of non-zero duration) transpired.In that instant or period object O with properties P became object O\u2019 with properties P\u2019, and while P\u2019 is not identical to P it may or may not be the case that O\u2019 is identical to O.Here\u2019s the crucial question: Do those 3 things provide necessary and sufficient information to adequately (scientifically or causally) explain what happened?I think not. Consider: would this change have been possible if there were not some inherent (or \u2018intrinsic\u2019, to use your term) characteristic or feature of O that directly participated in or catalytically facilitated the occurrence of that change? That directly resulted in P becoming a different P\u2019 (and perhaps O becoming a different O\u2019 too)? It\u2019s tempting to say that whatever particular property p in P that became a different property p\u2019 in P\u2019 provided that catalytic participation, but how is that physically (or even logically) possible? It would require p to have its own properties that are not physically present in P but which would allow p to become (or be replaced by) p\u2019 in P\u2019. An even better illustration concerns change in which a new property p\u2019 is in P\u2019 that was not in P, and every other p in P remains as it was (such that the cardinality of P\u2019=the cardinality of P+1). In this case, where did that new p come from? What piece, part, property, feature, characteristic, or whatever about O was causally affected by those causal laws such that p\u2019 came to exist? It cannot have happened ex nihilo \u2014 out of nothing. Examples abound, ranging from road rash scars and biker tattoos to cognitive dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s. Something is clearly missing from the list of items 1\u20133 above. And that \u2018something\u2019 is the ontological notion of a disposition - i.e., the tendency or propensity for the actual physical properties of things to change (increase, decrease, transform, etc.) under the relevant causal conditions \u2014 whether or not those things are ever actually subjected to those causal conditions! Dispositions constitute the very real causal potential for the actual properties of things to change due to the effects of causal laws. All dispositions are causal, in other words, and they have their own distinctive features. Most important among those are their (universal or probabilistic) strength and their permanence or transience. With this in mind, we can now construct a different matrix representing a very different version of your inherently ontological question:  Examples: Perm, Univ \u2014 human mortality, i.e., every human has the mortal disposition to die someday (otherwise they would not be human mortals).Perm, Prob \u2014 humans have blue eyes, i.e., every human has a permanent universal strength disposition to have an eye color, but each particular eye color (e.g. blue) has only a non-universal probability of occurring for any particular human.Trans, Univ \u2014 umbilical embryonic nourishment, i.e., every human has the in vitro universal disposition to be nourished via umbilical attachment to the mother, but despite being universal, the disposition is transient since post-partum, other means of nourishment are required.Trans, Prob \u2014 marry one\u2019s \u2018first love\u2019, i.e., some but not all humans marry their first love \u2026 they remain the same humans either way so the tendency to do so is transient (not permanent) as well as probable (not universal).I\u2019ve gone through all this for the following reasons: It\u2019s a great question that deserves a serious and thoughtful answer.It\u2019s a far more complicated question than it appears to be on the surface.The ontological and epistemological aspects of the question are crucial to determining a fully rational answer \u2014 especially with respect to scientific knowledge of causal laws.I\u2019m not quite sure how \u2018intrinsic vs. extrinsic\u2019 and \u2018necessary vs. accidental\u2019 correlate to the four dispositional categories, but I am quite sure it will be difficult to do so without either altering what those property terms mean to take on dispositional distinctions, or abandoning the property-based terms altogether and adopting the dispositional terminology in their place.I am extremely interested in others\u2019 (serious and BNBR) feedback and comments on this - especially from the asker!
