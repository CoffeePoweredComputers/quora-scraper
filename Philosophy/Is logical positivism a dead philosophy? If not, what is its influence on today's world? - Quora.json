            "answer_text": "It is not dead, as it lives on in the form of a newly named philosophy titled \u201cOntological Naturalism\u201d as espoused by: Richard Dawkins Ph.D. (zoology) Sam Harris, Ph.D (neuroscience) Daniel Dennett, Ph.D. (philosophy) Christopher Hitchens (journalist) , A philosophy that has been discredited, should probably not be referred to as \u201cdead\u201d so long as it has a popular following as does Ontological Naturalism as espoused by \u201cThe New Atheists\u201d. However, Logical Positivism as espoused by the Vienna Circle in the 1920\u2019s has been discredited by such Atheist philosophers as A. J. Ayer and many others. All of which serves to show why advocates of \u201cscientism\u201d such as Richard Dawkins, ought to have engaged in deeper research prior to the publication of his bestselling book, \u201cThe God Delusion\u201d in 2006. The books consist more of rhetoric than logic, and the arguments remain unsubstantiated by any scientific evidence at all, which of itself, is sufficient to dismiss the book as more of a philosophical rant than a book of science. In point of fact, one of the self evident shortcomings is that the authors fail to objectively identify their own premises, and logically, anyone seeking credibility for their worldview, must be able to demonstrate that their conclusions derive logically from known premises. The New Atheists employ much ambiguation in which their conclusions are \u201cloosely veiled\u201d by the domain of something termed \u201cscience\u201d which actually lacks an actual foundation in science. This should be understood a priori, or \u201cfrom the first\u201d. A worldview, to establish credibility, must Stand\u2014-On\u2014\u2014It\u2019s\u2014\u2014Own. In other words, a rant, or a criticism of \u201ca religion\u201d or all \u201creligion in general\u201d or anything written or spoken about a \u201cGod\u201d\u2026does not in anyway establish credibility for another worldview. A Worldview must be shown to be entirely sufficient unto itself to \u201cexplain everything\u201d or at least much more than any alternative worldview. Such a worldview, if credible, must stand on its own absent any mention of a \u201creligion\u201d or a \u201cGod\u201d at all. Ontological Naturalism, like its forbear, Logical Positivism, does not adequately have explanations for the entire spectrum of human experience. Let me give a clear example so that people can clearly understand what is being considered. Logical Positivism and Ontological Naturalism are philosophical monisms. \u201cEverything\u201d is either matter or energy or their associated phenomena such as time and space. This does not account even for a \u201cscientific law\u201d or \u201ctheory\u201d or even a mathematical measurement. These are abstract conceptions. Abstract conceptions exist in mind, arguably, as there is no such thing as scientific evidence showing that a \u201cthought\u201d exists as matter, energy, space, or time. How is this known? It is known because all natural phenomena, which is to say, matter and energy, exists in a Causal Relation to natural phenomena. Natural phenomena, as matter and energy is known to be either a cause of a natural effect, or the effect of a natural cause. That is why the assertion about \u201cnatural explanations\u201d are so frequently seen and familiar. However, all of that is called into question if Mental Objects such as \u201cthoughts\u201d exist. If abstract concepts do not exist as the cause of any natural effect or the effect of any natural cause, the abstract conceptions are not \u201cnatural phenomena\u201d but are \u201csupernatural phenomena\u201d by default. So it is not any philosophical monism which actually has greater explanatory power; but rather, it is some form of a philosophical dualism, in the form of a Mind/Body Dualism which offers greater explanatory power. This can be seen in operation in mankinds conceptions for legality and crimes and so forth. How is this relevant? It is relevant because if science explains \u201ceverything\u201d and natural organisms function in accordance with \u201cnatural selection,\u201d it is logically wrong and objectionable for any individual person or group of persons to object when any other organism kills, or steals, or rapes, or dominates or manipulates other organisms or commits fraud or indeed, does whatsoever it wants. Because what philosophical monisms to do is live a contradiction and a double standard. In that double standard, we tell ourselves that science is correct, and that we are no more than a kind of \u201cmeat machine\u201d or \u201crobot vehicle\u201d in a random and chaotic universe in which \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d is the ultimate law governing behavior. In fact, that becomes an Argued Subjectivity, because nobody really expects other people to operate that way. If people actually beloved something so brutal, it would have to be believed that a man could murder a young mother and eat her children raw while they are visiting the library. Philosophical monisms are woefully inadequate, and only become popular because people neglect to Think\u2014-Things\u2014-Through. It is like a fellow saying that he believes in brutal universe, but reaches for a phone to call the police anytime someone breaks into his house or interferes with his finances. This is made evident by the fact that many of the conclusions published in the books are substantiated by data from no peer reviewed science publication whatsoever. These authors collectively, released their publications on the world, and all have achieved great success in book sales. However, book sales and populism are not truth criteria in either science or philosophy, and for the reason that the books contain many anomalies, and many assertions entirely unsubstantiated by the necessary \u201cscientifiic\u201d or \u201cempirical\u201d evidences, the publications have become more of a social amusement than serious science or serious philosophical forays.

            "answer_text": "About ten years ago, I met a logical positivist at a conference. I was tempted to say \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t know there were any of you left around.\u201d Most philosophers think of it as dead, but it was killed by friendly criticisms. For example Quine\u2019s whole project of naturalized epistemology can be seen as a continuation of the goals that motivated logical positivists. Logical positivists were trying to maintain the legacy of Hume, and Quine said \u201cThe Humean condition is the human condition.\u201d But his seminal paper \u201cTwo Dogmas Of Empiricism\u201d undercut the distinction between analytic and synthetic that was an essential tenet of Logical Positivism. Subsequently, naturalistic philosophers like the late David Armstrong have been happy to describe their work as metaphysical not because of any belief in supernatural entities, but because they are attempting to describe reality as a whole. New Atheists are not guilty of the errors that Quine diagnosed in logical positivism. Logical positivists dismissed religious statements as meaningless, whereas New Atheists treat them as having a meaning, but being obviously false. The philosophical position that is the closest continuer of logical positivism is probably Dummett\u2019s anti-realism, which is based on the idea that to know the meaning of a sentence is to know its verification conditions. So far from being anti-religious, Dummett thought this could be used as part of an argument for the existence of God (see his Thought and Reality). Dummett always stressed that he was not trying to defend a version of logical positivism, but there are similarities. Neil Tennant, whose work on anti-realism is a continuation of Dummett\u2019s, did go so far as to say that logical empiricists were almost, but not quite right about most things.
