CUT-CUT-CUT Job is simple in such cases. However there is a case I would like to share with you- Some verbs have only the \u2018-ed\u2019 form, but some verbs change in the \u2018i-a-u\u2019 pattern. (Ring-Rang-Rung) The movie \u201cHoney, I shrunk the kids\u201d was released (1989), and I wondered shouldn\u2019t it be - \u201cHoney, I shrank the kids\u201d? In your case when the all the three are the same - Life is good! Hope this helped! Cheers! ",
