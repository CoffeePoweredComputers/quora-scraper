            "answer_text": "I think i met that cathartic technique our Master Teacher in Esoteric teachings taught us during one ritual where all of us members were included. It was done a long time ago, but i remembered the word catharsis. I thought it was a kind ofpractice. I only heard them that time. There are members who were like friends to him. And i think it was normal gesture among people whose age were not far by more years. Our Teacher was only a year or two older than most of us young people then. I was only referring to members of the same generation and age. In fact, i was only twenty-two that time, and most of other co-members were either of the same age or older by one or two years. Some are younger, i guess. I could not remember the reason why we did have that practice. It was not a day for regular rituals we had before. That time, our group was already seated in our padmas, we awaited forvhis instructions. I saw him placed their big transistor radio and tape recorder to the side. He suggested for us to listen only to the music. We listened, with closed eyes, i was thinking what kind of music was that, because i only heard it firt time. It was like holy, peaceful and calm. That is the effect to the mind and emotion. But\u2026to the mind, yes it was, but to the emotion, it had a different reaction and effect. I thought i felt something within like an onrushing of\u2026emotion! And i started to laugh. Without reason. Others i heard were crying. But then, i asked myself: WHY. Now i knew it was a technique, a catharsis, to release unwanted and supressed emotions. Our Master Teacher helped us erased suppressed emotions. Now i understood why i was laughing during rituals invoking the elements. I was laughing without reason, and sometimes i cried , without reason. It helps, really. I felt like they are a release, erasing negativity within. It was a form of cleansing. Now i understood also the meaning of the word catharsis\u2026 credits: to the Master Teacher  ",
