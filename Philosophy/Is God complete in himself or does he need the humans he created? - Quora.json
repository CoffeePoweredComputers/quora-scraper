            "answer_text": "God is complete in Himself. Applying the word \u201cneed\u201d isn\u2019t quite correct, Biblically speaking. God loves mankind and created us with the intention of having fellowship with us. So it was in the Garden, so it will be again but even better, some would say, in the end. [Update for Derm Bowen] - The central theme in the Bible can be called \u201cThe Redemptive Narrative\u201d. This is THE point of the Bible and has two book ends. The first is the Garden of Eden where man walked alongside God, as it says, \u201cthe Lord strolled through the Garden in the cool of the day\u201d (Genesis 3:8). The other book end and the final destination is The New Heavens and New Earth where it is said, \u201cand God Himself will be with them\u201d (Revelation 21). In between these two is the Fall of Man, and the process of covenants first to the fallen Adam, then Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, David, and finally the New Covenant through Jesus Christ. Of this last Covenant before the Second Coming of Christ the Bible says, \u201cGod commands all men everywhere to repent and believe on the One He has sent.\u201d And again it says,\u201dthere is salvation in no other name given under heaven among men than the name of Jesus.\u201d In order to perfect fellowship with mankind forever, the Lord had to deal with sin up front, He had to allow a choice. The Bible is also one giant prophecy and a statement that God will not allow sin to reign in eternity. Anyone who wants to can come along through believing in Jesus Christ. As for the timing of major biblical events, Jesus said, \u201cit is not for you to know times and seasons that the Father has set by His own authority.\u201d So then, having believed here on earth, in this age, we are called to share this good news. Most don\u2019t believe. Yet when you compare the Bible to other world views, it isn\u2019t illogical if God the Almighty exists and is good. If Jesus is who He claimed to be, then the Bible is the greatest of all stories, the true Chronicles of Redemption. So all of that ties into the question in this way. God did not \u201cneed\u201d to create anything. He chose to create, and especially to create man and angels to have fellowship with them. The Bible says that this fellowship will be very deep and eternally abiding to those who have believed in Jesus Christ, it is said in Revelation that they will sit down on His throne with Him. Here is a verse that addresses the OP specifically. Exodus 3:14 - \u201cI AM THAT I AM\u201d. This name of God means, among many other things, that He is completely self-sufficient and exists beyond all other things, including time and space. Does God need us? ",
