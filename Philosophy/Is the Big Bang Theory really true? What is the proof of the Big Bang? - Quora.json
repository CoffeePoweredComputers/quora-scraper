            "answer_text": "There are three big main lines of evidence for the Big Bang Expansion: Cosmic redshift of light, the relative abundances of primordial elements and the cosmic microwave background. Redshift: Atoms emit discrete frequencies of light because the emitted light is dependent on the possible energy levels of electrons in atoms. The energy levels of electrons in atoms is constrained by the wave-nature of electrons confined in a small space - you can only wrap an whole number of electron wavelengths around the nucleus. The pattern of frequencies emitted by an atom, commonly hydrogen, is well-known in the laboratory but when we pass light from remote galaxies through a prism we find that the patterns are shifted to longer wavelengths, and red is the longest wavelength of visible light, so we say that the light from remote galaxies is red-shifted. A full discussion of the various possible causes of red-shift is worthy of a separate dissertation but suffice it to say that astronomers have logically eliminated competing sources of red-shift and deduced that light from remote galaxies is red-shifted en-route by the intervening expansion of space. The Relative Abundance of Primordial Elements: By examining the dark absorption lines in light from remote galaxies astronomers can deduce the abundance of elements in intergalactic gases. What they find is a lot of hydrogen, a pinch of helium and a whiff of lithium. And that is exactly what is predicted by the models of the era of nucleosynthesis in a Big Bang Expansion. Cosmic Microwave Background: If the Big Bang Expansion is true then there was an era of time, after nucleosynthesis, in which the universe was too hot for electrons to be bound to any one nucleus for very long. When electrons are running around loose like that, it becomes highly likely that they will interact with a photon of light. So electrons catch a photon of light, recoil a little, and the acceleration causes them to emit a photon. This game of catch-and-release of photons is called scattering. A photon of light in this decoupled era can only travel a fraction of an inch before it scatters. However, the Big Bang Expansion causes a cooling of the universe and eventually electrons settle down into tightly constrained motions around a particular nucleus and scattering becomes far less likely, enabling photons to travel far and wide. For historical reasons this is known as recombination (electrons were never previously combined but the name is just a name.) However, the Big Bang Expansion predicts the temperature (3000K) at which recombination should occur and the age of the universe when it occurs, about 380,000 years atb (after the bang.) The expansion model then says that space should expand about 1000-fold from recombination to now and therefore, this ubiquitous light released by recombination, should be stretched 1000-fold, from infra-red wavelengths ([math]10^{-9} meters[/math]) to micro-wave wavelengths ([math]10^{-6}meters[/math]) That\u2019s a brief history of Big Bang Expansion evidences. There\u2019s a lot of science that I am glossing over so if you have drill-down questions there\u2019s a lot more to explore. ",

            "answer_text": "The smoking gun evidence was the discovery of the radiation from the time when the universe was a billion times more compact and on average as hot as a cool star. The universe cooled enough that the first neutral atoms formed from the hot ionized plasma, and with all the electrons captured in atoms, the left over radiation could stream through the universe freely. The age at that time? Just 380,000 years. The average density a few billion atoms per cubic meter. With the expansion the thermal radiation has cooled below 3 degrees above absolute zero and we detect it at microwave / millimeter frequencies. It is essentially the same intensity in all directions. There are tiny fluctuations in the temperature from one location to the next that give us insight into how galaxies formed. The average density has dropped by a billion times due to the expansion over nearly 14 billion years. ",
