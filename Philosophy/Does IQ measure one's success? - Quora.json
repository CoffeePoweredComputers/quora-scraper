            "answer_text": "Some people might say yes. I haven't read any of the other answers but I can guess how some of them might unfold: #1. Your typical IQ denier saying that having brains doesn't matter. These proponents of dualism will resort to an utmost amount of fallacies to try and trick in the point. Even if they don't succeed in the argument and/or life itself they will be happy in their denial. Win for them. #2. A person with brains who wants to sell. These proponents of physicalism will resort to an utmost amount of correlations to try and fallacy their way to a argument that looks contundent. They will oversell the merits of IQ into a lifestyle and \u201csuccess\u201d panacea. #3. A careful, and old, entrepreneur who knows the value of being at the right place at the right time. You can have whatever opinions and studies but you can not bullshit objective experience. The old and experienced will certainly have an idea of whom is achieving by luck, who has achieved by immorality and under what circumstances does hard work actually work. Success comes and goes in many forms and means different things for many people.  And then you have me. By many different criteria I'm not \u201csuccessful\u201d. I don't have a \u201ccareer\u201d even though I have skills. I have little real opportunities even though my \u201cnetwork\u201d is large and varied. I'm not \u201csuccessful\u201d even though my IQ is reputedly high. People whose skills I know for a fact (they tell me!!!) are lower than mine do better than me. While I was in Argentina I had three scholarships and was highly academically regarded, one of those scholarships was specifically created for me. Even though the help was there I could not finish my studies as I had to go back and help my family. Lack of solid socio-economic foundations fucks you over. You can have scholarships for yourself but if your relatives are in a drastically shitty situation, no one is going to help them for you. I can't eat caviar while someone I love has nothing. Being a good guy fucks you over. Later I was told there were no job opportunities for me where I lived, so I had to create my own job. I wasn't showering in gold but I had managed to find a problem and solve it. Lack of markets fucks you over. Afterwards I had some good and bad moments. With an economy as horrible as Argentina's the good moments are meh and the bad ones are a nightmare. There's something very important called food security. Lack of stability fucks you over. The bad moments include being unemployed for months because you're overqualified for the task. Prospective employers doing the economically right thing of hiring someone who is good enough to work but not good enough to be stolen by some other company. Being an outlier fucks you over. The acquisition cost of hiring someone who lives in the middle of nowhere is higher than someone who lives in your same city. Location fucks you over. By thinking that an employee is too good for your company or that he/she might bring unwanted change to the status quo you end up becoming the hot blonde no one wants to dance with. Being skilled fucks you over. Right now I'm in London. People contact me happy to offer me job \u201copportunities\u201d, the salary numbers are easily in the six figures. I go to interviews and everyone's hyper, they've found the guy. Then the government puts lots of barriers to hire foreigners, they make it annoying, they make it outrageously expensive and laborious. The initial impetus gets replaced by gloomy lawyering. The people who want you and need you can't hire you. Laws fuck you over. Someone looks at two identical cvs and one of the guys is rich while the other is poor, the rich guy gets hired. It has even been A/B tested!!! Being poor fucks you over. Dude. Let me tell you, I've been fucked over so many times in so many ways that I won't believe for shit whatever piece of random crappy internet advice/opinion that people have. There's clearly more than a couple variables to this situation and all of them reek of various degrees of nepotism, tribalism and unfair competition of every kind. That's evolution there for you. That's people taking every advantage they can to perpetuate whatever reproductive fitness they have. So please\u2026 high, low and average IQ people of all colors and shapes. Don't bullshit me. I'm too old for this. ",

The typical college graduate who becomes a millionaire had about a 2.9 GPA average. In other words a C student. The average A and B students, those with most likely higher IQ\u2019s, do well in the corporate, legal, medical world because they work well in the \u201csystem\u201d but most do not become millionaires. So, what is success? There are many definitions of success, but only one I know of for failure. That is the inability to achieve one\u2019s goals. If you are happy, generally content with yourself, but striving, have your health, love and are loved, I submit you are a success. The money doesn\u2019t count, contentment does. ",

            "answer_text": "Many years ago when I studied psychology in college it was suggested that IQ tests measure someone\u2019s ability to learn. At least that was the original goal for producing this test and interpreting the results. After gaining some experience with this concept and related tests the general consensus among psychologists is that a high IQ test score merely indicates the subject does well on IQ tests. I personally think success comes from a combination of talent and determination. Put differently if you keep trying and keep working at each try until it is thoroughly exhausted you will eventually succeed. In the case of offering services or goods to potential customers the biggest determinant of success is how well you determine what it is people are willing to pay for. This can be considered a talent but has nothing to do with the silly word games popular in IQ tests. Instead it is about listening to potential and current customers and understanding what they say. In the case of inventing new technologies a similar notion applies. If you work at a particular problem long enough and try enough possible solutions you will eventually find something that works. This is how Thomas Edison invented the light bulb. Perhaps the best word to describe this quality is persistence. If you disregard rewards such as membership in Mensa for people who do well on IQ tests there really is no benefit to a high score on this test. ",

For most endeavors average intelligence is pretty good and will get you where you want to be in the world.

I know very smart people who live in the equivalent on mom\u2019s basement in their forties. I also know very smart people who make hundreds of thousands or more per year. But being smart does not mean being successful and being successful certainly doesn\u2019t guarantee high intelligence. ",

But success also requires hard work and persistence . Well there\u2019s trait in psychology called conscientiousness. People who score high on that trait can\u2019t waste their time and energy. It really bugs them. They work hard. Most successful people are smart but also extremely conscientious. IQ has very small almost negligible correlation with success , you need to combine conscientiousness into equation then you get very good predictor. ",
