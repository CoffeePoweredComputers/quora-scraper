            "answer_text": "Moral is value of very high level but said so we need to practice in our consciousness only when we have knowledge and practicing the other values in our life. Moral comes much later in our relationship which I did describe in one of my old published book the purpose of moral in the evolutionary advancement of human. Human value I define in following terms. 1. Love is the seed and core value. A single entity needs to possess this value and if many people love each other equally they all make one group which is always in harmony. 2. Respect: Trust is another face but needs minimum two entities for respecting each other. If one pays due respect to other mentally they also love or value their words thus love is hidden in such state. 3. Moral: Moral word comes in picture where the entities are more than three. The moral word thus explains the transparency and or honesty among them when physically they may not be present. Thus if A, B and C are three good friends even if B is absent in an instance A and C would never criticize B in his absence. Moral thus is not personal choice but existence of their conscious state that is forcing them to follow discipline to keep them peaceful and happy even if have to work hard. Moral is like listening about soul in reciprocating our decision be for thinking or making an action and selecting an option which likely could be harmless in hurting anyone. Reaching and practicing moral does mean one has consciously thought to be away from desire that would hurt any form of relationships and to adhere has reduced the greed and keeping away from lust. Though these traits ideally could remain to a certain level but the choice selected for working moral is to rise and keep improving quality of life. If the right understanding of first value written as love means having right connection with heart and so emerging the feelings in inter relationships the second value of respect starts asking the ability of rational reasoning sense. Either of these quality partly never work the nest but following minimum self-discipline can guide one in this route. When a good amount or harmony is brought it could be easy to go ahead in following spiritual discipline which ones the gate for following moral by choice and confidence of associated with peace irrespective of any amount of labor to be faced or worked. Moral is difficult trait but one which is differentiating human with HUMANITY today and so is the demand of time and trying to find space for survival of our earth and nature herself. Many of us don\u2019t realize but is necessity or else humanity is moving ahead to be perished. ",

            "answer_text": "Who decides what is moral and immoral. But if you understand yourself and the environment in which you live, if you are aware; then you understand what is the right thing to do and will not dictated by the morality of the society. J. Krishnamurti ~ The Urgency of Change `Awareness' \u2026Can we discard the morality of society which is really quite immoral? Its morality has become respectable, approved by religious sanctions; and the morality of counter-revolution also soon becomes as immoral and respectable as that of well-established society. This morality is to go to war, to kill, to be aggressive, to seek power, to give hate its place; it is all the cruelty and injustice of established authority. This is not moral. But can one actually say that it is not moral? Because we are part of this society, whether we are conscious of it or not. Social morality is our morality, and can we easily put it aside? The ease with which we put it aside is the sign of our morality - not the effort it costs us to put it aside, not the reward, not the punishment for this effort but the consummate ease with which we discard it. If our behaviour is directed by the environment in which we live, controlled and shaped by it, then it is mechanical and heavily conditioned. \u2026 Tao: The Pathless Path, Series 2 ~ Osho Morality is mechanical\u2026morality is put together from the outside\u2026morality comes out of conditioning\u2026morality is enforced by others\u2026morality is a social device\u2026morality is dominated by the politician and the priest\u2026 John 8 New International Version (NIV) 8 1 but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. 3 The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group 4 and said to Jesus, \u201cTeacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. 5 In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?\u201d 6 They were using this question as a trap, in order to have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, \u201cLet any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\u201d 8 Again he stooped down and wrote on the ground. 9 At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. 10 Jesus straightened up and asked her, \u201cWoman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\u201d 11 \u201cNo one, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cThen neither do I condemn you,\u201d Jesus declared. \u201cGo now and leave your life of sin.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "The pivot of moral choice has three components. These are: (1) personal reason (2) emotional backdrop (3) socio-cultural compulsion. The first and the last factors are, more or less, understood. But the middle one is mostly misunderstood. Emotions are already built-in and represent the very genetics. Collectively, the emotions are known as the subconscious. Contrary to conventional beliefs, the subconscious emotion isn\u2019t really a mystery. It is simply \u201ctranslated intellect\u201d and \u201cinherent/ latent memory\u201d. Let me explain. When intellectual products i.e. ideas are sustained in mind for a critical length of time in the form of beliefs or inferences, rectified or of limited rectitude, they are subject to internal \u201crealization\u201d that converts the ideas into characteristic emotions and installs them corporally, that is, embodies them as respective mini-genes (dna-s). You should be able to imagine now that your whole genetics is built up in this process in course of time. To wit, emotions are pre-installed agents that influence your morality. More incomplete is your personal reason and beliefs, more awry are the emotions thereof and more moral distraction they cause. Emotions are your very own. You would be more intimate with your emotions than with your intellect. And yet awry part of your emotions are definitely not your own. Though you could be under the impression so far that your intellect is your own, you have to rethink how dear they could be to you if your personal inferences and personal reason they constitute would be riddled with inveracity (nonconformity with facts or reality)? So, you see, all the three factors which determine your moral choices aren\u2019t really your own. ",

            "answer_text": "Moral choices are our own. Not having it this way would imply that those who commit crimes should not be punished. Personal responsibility will go for a toss. Any criminal can just claim that it was the mysterious forces of nature that led them to do this. Now this is basically arguing from the perspective that keeping moral choices not as our own would lead to havoc in law and order. Right now the moral choice being that of the actor as a system is leading to good laws and better society. Therefore from a pure utility perspective it is justified to believe that moral choice belong to the actor. Is this argument conclusive of the truth? No. No question in philosophy really is, we have to make those assumptions that have the best consequences. ",

Getting defeat may be a sorrow to many but for me it is always a win win situation as I learn in which area more work needs to be done. Always have a positive attitude to every situation and how things will work differently than they usually do. Best of luck ",
