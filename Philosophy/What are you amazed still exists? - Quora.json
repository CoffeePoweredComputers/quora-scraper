Those studies soon turned out to be wrong and besides if impregnation without men actually happened, and men was just evacuated from life on earth, the world would perish and just no life anymore since men do the most important jobs in the world thats includes nuclear power plant workers who without working in nuclear power plants the said power plants would blow up and destroy the whole world. But no! There\u2019s some women out there who think if we do this bone marrow thing we can get rid of men and the world would be a better place! Idiots in my opinion, idiots. Even with all the logical facts and proven facts, they just don\u2019t stop boasting about crap that will not happen! ",

            "answer_text": "Religions that defy common sense and logic, specifically those that encourage belief in a spiritual dictator who demands unconditional faith and praise and yet provides no definitive proof for his existence except for an incomplete book written by primitive people in a time where everyone believed that the world was flat. Now here it is, 2020 and we still have people that believe the world is flat. We also have people that still go to churches on Sundays and sing and pray, and empty their pockets into the collection plates that get passed around with the hope that their said deity will look kindly on their favorite sports team or on them when they go to ask for that raise or promotion at work. This is what amazes me, this sillyness, this superstitious nonsense that many still believe despite the countless years of scientific research and knowledge that exists. ",
