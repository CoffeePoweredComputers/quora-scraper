Some artists may use their art as a tool to provide a \u201ccritique\u201d on the times in which they live or as a reflection on past social or historical periods. Some academics may choose to draw conclusions or create theories about social trends and label them \u201cmodernism\u201d and \u201cmodernity.\u201d They can put them forward and you and I can choose to accept or reject them. Only if and when we accept other\u2019s terms as valid can we then make our assessments of \u201cmodernity\u201d as seen from a \u201cmodernism\u201d perspective. ",

            "answer_text": "Where is modernity collapsing? Where are its fissures? Where is its underbelly most laid bare? Selfishness is an epidemic.Violence is an epidemic.Emotional disconnection is an epidemic.Toxic human behavior is an epidemic.Loneliness is an epidemic.I feel that each one of those topics could fill an educated text from a scholarly institution and a class by the same name. In fact, perhaps that is the case, just under another name. Or perhaps those classes need to be invented, because the causes and results are very real and very tragic. We are in a malaise and we don\u2019t know it. We\u2019re walking around blindly. We\u2019re living in 2019, but without the language or seemingly the will to even come to terms with the basic problems of the human condition. ",
