My \u2018Understanding\u2019 . . . \u201cExperience\u201d Experiencing anything \u2018learns ya up\u2019 - greater than any book, mortal teacher, movie, or even \u2018knowledge\u2019 or \u2018thinking\u2019. Those things just give you \u2018smarts\u2019 or even if you are just lucky? some \u2018smarter n\u2019 smarts\u2019. ha ha ha ha ha When you \u2018play to win\u2019 . . . that forces you to go beyond \u2018brain\u2019 values . . . because your \u2018Heart\u2019 gets into it. Listening to your \u2018Heart\u2019 always \u2018kicks tuchas\u2019 in the thing most grasp? as \u2018the game of life\u2019. Not only valuable in the \u2018papier mache\u2019 mortal life league . . . but \u2018kicks butt\u2019 in the arena of \u2018eternal life too\u2019 (kiss my grits papier mache\u2019) It/that takes \u2018the heart of a Lion\u2019 to keep on playing. And? that is exactly why \u2018the lion\u2019 is the King of Beasts. Lose? ha ha ha ha ha - becomes? Not an option. Quitters? will \u2018dry up\u2019 like a tree that doesn\u2019t want to play against \u2018the wind\u2019, \u2018the hot sun\u2019, \u2018weather\u2019, floods and drought and \u2018long dark nights\u2019 . . . and will soon become \u2018dead wood\u2019.  If one is satisfied becoming a \u2018stuffed Lion\u2019 in a museum? Go play with the \u2018chickens\u2019. grins and winks A chicken will never find their \u2018Creator\u2019 . . . it\u2019s much easier to just run around the hen house, and be chased by the rooster, and be happy, just laying eggs all over the place. Experience? Puts \u2018Understanding\u2019 in your heart . . . Thinking and smarts at best will not ever win a game against \u2018Experience\u2019. \u2018Understanding\u2019? is not a \u2018thingy\u2019 . . . but rather a \u2018Being\u2019 . . . Wisdom Herself/Himself. That\u2019s it bud . . . gotta go now . . . I\u2019ve got some \u2018canyon valleys\u2019 I still am working in/on. Thanks again for the request to answer . . . and you? have a great day. From \u2018Cubby\u2019  P.S.? You can take this \u2018check\u2019 to the bank and \u2018cash it\u2019 . . . The \u2018check\u2019 is good ",

To be honest, it feels good to win and it feels bad to lose but you shouldn\u2019t take it to heart either way. If you lose, you work harder and push yourself more. Putting in the effort is more important than anything. Your personal best is what should matter. Some people are better at one thing than another. You don\u2019t know what that is until you have put everything into it. We are all endowed with our own specific talants. Find what you are good at but more important is to find what you enjoy doing. Usually they are the same. I sucked at baseball but I always enjoyed playing. Didn\u2019t care if I sucked. ",

A majority of humans accept the nonsense that they are taught by those controlled by the powerful and very rich; but those do not teach Truth and there is Truth in this marvelous universe. Some prefer to learn from fools; but that does not lead to a life of Love, Joy and Peace. Find and choose better teachers! ",
