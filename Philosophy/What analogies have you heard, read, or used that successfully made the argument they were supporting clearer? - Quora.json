            "answer_text": "In section VII, of Part I of Book I of his magnum opus, A Treatise of Human Nature, David Hume makes the assertion that whatever substances we can conceive of do not have some innateness to them. In other words, there is no innate quality of an apple that makes it an apple. It is just an amalgamation of different qualities that we understand to be true of one particular apple, but which, as a specific time, we choose to apply to others that we have experienced in some way. To help us understand this, Hume offers the example of a man. There is no innate qualities that make up manliness. Men come in different sizes, shapes, colors, hairstyles, etc. As such, when we conceive of a concept of a human man in our minds, we are left with nothing. Because there is no innate quality of masculinity that defines all the qualities of man. There is no innate \u201cmanliness\u2019 within men. The implications of this, however, are quite staggering. This means that there is also no innate \u2018you\u2019 within you. There is no innate quality that defines me as Albert. I am just an amalgamation of different qualities, many of which can change, which all define who I am at any specific point of time. Every second of everyday, I am changing based on my qualities and there is not, at any point in time, where I have some innate special quality that defines me from all other individuals who also happen to be human males. I find this comparison that Hume makes in his book to be quite impressive and to show that he has clearly thought a lot about this. Only problem, though, is that Hume never came up with some famous phrase like Rene Descartes did. When Descartes states \u201cI think, therefore I am,\u201d I would love to imagine Hume looking at him and saying \u201cYou do not exist, you are just a set of constantly changing qualities.\u201d It would be quite funny, in my mind, to see a debate occur after such a statement.
