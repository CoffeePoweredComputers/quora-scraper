            "answer_text": "Some people have to think long and hard about having some kind of philosophy of life. It took me years to come to an understanding about myself and that didn\u2019t really happen until I was in my 20s, and even then, I still didn\u2019t really get myself until much, much later. Everybody is different and some people seem to come out of the womb knowing exactly how they fit in the world and what direction they want to take. How about this? What if I pose a few questions for you and you try to answer them and see if it helps you develop your essay? Here goes: What makes you smile or laugh?What makes you sad?What makes you want to get up every day?What gives you a sense of satisfaction?What do you wish you could have a do-over for?What do you consider one of your best accomplishments?What kind of books do you enjoy reading?If you could change something about the world, what would it be?What\u2019s your dream job?What\u2019s the worst thing you\u2019ve ever experienced?Do you like to work with others, or do you like to work alone?If you could visit any part of the world and experience life there, where would that be?How do you work on yourself?If you had a million dollars, and could do anything at all with it, what would you do?What is something that your friends might say about you?There are tons of these kinds of questions available on the Internet, so if none of these spark your ideas, then you might need to look elsewhere. Anyway, if you try answering a few of these questions and tag on a Why? or What does that say about you? with the question, you might begin to see some connections. A philosophy of life isn\u2019t necessarily going to be the same now as if might be in 5, 10, 15 years, so don\u2019t feel that once you\u2019ve written this, you\u2019re stuck with it. Plus, you might only be able to say one or two things about your philosophy in 250 words. What would your family say about you if they were trying to describe you to a stranger?They might say that I\u2019m quiet, a bit shy. Someone who reads a lot and is always trying something new. Someone who likes to do research and will do more work on something that interests me. They might say that I\u2019m creative in a number of different fields. They might say that I can be depended on. Okay, so if I look at the answer, I could say that my philosophy is to be like a sponge and constantly learn and really delve into things that interest me. My philosophy can also bring in being creative and building things. If I were charged with writing your essay, I would probably give examples or tell a story about something that I created and spent a great deal of time and effort in doing so. Maybe it would be something that I taught myself to do. I\u2019m pretty sure I could come up with 250 words about that. I hope this is of some value to you. Good luck. ",
