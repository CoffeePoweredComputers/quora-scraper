            "answer_text": "I hope following example enlighten you. When there is notion 'I'/'Me' only then there is notion for 'you' or 'he/she'. In short for when we consider 'first' person, only then we can talk about 'second' & 'third' person. Now if you remove 'I' then there is no meaning of 'you' or 'he/'she'. So 'second' & 'third' persons always exist with frame of reference of 'first' person.  Though, it is not classical example. It's origin is in philosophy. See Ramana Maharshi ",
