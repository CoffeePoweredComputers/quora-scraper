            "answer_text": "Socrates - Difficult to say, other than being somewhat against democracy. If you believe Plato\u2019s account then he shared some of his views on universality. Plato - The main tenet was his Theory of forms, contributions to Epistemology, but generally speaking, he coined Objective Idealism. He fought against the relativism of truth with Sophists. Augustine - Inspired by Plato to great extent, rejected Epicureanism, paved the path for Boethius's Neoplatonism that was the ultimate synthesis and foundation for modern-day Christianity. Descartes - A rationalist that is known for trying to prove God (questionable attempt). Contributed to modern-day epistemology. Stood by the mind-body duality later refuted by Phenomenologists. Hume - Empiricist naturalist, thoroughly rejected possibility for metaphysics, laid the foundation for Kant\u2019s philosophy. Hume adamantly claimed that things cannot be deduced from themselves alone, but need prior experience of them. Kant - Builds on Hume\u2019s philosophy, but then refutes it. Kant allows the possibility of metaphysics due to the human ability to actually deduce things from themselves alone, by intuition that is based on the understanding of \u201clanguage of things\u201d; so-called synthetic a priori judgements. Example of such language is mathematics or geometry for instance. Merleau-Ponty - One of the later phenomenologists. Phenomenology brackets reality and bias and investigates phenomena as they appear to humans. There are different methods within phenomenology; considering aspects of a thing, profiles of a thing, and moments of a thing. Every perceivable phenomenon is given not on its own, but in a greater context. One important idea is that consciousness is intentional and mind-body duality is negated, consciousness is out-there in the world, reaching to them things, and being them. ",
