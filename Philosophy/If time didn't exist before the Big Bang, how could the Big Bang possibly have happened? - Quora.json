            "answer_text": "Time is just a dimension just like up, down, right left, backwards, forward. The only thing that makes time special is the one way direction of causality. But that is governored by statistical laws. For short enough time periods all fundamental physics laws are reversible. There is an interesting experiment that demonstrates this: Physicists Reverse Time for Tiny Particles Inside a Quantum Computer No, they didn\u2019t really reverse time. But they created an environment where the direction of time had no cause and effect consequences. For small enough time periods this happens naturally. Which means if the universe has a beginning, it took a certain amount of time for the irreversible nature of time to kick in. For those first few moments time was just another direction of space. So this is why physicists like Steven Hawking\u2019s described the concept of before the Big Bang as equivalent to North of the North Pole. As you get very close to the North Pole, the directions take on different meanings. East and West just is directions of rotation around the pole. North and south just means that increasing or decreasing our radius. The actual location of that pole seems arbitrary once you get close. There is no actual candy stripped pole. Rather some scientist had to sit there and take very precise measurements, and say here is the North Pole. If the ice sheet you are on shifts, so that marking is in the wrong spot, you won\u2019t notice. Same with time. When you are very near the start universe. The instant that it started has no special indicator. If you were there to observer and the we were off by a couple of Planck units you would not know it, Because time is just a direction and not a chain of cause and effect, yet, you have no indicator which axis is time, and which direction is past, and which direction is future. From the distant future it is bloody obvious, but it isn\u2019t obvious when you are close to the beginning. If I tell you I am at a point along a circle of radius 1 measured 0 degrees from the axis. Then I tell you I move towards the Center until r=-1, you will tell me I have simply moved to the opposite side of the circle and r=1. It is the same thing with the Big Bang, If the universe is 2 Planck units old, and you ask me what happened 4 Planck units ago, I just move to the opposite side of a universe that is 2 Planck units old. Now the Big Bang is not the only game in town. Continual inflation fits known data just as well. It is roughly equivalent to saying North of the North Pole is straight up towards the North Star. It is a different model, but it works just as well. ",

            "answer_text": "I wasn\u2019t going to answer until I saw that Marco Pereira is totally misrepresenting Stephen Hawking (and doesn\u2019t allow comments), when he says this: \u201cTo say that since there was no time, there was no physics and no rules is the same as saying God made it\u2026:)\u201d Besides the fact this this is just a subjective assertion, neither Hawking nor any other actual cosmologist (which, I note, Pereira is not) has ever said such a thing. What Hawking said was that the laws break down at the point of the Big Bang, and that is not at all like saying that \u201cthere was no physics and no rules\u201d. What it is saying is more like that \u201cexistence\u201d underwent a phase change, so that from this side of things we can\u2019t look back and get a clue of what happened before (and Pereira, with an actual credential in Physical Chemistry, ought to recognize a phase change when he sees it!). In reality, saying that \u201ctime did not exist before the Big Bang\u201d is an over-reach, which Hawking really recognizes when he says that the laws break down: if the laws break down, that means we have no basis on which to know if time didn\u2019t exist or not. On the other side of the phase change, time might have flowed as we know it, or there might be a different dimension which turned into time, or there might be some other time-like dimension \u2014 indeed for it to be \u201cexistence\u201d as we understand it, there must have been some sort of time-like dimension since existence as we understand it requires duration, which means time or something like it. Hossein Javadi cited a more pertinent Hawking quote: \u201cEvents before the Big Bang, are simply not defined, because there\u2019s no way one could measure what happened at them\u201d. Another way of putting this is that to even speak of \u201cevents\u201d before the Big Bang is meaningless, since events as we understand them require duration and extension, which means time and at least two physical dimensions; and to speak of \u201cbefore\u201d the Big Bang is equally meaningless unless we assume that some time-like dimension was in operation the word \u201cbefore\u201d has no meaning (a far better term is \u201cprior to\u201d, which sounds like time but doesn\u2019t require that). So \u201cHow could the Big Bang possibly have happened?\u201d We don\u2019t know. We can\u2019t see \u201cbeyond\u201d or \u201cbefore\u201d or even into the very moment of the Bang, so all we have is speculation. The only hope we have other than mathematical metaphysics (e.g. string \u2018theory\u2019) at this point is the notions of \u201cbranes\u201d, because that conjecture at least offers the possibility of being tested, since it points to events which should have consequences in this universe, though unfortunately even if the concept is correct we may never get to see the evidence of such an event. So \u201cGod did it\u201d is at least as likely as an eternal multiverse or something, because due to the fact that the laws do break down at that point we just have no clue. ",

            "answer_text": "The question of TIME is both a deeply physical and philosophical one. What is time? Most folks would say on its most basic level, that time is a series of \u201ccausal\u201d events that occur in sequence. A clock tics \u2026 tic \u2026 tic \u2026 tic \u2026 tic. If you asked, \u201cwould time pass if there was no one or no way to measure it, our logic would demand that we still answer, \u201cYES\u201d. Surely, time does not need us to measure it, to exist on its own. What if we had no clocks? So what? Time would still pass, wouldn\u2019t it? It is an inherent part of our physical world. We could for example, explain that somewhere, some event is ALWAYS occurring in the universe, then another event is occurring, then another one and so on. Lets\u2019 say these events are the rate of inflation in the universe, or the vibrations of atoms. Somewhere in space, an atom is vibrating over time. Whether we are watching it or not, it is still vibrating. The atom itself is recording the passage of time. We don\u2019t need to time the vibrations. They are doing a nice job on their own. Under this logic, then time passes in our universe if there is even one atom in the universe vibrating somewhere to measure it. How fast is time passing? We all thought we knew that. Logically, time passes at the same rate everywhere. Then along came Einstein. He realized that the tick of a clock or the vibration of a single atom is not the same everywhere. The rate at which a tick of time passes, apparently depends on whether the measuring device is moving THROUGH SPACE, and how fast. Take that lonely atom. If it is moving at speed X through physical space, then time passes at one rate for it. If that atom moves through space at a different speed, then time passes at a different rate for it. The faster through space the measuring device moves, the slower the passage of time becomes. In the case of a vibrating atom, if we send it flying through the universe at close to light speed, it will vibrate \u201cslower\u201d. According to Physicists, if the atom could reach light speed, it would stop vibrating entirely, turn into energy and be frozen in suspended animation (something no material object can ever achieve, due to the laws of special relativity, which is another whole ball of wax). What would happen if that vibrating atom did somehow, stop vibrating? What if it was the only atom in the universe, and all motion within it came to a stop? Would time still pass? How could the universe know? There would be nothing to measure its passage \u2026 no clock \u2026 no vibrating atoms \u2026 no movement at all! However, even if there was not a single atom in existence, space itself would still be inflating .. getting bigger \u2026 tic \u2026 tic \u2026 tic. Time does not need atoms to be measured by events in our universe. In trying to imagine that scenario, logic does let me envision the idea of total suspended animation. Nothing moves. No ticks occur. I could almost be satisfied claiming that time can \u201cstand still\u201d, because there is nothing to measure its passage. Yet \u2026 in my logic, I would still \u201cfeel\u201d that time was passing at some rate or another, \u201csomewhere\u201d. I was just not able to measure it. This is particularly true regarding our universe, the Big Bang and the concept of the Multiverse. What do Physicists conceptualize when they consider the Big Bang, and what may have come before it? Prior to the Big Bang, they claim that our entire universe was confined to a tiny \u201cinfinitely small\u201d dot called a \u201cSingularity\u201d. In imagining that \u201cthing\u201d, some of them are forced to claim through mathematics that all energy, all matter, and even space itself was inside that singularity dot. The Physics apparently demands it. Yet, how can anyone visualize infinity? If that claim is true, then our Universe apparently existed as something (a Singularity), suspended somewhere else but occupying no space at all, with no passage of time \u2026 forever! How can anyone visualize Forever? Forever is a LONG TIME. It exists for all Eternity, for God\u2019s sake! Worse, that Singularity reportedly had characteristics. It was HOT! At the moment it \u201cwoke up\u201d and turned into the Big Bang expansion, that Singularity was supposedly trillions of degrees in temperature, FILLED with something scientists call \u201cvacuum energy\u201d, cosmic foam, Higgs fields, Quantum virtual particles, cosmic strings \u2026. There are lots of names for it. Then, something happened! Somehow, our \u201csingularity\u201d, existing somewhere in an infinitely small space without the passage of time, existing with all those characteristics, BEGAN! It inflated and expanded in volume at much faster-than-light speeds. At that precise moment, time began to tick in our new universe? The clock started. Dark Energy, Dark matter, vacuum energy, 3-dimensional space, cosmic inflation, cooling of energy to form quarks and leptons, the coalescing of something called the four \u201cForces\u201d of the universe \u2026 it all began with that event some 13.8 billion years ago. Once the Big Bang expansion began, there were \u201cthings\u201d in the new universe to record the passage of time. Quarks appeared and began spinning. Particles came together. It does not matter how fast or slow time passed, it is enough that something was now present to measure time\u2019s passage. So, scientists are happy to state that time began with the Big Bang. Well, back to the moment before the Big Bang. There is NO logic that can be called upon to claim that our universe\u2019s Singularity existed as an infinite \u201cnothing\u201d, for all of infinity \u2026 then suddenly .. something happened to it to cause it to expand. The evidence for the Big Bang is very solid. Apparently, our universe did begin 13.8 billion years ago. However, every ounce of common sense demands that we picture our Singularity as existing SOMEWHERE ELSE before it broke out. Cosmologists are also frustrated with the claims, and ask the same questions. A growing number of them have proposed an answer. Maybe, our universe\u2019s Singularity existed as a tiny \u201cdot\u201d within a much much larger environment \u2026 a MULTIVERSE \u2026 a place filled with space of its own, matter, energy, other universes, and other Singularities. Maybe we are but one of a countless number of other \u2018bubble universes\u2019, existing in some larger space, side by side, a space spanning mind-boggling distances. In that vision, there would be ENORMOUS NUMBERS of other universes. Some Cosmologists banter around that the Multiverse may be \u201cInfinite\u201d in size. That just doesn\u2019t cut it. Infinity cannot be envisioned. How can something, constituting some concept of physical space, go on forever \u2026 never stopping \u2026 forever \u2026 with time passing within it forever \u2026 with no beginning of time or space or energy or matter \u2026 and no edges \u2026 and no boundaries \u2026 no ending \u2026 no dimensions? How could matter and energy be infinite in substance? Where did it all come from? How could it not have come into existence at some time in the past? The very idea is nonsensical, yet Physicists toss it around as if it were established fact. Likewise, the concept of a Finite Universe is also impossible. How could the Multiverse be finite? That means it had a beginning. What was present before the beginning? Where did all the stuff of the Multiverse come from? It just cannot appear from NOTHING. There had to be a start \u2026 an origin, yet what was around before that start? Frankly, both the finite and infinite concepts of universe and multiverses are impossible, yet one of them must be true. It is enough to lose sleep over \u2026 I\u2019ll tell you. If it exists in some form or another, would time pass in the Multiverse? Presumably, it would! As envisioned, things would be going on in the Multiverse that would serve as measuring devices, to measure time\u2019s passage. The rate of time\u2019s passage might be very different than in our universe, but time itself \u2026 would surely pass, provided there was something happening \u2026 some series of events \u2026 some step by step \u201cvibration of an atom\u201d to measure it. Other Big Bangs would explode outward. Some bubble universes would die. Things would occur! If this theory has any validity at all, then my answer to your question is that time DID exist and DID PASS before our Big Bang. It just passed somewhere else, in the Multiverse. Our universe\u2019s Singularity, containing all of its own space, energy and potential matter, was trapped in suspended animation for some unknown passage of time, and did not start its own ticking clock going until the moment it began inflating. What of the \u201cfuture\u201d? According to popular theories, our universe has three fates, far in the future. It can expand forever. If so, then time will presumably tick in it forever, or at least until all movement, vibration and ways of measuring time\u2019s passage disappear. At that time, perhaps our dead cold universe will enter a new phase of suspended animation. Time in it will stop ticking, but time outside of it, within the bigger Multiverse, will still go on. Fate 2 is to have gravity reverse inflation and cause the Big Crunch. If that happened, then the universe would presumably contract back down to a new Singularity. Cosmologists would claim that time would stop passing in it, until and if the Universe exploded again in a new Big Bang. However, if the Multiverse exists, time would still be passing in it. Fate 3 is the Big Rip \u2026 our universe inflates so fast that all of its matter comes apart, turning back into photons of energy, cosmic foam, virtual particles, cosmic strings, etc. We would not form a new Singularity \u2026 we would sort of blend into whatever is out there beyond our own universe of energy and matter \u2026 possibly the very stuff the Multiverse is made of. If that occurs, then again, time would still pass in the Multiverse. What if there is no Multiverse? Then, we are \u201csucking wind\u201d so to speak. Both Infinity and Finite concepts of time are impossible. Of course, all bets are off \u2026 if a GOD made everything. Who knows what time, energy, matter and space a God or GODS would command? Note however, that would lead to a new question. \u201cWhen and where \u2026 did GOD come from? ",

            "answer_text": "Energy cannot be created. This should give you a sense of how elementary energy is. Energy is the only original stuff that ever was; no one could put it there, it has no ulterior source, it is the simplest substance in the world. Before the beginning of time, there was only energy. Imagine a body so archaic that it lacks time, space, matter or gravitation. It is an energy singularity made of uncountable energy packets we know as quanta. Look now at the possibilities open to energy. A \u201cfalse vacuum\u201d is an unstable state that spontaneously changes to a more stable state through \u201cbubble nucleation\u201d. A bubble spreads at a speed close to light with walls that have \u201csurface tension\u201d. This looks very much like the creation of space. More quanta inside the bubble self-assemble into the dozen elementary particles we know and further aggregate into matter. The energy-matter density inside the bubble gives space its geometric property, gravitation. This is how you produce a Big Bang out of a stock of the simplest and primordial substance in the world, energy. Here is more. What was before the Big Bang? Before the Big Bang there was an energy singularity with no space, time, matter or gravitation, and zero density. There is a way to \u201csee\u201d this primeval body; it cannot disappear without causing every object spawned by it to also vanish. By lacking spacetime the energy singularity appears to have existed \u201cthen\u201d, continues to exist now, and will remain undisturbed in its \u201cplace\u201d even if our universe disappears. Why do cosmologists disagree on what existed before the Big Bang? The tested instrument that made the Big Bang a necessity is of no application before the very beginning. General relativity concerns space, time, mass, energy and gravitation, but the theory says these phenomena debuted together 13.8 billion years ago, throwing no light on what may have existed before such a bizarre epoch. Events prior to the Big Bang are deemed to be unobservable, their information lost to us. Even in the face of such impediments, cosmologists lack no ideas on what may have caused the universe into being. Scenarios range from a universe undergoing an endless cycle of birth, collapse and rebirth; a mechanism\u2014eternal inflation\u2014bringing into being a myriad of universes, making ours a part of a \u201cmultiverse\u201d; the idea that the universe is confined to a sort of membrane inside a higher dimensional space\u2014the \u201chyperspace\u201d\u2014and many others, including the possibility that \u201cnothing\u201d split in two opposite halves so that the total energy of the universe is zero (0=1-1), have been advanced. Why have physicists never proposed a singularity made purely of energy? Physicists are concerned solely with their subject matter, persuaded that physics is a senior science taking precedence over the rest. Because this is also the general opinion, they overlooked the known solution to the only other two \u201corigins\u201d dilemmas. Evolution, an old subject. Science first stumbled with an \u201corigins\u201d mystery in the second half of the 19th century. A couple of English biologists faced a seemingly impossible question: were current lifeforms created in their present shape or were they descended from earlier ancestors? What they found was evidence for an evolution. A series of slightly varying creatures, increasingly fewer and more rustic as one got into the past, produced the astonishing variety of earth\u2019s life\u2014science now places a single cell as the ancestor to all modern life. The ensuing scandal was to be made worse by one of the two Victorians who clung to the matter in regard to humans. Did we also descend from more primitive animals? He said yes and devoted a book to examine the issue at length. What about the top question, the emergence of life itself? Before the creation of the first living creature there was only ordinary matter, so Darwin envisioned life arising out of self-assembling organic compounds in a \u201cwarm little pond\u201d bathed in heat, light and electricity. The key to all \u201corigins\u201d conundrums. Darwin showed how discontinuous, seemingly incongruous qualities emerge from an unbroken chain of events. His method to the origin of new phenomena was to look in the preexistent, simpler environment. By following it he got the right answers, twice. Humans originated from primates and life from organic compounds ultimately made of ordinary matter. Where the arrow of simplicity points to. The straightforward mechanism of evolution forces us to look for some simpler, preexisting body capable of spawning the entire universe. It should have known traits; it should be completely \u201cdark\u201d in our eyes and yet very visible if properly looked for; its constituent stuff should be very ordinary and yet capable of taking many different shapes. The law of conservation of energy. The law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. By this law there should be an initial inventory of energy to create the universe. Energy lacks corporeality and yet it is a real physical property. As a conserved quantity, energy is also unaffected by time\u2014Einstein showed that time and space are part of the same continuum, spacetime, so anything alien to space is also so to time. Lacking corporeality and time does not prevent energy to transform itself into other, even tangible, forms. The mass-energy equivalence principle. Einstein showed that mass and energy are equivalent. Initially just a convenient theoretical tool, experimental physicists found practical ways to use this principle to transform mass and energy into each other. Atomic bombs and reactors have been made to release huge quantities of energy. In the other end, protons brought to a speed close to light are made to clash in frontal collisions to produce much more massive particles than those of the protons involved. More complex, tridimensional mass, abounding in uncountable chemical varieties, is made of confined energy moving at the speed of light. The energy of the void. By the end of the last century, cosmologists found that the universe is expanding at an accelerated rate. A low-density, \u201cdark\u201d energy, first proposed by Einstein as a \u201ccosmological constant\u201d, is doing the pushing. It has been referred to as the \u201cenergy of space itself\u201d, the \u201cenergy of the void\u201d, or \u201cvacuum energy\u201d. There is a catch. As the universe expands, in order to keep the thrust constant, more and more space has to be created. At the scale of the whole universe, energy is not conserved; more energy is coming from an unknown source. The other space, the quantum vacuum. Quantum mechanics is the other general physical theory. It describes nature at the scale of atoms, nuclei and subatomic particles. It is inconsistent with general relativity because quantum phenomena have no equivalent in general relativity. One fine example is the uncertainty principle. Quantum field theory treats the void as populated by fields that never go away. The uncertainty principle forbids knowing with precision the value of a field at a point in space. If a point in space were to lack particles, the field\u2019s precise value would be known\u2014it would have zero energy. The vacuum is thus populated by quantum fluctuations, virtual particles that pop into and out of existence. Because their contribution is however positive, the quantum vacuum has energy\u2014even infinite energy. Unlike the constant density of the \u201cdark\u201d energy, in the quantum realm, the smaller the scale, the greater the vacuum energy density\u2014as smaller wavelengths traduce into higher frequencies. Calculations jump many zeroes when going from the scale of atoms to that of nuclei to that of a thousandth of nuclei. Physicists stop at the Planck scale because beyond this scale existing theories make no sense. At this point the vacuum energy density reaches 110^112 ergs/cm3. The measured density of dark energy is 10^-8 ergs/cm3. There is a gap of 120 zeroes between the energy of the space at the cosmic scale and that of space at the quantum scale. This disparity alone should tell physicists that the two vacuums do not refer to the same phenomenon. The energy singularity. The incredibly thick energy barrier\u2014much denser than matter\u2014surrounding the universe in the direction of the very small is the energy singularity. This body is so archaic that it lacks spacetime; this is how it managed to exist \u201cbefore\u201d the Big Bang. Since gravitation is a geometric property of spacetime, the huge energy of this singularity does not have any gravitational effects on our universe. From the energy singularity to the universe. Starting with the energy singularity, the first step to produce the universe is the creation of spacetime: a bubble, membrane, higher-dimensional world \u201cinside\u201d the dimensionless singularity, driven by inflation, a false vacuum, or some other spontaneous reaction of the original medium, such as a \u201cquantum fluctuation\u201d. The accompanying event is the leakage of some of the\u2014very simple\u2014bundles of energy into the new medium. The space-less quanta then assemble into the 64 known species of elementary particles. Thanks to the second-generation phenomenon of spacetime, quanta can further bond and aggregate into the tridimensional arrays we know as matter. Quantum phenomena and why no one understands them. The simplest parts of a structure cannot disappear without causing it to also vanish. It follows that if the most elementary pieces of our universe come from the pre-Big Bang era, we should be able to confirm this, today. By taking a close look at the smallest chunks of matter\u2014elementary particles, atoms and molecules\u2014physicists have \u201cseen\u201d them dissolve into waves. The particles reappear after some sort of interaction, usually a collision with a macroscopic object, an event called a \u201cmeasurement\u201d. Much of this process is actually unobservable; the waves are mathematically modelled and there is a strong indication that they are just \u201cprobability waves\u201d\u2014a piece of math\u2014describing unphysical objects that exist at best in some sublayer of reality. We have problem dealing with this other, subtler layer of reality because our mind is not well suited to ponder events occurring in the absence of space and time. Violations of ordinary logic by quantum phenomena. Nontechnical accounts of quantum phenomena have provided us with illustrations such as the following. Quantum objects exist as superpositions of different states; they can be in more than one place at the same time. An electron within an atom can jump from one place to another without crossing the intervening space. Quantum objects can tunnel through barriers. If one wants to know the precise position of a particle then one cannot know its precise momentum and vice versa. Quantum objects going from point A to point B follow all possible paths simultaneously. Entangled particles can interact instantly across space. One cannot observe anything without disturbing it. In these examples the concepts of space, time and corporeality are violated. The reason is that quantum objects lack space\u2014and hence corporeality\u2014whether immersed in space or matter. If freely flying when \u201cmeasured\u201d\u2014disturbed\u2014by a collision or obstacle, such objects behave weirdly. Depending on the type of interaction, they can show wave or particle-like characteristics, and the measurement of the whole set of their properties by classical standards, as if they were true particles, is unattainable. The origin of probability in quantum mechanics. Quantum formalism\u2014its mathematical apparatus\u2014cannot predict the outcome of single interactions such as the precise spot where an electron fired against a screen will appear. Rather, it provides the probabilities to observe one of the possible outcomes. The predicted distribution of probabilities appears only after many runs of the same experiment. Why? There is no equivalent between a \u201cnon-object\u201d suspended in a space-less sphere and one existing in space and time. Imagine a cat posing for us, in the dark. At one time it will be standing and at a different one, sitting. It can be licking its right paw or the left one. It can face us, show us one of its sides or appear tail first. All these are valid \u201cconfigurations\u201d for the cat to be in. Suppose now that we have a light that lets us take a glance at the cat each time we flash it. With each flash we will see a single \u201cconfiguration\u201d of the cat. In no case we will be able to anticipate it, all we will know is that we will see a valid configuration. The many states of the cat\u2014its entire shape or structure\u2014will be evident only after many flashes. Entanglement. The phenomenon of entanglement is especially illustrative on how a space-less object behaves in spacetime. Two electrons are entangled if the properties of each depend on the properties of the other\u2014the pair is said to share the same wavefunction. For instance, if one is in a \u201cspin up\u201d configuration, the other will have the other, \u201cspin down\u201d. While freely flying they are supposed to be in a superposition of the two states\u2014really an unphysical state foreign to spatial traits. Now, it is possible to send the electrons in opposite directions. Suppose that a measurement is performed on one of them. If the outcome is \u201cspin down\u201d, we will find the partner in the opposite, \u201cspin up\u201d configuration. In other words, the particles communicate instantly across space. Why? The reason is that their primary bond is more elementary, so it supersedes their spatial relationship. Conclusion. Four singularities: the energy singularity, the universe, life, and humans. Biologists use the term \u201csingularity\u201d to refer to events or properties that are single or unique, for instance, landmarks in the history of life. Speaking from a broader perspective, Spanish biochemist Juan Or\u00f3 says that there are three large singularities in the world: the universe, life, and humans. The problem with this statement is that there are two mutually inconsistent physical theories competing to describe Or\u00f3\u2019s first singularity, the universe. The solution to this conundrum first requires understanding that the problem of the origin of the universe belongs in the same category as the other two solved by Darwin. Once the necessity of a simpler body is realized, its nature is easy to elaborate. What follows is the question of how such a space-less, timeless body fits in the framework of science. Realizing its relationship with the many weirdnesses of quantum mechanics requires much harder work. At its inception, the present work had nothing to do with physics. Its purpose was to device a way to a science of the fourth singularity, human history, but that is another story. (1) Life\u2019s Origin: The beginnings of biological evolution.

            "answer_text": "\u201cSince events before the Big Bang have no observational consequences, one may as well cut them out of the theory, and say that time began at the Big Bang. Events before the Big Bang, are simply not defined, because there's no way one could measure what happened at them.\u201d Hawking said. Also Hawking said: \u201cThe universe, and time itself, had a beginning in the Big Bang, about 15 billion years ago. The beginning of real time, would have been a singularity, at which the laws of physics would have broken down\u201d. The Big Bang theory and even the theory of inflation explain after the explosion and say nothing about before the Big Bang. ). According to general relativity, the initial state of the universe, at the beginning of the Big Bang, was a singularity. A gravitational singularity or space-time singularity is a location where the quantities that are used to measure the gravitational field become infinite in a way that does not depend on the coordinate system. These quantities are the scalar invariant curvatures of space-time, which includes a measure of the density of matter. For the purposes of proving the Penrose\u2013Hawking singularity theorems, a space-time with a singularity is defined to be one that contains geodesics that cannot be extended in a smooth manner. The end of such a geodesic is considered to be the singularity. This is a different definition, useful for proving theorems. The two most important types of space-time singularities are curvature singularities and conical singularities. Singularities can also be divided according to whether they are covered by an event horizon or not (naked singularities). Both general relativity and quantum mechanics break down in describing the Big Bang. The initial singularity was the gravitational singularity of infinite density thought to have contained all of the mass and space-time of the Universe, before quantum fluctuations caused it to rapidly expand in the Big Bang and subsequent inflation, creating the present-day Universe. The initial singularity is part of the Planck epoch, the earliest period of time in the history of the universe. Expanding universe is explainable by Friedman equation. How we can review the Friedmann equation at the moment of explosion and before of it? So, for answer the question: What was here before the Big Bang? I never accepted zero volume and infinite density of singularity. We need review the Friedmann equation at time was zero, when and how the Big Bang was happened. We can start with this question, if the universe collapses, will it reach to infinite density and zero volume? Or is there a force that will counteract it? In the other word, we need a new definition of singularity. In recent decades, the structure of photon is discussed and physicists are studying the photon structure. Some evidence shows the photon consists of a positive and a negative charges. In addition, new experiment shows that the probability of absorption at each moment depends on the photon's shape, also photons are some 4 meters long which is incompatible with unstructured concept. It means we should review our understanding of energy. Einstein treated matter and energy as exchangeable. He established law of mass- energy equivalence; through his famous formula E=mc^2. Let's review and develop the concept of mass- energy equivalence. According to relation E=mc^2, energy is matter diluted, or matter is energy intensive. There are many articles that show, photon has upper limit mass and electric charge, which are consistent with experimental observations. Theories and experiments have not limited to photons and graviton will also be included. For gravity there have been vigorous debates about even the concept of graviton rest mass. For study and understanding the photon structure we need to describe relation between frequency and energy of photon. The change of frequency of the photon in the gravitational field has been demonstrated by the Pound-Rebka experiment. When photon falls a distance equal y toward the earth, according to conservation law of energy we have: Color-charges and magnetic-color A photon with the lowest possible energy also carries electric and magnetic fields. Therefore, the features of gravitons entered into the structure of the photon must behave in a way that along with explaining the energy of photon, describes increasing in intensity of electric and magnetic fields. In other words, some of these gravitons cause increasing the electric field of photon and some other gravitons increase the intensity of magnetic fields. Also, not only a photon at lowest level of its energy is formed by some of the gravitons, but also its formed members have electric and magnetic properties that is called color-charge and magnetic-color in CPH theory. The next step is to specify color-charges and magnetic-colors in which it is obtained by paying attention to at least change in energy of photon in a gravitational field while moving into blue shift of gravity.  By producing positive and negative electric fields, two magnetic fields are produced around the electric fields do form. Therefore, it will be made two groups of magnetic-colors. So CPH matrix is defined as follows:  CPH matrix shows the least magnitude energy of a photon. Sub-Quantum Energy (SQE) We use CPH matrix to define positive and negative sub quantum energies as follow: The first column of CPH matrix is defined positive sub quantum energy and the second column of CPH matrix is defined negative sub quantum energy, so;  The amount of speed and energy of positive and negative sub quantum energies are equal, and the difference between them are only in the sign of their color-charges and magnetic-color flow direction. Virtual photons There are two types of virtual photons, positive and negative virtual photons which are defined as follows:  A real photon is formed of a positive virtual photon and a negative virtual photon:  There, n and k are natural numbers. So far, the production of electromagnetic energy (photons) was described by using gravitational blue-shift, in reverse phenomena photons decay to negative and positive virtual photons. In redshift, virtual photons also decay to positive and negative sub quantum energies (SQEs), and sub quantum energies (SQEs) decay to color-charges and magnetic-colors, too. Color-charges and magnetic-colors away from each other, lose their effect on each other and become gravitons. In addition, there is a relation between the number of SQEs in structure of photon and energy (also frequency) of photon.  So, photons are combination of positive and negative virtual photons. Photon is a very weak electric dipole that is consistent with the experience and these articles are asserted. In addition, this property of photon (very weak electric dipole) can describe the absorption and emission energy by charged particles. A new definition of singularity According to general relativity, the initial state of the universe, at the beginning of the Big Bang, was a singularity. Both general relativity and quantum mechanics break down in describing the Big Bang. My question is, if the universe collapses, will it reach to infinite density and zero volume? Or is there a force that will counteract it? In 1917, Einstein assumed: \"the universe as a whole is static - i.e., its large-scale properties do not vary with time.\" In 1922, Friedmann showed that there exist expanding solutions that are unbounded with hyperbolic geometry. The differential equations that he derived were  After Hubble discoveries on the universe's expansion, Friedmann\u2019s equation was as follows:  In other words, Friedmann raised the possibility of a dynamic universe, which changes in size over time. In fact, Friedmann introduced the expression \u201cexpanding universe.\u201d In the 1990s, experimental observations showed that the expansion of the universe is accelerating and dark energy is tending to accelerate the expansion of the universe. According to the standard Big Bang theory, our universe sprang into existence as \"singularity\". What is a \u2018\u2018singularity\u2019\u2019 and where does it come from? Well, to be honest, we don't know for sure. Singularities are zones which defy our current understanding of physics. They are thought to exist at the core of \u2018\u2018black holes.\u2019\u2019 The pressure is thought to be so intense that finite matter is actually squished into infinite density (a mathematical concept which truly boggles the mind). These zones of infinite density are called \u2018\u2018singularities.\u2019\u2019 Our universe is thought to have begun as an infinitesimally small, infinitely hot, infinitely dense, something - a singularity. Where did it come from? We don't know. Why did it appear? We don't know. To answer these questions, let\u2019s pass across the black hole and reach the formation of the absolute black hole by specifying the limits of Newton's second law and gravitation law, then the singularity will be explained in the explosion of an absolute black hole. According to this approach in the singularity state is: volume will not be zero, density will be limited. This is just a simple and intuitive definition of an absolute black hole, but we should define an absolute black hole by using the scientific concepts and cosmological equations and analyzing its results. According to CPH Theory, energy (also all sub atomic particle) is formed of sub quantum energy (SQE). The amount speed V(SQE) of SQE, is constant, but the amounts of transmission speed V(SQET) and non-transmission speed V(SQES) are not constant, by decreasing the amount transmission speed of V(SQET) is added to the amount non transmission speed V(SQES) and vice versa. Each of these values is maximum when another value is zero that is given by:  Thus, according to the direction of external force which was affected on a particle/object, the total non-transmission speeds rate is converted to the transmission speeds or to the inverse. Now we can define an absolute black hole. But before explanations, it is necessary to define two terms of sub quantum divergence and sub quantum converges; 1- Sub quantum Divergence: if a particle/object falls in the gravitational toward a massive body, and the linear speed of its (SQEs) will be V(SQET), we say that the object has sub quantum divergence (Figure). 2- Sub quantum Convergence: if total transmission speeds SQEs of a particle/object go to zero, we say that the object has sub quantum convergence (Figure). So;   Sub-quantum Divergence and Convergence Definition of an absolute black hole: If a particle/object falls down into the absolute black hole, it will be involved in sub quantum divergence before reaching the surface of the absolute black hole. Consider the absolute black hole swallowing more matter; its mass and thus its gravitational field intensity will be increase. By increasing the mass, volume is reducing, its constituent SQEs is condensed and its transitional space will be limited. Definition of Singularity: An absolute black hole with very high density under two followed conditions reaches the singularity state: 1) Its constituent SQEs reach sub quantum convergence state. So the linear speed of everything on the surface of absolute black hole goes to zero, 2) Due to the gravitational pressure, the average distance between SQEs of an absolute black hole goes to zero. They are scattered around and these chain scattering are spread everywhere inside the absolute black hole and therefore the singularity is occurred. The density is very high in the singularity state, but not infinite. In addition, the volume does not reach to zero, but the average the distance between SQEs reach to zero. Given above descriptions can easily explain counteracting Newton's second law and gravity. Given the above themes, there are three basic limitations: transmission speed, non-transmission speed and density that they are the reason of creation the observable universe and all physical phenomena existing in it. Now, by using the Friedmann\u2019s equation the Big Bang will be reviewed. Right side of the Friedman equation, has given for real space-time and is used for after the Big Bang, because k determined the geometrical properties of space-time and c is the speed of light in a vacuum is constant, but given that the speed of light is not constant in gravitational field and it is zero for surface and inside of an absolute black hole. So if we want to solve the Friedmann\u2019s equation for absolute black hole, we must consider the speed of light to zero and the equation becomes as follows:  Assuming R is not zero (which is a reasonable assumption because the notion that, if the universe collapses, it will not vanish volume and it is not reasonable that universe was created of nothing). We take the square root of the above equation, so we have:  For t=0 the initial radius of the universe is obtained (at the moment of the Big Bang). Above equation is an exponential function that shows in the first moments after the explosion, expansion of the universe was very fast. In addition, because of the big bang, Newton's second law contrasts with the law of gravitational law, in this confrontation, Newton\u2019s second law, and the universal gravitational law is neutralized. In the early moments after the Big Bang the speed limit was not the speed of light c, because SQEs collide with each other, everything, even the photons were decomposed and the speed limit could have one of two values SQE speed V(SQE). So, we can write:  Classical mechanics and relativity (special and general) describe the acceleration is an explanation of outward of phenomena regardless of the properties of sub quantum scales. It should be noted that the interaction between large objects (e.g. collision of two bodies) under the action of the quantum layer (in fact sub quantum layer) done. In sub quantum level, the amount of speed is constant, in any condition and any space, and in any interaction linear momentum changes to nonlinear momentum and vice versa. According to SQE, we are able to show there is not a zero volume with infinite density in singularity also before the Big Bang.

            "answer_text": "The Big Bang theory is not a theory of the creation of the universe. Full stop. Done. Call it. Burn that sentence into your brain. Say it before you go to sleep, and first thing when you wake up. The big bang theory is a model of the evolution of universe, tracing the evolution of the cosmos to its very earliest moments. And that's it. Don't try to stuff anything else into that framework. Just stop. Going back before 10^-36 seconds, we simply don't understand the nature of the universe. The Big Bang theory is fantastic at describing everything \u201cafter\u201d that, but before it, we're a bit lost. Get this: At small enough scales, we don't even know if the word \"before\" even makes sense! At incredibly tiny scales (and I'm talking tinier than the tiniest thing you could possible imagine), the quantum nature of reality rears its ugly head at full strength, rendering our neat, orderly, friendly space-time into a broken jungle gym of loops and tangles and rusty spikes. Notions of intervals in time or space don't really apply at those scales. There are, of course, some ideas out there , models that attempt to describe what \"ignited\" or \"seeded\" the Big Bang, but at this stage, they're pure speculation. If these ideas can provide observational clues \u2014 for example, a special imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background. So, at this moment, it\u2019s impossible to say how Big Bang happened or what existed before As I understand Big Bang cosmology and the inflationary theory, the two are distinct. The Big Bang indeed being a cosmogenic model, whereas the inflationary theory is cosmological. While the latter describes the evolution of the universe, the former is a suggestion for its creation, which doesn't specify the exact means by which this inception occurred, allowing for suggestions such as quantum fluctuations or the collision of membranes in string theory.

            "answer_text": "Your \u201cif\u201d is a false assumption and so your question sort of stops before it even takes off. But, your wonder is fair because it is often - and incorrectly - stated as such in popular magazines or articles. You see, when you read about how \u201ctime\u201d, \u201cspace\u201d and everything began at a moment dubbed \u201cthe Big Bang\u201d; it is not \u201ctime\u201d, \u201cspace\u201d and \u201ceverything\u201d in general. That is a misconception. It is only time and space within the framework of the cosmological model. In the General Theory of Relativity, the observable universe is viewed as a geometric coordinate system consisting of four dimensions. Three are spatial and one temporal (often referred to as time). This theory is the prime theory predicting a time, 13.8 billion years ago, where this coordinate system was highly compressed down to a single point. So since everything we can observe today sprung from this point (aka the Big Bang) and we can say, from a certain point of view, that everything began then. This includes this coordinate system of four dimensions. However, the General Theory of Relativity only concerns the observable universe. Not the whole Universe, whatever it may be and this is the point often missed. Out there, somewhere, we may have similar or even vastly different types of coordinate systems. We cannot say with any degree of certainty, because our observations and our equations don\u2019t permit us to peek there yet\u2026 and so, your wonder is fair and it is, in fact, supported by what we think we know about the history of our universe; time has, perhaps, been eternally present. We do not know but there is no scientific theory claiming otherwise. The Big Bang tells us how it was shortly after a beginning, not from where this beginning came. There is hope, though. We may be able to figure it out still but to do this, we need first to formulate a theory that combines gravity with quantum mechanics. This, we do not have yet and so we cannot peek further back, yet. However and importantly; not knowing it, does not mean knowing it is not.  You also have to realize that time is an effect of physical factors such as speed and gravity. Time is relative; it is not autonomous and, therefore, dependant on these factors. Remove these factors (like under the conditions of a pre-big bang) and you remove this dependency but, all in all, only relevant within the framework of the cosmological model that is our universe but not necessarily the whole Universe.  Above is an artist's rendition of a bubble universe. Each bubble has its own coordinate system, with each their own time-dimension. Such illustrations help to better understand why the observable universe need not be final. We are one bubble amongst a sea of other bubbles - all of which have their own \u201ctime\u201d. Alas, your \u201cif\u201d must be dismissed.  Thank you for your question, Mahmoud. ",

            "answer_text": "Time: Time always exists. The very question of what came before, is a measure of time, thus requires the existence of time. Everything is a result of variations in the fabric of space and time. Black hole: A black hole is a planet whose gravity has exceeded the outward force, and infinitely collapsing in on itself. The event horizon is the point where the force, or distortion of time, exceeds the speed of light. Measuring time: a second is measured as the number of wavelengths passing a fixed point. Light moving away from the event horizon would have its wavelengths compressed, infinitely compressed at the event horizon. In short the light at the event horizon will never reach an external observer. Essentially space and time is passing infinitely fast at the event horizon. The centre of the black hole is said to converge to what we refer to as a singularity. Milkyway: at the centre of our galaxy is a super massive black hole. It acts like a large cooking pot. As orbiting stars and planets get too close to the centre, the black hole can start feeding, releasing vast amounts of energy and potentially turning the galaxy into a quasar, where the entire galaxy is on fire. This is where the heaviest elements are formed. Eventually enough mass is thrown clear of the centre and the black hole goes dormant. Big bang: To the external observer, when a star collapses infinitely we observe that as a black hole. To an internal observer, inside the black hole, the event is a big bang. It is the formation of a new universe. Starship (external): Consider observing a space ship heading towards a black hole. You would see them move towards it, but given the light would take longer and longer to reach you, they would never reach the event horizon. Starship (internal): now consider you are the one heading into the black hole. As you head towards the event horizon you watch the external observer. Given you are accelerating towards the event horizon, time will be perceived as normal, however space will expand rapidly resulting in the observer and stars moving away at speeds vastly exceeding the speed of light as a result of lensing. It will be like shrinking. By the time you hit the event horizon, ignoring spaghettification, all the stars would have moved infinitely far away. Passing the event horizon means you are in a new universe, where time is passing infinitely faster than on the outside. Your perception of this infinite time is infinite space at a new normal time. You could not reach the boundary flying at the speed of light in any direction. Starship (time travel): the space craft heading towards the event horizon could fire it's engine to fly back out. Everything would be extremely far away, but as you climb out lensing will begin to rapidly reduce the distances. More importantly, wave lengths of time passing you will be extremely compressed, meaning that time is passing vastly faster than normal. Many hundreds or thousands of years could have passed in what you perceive as little as hours or days. Escape: There is no way for us to move from our universe to the parent universe that birthed the black hole. Relative to our parent universe, our universe will evaporate through hawking radiation and expire. Relative to us however our universe will last forever, and will never expire. Hawking radiation: micro black holes form all the time, however they last an extremely short time as they evaporate through hawking radiation. Large black holes seemingly last forever, because hawking radiation is extremely slow relative to us, matter and antimatter acting at the boundary of the event horizon leaking energy at wavelengths exceeding that of the event horizon; eventually evaporating the black hole into nothing. Singularities: so just as you can zoom out or in infinitely, you also get extreme distortion of time forming points, singularities of time, that form a new universe. These form infinite universes or multiverse that are in turn infinite. Maths: models our universe. Consider the set of numbers one to ten. The number one can be divided infinitely into another set. Each point can be divided infinitely, just as you can make greater and greater sets. In maths we can prove difference sizes of infinity. Home: so while our universe will be created and evaporated in the parent universe, relative to us our universe will last forever. While our parent universe will shed a tear for our eventual demise, relative to us that will never happen. Mass: all mass ultimately is a result of singularities spinning around each other to form large unit structures. Quantum mechanics: the double slit experiment is meant to prove Schroedingers cat, simultaneously alive and dead. That a single photon passes through both slits simultaneously to form a super position. There is a simpler explanation. The photon rides a time wave front, and the wave front passes through both holes, and the photon is redirected by riding the superposition of the wave fronts. [This could potentially be proven using new photographic techniques allowing us to take trillions of frames a second and thus watch light in \u201cslow motion\u201d as a single photon approaches and passes through the double slit] Quantum entanglement: consider two black holes that pass by each other very fast, but kiss for the briefest moment, resulting in the event horizon connecting. The result is that while the two singularities can be extremely far apart, the connection cannot be broken. Given time inside the singularities passes infinitely fast, any effect on one singularity can instantly effect the other. ",

            "answer_text": "You perhaps need to rephrase the question. The Big Bang theory is a theory based on General Relativity that explains that the universe expands (as derived from GR itself and observed by the redshift-distance relation by Hubble) and therefore in the past was smaller, hotter and denser. The Big Bang theory itself does not say what started the expansion or what was before. The Big Bang theory does NOT state that the universe started as an infinitely dense point (singularity). That is something most people don\u2019t quite understand and equate the \u2018big bang theory\u2019 (the currently accepted standard model of cosmology) with the idea that everything started with a singularity. The last idea is wrong, and here is why. The model only takes into account General Relativity and ignores quantum mechanics, so other forces/interactions, like electro-magnetism, strong and weak nuclear force, are completely ignored. Such an approximation works as long as all the other forces are comparitively small (as compared to gravitation). For the weak and strong nuclear force this is the case as long as distances are large enough. For electro-magnetism (which itself extends infinite range, like gravity, but is much stronger then gravity) the approximation is good as long as at that distance scale matter is electrical neutral and thus the resultant electric/magnetic forces can be neglected. NB. There is a different cosmological idea, the electric universe, which claims that electrical and magnetic forces do not cancel even at large scales, and therefore the big bang model is wrong. Electric universe theory might be at least in part correct for the claim that electric and magnetic forces have more influence on galaxy/star and planetary formation as previously understood, but the claim that electric/magnetic forces dominate the evolution of the whole universe (instead of gravity) is supposedly wrong. The assumptions on which the cosmological model in the big bang theory is based however break down near the point of singularity when distance scales become arbitrarily small, and that is why the model can no longer claim to be correct without taking into account conrtributions of the other forces. But there is no theory at hand that combines both GR and QM. That is a topic of active research and theory construction (loop quantum gravity, string theory/M theory). So, what started the expansion of the universe? An explenation that is widely accepted is that of inflationary cosmology, that explains that before the expansion of the universe there was a very brief period of exponential expansion due to repulsive gravity. Inflation ends because the field that causes the exponential expansion decays. Inflation can explain the homogeneity with the right amount of fluctuations (stretched out quantum fluctuations) to explain stucture formation (galaxies, etc.), why the density of the universe is so very close to critical density (if only a tiny bit less dense, the universe would be almost empty, if only a tiny bit denser, the universe would have already collapsed on itself). The question about \"what was before the big bang\" also is left to pre-Big Bang theories, of which inflationary theory is still the dominant explenation. Inflationary cosmology also predicted gravitational waves, which in the near future will be observed. ",

            "answer_text": "The term \u201ctime\u201d is applied to all activity. And can only be determined by activity. And activity is applied to a flow of events. No matter how small, short or intense. Without activity, time does not exist. The Big Bang is considered the starting point for all activity. What remains to be determined is was there \u201cactivity\u201d prior to the Big Bang? Since we cannot access the condition prior to the Big Bang, we cannot determine if activity existed. Thus, it is assumed that time did not exist. We also assume that space also did not exist prior to the Big Bang. Thus, once the Big Bang occurred only then did both space and time come into existence. Space and time are currently considered to be connected to each other. A space/time fabric so to speak. Of course, this is all speculation. What is not being considered is that something must have created all this energy, matter, dark matter and dark energy. And apparently from nothing. Which is very difficult to both imagine and swallow. However, I suspect that in that infinitely dense singularity that is believed to have existed before time and space began, virtual particles may have also come and gone. Their emergence and disappearance could have deposited energy to the point that eventually the singularity could no longer contain what had accumulated. Thus the Big Bang. If such virtual particles were, in fact, coming and going, then time did exist before the Big Bang. But in a state or dimension not yet understood or even currently imaginable. Then there is the question of quantum existence? At what point did it emerge, if ever? Plus, there is always the possibility that the Big Bang is actually still occurring. Only that it is now so subtle due to the expansion of space, that we simply do not notice it. Yet it is believed that virtual particles are still popping in and out of existence at the quantum level.

            "answer_text": "First, a bit of meta-answering. This question has the following form, which is quite common here at Quora: \u201cIf [premise] then why [impossible or unreasonable thing] ?\u201d Questions of this form usually have one of two answers: a) The premise is false. b) The impossible or unreasonable thing actually never happened. Since we can observe the universe around us, it is safe to say that it happened. So we can conclude that there is something wrong with the premise that space and time did not exist before the big bang. The big bang is just a term for a time when conditions in the universe were so different from what we see today that we cannot confidently predict what came before it. That does not mean that space and time didn\u2019t exist. It just means that what we have learned about physics by observing the universe around us has not given us enough information to understand the universe back then. Using what we know about physics, we can extrapolate backward, to a time when the matter and energy we see today was very compact and very hot. But at some point, it all appears to have been so compact and hot that we can\u2019t make confident predictions about how it would have behaved. And we can\u2019t predict what state it was in prior to that state. Newton\u2019s physics gave us a pretty good understanding of how things behave at everyday speeds, but it didn\u2019t make good predictions about how things behave at very high speeds or very small scales. For that, we needed a new way of looking at things - Einstein\u2019s physics. But even that still doesn\u2019t tell us enough to make good predictions about how things behave under very high temperature and pressure. For that, we need to make more observations of the highest temperatures and pressures that we can study - which is where things like the Large Hadron Collider come in. We\u2019re still learning. The big bang represents the limits of our understanding of the universe - which is not the same thing as the limits of the universe. It makes no sense to leap from \u201cwe don\u2019t know what happened earlier\u201d to \u201cthere was nothingness earlier.\u201d There was something. We\u2019re not sure what it was like, but we\u2019re investigating. ",

            "answer_text": "I like this question because it is an obvious one if you postulate the Big bang as being the beginning of the universe. The theory of the Big bang as the origin of the universe answers nothing! It is too much like creationism and Genesis! \u201cGod said, \u201cLet there be light\u201d. And there was light\u201d. And so on. The Big Bang theory does not improve on Genesis! Intelligent men of 3000 plus years ago were also puzzled by where everything came from. They knew, as we know today that everything has a beginning and an end and so they enquired as to what was the beginning of everything they knew about the world. Because we are intelligent beings, who have been subjected to worldly finite happenings, throughout our history, we naturally think of beginnings and ends, but suppose one suspends this belief: the universe, therefore, becomes infinite in both age and size. It has always been here and always will be. It extends to infinity in every direction. Postulating that this is the case, it is not surprising that, just by chance, a planet like Earth exists and there is nothing like it for a very long way into space. Modern theoretical physicists with all the knew observations of the universe to think upon, know that they can only see the observable universe, because there is an unknown quantity of universe beyond that which can be seen. The Big Bang theory was a neat idea and explained many of the then observations, but cannot now be a good theory, unless we can observe the extremities of he universe, which, if it is infinite, can never be achieved. Stephen Hawking, in his book, \u201cA Brief History of Time\u201d, (which I have read 61 times), states that at the point of Big Bang, time also started as space was created, but if time had been effectively halted, how did it move forward to point of Big Bang.  Yes, indeed, the question is a good one. ",

            "answer_text": "this is just my personal speculation and isn\u2019t based on anything but I think time had existed is existing and always will exist. Also I consider time as a sort of type of energy, or fuel for other energies so to say.If time didn\u2019t exist then everything would be at stand still, it doesn't matter if you\u2019re near the event horizon of a black hole, u won\u2019t fall in because it requires time for you to be sucked in by huge gravity. you\u2019ll just spend an eternity floating in a same position.soo this is my view of the space time.there exists 2 planes that are parallel to each other, 1 plane that is always at a standstill(space) and other plane that is always moving(time).these to planes always affect each other, as you are there sitting at your computer bending space with your mass you re also bending time by bending space.So space is where we exist but time is a force that affects everyone and everything from every direction at the same time\u2026. let me give you an exampletake 2 pieces of paper and put them on top of each other so that it looks like it s just one paper.now take it into one hand and hold the paper/s with only the tip of your fingers, you\u2019ll notice that the papers are bent somewhere in the middle, well that is you, the center of the universe bending space by solely your mass, and so time is being \u201cpulled\u201d by the \u201cgravitational force\u201d of space and being bent itself. (let s call it quantum gravity)Now that we have a bent spacetime let s add a single atom floating around you (I choose gravity as a force to explain this because it is not affected by \u201cfree will\u201d), and so that atom will fall into space that you are bending and the closer it is to you the force pulling it will be greater and it will move faster\u2026 but how does it move?well as time affects that atom from every direction you\u2019d think the forces of time would just cancel each other out but that is not the case because of quantum gravity the force pushing atom towards yourself will be greater. so time = energySo how is this related to the creation of everything?Well time and space always existed even before the big bang I believe, as universe is constantly spreading, it\u2019s spreading into \u201cspace\u201d or nothingness so to say or void.So time and space existed before the big bang so how did everything come to exist?now put those pieces of paper that are on top of each other on a table or some other flat surface, you\u2019ll notice that they are completely flatwell that\u2019s basically it, as time is pulled by space and they are flat on each other and as there is nothing on or in space there are no bendings of time and space, but time moves constantly so as it moves (just like tectonic plates) it get\u2019s stuck somewhere in space and as it tries to move it makes a big \u201clump\u201d (time is bended but space isn\u2019t) and as that lump increases in size(time wanting to move) and as quantum gravity pulls it towards space it flats out with a big boom, \u201cmaking\u201d a lot of energy, and as we all know it E=MC^2 so it s quite easy to make mass out of energy (with that much energy that was relised by that big boom) and so this process had occurred for an infinite number of times (and in different places making it possible for infinite number of universes) and so that\u2019s how universe was created\u2026 I think\u2026 this is just something I thought and talked with during history class so don\u2019t take it too seriously but I m open for criticism (but please be gentle) ",

            "answer_text": "To begin, let\u2019s step around the human-centred experience of time. Rather, time is an ordering of states of the universe - what happens first and what happens next. We don\u2019t need to worry about complicated discussions relating to relativity and entropy to consider an answer to the question. So we are referring to an ontic ordering, meaning it is about the order of existence, in particular, states of the universe (and everything). Hence, in this context we are asking for something that existed ontically prior to the Big Bang. We are looking for first-cause. The question pivots on philosophical (metaphysical) reasoning because anything ontologically prior to the Planck time (the shortest sensible unit of time) is not a question that physics can answer - it is outside the discipline. First-cause was argued to be necessary, meaning essentially inescapable, by Aristotle. He said, and others agree (e.g. Leibniz\u2019s principle of sufficient reason) that everything has a cause. However, he noted that this led to an infinite regress that would mean there would be no way for things to start. He therefore supposed there must be an uncaused cause, an unmoved mover, a cause that was the cause of itself. This sounds a little odd, but in a more contemporary setting, he is saying there must be some condition of the world that always was, and always will be. Such a cause exists independently from time. It would exist at the origin, indeed, in a sense it would be the origin. It must have brought the world into existence, including space and time. So the Big Bang\u2019s initiation is independent of time. This ends my answer to the question asked. However, if such foundational matters are your interest and you wish to go deeper, this hyperlink may be of value: How to Build a Universe from Wheeler\u2019s Immaterial Source, in Nine Pages or Less. by Stephen James Anastasi In that essay, I propose the cause and foundational nature of time, as well as why time has an arrow, and how structure evolves. This essay was followed recently by: A cold bang: thoughts on the Planck mass as an entry point into quantum gravity. by Stephen James Anastasi. ",

SpaceEnergyMatterEinstein gave the famous equation e=m c^2 This reduces the ingredients to: SpaceEnergyI will try to explain relationship of space & energy with help of an example. Say you have to dig out sand from a flat plane. You take a shovel and dig the sand out. After few hours of labour you would have made a hole in the earth. But at the same time you would have created a pile of sand that you have dug out. Energy-Space are like the hole in the earth and the pile of sand. Each cannot exist with out the other. While each perfectly cancels out the other. *Here by energy, I am including all forms of energy/matter (including dark energy and dark matter) Black holes are a great lab to understand the universe. We know that time is relative and varies from place to place. If we take an indestructible wall clock to vicinity of a black hole and fling it towards the event horizon. We will observe that seconds hand of wall clock slowing down till the point it completely stops- as the wall gets sucked into the point of singularity. The clock stops because inside black hole time itself do not exist. If we go back in time- the universe shrinks till it is infinitesimally small and infinitesimally dense. And as it is in the case of black hole- time itself stops. Therefore we can safely conclude that before the big bang there was no time. Now, how did the Universe pop out? In quantum physics, weird is the normal. We have many sub atomic particles that pop in and pop out of existence is millionth of a second- - without violating any known laws of physics. Therefore it is entirely possible that one such sub-atomic particle popped out and led to the birth of the universe. End of the universe: Latest scientific observation is that space is expanding and galaxies are growing apart. The Gravity (glue that binds galaxies) is not strong enough to reverse the expansion. Overtime galaxies will scatter further and further and Universe will become a lonely and a cold place. After last of stars burn out the fuel- black holes will still be around. However, as per Hawking radiation theory- black holes lose small amount of energy. When the black holes run out of material to swallow, slowly black holes will shrink as they lose energy. This process may take trillions of years. Trillions of years may look very long but it is still far short of forever. ",

I don\u2019t like to explain jokes but I made a parallel of Getting the Universe from Nothing (using Inflation, etc) to Money is for Nothing and the Chicks for Free\u2026(Dire Straits) This extra explanation is for the benefit of Peter Woodward..:) If I \u2019ve never mentioned before, please free free to edit my grammar. I will always thank you for any correction. Also feel free to criticize the content of what I write here. It doesn\u2019t cost any money. ################################################### Comments: Peter Woodward Hey Marco! Before expanding upon the universe, maybe go back and learn spelling, and grammar, and sentence construction. MP Answered: Feel free to suggest edits\u2026 I will always be grateful\u2026:) When you have something intelligent to say related to the question, that will also be nice.. ",

            "answer_text": "All Big Bang theories have problems. They do not predict nor explain Dark Energy and Dark Matter that make up 96 % of the universe. So Big Bang at most could explain 4% of the universe if it were true. That is not impressive. So top scientists now distance themselves from the Big Bang theory. Ordinary people are unaware of this and still continue with the theory. But look at the problems. Something starts the Big Bang. Lovely scientific word, \"Something\". What was it? No-one has the faintest clue. Lovely science this. We are dealing with something that we know nothing about. Precision Physics at its best. So we start guessing where we have no facts to work with. Good science? Not really. Physics has no laws of creation. Start with nothing and there are no laws of Physics which can produce something. Scientists dodge this by claiming that the vacuum has energy. Sorry. Energy is something. So if you just assume there is energy, you have just assumed a massive step of creation from nothing. In the process you have violated the most basic of Physics laws, the law of conservation of energy that says energy cannot get created. So you just cannot get going if you are honest and start with nothing. Look at the one answer. We have something infinitely dense, infinitely hot, and infinitely small. Lovely. Where did it come from? No answer. You just have to keep guessing in a complete absence of physical evidence. This theory requires three infinities. The entire universe that we have does not have a single infinity (other than human stupidity as Einstein suggested). So claiming to somehow have three infinities at the start is physically impossible. Why not make it easier and just assume one Infinity and call Him God? But God would never create in such a cumbersome manner as the Big Bang. Now ask where your poles come from? And what charged them up? And what made them touch? And what was it that exploded or expanded? Listen to the answer, time was created in the Big Bang. We do not even know what time is. We cannot even measure time. We measure the movement of a pointer across a watch face, we do not measure time. If we have no idea what time is, then how can we say how time was created. Just complete guesswork. Physics has no laws of creation. Creation from nothing, no energy no anything, is not possible within the known laws of Physics. ",

That's the theory anyway...All these infinities are troublesome!Oh! \"Big Bang\" doesn't exist either!Time has stopped. You just can't get there from here!The model falls apart.Unity contains all possibility.One possibility is Expansion.There is no Bang, because there is no Space to Bang into. There is just Expansion. Expansion creates SpaceTime. Density decreases. Temperature decreases. Time starts to flow, is the flow, of Expansion. Relative to Time in our frame of reference, we say this took X nanoseconds, or hours, or millions-billions of years, but in the frame of the expanding singularity Time is barely moving. It all still takes forever.Expansion is forever. And, it took forever to get where we are.Unity always existed, and will always exist. One eternal NOW.No problem here.It's all in your mind...Now, the next Act.If Unity can expand, can it also contract? Does it have to?Since Unity is sum of all possibilities, then this must be possible. Will our Universe eventually contract?Are we part of a Multiverse of infinite Universes? Another possibility. Answer?Unknown. Not testable. At least not with current technology. Hopefully better minds than mine will find an answer. Not to worry! The Universe is what it is, wether we understand it or not. ",

            "answer_text": "Time does not exist by itself. Time does not exist now. Time is effected by perturbative sequence of events. If there are no events, there is no time. Let\u2019s say you are a signal segment in a high density rotational disk drive. There was a time when disk drives had a sync-track or clock-track. Then signals were recorded onto other tracks using the sync-track as the clocking signal. But then as signal frequencies gradually increased, due to increase in rotational speed as well as signal-track densities, the drift between the sync-track with recorded signal became increasingly inconsistent. The simple but great solution worthy of a Nobel prize was, why not make every track a clocking signal track? Such that, a bit-value-1 would effect a change in phase of the clock. If bit-value-0, no phase change would be effected. Or use the converse strategy, where bit-0 would effect phase change, while bit-1 wouldn\u2019t. Voila! The self-clocking signal. Wherein you as a signal segment is aware of time, due to the signal progression itself. Outside the universe existing on your hard disk, time as you know it does not exist. Time in the hard disk did not start until there was a signal sequence recorded, where the platter rotation is the conceptual aether of your Universe. Due to some geniuses in England supplemented by those in Massachusetts, your existence is independent of the angular speed of the platter. Some \u201ctime ago\u201d, there was a conceptual big bang transcribed on the disk platter, which eventually led to your existence in \u201ctime\u201d. In your Universe, you would never know if Almighty Allah would regularly spin-down the disk for \u201cregular\u201d maintenance. Not very precise allegory, I know. The Universe is a self-clocking signal. Outside our Universe, there is no time as we know it. What is the topology of this signal? Is it concentric, radial, or linear scan, or interleaved linear? Topology is a relative concept. Let\u2019s say you are Prince Charming. You live in what you believe is a linear world. Your time and distances are linear. Or so you thought. One day, you met and fell in love with Snow White, who lived in what you observed is a temporally rotational world. So that you get to see and touch her \u201creality\u201d only once every 0.01 seconds. One day (your conceptual day), you asked her \u201cDo you know you live in a rotational world?\u201d To which she retorted, \u201cNo, I live in a linear world. You OTOH my love, live in an oscillatory hyperbolic world!\u201d What if you had fallen in love with Princess Snow who lived in a \u201crotational\u201d world which allows you to see and touch her reality once every Planck interval? What if every one of us had our own sub-Universe that reappears on the common plane every Planck interval? What if you were \u201ccreated\u201d abnormal, such that your traverse on the signal platter not in \u201clinear\u201d alignment to the rest of your fellow-humans? What if every human, every atom, every quark are all slightly misaligned from each other on their traverse on this Universal platter? What if there is mutual-parallax in the perception of time (and distance, and rotation, and rarefaction) progression among every single quark in the Universe? What if, due to some geniuses in Massachusetts, it was decided that some signal segments would be transcribed the converse way, such that an elegant strategy exists to compact continuous sequences of no-change in phase? What would happen if a signal pattern encountered its own converse-pattern or anti-pattern? Anyway, silly me began to wonder, what if the instruments of measurement and the entity being measured are simply segments of the same signal? Of course the instruments and the \u201csignals\u201d being measured sit on the same substrate carrier. Of course! Then, doesn\u2019t that make the Michelson-Morley detect-the-aether experiment moot and pointless? Hence my question: Is Michelson-Morley capable of disproving that objects and instruments themselves are part of an aether? Silly me. ",

            "answer_text": "The time as we know it is related to cause-effect relationship and increase in entropy. The cause of Big Bang is outside our ability to know; at least with cause and effect relationships, as we have no means ( theoretical or practical) to to link any event outside our spacetime ( before the Big Bang is outside our spacetime) with any event inside our current spacetime. Also at the moment of Big Bang, the singularity was the moment of perfection, with everything in perfect symmetry, and so the entropy was minimum. Everything that has occurred after that moment of perfection is increasing the disorder, and therefore the entropy. So there is no way for us to measure or conceptualize any moment in time before the Big Bang The way to understand place of our universe in the bigger context is to imagine a multiverse, with 11 dimensions ( the number 11 is based on very complex mathematical reasoning that is beyond the scope for this answer). These dimensions can be considered as space or time, as both space and time are equivalent in this multiverse. Our universe is just a \u2018'bubble\u2019 within this larger continuum. Consider the earth\u2019s surface. At the exact point of North Pole, there is no North anywhere!!! If you move away from North Pole , in any direction, you are moving south. This may appear to be a strange singularity, but we know that North Pole is just one point on the surface of earth, and we know it because we can experience and understand 3-dimensional space, and earth\u2019s surface itself is a two dimensional D-brane ( a bubble) curved in 3-dimensional space. Similarly what appears to us as singularity at the moment of Big Bang ( there is no Past from that moment, just future - compare past / future to north /south in previous example) , is not a actual singularity in that 11 dimensional continuum, just an ordinary point in 11 dimensional spacetime. There could be other \u2018'bubbles\u2019 where laws of physics are very different; some may have more than one time dimensions, some may have no time dimension at all!! ( consider the realm of unchanging \u2018'Eternity\u2019 that many religions talk about) ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question. While no one quite knows how the big bang happened, there are several theories. According to one prevalent theory, big bang is a cyclic event caused by the 'big crunch' of the universe's earlier avatar. Another theory is that the universe 'popped into existence' at the big bang from a mother universe due to extreme curvature at a worm-hole singularity, which then severed itself like the umblical cord, hatching the baby universe. Refer drawing below (from The Mind of God by Paul Davies)  These are interesting theories, but just that - theories. We don't know for sure. I find the other aspect of the question, about time not existing before Big Bang, worth contemplating too. What is time? It is the interval between two events. Therefore, if there are no events, there is no concept of time. The existence of matter implies passage of time, because matter consists of subatomic particles in motion, and hence events. So does the release of energy in the form of radiation. Hence, if time doesn't exist, matter and energy can't exist. So what we have before the big bang is just vast, totally empty space devoid of the very basic building blocks of the universe as we know it - time, matter and energy. Hard to imagine. Even today, one of the most perplexing questions that scientists and philosophers are grappling with is : 'why is there something in the universe rather than nothing?'. It would been overwhelmingly more likely for the universe to not exist, than to do. Which implies that the conditions before the Big Bang, which we cannot even imagine, are actually the state of equilibrium for the cosmic reality. We have indeed come a long way. ",

            "answer_text": "Space and time came into existence at the moment of the big bang. Before the big bang there was no time or space in our universe. So it doesn\u2019t really make sense to ask what was before the big bang, because time did not exist. Keep in mind that the theory of the big bang was born out the observations by Edwin Hubble who was the first person to look into a very large telescope and see galaxies as clumps of stars. Before that, humans thought galaxies were just individual stars. When Hubble looked closer, he saw that all of the galaxies in the observable universe are flying apart at an increasing rate, a bit like a bomb exploding. So if we interpolate back to the moment when all of this matter and energy were together in one place, it should have been about 13.8 billion years ago. The other evidence which supports the big bang is that there is a microwave energy field which permeates all of space and is responsible for the static on your TV when its not tuned correctly. It is constantly reverberating with the echoes of the big bang in a way that is consistent with 13.8 billion years old figure for the age of the universe. In order to understand the theory of the big bang, you also need to understand the implications of Einstein\u2019s theory of special relativity. One of the implications of his theory is that space and time are not separate dimensions but linked in a type of fabric. At the moment that the big bang occurred space-time came into existence in our universe. Its possible that there are other alternative universes with different laws of physics there was a \u2018time\u2019 before the big bang in our universe but there is no evidence to support this, so as far as this is concerned we can only guess. But the theory of the big bang is based on observational evidence I have discussed above. ",

            "answer_text": "Even what existed before the universe is currently unknown, so it is not impossible that time did exist before Big Bang. According to the Big Bang theory, time, was created (or said, started) by the moment the Big Bang happen (spontaneously), that\u2019s to say that even if time evidently doesn\u2019t exist before universe was born, Big Bang could still happen. Just because humans can\u2019t figure out what was there before the universe even born, they started guessing. For one of those I think is more supported: Just the same universe, but before Big Bang: don\u2019t remember when did I read about this, the universe usually have a lifespan, after that, it is collapsed into a zero-dimensional point called singularity, and that\u2019s where the universe we used to live in born and start to expand and then approaching its end of life and then collapse again. You like sci-fi? I have also heard of one that suits your favourite: This universe was somehow created by a higher dimensional life, or to say, advanced civilisation: The quantum computer, as after you read what you tap into the link, will you be understood that this kind of technology have the capability of overpowering The intelligence of human, for which, if happened, would potentially extirpate our civilisation. There is a method for preventing this from happening: we trap the \u201cintelligence\u201d we created inside a virtual reality world (for which will be very advanced and identical to that of reality) and keep learning from the fast developing them. From the method we can think of, it is not weird that we are also a quantum computer created by some kind of civilisation, and the universe we observed today is the ultra realistic virtual reality mod that they have us trapped into. So it can be said that this universe can be the program of some earlier advanced civilisation. They are now looking into us, and learning from us, as we are smarter than them. ",

            "answer_text": " Time is a manmade cookie that crumbles in the face of physical laws. However, we need to have some form of measuring time that endless cycle that somehow corresponds to the rising and setting of the sun. For convenience sake we divide daylight and night into understandable parts. In reality eternity has no moving parts, no beginning and no end. Its just there without interference from cookies- the smart ones or the crumbled ones. In this concept of time without a beginning and ending we had a Big Bang. How else can we understand this monumental event into a phase without placing it in a timescale to position it for an understanding. It was possibly for this reason that the ancient Indians and Iraqis invented the zero to show a nothingness- an absolute and a point or place where nothing but eternity exists. Without that zero to add to that one apple or ten apples would really be one big apple with no definite shape or size of circumference. So it is with the Big Bang which is deemed to have happened that many ,many sunsets or moonlights away. Complex enough. That digital watch on your hand has a quartz crystal that vibrates billions of times when electricity passes through. Do we understand this? Possibly not. And so mathematics comes in to break up this vibration into manageable parts. So it is with a Big Bang. There was a \u2018time\u2019 when physical laws came into into existence in a brief second billions of times smaller than we can understand. From this almost negligible dense matter, everything sprung into action and the Universe happened. Mathematics tells us that it happened, 14.8 billions years ago! Don\u2019t ask me what was there before it ? As far as I can estimate everything was there exactly as it was but \u2018time\u2019 and \u2018space\u2019 came into being. We now understand that the Universe is Expanding. Expanding to where and why and how is still a mystery. One physicist says it is expanding into a space- but that space is unknown. Another brilliant physicist wrote to me this morning to say it is Contracting. So now we have a Big Bang, an Expanding Universe and a Contracting Universe. All seems to have happened at the same time in a \u2018space\u2019 we still don\u2019t understand. Do we need to understand this? Yes. It\u2019s that incredible search for who we are and how smart we can be in figuring this whole thing out. For now there was a Big Bang. There is an Expanding Universe and there is a Contracting Universe. That\u2019s good enough for me.today. Glad I contributed my 2 cents worth to this answer. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIf time didn't exist before the Big Bang, how could the Big Bang possibly have happened?\u201d Simply because before to get involved into dreaming the visible universe of the alpha brainwaves waking state, you are a non-local Soul - a Spiritual observer endowed with GODspeed, free of the restraints of the human brain. However, as soon as the dream-universe appears in a flash, at the midpoint between your eyes, the intellectual cloud-mind gets hypnotized into conceptualizing yourself as a prisoner hopelessly entangled with the DNA-brain-body. This hypnotic effect is called virtual immersion and also materialistic delusion.It happens on account of the reversed mirror effect of the wrapped space-time bubble, the inner center part of the wormhole tunnel in which the vision field gets manifested. This effect is best known as Maya.  This twisted faith is the actual meaning of the famous \u2018original sin\u2019 in biblical lore, which causes the downfall of the electro-gravitic starship of the Soul into s-lower musical harmonics, holographically generating the flesh body, or higher density spatialization, in the form of the double tetrahedron electro-magnetic field of our 3D physics, with it\u2019s own inertial and entropic qualities, gluing us to the ground and leading us to the grave rather than the negentropic bliss of immortality.Thus the original sin consists in believing that the phenomenal experience of the senses is our reality and that we MUST act upon it in order to survive primarily, and eventually to learn more about ourselves through the study of our physicality, inside our bodies of flesh, and outside in the external environment, the visible Universe and it\u2019s laws.We are wasting our lives away studying our own subconscious dream-world, convincing ourselves every second more of it\u2019s genuineness, rather than applying our focus on WAKING UP from the delusions perceived in the Hall Of Mirrors. In short, humanity is living in a deep hypnotic state and has established through scientific observation that this state is actually true lucidity and the only truth we can prove. This reversed faith is indeed responsible for the \u2018Fall Of Man\u2019 from the status of Spirit, alive in a body made of electro-gravitic energy with extremely high coherence levels, into a gross body made up of food material (result of Eve\u2019s first bite in the first biblical apple), crystallized in a state of frozen light, with high entropy and fractal chaos levels, which is the inertial force we call gravity today. Such reversed faith - generating our own gravity - is what has been responsible for the birth and death, and then re-birth again and again - of every embodied Soul, with their subsequent actions, leading to their own return, as results being expected in time or psychological causality.Whatever we have firm faith about, that becomes the dream-world in which we live during the inappropriately named \u2018waking\u2019 state.This is the never ending cycle of attachments to karma, or the bondage to the fruits of one\u2019s actions.The actual awakening, or \u2018great-waking\u2019 state, takes place when we stop identifying with the sensory experience and realize that we are merely dreaming our own density out of intellectual decoherence.The moment universal coherence is restored however, we can travel through time and have no reason to die anymore.

            "answer_text": "The Big Bang was the expansion of the universe from a state of unimaginably high energy density to a state in which matter as we know it began to exist. Suppose time started when the expansion began. Then the expansion occurred during time as we know it. There\u2019s no problem of the existence of time during the Big Bang; it existed. Now there is another question: how did this enormous amount of energy come into existence? If time did not exist before the Big Bang, then this energy did not come into existence. It existed when time began. In other words, the universe was not created, or anything like that; it has always been there. The universe has existed for all time. If time didn't exist before the Big Bang, how could the Big Bang possibly have happened? The question I originally answered was a different one that was merged with this question\u2014so I am merging the answers. The original question, as I understood it, was about the origin of time, not the origin of the universe. Here is my answer to the original question: How can someone say that time started at The Big Bang? If time didn't exist before it was created, how could the transition from the 'moment' in which it didn't exist, to the moment in which it started existing happen? We know about the Big Bang because we know about the expanding universe, and we can track back from the known rate of expansion to calculate the time when it was just a speck, and the speck must have expanded with a \u201cbig bang.\u201d We can\u2019t calculate any farther back than that. We therefore say the universe started at the Big Bang. In the universe, time and space are useful dimensions. Without a universe, time and space have no meaning for us. Time as we know it started at the Big Bang. To say flatly that time started at the Big Bang is an oversimplification. We don\u2019t know that time started at the Big Bang. If it did, as the question presumes, there was no time\u2014no \u201cmoment\u201d\u2014when time didn\u2019t exist. There was only a first moment when it did exist. If on the other hand time did not start at the Big Bang, but instead existed before everything, then there still was no moment when time didn\u2019t exist. Either way, no transition\u2014time existed for all time. ",

            "answer_text": "All Big Bang theories have problems. They do not predict nor explain Dark Energy and Dark Matter that make up 96 % of the universe. So Big Bang at most could explain 4% of the universe if it were true. That is not impressive. So top scientists now distance themselves from the Big Bang theory. Ordinary people are unaware of this and still continue with the theory. But look at the problems. Something starts the Big Bang. Lovely scientific word, \"Something\". What was it? No-one has the faintest clue. Lovely science this. We are dealing with something that we know nothing about. Precision Physics at its best. So we start guessing where we have no facts to work with. Good science? Not really. Physics has no laws of creation. Start with nothing and there are no laws of Physics which can produce something. Scientists dodge this by claiming that the vacuum has energy. Sorry. Energy is something. So if you just assume there is energy, you have just assumed a massive step of creation from nothing. In the process you have violated the most basic of Physics laws, the law of conservation of energy that says energy cannot get created. So you just cannot get going if you are honest and start with nothing. Look at the one answer. We have something infinitely dense, infinitely hot, and infinitely small. Lovely. Where did it come from? No answer. You just have to keep guessing in a complete absence of physical evidence. This theory requires three infinities. The entire universe that we have does not have a single infinity (other than human stupidity as Einstein suggested). So claiming to somehow have three infinities at the start is physically impossible. Why not make it easier and just assume one Infinity and call Him God? But God would never create in such a cumbersome manner as the Big Bang. today ask where your poles come from? And what charged them up? And what made all of them touch? And the thing that was it that exploded or broadened? tune in to the answer, time was made inside big-bang. We try not to know just what time is. We cannot even determine time. We gauge the action of a pointer across a wrist watch face, we don't determine time. Whenever we have no clue what time is, then how do we say how time was created. Only full guesswork. Physics has no laws and regulations of creation. Creation from nothing, no energy no anything, just isn't feasible within the recognized laws of Physics. ",

Human create time so that they can know when to harvest, arrange the activity or to know when it's going to be day and night. It is not real. It seems real because you believe that it exist. Same like how you believe maths and numbers exist but actually they don't exist in the real world. They are just a concept, an idea. It is a human creation and not nature creation. Same like a big bang. It is just a theory to explain how the universe started. But actually I don't believe the big bang theory. I believe that this universe is the result of the past universe being destroyed because the stars already old and explode when its hydrogen and helium fuel started to deplete by time. This remnants of the past stars and being thrown to space and form new planets and stars. There is no real starting point or ending point of the universe. I don't really believe that the universe is 13 billion years old. The 13 billion years is just the age of the oldest stars that we ever known. Not the real age of the universe. There is a planet that is older than the universe and had outlive its 2 parent star. That proves that we still don't understand many things about the universe. I believe that the most plausible way of ending the universe is the cold death where the hydrogen and helium of the universe is going to be depleted to form heavier elements or those stars are going to end up as a black hole in space. As more stars are being converted into black holes and black holes cannot die, they will continue to exist until the universe is full of black holes or the stars is continue to finish the hydrogen and helium until at 1 point there will be not enough fuel to create a new stars.

            "answer_text": "The question involves the following assumptions: 1. Time did not exist before the Big Bang 2. The Big Bang was caused by something 3. If A causes B, A is prior in time to B. The three assumptions cannot all be true. The prevailing view is that the second assumption is false: the Big Bang happened, creating time and space with it. This view is based on General Relativity, in which time, space and mass-energy are inseparable. My view is that it is the first assumption which is false. Time, space and mass-energy may currently be inseparable, but if the laws of the universe have developed since the inception of the universe, this inseparability was not necessarily present at the beginning of time. I find this easier to swallow than the proposition that something with all the mass and energy of the current universe, together with all natural law arose out of a nothingness devoid of time, space, mass-energy and natural law. If time and space preceded the Big Bang, it would be possible for a quantum fluctuation to produce the initial state of the material universe. Such a fluctuation could persist if it was energetically neutral, which would be the case if the mass-energy was exactly compensated by the negative gravitational potential energy it produced. In this way, we would truly have a universe from nothing, as Krauss has suggested.

            "answer_text": "I think the issue is much more simple than most physicists and/or theorists want to believe. (All these overly complex theories remind me of a detective determined to make one person guilty of a crime they did not commit. If you look hard enough, use all possible knowledge and experience, slant every area of the suspects life, you can make almost anyone look guilty of any crime. As humans, we all seem to be quite susceptible to that way of thinking. If a person has a vast knowledge in a particular area of a science, then that person will create theories to explain everything unexplainable, using his area of knowledge.) Anyway, while it is true that the \"universe\" we see was created from a \"Big Bang\", all matter exploded out from that and as it moved its way out from the central point of the explosion, the matter began to coalesce and collect on itself, due to various functions of gravity and other universal laws which do not require the existence of humanity in order to \"do their thing\". As the \"Universe grows wider, broader and more vast, the galaxies form, the solar systems form, stars (suns) form, planets form, etc. For about 10 billion years, the universe expands and changes, reforms and rebuilds everywhere; as it gets closer to the 10 billion year point (just a ball park number, even though ball parks did not as yet exist) the expansion gets slower and slower. Finally, at that critical point, for the tiniest fraction of a second (or whatever time scale you want to use out there) the expansion stops, and the maximum size of the universe is reached. Now the whole mess (mass of matter in the universe) reverses! The power of the blast that threw everything out, in all directions, has been used up and the gravitational force of all this matter begins to pull it back together. At first the force is minuscule. As time marches on, the forces gain greater and greater power/momentum. The universe converges faster and faster in on itself. As it gets closer to 20 billion years from the initial Big Bang, all the matter begins to collect as one big mass of matter; all the matter in the universe becomes one single, large object. Now, the mass of matter being so large, the gravitation force of that giant ball of matter pulls the outer layers closer to the center. Time continues to march on and that large mass of matter gets smaller and smaller, at least in diameter, but not in mass (as an analogy, if you put a 2,000-pound car in a crusher, and you crush this 18 foot long car down to a three foot cube, it is the same mass, but a lot smaller in size.) Anyway, because we are talking about such an incredible amount of mass and therefore greater gravity, (the more mass, the greater the gravity, another universal law which does not require humanity\u2019s existence in order for it to work properly) the smaller in size all the matter in the universe becomes. So now we have this ever-shrinking ball (roughly a ball) floating around in the approximate middle of what used to be our universe. All this matter that contains all the atoms that made up everything; you, me, the third moon of Jupiter, the weed resembling a large dandelion growing in a large field on an obscure planet, orbiting around a red sun on the other side of the Andromeda galaxy and then up and to the left; EVERYTHING in this universe that ever was is now in this giant, continuously shrinking ball. Because the gravitational force is so great, this ball gets smaller and still smaller. Finally, a point comes (a point that is open to much debate in humanity; the universe doesn\u2019t much care) where this ball just cannot get any smaller, yet the gravitational force continues to overwhelm this ball. Obviously, to us tiny little things in the grand and vast scheme of the universe, we cannot imagine the power being generated by the gravitational force from ALL matter in the universe, which has converged into one spot but I bet it is a lot more than my toaster generates when it burns my bread. Anyway, the force MUST go somewhere and since it can no longer go inward, it goes OUTWARD\u2026.. and what do we have????? Big Bang 2. In approximately 20 billion years, Big Bang 3, and so on, and so on, ad infinitum, forever, and ever, and ever. Let\u2019s call it the \u201cRebirth\u201d.Now, carrying this on, we might be existing in the first rebirth, or the 7,534,644,412,345,123th rebirth. And if that has not destroyed your brain enough, then consider this\u2026. What are we calling \u201cthe Universe\u201d? Are we referring only to all the matter in our little group of millions and millions of galaxies? OR\u2026. Are we referring to all the endless space that exists here and well beyond where our group of millions and millions of galaxies ends? Let\u2019s refer to the \u201cUniverse\u201d as our little groups of millions and millions of galaxies; you know, everything which gets reborn every 20 billion years during the Big Bang. And we will refer to everything beyond the point where our matter has stopped as \u201cEndless Space\u201d.(OK, last thing to warp your mind!)Is it possible that there are other \u201cUniverses\u201d in the endless void of space? These separate \u201cUniverses\u201d existing so far apart that they have virtually no effect at all on one another, AND we cannot see them, no matter how powerful the telescopes, and we will never be able to visit them no matter how much technology advances because the distance is just too great.THAT, is how I see the whole thing. Needless to say,\u2026 I have had trouble sleeping for most of my life. UPDATE:Someone sent me a comment on my answer; they said that I was wrong and that there was \"no such thing as a Big Bang\". They went on to say that all matter is expanding and will always expand due to the existence of Dark Energy (or Dark Matter). (Dark Energy or Dark Matter is also one of those things I mentioned at the beginning of my original answer. People are always trying to make things far more complicated than they need to be because they heard of something that they liked and few people know about, so they glue themselves to an idea that makes them feel like their \"theory\" is more special, and therefore more accurate, then the theories from other people. Dark Energy or Dark Matter (like Anti-Matter) is entirely theoretical. There is not the slightest bit of proof that such substances exist. We see it and hear about it on Star Trek and therefore it exists. WRONG.... It does not exist, at least to any science currently known to us. Now of course we can go with the long-suffering argument of \"Just because we have no proof of its existence, does not mean that it does not exist.\" We really need to keep that sort of argument for God alone. Now... why did I write all this Update\" for such a pithy qualification? Because it goes right back to what started this whole thing. When people hear something, the knowledge of which they can use to impress their friends, and even strangers, many times they will take this topic and run like a Quarterback being chased by three tacklers the size of Andre the Giant. This person used \"Dark Energy\" as a point of fact when there is nothing in all of science which comes close to proving its existence. In fact, \u201cDark Energy\u201d/\"Dark Matter\" are a hypothetical theory which exists ONLY to explain other theories which, as of yet, cannot be proven. I mean now that is WEAK! Anti-matter you say???? Same-O Same-O ! Warp Speeds-Ditto ! Parallel Universes - Xerox ! Time Travel - Once Again ! All this, not even Science, they are Science Fiction. Maybe someday, something like one of those will be shown to exist, I have no idea, but I know that as of yet, One CANNOT use those topics to prove and/or argue anything, let alone other unprovable theories. Even the idea of a Big Bang has far more scientific substance than those topics. Well, enough of all this. Oh, by the way, I mean no offence or disrespect to the person who wrote me not on my flaws. In fact, I thank you for helping me prove my original point. There is that word \"prove\" again; UGH! UPDATE:Another wrote me a comment saying that according to the latest theories, the converging of the Matter in the Universe back in on itself (that is referred to as the \"Big Crunch\" thank you for reminding me of that term) will not happen because the matter is too far apart. Yes, I have heard that as well. However, being human myself, and liking the details of my theory, I will stick to that one until something else is proven. But I do want to say that his mentioned theory is out there and reputable scientists place credence in the idea. Of course, many reputable scientists also stick with the \"Big Bang\" - \"Big Crunch\" - \"Big Bang\" - \"Big Crunch\" - \"Big Bang\" - \"Big Crunch\" - \"Big Bang\" - \"Big Crunch\" - \"Big Bang\" - etc. I will not go on with an endless diatribe about why I still believe in the big crunch, but for the moment, suffice it to say that I would not continue to believe it if I did not have at least some meritable ideas behind it. UPDATE:One person wrote to me and corrected me on one issue (Thank you)! Her words were \u201cwhile it is true we don't have any empirical evidence for dark matter, antimatter has been detected numerous times by particle detected around the world\u201d. Strangely enough, I actually remembered that the moment I read her note. Antimatter actually does exist; granted, not very much of it. In fact, I just learned that official records show that Antimatter is the rarest and most expensive substance on earth. One gram would cost about 25 billion dollars. (One ounce, about 200 billion dollars.) Now, the theoretical part, at least in-so-far as I have read; there is currently no practical use for it. Oh sure, scientists apparently have all kinds of theories (there is that word again) but as of yet, there is no practical; every day; Honey, go down to the store and pick me up some Hydrogen Antimatter; use for it.

            "answer_text": "The Big Bang is an extrapolation backwards in time from the current observations about our universe. Since it is currently expanding it must have been smaller in the past, and using current knowledge in physics we can deduce how it must have been way back in the past, event to a point when it was extremely small, dense and hot. There is of course a limit to how much back in time we can go with our models of the universe, to go beyond the time when the size of the universe was the order of the Planck scale we would need a theory of quantum gravity that we do not yet have, so that is as far as we can go. On the other hand the Big Bang theory is currently the one that best explains current observations, such as the expansion of the universe, the relative abundance of the elements, cosmic microwave background, etc. For a little while the \u201cSteady State\u201d theory, put forward around 1948, looked like a plausible alternative to the Big Bang, but it didn\u2019t last much because observations since the 1950\u2019s (such as the cosmic microwave background) were better explain by the Big Bang theory. That is the current status of our knowledge of how the universe has evolved, with some little tweaks here and there (like the discoveries about black matter and dark energy). So, to answer the question, more than claiming that we do not have an answer I would say that the question itself makes assumptions about the nature of time that go beyond our understanding of the universe beyond the Planck scale. At that scale we do not even know how time, space, and other possible dimensions may look, and we do not even know what the term \u201chappen\u201d may denote. As soon as someone develops a sucessfull theory of quantum gravity we may try to apply it to the universe beyond the Planck scale, but at that scale \u201ctime\u201d may become intermingled with other physical concepts in a way that we do not yet understand.

            "answer_text": "First of all, a valid explanation of the Big Bang must include the origin of every bit of matter/energy. And Quantum Foam, collisions of universes, remnants of other universes, and where God reached out his mighty arm and went \u201czap\u201d are invalid because they don\u2019t explain the origin of those entities. This type of circular logic using one unknown to explain another unknown is totally illogical and misleading. But what is logical is mathematics. And a simple equation can explain it, along with a simple syllogism. In fact this is so simple that brilliant minds will reject it because of its simplicity. But yet the Cosmos is really quite simple and just a matter of bookkeeping so that everything in the universe will balance, as Emmy Noether might say. So, here it is, soooo simple: If Time = 0 And 0 = Nothingness And Nothingness = 0 = +1 and -1 Then from Nothingness = a (+1) universe and a (-1) universe could arise Therefore no need for a Singularity/Big Bang, just a Big Separation.* Of course there must be a slight amount of asymmetry between the universe and its anti-universe partner or the 2 would annihilate each other. So, our universe went on to become what it is, and the anti-universe (dark matter and dark energy) failed to evolve to the point where it represents 95% of all measurable matter/energy. In other words, the anti-universe is running at a much slower pace than ours with dark matter being composed of some unusual form of primitive matter that puts out both gravity and repulsive gravity. The current theory is that WIMPS (weakly interacting massive particles) are the main composition of dark matter. Conclusion: no need for a Big Bang. The problem with this scenario is that it does not explain where the energy came from to fuel such a huge explosion. The Big Separation is a more logical explanation in that there is no initial energy required to cause the \u201cBang/Separation\u201d. Just a phase shift of waves and their anti-wave partners, which when co-existing together form the basis for Nothingness. And if the randomness of nature over time can cause just a slight phase shift resulting in a slight amount asymmetry, then the Big Separation will occur. *Now, the problem with the Big Separation is that it implies that Something was there to form a separation. And if Something was there, then how can this be Nothingness. But yet the equation shows that Nothingness = 0. And from 0 = a (+1) and a (-1) can occur which demonstrates that you can get Something from Nothing providing it is paid for by an Anti-something. And just like everything in life, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Even in the cosmos, everything must be paid for. For every universe created, it must be paid for by an anti-universe. And the definition of any anti-universe is simply an unevolved, slower (or faster) form, with different laws of physics type universe. BTW: the biggest problem with this theory is the concept of Nothingness where Nothingness is exactly that, just nothingness. How can a universe spring into existence if there wasn\u2019t anything there to begin with. And this type of thinking is characteristic of human learning and reasoning, where to make something you need essential ingredients. Well, you could throw God into the equation. But then, where did God come from. So this leads to the only acceptable conclusion that Nothingness can create something provided it is paid for by an anti-something. But this is difficult to comprehend because there are no comparisons in our universe. Well, there is what\u2019s called spontaneous combustion. But that still assumes there was something there to provide for the combustion. But in the case of nothing giving rise to something, this is completely different because you must assume that Nothingness spontaneously created something out of nothing. How can this be? Voodoo and Black magic? Thus the only way to believe that all of the above is true is by a process of elimination. Explanations that start out with essential ingredients to explain the Big Bang without explaining where they came from are not the answer unless they explain where the ingredients came from. Quantum fluctuations come close to explain the Big Bang, but quantum implies energy and matter. And this ingredient simply didn\u2019t exist in a state of Nothingness. However, fluctuations are common events and could account for a phase shift of waves that have cancelled each other out to form Nothingness. Therefore, the concept of Nothingness can avoid this common error of including a starting substance because Nothingness can also represent cancellations which equal zero. Then reverse the equation and you get a something (a +1 universe) and its anti-something partner (a -1 anti-universe) which have remained cloaked, and probably for billions of years until a phase shift/fluctuations occurred which caused the Big Separation. And if you are still confused over the concept of Nothingness, think of noise cancellation headphones. Turn on the headphones and a sound wave will cancel the noise wave and you get Nothingness. Turn off the device and suddenly from Nothingness you get a sound wave. It's important to remember that waves form the basis for everything in the entire universe, whether its electromagnetic waves, gravity waves, or the waves created by the vibration of strings, in String Theory. And it was gravity/antigravity waves that created our universe, but not so much of a bang but a whimper. Just a gradual separation requiring no energy, but yet resulting in a very large and all inclusive\u2026\u2026.., Big Separation. Like an old used garment that simply falls apart when you try to put it on. In other words, from a Nothingness point of view, just a separation of a waves from their anti-wave partners in their cancelled-out state of Nothingness. And matter and the entire universe is simply the condensation of these waves, like mist that can form raindrops. So there it is: all the mystery, confusion, and mysticism taken out of the universe and its creation with just simple logic, a simple equation, and the process of elimination. But wait\u2026\u2026., doesn\u2019t that take the wonderment out of the emotional right side of the brain and shunt the neuronal transmissions through the Corpus Callosum and into to the logical left side and turn everything into just math and physics? How dull. Or maybe it\u2019s better to look into the night sky, sit back/ relax, take a toke from the friendly smoke, and let the hallucinations begin. ",

My own view is that Time , Space and the Energy-Matter Combine have always existed and will always exist . There could never have been any need either for an imaginary God or the imaginary Big Bang . And , neither all energy coalesce into matter at any particular instant nor the vice versa can happen , because change is a continuous process and is happening all the time . This very fact should debunk the idea of Big Bang , which assumes that all matter converts into energy and concentrates in a tiny space and then at a critical stage , when it can not shrink any further , it explodes into a Big Bang . And lo and behold ! A fresh universe starts its journey along with a newly created set of Time and Space ! Really a wonderful story for small children . It is most ridiculous to suggest that Time , Space , Energy & Matter all started with the Big Bang and will again coalesce together as the time for the next Big Bang approaches . An interesting little story in this regard will expose the concept of God and the Big Bang . The story goes thus : A man is leisurely walking with his little son when there is sudden conversation between the two . In the story below F denotes father and S denotes son . S to F - F , you say that God has created us all . F to S - Yes, definitely my S . S to F - Did he create that big boulder over there ? F to S - Yes , of course , my S . S to F - Did he create those Hills also ? F to S - Yes , my S . S to F - And He also created this earth ! F to S - (Now a little irritated and wanting to close the conversation) Why are you asking such unnecessary questions when I have already told you so many times that God has made the whole universe and everything in it . He is omnipotent , omnipresent , omniscient etc. etc. He can do and also undo any thing , and even such things which we humans can not even conceive of . He is so powerful that he can lift the whole world on just one finger . S to F - (Now , hesitantly) F , can I ask just one last question ? F to S - Yes , definitely my S , go ahead . S to F - F , can God , who is so many omnis , produce some thing which he himself will not be able to lift ? F - ( He is now speechless and falls silent and in deep thought . His strong belief in the existence of God , which he had nurtured so long , gets hugely shaken) ",

            "answer_text": "Very interesting question! I cannot pretend to have the answer, but I would like to clarify a point. It is hard for me to explain so I\u2019ll need to go a little off-topic to clarify it. Please bear with me: A fish can feel depth changes in water. A bird can feel magnetic field, and an ant always know how many steps away it is from its nest. All these features are result for adapting to their environment. We as humans don\u2019t have those features because it doesn\u2019t bring more survivability in our environment. The fact that human thinks that time flow at the same speed everywhere, is also an adaptation consequence. We don\u2019t experience relativistic effects where time flow differently for 2 points because it doesn\u2019t happen on the surface of our planet, therefore there is no use for us as humans to have an innate deep understanding of relativistic effect of time. In fact most humans on earth have a hard time imagining the bending of time because our brain as it is, is not meant to understand it. When I say most humans, I include physicist: they rely on math and not on their level on understanding. We however know and have proven that time does not flow at the same speed at every point of the universe. Now to our point: We have been living in time and space. We always have been experiencing that any event is caused by something this thought is called causality. we are not made to imagine something without causality. The problem with causality is that it requires time: The concept of \u201ccause and consequence\u201d, of \u201cbefore, and after\u201d requires time to exist. So if the big bang is the origin of time and space, time began to exist with the big bang. Therefore time did not exist \u201cbefore\u201d. I\u2019ll even say that the statement \u201cbefore the big bang\u201d would have no meaning. And \u201ca cause for the big bang\u201d has equally no meaning. The same goes for space and location. Well in short, my point is that if the big bang is really the origin of time and space, the occurrence of the big bang is something that can disobey normal cause-consequence and location of occurrence as we know it. However if space-time existed before the big bang (here\u201d before\u201d is justified because time existed) then your question will have an answer more easily understandable for us humans. ",

            "answer_text": "Our basic common sense notions as to how the universe works, which underpin the natural sciences, are completely false. Causality does not exist. Let me repeat that. Causality does not exist. Whatever is happening right now, in your immediate experience, whether that be your own breathing, the sounds of birds, or even the thoughts inside your head, none of it is determined by the past. Reality is simply a seamlessly unfolding stream of change that is totally spontaneous and acausal. If you honestly scrutinise your direct experience, rather than your thoughts about experience, this will become obvious to you. No abstract thought is required. Indeed, it is abstract thought itself that creates the illusion of cause and effect. Somewhere in the development of Western thought we fell into the trap of believing that all phenomena must be purposive. That is, we decided that whatever is happening must a) have been set off by something other than itself, and b) must be going somewhere. In regarding the universe in this way we overlooked the most profound and obvious truth underlying the whole thing: The universe, which by definition is everything that there is, is not going anywhere, and did not come from anywhere. As such, it has absolutely no purpose beyond the simple fact of its own present unfolding. How could it be otherwise? To attribute purpose to phenomena is to assume that they are compelled to happen by something beyond themselves, but how can we say that the universe is compelled by something beyond itself without creating an infinite regress? You see, causality cannot exist, because if it did, we would never reach the point of independent origination, which must exist for anything at all to happen. In the same token, if we say that the universe is an independent origination, which is compelled by nothing beyond itself, then we must apply the same quality to all phenomena that constitute the universe, because we cannot introduce causative relationships into a state of affairs that is fundamentally without prior cause without creating a logical impossibility. So the reality is that it is not the Big Bang, the spontaneous eruption of a universe without prior cause, which is strange, it is our insistence upon the delusion of causality that consistently makes us overlook the fundamental nature of existence in general. We do not live in a universe of Newtonian billiard balls. Phenomena do not have a causative relationship to each other. In reality, change simply happens of itself, and has no point of origin, and no ultimate destination. How could it be any other way? ",

            "answer_text": "The question involves the following assumptions: 1. Time did not exist before the Big Bang 2. The Big Bang was caused by something 3. If A causes B, A is prior in time to B. The three assumptions cannot all be true. The prevailing view is that the second assumption is false: the Big Bang happened, creating time and space with it. This view is based on General Relativity, in which time, space and mass-energy are inseparable. My view usually this is the very first assumption which will be untrue. Time, space and mass-energy may presently be inseparable, however regulations of the universe have developed because the creation of this world, this inseparability wasn't necessarily present at the start of time. I find this simpler to take than the proposition that something with all the size and power of existing universe, along with natural and organic law arose out of a nothingness devoid of time, area, mass-energy and all-natural law. If some time area preceded the Big Bang, it could be feasible for a quantum fluctuation to create the original condition regarding the product world. Such a fluctuation could continue if it was energetically natural, which will function as the case in the event that mass-energy was exactly paid because of the negative gravitational potential energy it produced. In this manner, we would undoubtedly have a universe from nothing, as Krauss has recommended. If you are considering an exploration for the theory that regulations of the universe have evolved since its beginning, you might like to read Home | Quantum Occam . ",

            "answer_text": "So, first you should be aware that there are many models of the early universe, and \u2018time not existing before the big bang\u2019 is only one of these. It is a more popular view, now, that the universe is infinite in both space and time, but that quantum fluctuation produce an inflation event that triggered \u2018our universe\u2019 as a subset of that. However, even in the models in which time begins when the universe does there is no problem. The problem is that, as humans, we can\u2019t readily \u2018let go\u2019 of our shortcuts for understanding things. We can understand the words \u201ctime did not exist before the big bang\u2019, but we don\u2019t really have any way to \u2018wrap our heads\u2019 around the idea. Even writing it we are stuck with the time ideas that we have \u2018built into\u2019 our thinking\u2026 \u201cbefore\u201d the big bang has time built into its expression! But this is a flaw in our thinking, not in the concept. Look carefully at what you are asking\u2026 when you say \u2018how could it transition from the moment in which it didn\u2019t exist\u2019 you are already supposing that there is time before. We just can\u2019t let go of that idea. I am reminded of those people who can\u2019t get their heads around the fact that \u2018faster than light\u2019 is not meaningful\u2026 there is always a way to add to any speed they know, so they think \u201cif I am going very close to light speed and then add some more velocity then I\u2019ll be going faster than light\u201d. But that\u2019s not how it works \u2014 because our ideas of how velocity behaves are wrong when velocities are that great. Similarly our ideas of how time works are based on a very particular experience of time, and we can\u2019t really conceive of its absence. But it is a serious error to think that an inability to imagine something means it can\u2019t be true. Instead we need to create tools that can deal with the concepts that our brains can\u2019t directly handle. Mathematics is our \u2018go to\u2019 tool for this, and it handles things like time coming into existence at the point of the big bang just fine. Again, however, this is not the only model, and you can go with concepts like \u2018eternal inflation\u2019 or cyclic universe models. These avoid the singularity of the traditional \u2018big bang\u2019, though introduce other complications. ",

That is \u201ccausality without the passage of time.\u201d But we\u2019ve pretty much determined that you can\u2019t have time without matter and matter without energy and energy without time, so if the Big Bang was the moment at which any single one of them began to exist then they must have all began to exist together. Yet despite what anyone says about quantum mechanics, there is no point in which we should accept the answer that \u201cnothing caused something\u201d. Because if we did, we would all cease to be scientists. Had I given that conclusion at the end of the defense of my Master\u2019s Thesis, I can assure you the 4 professors in the room would have not only refused to grant it to me, but they may have been tempted to rescind my previous degree as well. I became a scientist because I was interested in \u201cWHY\u201d things happen? Why is the sky blue? Why does lightning strike? and so on. Why would I wish to abandon that philosophy now and say nothing causes lightning or the Universe. And even in quantum mechanics one shouldn\u2019t confuse the efficient cause with the material cause (see below). All we can say is that we do not know what the efficient cause was. So how could the Big Bang have happened? Well rather than just saying we \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d there are somethings we can indeed logically derive. For instance: We can immediately conclude that whatever caused the Big Bang must be timeless, matterless and energy independent. Either this means there are alternate forms of time, matter and energy that are orthogonal to our understanding of time matter and energy or there are other forms of existence above and beyond these requirements. We could call these Extra-Natural (the natural being that which is constrained by time matter and energy). What does that mean, it means that scientifically and logically and rationally we can say that there\u2019s far more out there than the 4 dimensions that we can measure with our current senses and sensors and maybe far more out there than just this Universe. *****************There are 4 kinds of causes (from Wikipedia). Matter: a change or movement's material \"cause\", is the aspect of the change or movement which is determined by the material that composes the moving or changing things. For a table, that might be wood; for a statue, that might be bronze or marble.Form: a change or movement's formal \"cause\", is a change or movement caused by the arrangement, shape or appearance of the thing changing or moving. Aristotle says for example that the ratio 2:1, and number in general, is the cause of the octave.Agent: a change or movement's efficient or moving \"cause\", consists of things apart from the thing being changed or moved, which interact so as to be an agency of the change or movement. For example, the efficient cause of a table is a carpenter, or a person working as one, and according to Aristotle the efficient cause of a boy is a father.End or purpose: a change or movement's final \"cause\", is that for the sake of which a thing is what it is. For a seed, it might be an adult plant. For a sailboat, it might be sailing. For a ball at the top of a ramp, it might be coming to rest at the bottom.",

After some billions of years (if we are alive), the galaxies nearby will have gone very far away that we will be unable to see them. The light from them would never reach us. We won\u2019t be able to learn or understand some of the amazing physics that we understand now. Similarly, there might be some things like the Big Bang Theory, which we can\u2019t understand now. Maybe it\u2019s too late. Maybe we don\u2019t have enough evidence. All we can do is theorize. Or maybe we are not that smart, and someone someday may find out. Some of the current cosmic evidence observed is that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. This implies that if went back in time, the universe should be contracting. And it should have originated from a single place with enormous singularity. This is the Big Bang Theory. Now time is not an absolute quantity. It is relative. Time seems to run very slow near high gravitational fields. Because of the curvature of space time fabric, due to high gravity, light needs more time to cover the distance. And since, the speed of light is constant, time runs slower. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there is nothing happening inside a singularity. It just means that the information of what is happening there hasn\u2019t been able to reach outside. Time may have existed before, but we have no idea of what was happening inside the singularity.

            "answer_text": "Einstein made a revolutionary discovery when he linked space and time into spacetime . And after that physicists jumped in the bandwagon without understanding what this actually means. All this means is that IN OUR UNIVERSE space and time are inextricably linked. Time can not exist without space. However the confusion begins when physicists forget that the opposite is not true. Space can exist without time. Do any second grade geometry. None of those equations deal with time, but all have to do with space. But but\u2026The word before requires time, and there was no time before the universe began\u2026 is a point of much contention. However the actual accurate statement is that, \u201cthere was no time before the Big Bang event, in our universe.\u201d However every universe has its own set of temporal conditions. While it is accurate to say that no event on those universes happened before the Big Bang, it is also accurate to say none of those events happened after the Big Bang. Space and time existed outside of the Big Bang and still do. Between universes time is arbitrary and can only be referenced by placing an artificial marker point by which to judge differences in spatial-temporal motion. So the end of one universe can coincide with the beginning of ours, the end of ours can coincide with the beginning of another, and the end of that universe can coincide with the beginning of the first universe in this statement. Each universe can have time flowing in one direction internally and still form a perfectly reasonable system in which the end is also the beginning without paradox. ",

I believe the Roman Catholic church has instructed physicists not to look beyond the Big Bang for some alternative explanation, but I also think this kind of scientific instruction from church officials has been largely ignored since the days of Galileo. Time is an interesting concept. As biological creatures living in a system of days/nights, tides, phases of the moon, lifespans, and seasons, we believe that time exists. It is equally possible, however, to take another view. Perhaps only motion and distance exist. Time might be nothing more than the ratio of distance divided by motion, or velocity. Mathematically, I mean. No movement, no time. No distance, no time. For the Big Bang theory to function, it must assume a single point without motion or distance. Therefore, no time. So your question, which intrigues me too, is really about the condition of a very early universe in which there could be none of the laws of physics as we now understand them. No electrons spinning around pulsing protons. No distance between the orbits of electrons and their protons. Theoretically, all the energy of the universe was fused into a single point, and the point itself did not exist except as a potential source of energy. I can see why church officials would imagine that as the primeval state of God. Great question. One of the most basic questions of all. It\u2019s like asking \u201cwhat are the physical dimensions of an idea?\u201d We can acknowledge that ideas exist, and we know they exist without physical dimension. But when we talk about them, it is nearly always to discuss them in terms of how they function to move things in the physical world. But as for the idea itself? No dimension, no movement, no time, no distance. Only potential. ",

            "answer_text": "Great question!  First off, it's not clear that time didn't exist before the Big Bang; plenty of theories of cosmogenesis extend time indefinitely into the past, past the hot, dense ball of plasma commonly referred to as the Big Bang from which our universe today evolved. There is, however, a movement in fundamental theory to question the fundamental nature of time (and space).  For pretty much forever, we've kind of assumed space and time have been there, and constructed a theory of physics--something to explain the existence of matter and energy, their properties, and their evolution--on top of them.  Physicists, inspired by the question of \"where did our universe come from?\" are now beginning to ask questions about whether it might be more true that time and space are 'emergent' properties of our universe, rather than a fundamental quality of reality. Fundamentally, the answer to whether or not time is emergent or fundamental (and, if emergent, how it emerges) necessarily rests on understanding we just don't have--a theory of quantum gravity.  The universe near its very beginning is simply outside the realm of validity of the known physical laws--just like the singularity of a black hole, it's too compact for our theory of gravity and too dense for our theory of particle physics.  The final answer to this question, then, awaits such a theory, though that doesn't mean physicists aren't hard at work coming up with ideas. ",

Just because a majority of today\u2019s scientists / physicists / philosophers don't know what happened \u201cbefore\u201d, does not mean nobody knows. And, if someone is trying to say that the Universe has come from nothing, they should think about it deeply and seriously try to find out the actual answer. If there was a thing such as Singularity, what is the origin of that Singularity? (And, Singularity is your \u201cGod\u201d then!). If there is no brain (intelligence) behind the origin of the Universe, why do we, a part of this Universe, have a brain? Why did the Big Bang happen at a particular instant? Why not 100 years before the actual bang? Why not 100 years later? Why not today? Who or what \u201cdecided\u201d? The Big bang (in its truest sense) might have occurred, but who was the cause behind it? The current modern theories of the \u201cBig-Bang\u201d are a result of mental speculation. Time is eternal, and \u201ccyclic\u201d in nature. The universe \u201cexpands\u201d in one sense, but not from a \u201csingularity\u201d, and then \u201ccontracts\u201d and \u201cexpands\u201d again, and the cycle continues eternally. The words \u201cexpands\u201d and \u201ccontracts\u201d are in quotes because it is not the expansion or contraction which our limited minds can conceive of. All of this is thoughtfully controlled by the Supremely Independent creator, with a purpose. Time is completely under control of the eternal Supreme Lord, and we are completely under control of time. One may consult books written by qualified scientists, for a insight into non-mechanistic methods of acquiring knowledge, which are needed for topics that are beyond the \u201crealms of the established scientific methods\u201d. One such book is : Mechanistic and Nonmechanistic Science: An Investigation into the Nature of Consciousness and Form, by Richard L. Thompson, 1981 (PhD. Mathematics, Cornell University, researcher in statistical mechanics, probability theory and mathematical biology). (This book is appreciated by scientists like Eugene Wigner and Brian Josephson: \u201cI liked the third chapter of Mechanistic and Nonmechanistic Science very much,\u201d wrote Eugene Wigner, winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1963. \u201cIn particular it acquainted me some with the Bhagavad-gita. I learned that the basic philosophical ideas of this on \u2018existence\u2019 are virtually identical with those which quantum mechanics lead me to.\u201d (http://www.elcom.ru/~human/2008bg/Wigner-Thompson_letter.pdf) Meanwhile, the 1973 Prize winner, Brian Josephson, commented, \u201cIn Mechanistic and Nonmechanistic Science, Dr. Thompson makes a number of cogent arguments against the usual scientific picture of life and evolution (which do not accept the existence of higher or subtler levels of organization). He also presents a clear alternative model. I think it is an important book, which would be of interest to many people.\u201d)  In fact, Josephson was so impressed with Thompson\u2019s book that he invited him to serve as a post-doctoral fellow for a year in the prestigious Cavendish Laboratory, at the Cambridge University Department of Physics. Thompson gladly accepted the offer, working there from 1984 to 1985. Real science is: \u201cknowing things as they are\u201d, although the methods may be different. Simply stated, real science is: \"knowledge of things as they are\" or, a real scientist is one who knows things as they are. Authorised Vedic scriptures give us the basic definition of God. Please note that, Veda, in Sanskrit, just means knowledge. Vedic scriptures deal with \u201ceternal religion\u201d, and have got nothing to do with any current man-made religion (or misinterpretations of authorised religion). [Definition of God, as per the authorised vedic scripture, Shri Brahma Samhita (5.1):] ishvarah paramah krishnah sach-chid-aananda vigrahah, anaadir-aadir govindah sarva-kaarana kaaranam \u201cKrishna is the Supreme independent controller (isvarah paramah krishnah), the Supreme Person, and has an eternal (sat), unchanging transcendental form (vigraha), full of knowledge (cit) and bliss (aananda). He is the beginning (aadi) and the original cause of all causes (sarva kaarana kaaranam) and Himself has no other cause (anaadi). Krishna is also known as Govinda.\u201d So, there is only ONE God, and God is ultimately, a Supremely transcendental Person. God is a Person. That\u2019s where Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead (who is the original cause of everything and has no other cause, by definition) comes into picture. Although God is known by many, many names, the principal name of God here, in this particular scripture, is said to be Krishna. Shri Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead (or God). God, the Absolute Truth, is the eternal Supreme soul, and is absolute pure consciousness, which is absolutely non material. Pure consciousness is the basis of all existence. All living beings are not their bodies or minds, but are individual eternal non-material spirit souls (\u201cspiritual particles\u201d) and are the parts and parcels of the Supreme soul. Consciousness is the symptom of the spirit soul. This is also accepted by scriptures such as the Bhagavad-gita, and Shrimad Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana). Bhagavata Purana deals with the \u201cScience of God\u201d, and also provides a concise definition of God in the very first chapter. Link to Shrimad Bhagavatam 1st Canto: Canto 1: Creation Why do scientists put faith (yes, faith!) in their inductive process which is quite unreliable? Why should one not put faith in a logical, deductive process, that comes from a reliable source? ",

            "answer_text": "Our universe emerged 13.8 billion years ago from a steady state infinite cosmos composed of elementary products as are found in our observable universe today. After 50 years of searching for the origin of our universe, I found that the above statement is the most likely science-based answer. Why has nobody seen this? The evidence: Our observable universe seems to be flat - not round - so free space is potentially endless (Hubble, etc.)Our universe is composed entirely of elementary particles, which create matter, energy and the forces of nature.Elementary particles are eternal. Specifically, a quantity of elementary particles does not change. They cannot be created; they always existed.Elementary particles are in motion over infinite time. They can travel infinite distances across the cosmos, creating an isotropic expanse of matter and energy similar to ours (Law of Conservation of Linear Momentum).The Big Bang occurred when a universe-sized quantity of elementary particles (i.e. matter and energy) in the cosmos contracted into a small space. Our singularity created new contents in our universe from pre-existing elementary particles. The evidence: The Law of Conservation of Matter and energy and the Principle of Mass-Energy Equivalence demand that an equal amount of elementary particles be available prior to the Big Bang in order to create the contents of our universe. Creating something from nothing is not allowed.Our observable universe seems to be composed of newly formed contents. Matter is not eternal, only elementary particles. The forces, energy and matter of our universe are new but our elementary particles always existed.A favorite hypothesis of mine envisions a large area of the cosmos being sucked into a small point. Maybe this began as a black hole which, through its strong gravitational pull, gathered a universe-sized quantity of matter and energy. Extreme conditions destroyed everything back into elementary particles or something more primal momentarily. Our singularity then expanded rapidly, allowing newly-created energy and matter to form our new universe. Another hypothesis of mine considers that fluctuations of space expansion and contraction created a critically low point of contraction, leading to the collapse of an area of the cosmos into a small point. Maybe the singularity was created at the nadir of a wave of space expansion/contraction traversing the cosmos. Why is space expanding? The force of expansion of space from an area the size of a universe that was sucked into the singularity may be expanding back to a state of equilibrium. It seems nobody has seen this simple, complete answer that agrees with current scientific evidence because we have not imagined our universe as a subset of a larger celestial structure. We are so pre-Copernican in our views, believing that our universe is the beginning of reality, the one-and-only. We don\u2019t even have a name for the space which could theoretically contain our universe! I call it the cosmos, distinct from our universe. p.s Time therefore must have existed as a property of the cosmos infinitely into the past ",

            "answer_text": "The question is really just pointing out the absurdity of \u201ccosmology\u201d which is the insistence that the universe was created, despite all evidence showing it's in a steady-state. These creationists believe that the universe was created by God. But their theories just get stranger and stranger, as their claims are disproven one by one. First, they claimed that all matter was created from energy (without creating antimatter) in a big explosion. The evidence was said to be the red shifts of Hydrogen emission lines from distant galaxies, first measured by Hubble. The Doppler effect seemed to provide the explanation. However, it was then shown that the red shifts of galaxies, and also of supernovas, are isotropic. This meant that the big bang had to have occurred at the position of the observer. Otherwise, it should be possible to determine the location of the origin, or starting point of the big bang. The theory had to adapt. Instead of an explosion long ago and far away, the big bang happened everywhere at once, before time began. Ever since, space itself has been expanding uniformly, like the surface of a balloon. The new version had already been disproven, though, in the Michelson-Morley experiment, and is the same as arguing the medieval concept of the aether. \"Space itself\" cannot expand, because there is nothing there to expand. Electromagnetic waves don't interact with empty space, which doesn't act as a medium for light the way water does for ocean waves. There is no aether, or underlying medium in empty space. If there is, it has always defied measurement. The Michelson-Morley experiment was one of the most important in the history of physics, and has been repeated and validated all across the EM spectrum. Physical space and time may be interrelated by relativity, but an expanding empty space is just an expanding - and imaginary - coordinate system. Even the cosmic microwave background tends to disprove the big bang theory. Why are the microwaves also isotropic, instead of all heading away from the starting point of the big bang? ",

In physics we talk about a real world where real world events happen, and such events happen somewhere at sometime. Space is a concept, the concept of \u201cwhere things happen\u201d. Its dimensionality comes from orthogonal pointing, and that ends with three. Hawking describes, in laymen\u2019s terms, the initial condition of a Big Bang with:\u201d infinitely small and infinitely hot.\u201d \u201cSmall\u201d describes a confinement, \u201cinfinitely small\u201d dissolves the concept of confinement, turning it into \u201cnothingness\u201d. But nothingness is not a confinement. Infinities projected onto the real world produce irrationalities. Temperature is clearly defined as \u201cthe average kinetic energy of the particles in a system\u201d. Infinite temperature means infinite kinetic energy, which means infinitely fast movement of particles. A region without matter cannot have a temperature and movement of particles implies space. Time is a concept, the concept of the sequence of \u201cthings happening\u201d and its one-dimensionality comes from counting. Time is an abstract, a number line. An event gets its identity from happening \u201cwhere things happen\u201d in the sequence of \u201cno event \u2192 event\u201d and therefore, if the Big Bang is called an event, it must have followed that sequence. If the Big Bang is not a physical event, then its a miracle and as such has no business to appear in scientific discussion. So, of course, if an event called Big Bang has happened at all, it must have happened in time and space - a physical event does not create these concepts! WE create these concepts to allow us to consciously navigate and investigate the physical world.\u201cTime and Space \u2026 It is not nature which imposes them upon us, it is we who impose them upon nature because we find them convenient.\u201d (Poincar\u00e9) Mathematics cannot reach out and touch reality, you cannot \u201cexplore\u201d reality with mathematics, only with experiments and observation. Math can at best describe, but not explain. Nobody could, and had the authority to say this as bluntly as R.Feynman: \u201cI love only nature, and I hate mathematicians.\u201d ",

Here is a schematic from a high energy (particle accelerator/cosmology) physicist on the resulting descriptions of cosmological evolution in time:  History of the Universe, taken from my article with the same title, with added color-coded measures of how confident we can be in our understanding. In each colored zone, the degree of confidence and the observational/experimental source of that confidence is indicated. Three different possible starting points for the \u201cBig Bang\u201d are noted at the bottom; note that individual scientists may mean different things by the term. (Caution: there is a subtlety in the use of the words \u201cExtremely Cold\u201d; there are subtle quantum effects that I haven\u2019t yet written about that complicate this notion.) [ Which Parts of the Big Bang Theory are Reliable, and Why? ] As you can see there is little known on the cosmological history before the Hot Big Bang [HBB]. That was the moment in time cosmological Big Bang theories started with before the 1998 - 2004 discovery of dark energy and the inflation era preceding the HBB, the era when everyday particles and the universe we know and love was produced. In principle inflation, which likes to be eternal, can be eternal backwards. The idea that so called semi-classical physics, quantum field physics including low energy general relativity, which would end being applicable before those energies, must end in a time starting singularity has been laid waste by history. And in fact, inflation happens at energies well below \u201cuniversal breakdown\u201d [a factor 1/1000 less] even in the generic eternal versions. It could still be true that something extraordinary happens just before we currently lose track of cosmological history, but that would mean we would have missed a completely new understanding of \u201ctime\u201d.

We perceive ourselves as caught in a flow of time, channeled by \u201ctime\u2019s arrows,\u201d and seeing time as \u201creal\u201d (it may not be in all senses of that word) and unidirectional (there may be other directions just as there are with spatial dimensions).Our consciousness apparently being embedded in one temporal dimension shows up in human language and psychology. Everything \u201cmust\u201d have a before, during, and after. All effects \u201cmust\u201d have a prior cause. Our limitations of language then lead to the thought that something just cannot suddenly happen if there was not some \u201cbefore\u201d \u2014 some earlier cause. However, we now know that is not how the universe works. In some cases, effect can precede cause, or be concurrent with cause. If I dropped a rock from the third dimension into a two-dimensional water world, how would the two-dimensional creatures in that water world see the event? It just \u201chappened\u201d with no indication of a prior cause that they could see in their two-dimensional world. That may or may not be a fitting analogy to the Big Bang, but it should serve to illustrate how our limited senses and bounded psychology may fail to understand an event like the Big Bang \u2014 just as a group of intelligent crows might puzzle out how zippers work but never understand how to make a zipper.How would any sentient being conscious in and of n dimensions perceive universe? In string theory, we are in a 3-brane. We are conscious \u2014 we think! \u2014 of that fourth dimension, a temporal dimension we call time, but we have no apparent freedom of motion within it. Is it possible that in any universe of n dimensions, a sentient being in that universe would only have the ability of volitional motion in n-1 dimensions? That they would be caught in a \u201cflow\u201d of that additional dimension, able to sense something, but not move around in it? That their apprehension of that additional dimension would be such that their n-1 language and psychology would lead them into various logical dilemmas?Does our universe have dimensional \u201cedges\u201d? Not a limit on how far one can go in a spatial dimension, or how long one could be carried along in time \u2014 but the \u201cboundary\u201d that would keep say a two-dimensional Flatlander from standing up into a third dimension. If the Flatlander could reason out the existence of such an \u201cedge\u201d how might he or she describe it? A sort of Big Bang \u2014 a beginning for which a \u201cbefore\u201d has no meaning? A limit of space-time consistent with a constant like c? An equivalence of matter and energy?We may be like Flatlanders who have come to understand that their infinite Flatland is nonetheless bounded dimensionally, and that their best efforts to describe \u201cedges\u201d will sound nonsensical, logically flawed, and completely counter-intuitive.

            "answer_text": "I have a very particular idea of the Universe. I am not a physicist, a mathematician, astrophysicist or any type of scientist\u2026 Just curious. But I believe that the Universe is infinite. Universe. That means space (matter, more particularly, Hydrogen) and TIME. There\u00b4s TIME and there\u2019s Time. Time is a rather simple manner we - humans - devised to (try) to measure TIME. So, with these premises, I also believe there was not \u201cA\u201d Big Bang, but \u201cOUR\u201d Big Bang, among many other Big Bangs that are happening (were happening and will be happening) in the Universe. Forever. Forever back and forever forth. Imagine a hose pumping air in a bucket with water and soap. Whenever a new \u201cportion\u201d of air gets in the system, it forms a bubble that lasts for some time. This bubble bursts and ceases to exist, but another one is forming here, another one there, and so on. Space is the air and water and soap. But that\u2019s not enough. You need TIME to make Space functional. You cannot take Space alone, not considering TIME as well. There\u2019s no Space without TIME. But when TIME \u201cstarted\u201d? It didn\u2019t. That\u2019s the difficult part to accept. There was no \u201cbeginning\u201d, and there will be no \u201cend\u201d. It was always there. All that happens is transformation. The matter that participates in THIS Big Bang, one day will collapse to Hydrogen and \u201cappear elsewhere\u201d in another Big Bang, starting all over in that region. Many processes were needed to transform Hydrogen in what today we call \u201cOur Universe\u201d. The heavy metals, Rare Earths, Radioactive materials, Gold, Platinum, Tecnecium, etc., were not always \u201cthere\u201d. Hydrogen was. Hydrogen is the most common and simple element. Submit Hydrogen in a series of transformations, like stellar collapses, Novae, Supernovae, all that stuff, and you obtain Helium, Carbon, Oxygen, Iron, etc. \u201cOur\u201d Big Bang is actually in a temporal position (Space+TIME) that we have what we see today. And as it is \u201cour\u201d BB and it happened around 14 billion years ago, all we can \u201csee\u201d is 14 billions years of travelling light in any direction. We are inside one of those \u201csoap bubbles\u201d. One day it will burst, and all \u201cour\u201d matter will be \u201cdisassembled\u201d back to H2, (can I call it a \u201cGib Gnab\u201d?) starting a new cycle somewhere else. MAYBE Black Holes are the \u201cscape valves\u201d that perform this operation, and connect our \u201cdisassembling Universe\u201d to a brand new one, like a filter that engulfs all type of matter, bring it back to the elementary state (Hydrogen) and start a new cycle in another Space+TIME region. So, Big Bangs are \u201cpopping\u201d everywhere. Some are brand new, some are in their \u201cmiddle ages\u201d, some are \u201cdying\u201d\u2026 But there\u2019s no end, as there was no beginning. Again I say, I have not any scientific background os support all this. That\u2019s only one curious layman\u2019s idea that I have. I would be really happy to discuss this with more specialized people. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for asking this question. Let me answer your question by using this analogy: Suppose you\u2019re sitting in the board room of Apple (in Cupertino) and Tim Cook, who\u2019s sitting right across the desk, has your resume in front of him. In exactly half an hour, Tim has a space shuttle to catch. He\u2019s going on a very long trip to set-up Apple\u2019s headquarters on Planet Mars so that the company can avoid paying heavy taxes on Earth, and you\u2019re probably going to be his replacement IF in the next few minutes you can convince him that you\u2019re the right person to lead Apple. The stakes could not be higher if you wanted. Each second is important. You\u2019ve been talking to him for all of 10 minutes when you suddenly feel something in your abdomen. It\u2019s a sensation that you\u2019re too familiar with to not realize what a shit of a situation you\u2019re soon going to be in. It\u2019s the same-old trigger that your body has been sending your brain whenever a particular set of muscles in the lower half of your body are to begin contracting and relaxing. Congratulations, your dump is on its way. While you try to stop the inevitable from happening, Tim\u2019s getting quite impressed by you. He tells you how amazed he is with the amount of traction you\u2019ve generated for Apple on Quora. But before he can turn over the keys of the company in your hands, he must ask you some questions. He then starts asking you a set of really important questions. There\u2019s no way on earth you\u2019re getting out of this now. Not with him leaving in just a couple of minutes. You curse what you ate that day but that won\u2019t help. You\u2019ve been an Atheist all your life, but you still call upon God to save your ass. That isn\u2019t helping either. The contractions are now beginning to get really violent. Any moment now your muscles can decide to act in unison and empty your bowels, right there in the perfectly designed company-chair. You can\u2019t help but silently cry inside. You MUST get out now. You\u2019re about to tell Tim that how sorry you are and how you\u2019re ready to give up the job and need to excuse yourself when he exclaims that he has one final question for you before you can become his successor. What do you do? Obviously, you wait. You hold on to dear life for it\u2019s clear that in the next 2\u20133 minutes you\u2019ll become Person #1 at one of the most valuable companies on \u2018Earth\u2019. Oh, the agony! Each second seems like hours now and you cannot wait to get out. You don\u2019t hear a word he says are hoping that he doesn\u2019t ask you another question because then nothing will save the two of you from life-long embarrassment. Finally the moment comes. Tim\u2019s satisfied and he tells you that you can leave. Now, this is the MOST IMPORTANT part of my answer: From the moment that you leave his office to the time you locate, reach and use the nearest loo, happens in less than the what it took for the Big Bang to happen in. That, my friend, is how the the Big Bang could\u2019ve happened without there being any time for it to happen in. I hope it\u2019s clear now. ",

            "answer_text": "Since there is no generally accepted theory of quantum gravity this question can only receive highly speculative answers. However, those proposals that do exist, which attempt to make the universe somehow arise from quantum gravity usually involve some kind of tunneling event - analogous to the instanton solutions that exist in certain quantum field theories, like non-Abelian gauge theories. Instantons can occur in quantum field  theory that tunnel between degenerate vacua of the theory which correspond to classically different topological behavior of the fields at infinite distance. They can also occur when there is more than one local minimum to the potential of the field theory. Such solutions, it is argued, may exist in quantum gravity as well, if the theory is quantized by a path integral approach. One way of looking at the Einstein equations is to represent them as an infinite set of Yang-Mills fields, so the idea is at least plausible  There would be a tunneling event, presumably from an unstable vacuum state, which creates an initially inflating deSitter space from whatever state of the combined gravitational and matter field vacuum existed. Time and space need not be globally well defined before, since a path integral approach to quantum gravity could be interpreted to involve a sum over all possible spacetime topologies. At the end of the tunneling event, the comoving time would exist inside the expanding deSitter space. This is a vague answer, I know. But it's a good question. ",

            "answer_text": "The fact is no one knows if space/time didn't exist before the big bang. There are multiple theories based on this idea but mainly it\u2019s that our universe may not be the first and/or only. The details of the beginning of existence is the biggest question ever asked. I believe our universe is a black hole in another. Ever since learning matter increases in mass as it accelerates I've always figured that that means it also increases in gravity which would in turn curve space into a 4th dimension of space. So, if there is a critical sphere of matter collapsing in on itself due to gravity, it accelerates inward therefore increasing in mass therefore increasing in gravity therefore deforming space/time at a rate fast enough to keep particles from colliding with each other until they reach the point of no return when matter reaches light speed. At this speed matter curves space 90 degrees into the 4th dimension creating a relativity perpendicular to ours. In this case a black hole is the contact point of one universe with another. I also think that as the black hole/universe continues to consume matter it continues to expand increasing it\u2019s surface area allowing it to increase the rate of matter consumption which would accelerate the expansion of the universe(i.e. dark energy). There is more to this but that is the gist of my own thoughts. ",

Some will say that since the universe has a zero sum energy state there is no need for a cause to produce the effect which means there\u2019s no reason for time before the universe. The way I think of it, the lack of time \u201cbefore\u201d the big bang is a good way to explain how a universe could form. With a lack of time you have no cause and effect as we know it and an infinite set of possibilities. All possibilities exist and occur since there is no time limiting them, therefore no matter how improbable a universe from nothing is it would have to happen somewhere and our universe is where it happened. Another way to look at it is that time as we experience it is an expression of the space that our universe is made up of. There is also a possibility that outside of our universe\u2019s 3 dimensions there is a different time analog that is an expression of that set of dimensions and provides for a type of cause and effect externally to this universe. From that dimensional standpoint our \u201cTime\u201d would be 0 (all things are occurring at once from their standpoint), but it would not necessarily be linked in any way to our \u201cTime\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Just to throw a couple of monkey wrenches into all of this\u2014there may well have been a series of big bangs. That is the initial expansion known as the Big Bang, billions of years of expansion, then billions of years of contraction leading to a Big Crunch and then pressure starts up and the next cycle begins. And on and on and on and\u2026. Also, Alan Guth\u2019s cosmic expansion suggests that there are big bangs all the time forming in eddies of the expansions and then blowing into some quantum field and away from us. There is a theory that black holes send their material out into another expansion at their opposite side\u2014a White Hole. This theoretical occurrence looks and acts just like a Big Bang probably because they are defacto Big Bangs. All these countless Big Bangs form other universes, hence the multiverse theory. It is a bigger erector set out there than is probably possible to imagine. As you can see, time has little to do with all of this. It is just something we use to help order our existence on this little blue marble we all live upon. In fact, time is just a bi-product of the energy and eventual matter that issued from \u201cour\u201d one little Big Bang. Size is relative, as is time. But it is a great show that is for sure! ",

            "answer_text": "Objective spacetime definitely came into existence with the big bang as our universe appeared out of the multiverse (whatever that is) which is the meta-system or environment for all universes that is described by some string theory probably at the M-theory or F-theory level, i.e. at a level beyond what we can schematize. The pluriverse is the highest schema we have and that is 9 dimensional and string theory appears just beyond what we can schematize in the tenth dimension, then M theory unifies the various string theories that are possible in the eleventh dimension, and in the twelfth dimension there is F theory that is a further simplification, but also spawns two orthogonal time lines which we do not know what to do with. In the 14th dimension we get three orthogonal timelines. These extra orthogonal time lines is precisely what is needed to break down the fundamental assumptions of metaphysics which is that time is either linear or circular (eternal return, samsara). Primordial time must be something different from either circular or linear time. As Heidegger says in Primordial Time the various moments of time are equi-primordial, and the fact that there may be orthogonal time lines as Dunne thought back in the early twentieth century means that there must be other equi-primordial moments, so for instance the mythic time of the mythopoietic can be seen in these terms. We do not have to go very far to see how this other moment of four dimensional time worked, we merely have to go back before Thales in our own tradition and look at the Greek and other mythologies, which lost their force when the symmetry breaking of the metaphysical occurred producing the illusion of three dimensional time, plus lost time, just like Minkowski spacetime has nowhere beyond the light cones. It turns out that orthogonal timelines is exactly what is needed to understand how there can be an operating system (pluriverse) for multiple universes of which our own is just one. The reason we have a schema for it is that we can experience the multiple timelines associated with each moment of time in our own lives, and did so enmass in the mythopoietic era prior to becoming free autonomous subjects as Descartes and Kant pictured us to be, and which we are trying to live out. However, if we go back to Homer as Kelly and Deryfus do we can see that the early Greeks had a completely different orientation to the world, which they see as arising again in Melville that we associate with polytheism which they think exists before and after the monotheistic imperative we have been living out in the metaphysical era. However, since spacetime itself is projected according to Kant and not objective from our vantage point, and since objective spacetime is a noumena, then even saying that there is multidimensional space and multidimensional time is our own projection, and what existed in the multiverse is an unknown unknown which we can speculate about, unless we find some signature of it on our universe we will never know anything about it. Since there was a signature of the Big Bang (cosmic background radiation) and we can even figure out that the universe is till accelerating in its expansion, so we know that dark energy is streaming into our universe from somewhere. Since we have been able to figure out these things then we might find a meta-cosmic signature of the pluriverse somehow inscribed into our universe. But until then even the projection of multiple orthogonal timelines in the Matrix of multi-dimensional spacetime/timespace is merely our own projection from what we know about time and space in our own universe that makes our life possible on this small planet in the midst of an immense void.

            "answer_text": "The short answer is we don't know, and anyone that tells you they do know is mistaken. Einstein came to the conclusion that space and time cannot be independent of each other and that they react to each other so as to keep the speed of light constant for all observers. Minkowski expanded on this to define spacetime as a four-dimensional construct. Based on that, within the rules of our universe, time could not exist without space, and since space did not exist prior to the big bang, then neither did time. Okay, that answers the question for time as it is defined in our universe. But it assumes there is no other existence besides our universe. We can't answer the question of whether or not there is other existence - it is unobservable to us. But we are starting to gather information our universe that is leading to new theories. From 2001-2010 scientists gathered data from a NASA probe called WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe). Some of that data indicates that the microwave background fluctuates more on one side than on the other. One theory that explains this says that our universe is a bubble that separated from another universe. If that is true - then time did exist before our universe and exists outside our universe, but there might be a discontinuity between the time in our universe and the time in our parent universe. But, again, that is a theory in progress. ",

Newton, Principia, Scholium. No one since then has done any better. And the reason atheists, theists, and agnostics are still arguing in circles over the existence of God is that they have never defined a strategic word such as exist. In genuine science it is straight forward. If you want the audience to understand what you mean by time and by exist you simply have to tell the crowd what these words mean for the purposes of your presentation\u2026 The scientific definition of time, Science 343 (2014)  Once we have the strategic terms rigorously defined, it becomes obvious why it is irrational IN SCIENCE to say that \u2018time exists\u2019. Likewise, it is irrational to say that either time or space were \u2018created\u2019.   There was no beginning to our Universe. Matter did not spontaneously pop into existence with or without God. Matter cannot be morphed into space and space cannot be morphed into matter. It is the deranged Mathematical Establishment which has spread this nonsense to the masses on the basis of authority. . .

This is the infinite past theory. There is speculation by theoretical physicists that even in a max entropy heat death state (clocks could not tick in the usual way in such a state) something may eventually happen. See Robert Shuler's answer to Could there be alien civilizations advanced enough to have proof of the multiverse theory, or is the multiverse theory unprovable and untestable no matter what?Time at \u201czero\u201d moved asymptotically slowly, or may as well have for lack of a reference. This is the finite past infinite start theory. Or the we are the first universe theory. Since for it to just start all of a sudden is implausible (what would have started it then), we postulate it has always been starting, but infinitely slowly, so there is an infinite past, but a finite series of past states.",

            "answer_text": "All the time the ever existed, or will exist, that is an infinite amount of time, occurs between the big bang and the \u2018big crunch\u2019. A singularity has zero time and no other dimensions,\u2026 it is precisely ex-nihilo. Since the universe began with a singularity and will end with one, and since time slows to any \u2018observer\u2019 within, then time from alpha to omega is infinite. There exists no force that can prevent the collapse to a singularity. Any musing about quantum mechanical exchange forces preventing a singularity is spurious at best. This makes a puerile assumption that a highly compressed universe somehow still obeys quantum mechanics as we know it and is one compressed anti-symmetric wave function. Ludicrous. The inflationary time frame in the universe was indeed beneficial since almost all anti-matter was annihalated. Since Dirac asserts, and which is accepted, that anti-matter is matter traveling backwards in time, any prevailing of antimatter would have reversed the \u2018arrow\u2019 of time. This direction of time was set by the predominance of matter at the beginning largely by the left-handed chirality of the quark-gluon plasma that occurred perhaps 10^-30 s after t=0. This annihilation of anti-matter means that the unfolding of spacetime is being led by a truly massive wave of the most energetic photons ever. We can\u2019t see it,\u2026 nor would we want to,\u2026 since at c it is far in advance of our observation. If 10^80 particles of matter are left after this interaction, then the number of photons pushing spacetime is on the order of 10^160. In case you\u2019re looking for \u2018missing mass\u2019. On this subject there are so many \u2018sound-bite-type\u2019 comments made about how one feels about ex nihilo,\u2026 not much real discourse about the possibilities. Just because someone doesn\u2019t understand there being no time, or infinite time, and \u2018nothing outside the universe\u2019 or whatever, doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t true. ",

How did it supposedly create time?\u201d Put time in perspective, it is simply a measurement.  Time is a measurement we define, as we did with the 60 and counting on our hands, or the Egyptian/Babylonians and measuring the solar/lunar changes, or a clock keeps time or the cycle of the Universe is time, it is all simply a measurement we define. To say \u2018time\u2019 did not exist prior to the \u2018big bang\u2019 of the Lambda CDM model is akin to the pseudoscience Hubble expansion and Lambda CDM is based from. Both lack good science and logic, leading to more questions than answers. Some like that, to toil futilely, some don\u2019t and ponder alternatives that lead to advances. Ponder that if you were a god who existed eternally, just for this example or intellectual conceptualization. If the Universe we humans exist in were laid out like a foot stool in front of you, to just watch and amuse yourself with, what would you witness? Say the big bang just happened, a few moments ago and you have watched everything and see what is now and see it all progressing and you have the ability to be omnipresent, anywhere instantly. Would you understand and measure time enough to know before the big bang happened you existed and the big bang was simply a change of the matter=energy in front of you? And therefore, you might concluded \u2018time\u2019 existed, 1- prior to and 2-during and 3-after the \u2018aka big bang\u2019 spreading of the matter/energy of the Universe. Regardless how thin or far flung the energy, you would conclude time exists consistently simply as a measurement of what you witness. And to your mini god enjoyment the Universe of baryonic matter was a rather amusing ball of energy=matter in continuous flux and motion, change, to pass the time with. And so, with that you have your own answer regardless of \u2018no time existed\u2019 explanations. douG ref: Foundation of \u039e Theory ",

Even randomness balances, eventually, at infinity. All mathematically logically possible realities that can exist, do exist. Time is not so different from space. Our subjective consciousness navigates the information at a set clock speed. The fastest speed we can go, is also the fastest time can move if we are stationary. If you aren't moving through space you are moving through time. But what are you really? Time doesn't exist, and neither do you. But, also, for a moment, in a subjective wrinkle that hasn't yet annihilated itself - (like subatomic particles in a particle accelerator collision - or the dance of empty space in which particles dance on a sine wave into and out of existence and into an anti-existence and every so often they'll be near an event horizon and something will be created from nothing) - for a moment a universe will spring into existence just long enough for all of these events to occur allowing you to ponder this once again.. And again.. And again... And again... My ideas are, I'm afraid, too complex even for me to fully grasp. Time and space are both infinitely small and infinitely large.. Simultaneously. The big bang never happened, the universe is an oscillating hypersphere and only appears to have banged. The big rip is not propelled by dark energy, a mere theory, but by gravity (also a theory) - the singularity that gave us life will also rip us apart to be born anew. We don't see this because at superluminal speeds the great beyond appears black but if you gazed into space long enough you'd see yourself. -Garrett Remes ",

            "answer_text": "The words after and before are semantic analogies relating to the passing of time.  Therefore the question itself is inconsistent.   -- Here is a mathematical metafor: Imagine you live at a point on the curve y=1/x in the positive x, y quadrant.  Inspired by your favorite books, you dream of knowing about life in other quadrants.  So you embark on a voyage towards the Y axis, the nearest border, in hope of fame and fortune.   You walk for many days and you are getting really close to the Y=0 axis, so you keep going.  And going.  Soon, you meet a mathematician and a philosopher on the way.   \"You may as well stop now\" says the philosopher.  \"This road doesn't lead to X=0, it leads to infinity\".  \"X=0 is a singularity, it doesn't exist\" says the mathematician. Dismayed that you can never reach the Y-axis, you leave the mathematician and philosopher and go back to Cambridge University to become a physicist.  You start collecting data and taking measurements.  Finally, you shout \"Eureka, I've invented the big bang theory\".  You publish the theory and take it back to the mathematician and the philosopher. \"Pretty clever\" says the mathematician.  \"It explains most of the data and its mathematically consistent.  Its not wrong...\"   \"Interesting\" says the philosopher.  \"But we'll never be able to prove its right either\".   Frustrated, you remark, \"well its the best I can do given we have only had 300 years to study the universe.\" -- Time is a quality of the \"positive x, y universe\" e.g. space time 1) You can't ever go to the other quadrants to see what is there e.g. before the big bang.  2) You don't even know if X=0 or not since you can never go to infinity e.g. the beginning of time.   Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "The problem here is with the question more then the answer. What we have to consider is the context. We only know of time in relation to other dimensions. We have a working definition of time based on events that occur with matter and with motion. We know that an object with velocity has a relationship with time. We can solve for time, time being distance divided by velocity. Time as we know it requires mass and motion. But does it. We speak of a time just before the big bang. as we speak of the time just prior to that. We can speak of time as part of a series of events. We may not be able to quantify the time but we have a before, during and after. This is because time without an observer is not relevant to its own existence. As soon as you say that time before the big bang or the time before the existence of the universe as we know it, they you have just defined a time when time as a quantity defined couldn\u2019t mathematically exist but it did because time is a construct of our conscious experience of reality. If you have a political agenda for asking about time, that is you seek to undermine science for the metaphysical, remember you can\u2019t advance that agenda by creating doubts about those who use the scientific method to propose the formation of the current universe. You must prove your own point on it\u2019s own merit. there isn\u2019t a default position for the universe. ",

            "answer_text": "Asking what happened before time began is like asking what is further north than the north pole. It is a nonsensical question. One way to reference the reality to which you are referring is \u201cbeyond\u201d the universe, and I would argue that it is necessary that something universally independent exist in this reality in order to be the cause of the universe, but you cannot reference or think of this reality as \u201cbefore\u201d since any temporal relationship is meaningless and logically invalid without the existence of time. If you are asking how a cause-and-effect relationship can occur if time is the effect, then that is a good question. We often think of cause and effect linked to temporal relationships (ie. cause happens \u201cbefore\u201d the effect), however, there are cause and effects that occur simultaneously. For example, when you are sitting in a chair, there is an impression in the chair caused by your posterior resting on it. Both the impression and your posterior exist simultaneously, yet one is the cause of the other. The cause of the universe cannot have a \u201cbefore/after\u201d temporal relationship with the universe. Rather, like the chair example, it has a temporal relationship with the universe that is simultaneous. ",

            "answer_text": "Daniel Maindron. Jan 14, 2019 Credentials: Lived long enough to read and learn. Now a question: Does a triangle exist? A usual simple triangle, three vertices, three edges. Ok, we have now a space, because the triangle has sizes. A time for the time: let imagine the triagle is rotating just for a second. Again a question: does the triangle exist? It definately exists from the mathematical (or a programmer) point of view. But does it exist as a material object? Probably not. Otherwise somebody would already collected a fortune by puting them on a sale. Now let\u2019s insert the salesperson and the buyer into the same mathematical space-time. It takes some work. For that purpose let\u2019s imagine the objects and actions in that 4D space-time are obeying some laws of \u201cphysics\u201d. Say a combination of equations for the quantum mechanics (with a \u201cstandard model\u201d) and for the \u201cgeneral relativity\u201d. The equations, assumed, are corrected to avoid the current problem of being incompatible. Let formulate initial conditions: good enough to simulate the \u201cBig Bang\u201d. If the equations and the initial conditions are reasonable, then, the equations should have a solution in the solid mathematical sense. Tricking the initial conditions, we might find a solution very similar to the existence of our solar system (and the Earth as the gem of the system). At some moment in time, starting from the Big Bang, the solution reveals a salesperson with a possession of plastic triangles, very helpful for a woodwork hobby. You have got the idea: we have managed to make the material and the ideal indistinguishable. For us (mathematitians) the triangle is ideal (together with the whole \u201cworld\u201d of the solution), but for the salesperson his world is very real and material. Among other options, he might rotate one of trianles for a second, if he likes doing it for a better sale. Resume. A universe has been created. The fact that \u201cin a theory\u201d such equation exists, is already enough. No God, no mathematician, no programmer are required. The \u201clife\u201d is just an ordered sequence of time-cuts in the 4D space-time solution of the equation. There are as many worlds as many equations (or programs). We can\u2019t change anything in the \u201ccreated\u201d world of solution. Did time exist before the Big Bang? Now you know the answer. ",

            "answer_text": "The only evidence we have about the origin of our Universe is observable characteristics of it.  The most astounding characteristics are: The physical laws of our Universe are capable of producing physicists without outside intervention.  That would seem to call for great complexity, butThe physical laws of our Universe are simple enough that physicists thus produced are able to figure out those laws without outside help.Other scientists are necessary to close the circle by figuring out how those physical laws yield physicists. Characteristic #1 can be explained by the multiverse hypothesis, but that does not explain #2.  This remarkable combination of complexity and simplicity suggests that the Universe was created for the purpose of developing an understanding of itself without outside intervention.  Such a creator would not be any of the commonly worshipped gods, because of the absence of intervention after the creation.  Any supposition of intervention is blasphemous, because it implies that the creator was too stupid to create such astounding physical laws.  The doctrine of a non-intervening creator is called \u201cdeism\u201d.  This hypothesis does not tell us anything about the creator.  Our Universe could be a Ph.D. project, or a science fair project, or a parlor trick.  In fact, this hypothesis leaves us with the same questions about the creator\u2019s existence as it seeks to answer about ours, so it is more of a lifestyle choice than a real explanation of anything.  Physicists are in some sense hypothetical deists, because they are impelled by a desire to achieve the above-described understanding and a belief that it is possible.  ",

I\u2019m sure what it\u2019s actually called but let\u2019s go with that. Basically, the universe is cyclic and isn\u2019t constrained by a linear timescale. There is no beginning, no end, etc. The universe expands, gradually loses momentum, and the force of gravity pulls everything back together again in another Cosmic Egg\u2014the Big Crunch. This happens over and over again forever and ever. Another popular theory (this is actually a theory) is that the Big Bang was actually the explosive exit of material from a black hole in another, parallel universe. Every black hole creates a quantum pocket of space wherein everything it gobbles up becomes another universe. From the black hole side this happens gradually and endlessly, but from \u201cour\u201d side it looks like it happens all at once. There are numerous other explanations, and none of them are any more far-fetched than the concept of a creator. One of them, however, embraces the concept of a creator. This idea is that in the beginning there was nothing but the universal consciousness. It existed without form and did nothing but contemplate the reason behind its own existence. As it did this introspection, that massive amount of energy began to contract, growing smaller and more concentrated, until finally the universal mind had a brilliant idea. BANG! The universe was created, all for the purpose of this universal mind being able to have \u201cexperience\u201d. Pieces of this mind were scattered about, each of them directing and overseeing evolution to the point where lifeforms were created that could contain this spirit matter. Those pieces then inhabited the bodies of these beings so they could ahve experience and then share it with the universal mind. Far fetched? Maybe. But interesting; dare I say, fascinating. ",

It goes along similar lines to many things in physics, like gravity. We know gravity is there, we\u2019ve even seen gravitational waves recently, so we have a very good idea of how it\u2019s working\u2026 but we still have no idea how that actually came together, or how it\u2019s working on the quantum level. From how we see things, we shouldn\u2019t have gravity, but we do. The Big Bang goes the same way, but there are a lot of concepts that people have of how it could have happened. My favorite being brane cosmology. Brane cosmology goes along with String Theory, stating that the 4 dimensions we see here are just a small part of the overall picture, where there\u2019s most likely 12 different dimensions. When you have these 12 dimensions working on their own, there are times when they collide, creating a new system from their interaction. Where we are, 4 of these branes came together, and it\u2019s first impact made the big bang happen, and those 4 branes have been constantly pushing together to make the expansion of the universe. At one point, those branes will start to pull away from eachother, changing the expansion of the universe to a collapse, and we would end in a big crunch, everything coming together until a point where it\u2019s nothing all over again. Of course, there is no real evidence that this is how it works, and there is no possible testing to see if it\u2019s true or not, but it\u2019s still my favorite of the possibilities. ",

When we buy a house or a condo we\u00b4re not buying space, we\u00b4re buying walls that have a physical existence inside that space, as everything else. We cannot buy time, we do buy periods of lack of events or of distance between events: Monthly payments -for example-which means that 30 days (rotations of the earth around its axis) may go by without us paying anything. But those 30 days are not something that we can physically manipulate in any way, like making them longer or shorter or lighter or heavier, or paint them in any color. We think of time & space as \u201cthings\u201d, which they are not. They are non materialistic or intangible entities, so their existence should not be defined inside the frame of reference of our basic materialistic conception of things. Time or Space are not \u201cborn\u201d to live an independent life, like they were babies or flowers, they come to existence as part of the event of the birth, or the outcome, of something that requires them as a \u201ccontinent\u201d The existence of the universe makes no sense without time and space, as much as the existence of time and space make no sense without the existence of the universe. Furthermore, Time and Space must necessarily be proclaimed for the sake of human consciousness, for which those two entities are indispensable in order to understand the universe. They provide our consciousness with an \u201cimage\u201d of the universe without which we would be blind, and that\u00b4s basically all. Finally, an inquire about anything previous to the existence of the universe around us, as we observe it, seems like a long long road that leads nowhere, for the time being, or forever. Who knows? ",

They never existed in any sense whatsoever, imaginable and unimaginable.  There must be or have been something eternal, even if that something was nothing more than potential.  I like to think of it like this. There is no difference between 0 and 1, when 1 has no inside, outside and no constituent parts. There is no time and no space to this 1 and no events can take place. No cause and effect events and no possible observers. Nothing can interact with it because there is nothing else, but this 1 is something more than absolutely nothing. It could be subject to quantum perturbation assuming any random set of values, including an energy state which could spontaneously differentiate itself creating a false vacuum which could expand. The energy of that expansion later experiencing phase transitions which lead to the universe we are part of today.  ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re actually looking at it wrong. Tbh, one thing that has blown straight past all of Physicists\u2019 and Reasearchers\u2019 head is why exactly the Big Bang happened. There are obviously a lot of theories, but none concrete enough to be accepted by and large. So, now, coming fo your question. Even though we do not know why the big bang happened, it did, and due to the fact that all that much of energy, of the entire universe, was stored in something much, MUCH smaller than the present day universe, it was unimaginably, hellishly hot. In fact, it was so hot at it\u2019s very beginning, that things as fundamental as the 4 fundamental forces (Gravitational, Electromagnetic, Weak forces and Strong nuclear forces), as well as particles like leptons and hadrons (protons, neutrons, etc. come under them) did not exist, just the most fundamental particles like quarks and electrons. This was due to the high temperature, the particles moving about at such extreme speeds they couldn\u2019t be bonded to form particles like even a proton, much less any of the elements. So, basically what I\u2019m trying to make clear to you is that the conditions were extremely drastic. Hence, until a given point (I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t remember just how long after the actual big bang), even the laws of Physics, or rather, Physics itself didn\u2019t exist at all, before the big bang. So, fundamental things like space and time also did not exist. You cannot consider than since there was no space and time then how did the Big Bang happen. Big Bang is the mother of all, it is what created the concepts of Space and Time. I hope that helped. :) ",

But here\u2019s the thing, current physics did not yet exist at the Big Bang. Other processes were at play and obviously, they did not need Time to occur. Indeed, this period may be what is known as the Planck Epoch, a period that our current physics cannot describe since it was shorter than Planck Time. Furthermore, the conditions around the Big Bang was likely a singularity, where again, our current physics don\u2019t apply. It\u2019s the same reason the conditions inside a Black Hole is beyond our comprehension. Our current physics cannot handle the infinite curvature of space (aka gravity) that is likely inside a Black Hole \u2014 and around the Big Bang. In short, Time was unnecessary around the Big Bang since the physical processes did not depend on our current physical laws.  I wrote basically the same reply to why every particle in the universe isn\u2019t entangled even though they originated from the same object. S. Damon's answer to If a universe started from a single point called the Big Bang, shouldn't everything in this universe be entangled? ",

If space-time had existed it would not have allowed the sudden and massif expansion of that singularity. because there was no space-time there was also no limit on the speed that the universe expanded, which was many thousands factors of the speed of light. If that had happened in space-time the spacial fabric would have acted as a dampening field and prevented the singularity from expanding. How the singularity came into existence, science has no clue. Some claim that it has happened many times, the big crunch followed by the big bang, over and over. Even with this hypothesis, at some point something or someone needed to be the prime mover. How could matter (singularity) appear in a realm where there was no space (dimension) or time, a condition that we have problems imagining let alone being able to reproduce it (which is an impossibility). The easiest solution, and at this time the only viable solution to the problem is that God brought that matter into being. The one creation ex nihilo (from nothing) that would have set the whole process into motion. ",

            "answer_text": "Here, the word \u201c time \u201d should not be treated as the physical quantity that we call time. Here, the word \u201c time \u201d actually signifies \u201c our time \u201d. And to say that, time didn't exist before the Big Bang means that, our time, that is, the time in which we are currently living in, didn't exist before the Big Bang. This is because, before the occurrence of the Big Bang, our universe and everything in it was in an immensely condensed state, in the form of a singularity. Now, in a singularity, a huge quantity of matter and energy is condensed in a very tiny space. Due to this, the density of the matter and energy becomes so high in a singularity, that all the laws of Physics break down. Hence, all the associated ideas such as the idea of spacetime, also break down at this point. Therefore, it becomes impossible to determine what happened before the Big Bang through the laws of Physics. Also, since the matter and energy density at the singularity is so high, therefore, all the previous laws of Physics that governed all the matter and energy before they were condensed to form this singularity breaks down at this point. And after the Big Bang a completely new set of laws of Physics starts to govern the matter and energy. And these new set of laws of Physics does not depend in any way on the previous set of laws that governed the matter and energy before they were condensed to form the singularity. Hence, anything or any process which occured before the Big Bang is completely irrelevant for our current universe. Therefore, the time that existed, before the formation of the singularity and hence, before the Big Bang, is also completely irrelevant, as it can never ever affect or determine anything in our universe. This is why we ignore all the processes or the space and time which may have existed before the Big Bang, and consider that our time had a beginning at the moment of the occurrence of the Big Bang. Maybe the fabric of spacetime was totally different before all the matter and energy was condensed into that singularity than it is now. But, that could in no way ever effect the fabric of spacetime of our universe. Hence, we state that our time, or simply, time didn't exist before the Big Bang. Thanks for asking. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the biggest problem here is the assumption that time didn\u2019t exist before the big bang. In a Doctor Who classic series called Terminus, where at the exact center of the universe, they find a massive ship in space, once capable of time jumping, with a damaged engine, which if allowed to explode, would destroy the universe. But they also find an engine has already been jettisoned, suggesting the previous universe was destroyed in this exact way, and the ship time jumped into the creation of the next universe. So plenty of plot holes. But, what if time is the constant, and the universe expands until it cant anymore, (think elastic band), and then contracts back into a single point which then explodes (again). So time simply exists, and matter constantly re-arranges itself within it. This means that time is a concept too large for us to comprehend. It\u2019s our limited thinking which assumes the universe actually started, with nothing at all before it. But pretty well every theory starts with an assumption, which could be wrong. (This one too). ",

At the centre of every galaxy is a massive black hole that eventually gobbles up all the stars & matter in its galaxy. The more advanced this process becomes, the smaller, and brighter the galaxy becomes. Surely by the end of it, there could only be a super massive black hole left, with nothing else to gobble up. I imagine a whole universe dotted with these super massive black holes, each with a gravitational pull so strong, they begin to attract each other & merge together from vast distances, forming even bigger SM black holes with even more pulling power, until they have all merged into one gigantic ultra massive black hole, so massive, and with an infinite gravitational pull so strong, it starts to collapse under the force of its own gravity, to a point where it cannot compress any more, at which point, kaboom, the big bang. And from there, the universal process starts all over again ??? It could be that time actually stops in the final moments before the big bang, then starts again once the bang has happened ?? Anyhow, thats my theory. ",

            "answer_text": "Our awareness of any one moment in time is like the shutter of a lens taking one picture at a time. Who or whatever controls this shutter speed is in control of how we get to perceive the universe. It is commonly believed that before the big bang time was non existent as there was nothing to measure. Time as we currently know it now is merely a way of dividing the beginning to the end of the universe, as well as relevant events into measurable moments, or at least so we are taught. At least this way we are capable of making some sort of sense of it all. It is also generally believed that time can be change by moving at different speeds and as such the faster we travel the slower time becomes hence Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity. Unfortunately this couldn't be further from the truth.Some theorists would even go as far as postulating that we would one day be able to cross the boundaries of time hence time travel.  Einstein\u2019s Curse. I say this with the utmost respect as Einstein is certainly my favorite scientist having inspired me since a small boy always wanting to know more. The biggest breakthrough relating to time that has ever been made and which has stood the test of time for literally a century is nothing other than Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity. Whether future time will proof his theory to still remain correct or not is not as important as him having laid the foundations for many discoveries made based on his assumptions. Unfortunately only half a truth, which it is, will take you only so far eventually imprisoning you in a maze of misinterpreted information from which there is literally no escape. Inevitably it has lead to the majority of scientists now being caught up in the spider web of relativity. This a very bold statement but yet a statement that will proof to have far reaching consequences only to be appreciated by future generations. Einstein\u2019s curse hence the maze of relativity is just that for it literally enables one to get lost in the concept of time each time opening up new possibilities of mental entrapment with little or no escape. If we truly want to make sense of our existence then we need to take time seriously and treat it with the necessary respect that it deserves for only then will we get to understand the realities thereof. Time is universal, it\u2019s real; yet it cannot be manipulated in any way or form.Time is subjective to nothing not even to itself other than being a medium of integrity.Even if there were nothing, not even nothing itself, then time would still be moving along.Even nothing would be subjective to some duration within the constraints of time. Time is sequential and as such there is no way of going back or forth in time other than to embrace the moment and follow the flow of time.As such any one moment in time on a linear axis can only be experienced once during that specific moment in time. Once the moment is gone it\u2019s gone forever other than becoming a memory. The only way to have a peek into the future is by living in the past of which the present moment has already occurred.  The word \u201cTime\u201d dubbed by man might certainly be the creation of man but the very concept of time itself is the ultimate reality without which no physical or conscious realities can exist. As such this would make time the mother of all realities giving birth from moment to moment.Time is not subjective to matter of any sort, but matter itself is certainly subjective to time. Every single moment in time no matter how long or short that duration might be occurs at every conceivable point in the universe at the very exact same moment.  If any one moment in time was representative of a color then the whole universe would have been the very same color at any one such a moment in time no matter how long or short the duration of that moment might be hence the transparencing of time. As such no matter how big the universe might be, from moment to moment it would be following time changing from color to color at the very same instance. According to Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity if time was representative of a color then the universe would look like a rainbow. Time is all-pervading, always waiting for you, no matter where you go, no matter how long it might take you. As such it can be safely defined that only matter is capable of physical motion across the universe and not time itself. To help us to understand time, we need to establish sequentially defined points of reference from which point onwards we can relate to different duration's of measurement. No matter how close or far apart these reference points might be, the only important thing is that these reference points should remain consistent with no deviation at all, no matter what, to remain the same throughout our measurements. Whether you would like to distance the reference points in Planck lengths or the length of one circumference of a hydrogen atom or any other length of reference is not important at all other than the consistency thereof referring to one such a measurement as a single moment in time. The last and most important thing to take note of is; now that we have defined the realities of time, we need to use it in a meaningful, consistent and logical way. When the need arrive to mutilate time for the sake of explaining what we cannot make sense of, then one should rather walk away.But then, this is only my opinion from 25 years of painstakingly analysis of our perceived realities.

Time did exist before the big bang.For there  to even be a big bang there had to be moving rocks and w.e else before (in space ) Time is really just speed and distance and time really only applies to creatures who can observe. objects that are non living there is no time.  So no time actually dint exist until we came up with it. Haha But to answer your question  the way  your askin.. If there was objects hurdling through space before the big bang then time did exist. And there was...and if there wasnt then the big bang would of never even been . I guess it was only a matter of TIME  until the big bang happened. So to sum that up.  There had to be motion happening to arrive at the big bang. If there is motion and its traveling a distance. There is time .  To eloborate our time works the way it does . Because of thr precise speed the earth travels around the sun and how fast it spins. If the speeds were to change time would change.  Doesnt earth travel at around 20+ thousand mph  around the sun or what is it idk the exact number and 1200 mph it spins if these numbers were doubled. A day would be 12 hours long right? ",

When you start a game, that game has internal time. Everything in it (which is physics based simulation) moves/changes by some rules as time goes forwards. But what about the \u201cgame time\u201d before you started the game? It didn\u2019t exist at all. There is no \u201cbefore\u201d, and the reason for the whole in-game world coming into existence is well beyond the game world itself, it cannot be explained by the rules of the game. No observation within the game world can decide what cause it in the first place. One could argue that there was \u201cbefore\u201d. Surely, you could just run the whole simulation backwards from the starting point (if it\u2019s reversible), and see what happened before. But this is what *would* have happened if there was something before. But there still was no time before. Before that there was time for you to start the game, but such concept doesn\u2019t apply in the game world. It\u2019s not part of it. I imagine the big bang as even similar to starting the game, and we are part of it. It doesn\u2019t imply that we are in a simulation, just that whatever caused big bang is beyond the rules of our universe, it\u2019s just something we can\u2019t know. ",

            "answer_text": "A subtle but perhaps important distinction is that it might be more accurate to say that Time was undefined before the Big Bang, rather than saying Time did not exist before the Big Bang. So what defines or gives Time \u201cflow\u201d? Relativity says that Time and the speed of light are intimately related. A simple definition of Time is \u201cTime is what keeps everything from happening at once\u201d. From this definition (such as it is) we can see that Time is essentially a \u201crestriction\u201d. The speed of Light is also a restriction. The speed of light and Time appear to be the result of the same restriction. If for example the speed of light was infinite, or unrestricted, something could be in two place \u201cat once\u201d. Since being in two places at once is exactly what is not allowed by Time, we can see that a finite speed of light may be required to have Time. Since the restriction that creates the speed of light did not exist before the Big Bang, neither the speed of light nor Time were defined. Saying they were undefined is not quite the same as saying they did not exist, it might in fact be saying Time \u201cflowed\u201d infinitely quickly before the Big Bang and since Time was infinite, everything including the Big Bang was sure to happen \u201ceventually\u201d. So the question you posed originally can be completely turned on its head to ask if Time was undefined or infinite before the Big Bang, wasn\u2019t the Big Bang inevitable? ",

            "answer_text": "So, the question necessitates the definition of time. No time existed. Therefore nothing could have happened. That is your idea, right? So, time is not well defined. IMHO, time is the rate of change. If something can happen without change then time can be dropped. Let me try a different route: if something can be separate from time (change) then we are on track. We CAN have something before time, the only requirement is that there is no change. Then suddenly there is change. There is time. And things consequently start to change. Time is not some untangible supernatural phenomenon. It is not a force. It is just the rate of change. If there is no change then you can say: There is no timeTime is frozenThey seem to mean the same thing. Change itself creates the perceived phenomenon TIME. Well, that is my idea of it anyway. If we consider it to be some force or some other hard to grasp inherent property then we have a problem. Time can be zero, time can be infinite. It seems to me that this kind of gives it away as\u201dnot real\u201d. Or virtual. Just a rate of change. Compared to what? Compared to other changes. You alway compare to some other change (e. g. A clock, which is based on some change). Also, if there is only one particular kind of change happening, you have the strange case of not being able to compare it to anything. Which seems contradictory (change should be measurable, but if there is only a single kind of change happening then it\u2019s not possible to reference it). So, consequently, as long as just one particular change exists, one can still say time does not exist. As there is no basis for reference. Existence therefore, to a limited extent, seems to be possible without time (rate of change). I hope I\u2019m not confusing anyone. Think about it for a minute. If there is only ONE kind of change exists and absolutely nothing else, then this one lonely change cannot be compared to anything. If you are physically there to do anything then you violate the uniqueness (homogeneity) of the environment and create time. So it seems to me that \u201cthings can happen\u201d without the concept of time. As long as these \u201chappenings\u201d are homogenic. Time, conceptually, can only begin to exist once there are at least two different rates of change exist. As to the extent (e.g., physical, dimensional etc.) of the change that is allowed to exist without the concept of time is not clear to me. But, following the logic, it should be possible. But I cannot dimensionalize it myself. One can make the mistake of saying \u201cbut I can measure that change by comparing it to my own reference frame\u201d - well, maybe. But what is the nature of that \u201clonely change\u201d that occurs? I would not presume to know. Compared to our own frame of reference, it could last for a millionth of a second, five seconds, ten hours, fifty years or trillions of years. For an arbitrarily long time, really. But its nature remains hidden to me. ",

These are all part of the tool that we use to talk about the universe and to do science. Does left, right, up, down, front, or back exist in the reality for a rabbit or a squirrel I don\u2019t think they would know these concepts. Certainly they are not part of their reality. Neither were they part of the realities of our ancient hunter/gatherer ancestors. This is not to say questions concerning origins were unknown to our ancestors. The concept of direction is apart of our model. It is embedded in our idea of coordinate systems. The concept of space is based upon the idea of measurement. The search for origin is all apart of the concept of cause and effect. It is easy to create a coordinate model, which leads to the question you have asked. The Big Bang model was not meant to answer questions of origins. In fact the model has nothing to say about time zero. It fails to provide consistent information at that time. That is why time of zero is call a singularity. You can only use it correctly where time has a value greater than zero. This is only our best guess. Newton provided a good model. But that model has been improved to the one we currently have (e.g. the Big Bang). But this model is only our current best guess. As we continue to gain knowledge it will be improved or replaced. I don\u2019t know what answers the improved model will provide. The reality is that the universe does exist. That is a starting assumption of the model. Assumptions are assumed to be true without proof, or explanation. If you want to create a new model to address that question be my guess. However, you should be aware of Parmenides logic which says that a model that includes both existence and non-existence is inconsistent, and will lead to a contradiction. ",

            "answer_text": "Your hypothesis that time did not exist before the eventuation, (Big Bang) is flawed because time is elusive and intangible. We can measure and calculate events past and future but nothing in this universe can stop it, including the end of our existence. The essence of time exists throughout all space including our eventuation plus six others that are presently in the process of expanding or contracting. Our eventuation is still in the expansion stage. Since you most likely have no idea what I am talking about I will provide links at the end of the video that will explain everything and more. But first I will briefly tell you about our eventuation. Some countless trillions of light-years ago an event took place, an accidental happening that occurred and is known universally as the eventuation. It was that event that created everything that exists in our universe. It is also a little-known fact that no self-proclaimed deity is responsible for its occurrence. It was this event that started its chronometer's countdown and will continue until our eventuation completes its cycle. After reading your question and some of the answers from the equally uninformed, I feel everyone needs to gain some insight into universal knowledge. I do not mean to sound conceited or condescending. It\u2019s just that through no fault of their own, they have been deprived of universal knowledge their entire life. For that reason, I produced a generic video that should provoke some curiosity by including answers to several germane subjects. If you listen to the entire video and utilize the links, you will have a greater understanding of these occurrences. The answer to your original time question is covered on the second recording on the eventuation tapes. The other links contain important information everyone should know but never learned because of the fall of Atlantis. Once again, most everyone is ignorant of Prince Calagastia, Lucifer, and Satan and the planetary rebellion. That is the primary cause of our planets present atavism. Everything is posted on the website, all anyone has to do is read or listen. Once you gain access to the UBEC website, I encourage you to avail yourself of learning some Celestial Knowledge and Spiritual Enlightenment that is not available in any church or formalized religious institution.

            "answer_text": "I don't think of the Big Bang as an event that happened in a place, but rather the level of description at which spacetime is a single 'here and now'. Without any space to 'bang' into, or any scale of duration to compare with, the bang is as much an incursion of spacetime into the cosmological Totality as it is an explosion of mass-energy into nothingness. What is an almost instantaneous fraction of a nanosecond to us may have been hours, years, or eons in the relevant terms of experience...once we allow that experience is present intrinsically in some sense. Because we do not know the relation of our own awareness to these cosmological scales of awareness, the Big Bang could be said to still be happening, right here, with us inside it. It could also exist as a kind of mirage - the image of linear time's collapse into singularity which projects backward from the expectations of the physics that has evolved since.  The Big Bang may be a creation myth that is appropriate to a particular stage of human understanding - one dominated by mechanism and instrumental reasoning. It holds up a mirror of a fixed, ever-receding point, when the deeper reality may be that such a point is one of many recurrences of the theme of origination. The truth of cosmic origin may be that it is more like a hub of time and space, more of a Platonic, monadic state in which the blueprints for basic shapes, colors, arithmetic relations, and qualities of experience are drawn up from back stage - free from the spacetime constraints of the show.

            "answer_text": "So, I\u2019m going to chime in with a layman\u2019s perspective as best I understand it. In order to have time, you need a clock of some sort. Not a clock with a face and hands, but a clock in the sense that you need matter in order to interact with time. This is true for distance as well. Without time, you don\u2019t have distance in any direction, or rather\u2026.distance in any direction doesn\u2019t matter at all because it\u2019s a big fat zero if you don\u2019t have time. EM radiation doesn\u2019t experience time. From a photon\u2019s perspective, it arrives at it\u2019s destination the very moment it is emitted at it\u2019s source. Photons don\u2019t care about time, and basically live \u201coutside\u201d time from their frame of reference. With that in mind, imagine two universes. One universe is a cube who\u2019s edges are one light second across. The second universe is 10 billion light years across. If these universes are filled with only light or EM radiation, and no matter, a photon would not be able to tell which universe it is in. Whether traveling one light second, or 10 billion light years, the photon experiences zero time. From the perspective of the light inside each universe, these two cubes are exactly the same no matter what their real size is. Now, if you add someone into each of these universes to be an observer, and these two observers from each universe can compare notes, these two observers can measure the size of their respective universes and tell that they are different sizes. However, by adding observers, you\u2019ve added matter and by adding matter, you\u2019ve added a clock. In these universes where observers exist, time is important. In universes where matter doesn\u2019t exist, time is irrelevant. It may exist. It may not. It doesn\u2019t matter because without mass, time has no function. We can say time didn\u2019t exist before the big bang because there was no slower-than-light observer around to interact with it. Space itself, the void, could have existed, or not, but time is completely irrelevant until there is matter. ",

Quantum Entanglement is a localization of space without a reference to time. Therefore, not everything in the universe is necessarily governed by Time. Time likely is not a fundamental element of physics. Also, in different dimensions, the qualities of time can be very different. Space/time is relativistic, not immutable. See CERN's extra dimension particles. Personally, based on mainstream physics intentionally ignoring non-localized hidden variables: I believe the Big Bang is just successive approximation that leads astray to a dead end. Much of the observable universe is inconsistent with the Big Bang theory. Observations seem to be more consistent with physics constants slowly evolving.

            "answer_text": "The recent theory called as string theory describes our universe as one of the many parallel universes existing in other dimensions which are out of reach by us. Its basis is that every particle and object is made up small strands of vibrating strings which are existing all over the universe. These string need more than 4 dimensions to travel hence its said that there are a total of 11 dimensions existing and the parallel universes may be existing these dimensions. Why we could not see it? Now take an example, imagine you are as small as an ant and you climbing a pole (circular obviously) now you will notice the ant go in five dimensions(up,down,front,back,and circular). Similarly there are dimensions but they are so small that we are unable to see them. So, its said that these strings expand and thus acting as a membrane on which our universe is existing. Its theorised that (as there is no explanation of the bang in big bang theory) it could be that, the two membranes( one of ours and other of parallel universe) collided thus giving the bang and generation or formation of the universe. Now if I go into detail it will become complicated thus I would say that its still a mystery whether time existed before the collision of the two branes or not. Hope this helps. ",

A definitive statement of what happened during the BB or before has to be qualified as an assumption based on X, Y and Z reasoning.   I would like to provide an answer to this question also but I admit that I have absolutely no empirical evidence (nor does anyone else) so my response is an assumption based on the following: A Super Nova and gamma-ray bursts are the most violent events in the present day universe.  We know some details about super novas but very little about gamma-ray bursts but we extrapolate that they might be the result of what we call a gravitational collapse - essentially, the matter condenses so much and concentrates its gravity to such an extent that it begins to break down the atomic structure of matter - similar to an atom bomb but instead of doing it with a kilogram or two of matter, it does it with billions of kilograms of matter - resulting in an explosion that can be seen from 10 billion light years away. I imagine the BB to be something like this.  If you assume that we exist in an infinite or near-infinite universe, then what we call the BB might be just a larger, more powerful version of a super nova that occurred in our little corner of the much larger universe.  This implies that what we call the universe is not all there is. Alternatively, if it was anything like the gravitational collapse of a super nova, and if  you think that what we call the universe is all there is but that it is infinite in time, then that implies that perhaps we are on a repeating cycle of BBs followed by a Big Crunch which develops into another BB and it repeats every 300 or 400 billion years. Humans have a hard time coming to grips with a speck smaller than a grain of sand that exists \"nowhere\" and \"outside of time\" and then it bursts into an entire universe.  It may work out on paper in math equations but we are not robots or computers and we don't think like that.  At least, I don't. ......In my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "Discussing the universe requires a conceptualization of what is the universe. What Is The Universe? Robert H Kroepel Copyright \u00a9 2020 Lakeside Studios New Durham NH USA The universe is comprised of space, time and matter-energy (m-e). Finite = Having spatial, temporal, physical, and/or mathematical limitations, boundaries. Infinite = Having no spatial, temporal, physical, and/or mathematical limitations, boundaries. Causality = People, objects and/or events exist in space, endure over time and are comprised of matter-energy as causes causing as effects (A) changes of the physical states of pre-existing people, objects and/or events or (B) new people, objects and/or events from pre-existing matter-energy. Coincidentiality (Proximality) = People, objects and/or events being non-causally co-located in space and time. People and objects are entities \u2013 things who/which exist in space, endure over time and are comprised of matter-energy. Events are causal or coincidental relationships between or among entities \u2013 people and objects, things. Space is the single infinite volume whose radii are infinite in size because they have startpoints but no endpoints in contrast to finite volumes whose radii are finite in size because they have BOTH startpoints and endpoints. The infinite (spatially boundless, unlimited) single infinite volume that is space eliminates any possibility of the existence of any other space, time, matter-energy, person, object, event, or \u2018consciousness\u2019 beyond or outside or in addition to itself which means anything that exists exists within space and therefore within the universe. The infinite size of space that eliminates any possibility of the existence of anything beyond or outside or in addition to itself means there was nothing that could have created or caused space to exist and that means space has always existed in the past, exists now in the present and will always exist in the future. Time is the use of a chosen duration (cycle, recurring motion) for a time-interval for a unit of temporal measurement for the measurement of other durations, the generation in timepieces of their timerates, timepoints, timelines, and timecounts, and the determination of sequences of events, simultaneities of events, causalities and coincidentialities of events, and changerates of events at all scalar levels and inre single and multiple reference frames and bodies. When time is measured using distortable timepieces, the type of time is local time \u2013 proper time, the unique time relevant to specific reference frames and bodies, Einstein\u2019s time, relativity time; when time is measured using non-distortable timepieces, adjustable timepieces, radio clocks (USNO, NIST, GPS), or inertial clocks (US Military \u2013 Ships, Submarines, Aircraft, Tanks, etc.), the type of time is universal time \u2013 absolute time, the same time everywhere and anywhere in the universe, Galileo\u2019s time, Newton\u2019s time. The timeline (continuum of time) of universal time (absolute time) is infinite from the past through the present into the future because of the infinite/eternal existence of space and therefore the universe. Matter-Energy is the set of elementary and subatomic particles, atoms and molecules and their relevant forces (push-forces and pull-forces) that comprise all people, objects and events (1) who/which exist in space and endure over time (in contrast to ideas and intuitions inre people, objects and events that exist within neural networks inside brains/nervous systems) and (2) who/which as causes cause as effects (A) changes of the physical states of pre-existing people, objects and/or events or (B) new people, objects and/or events from pre-existing m-e. M-e has been proven to be indestructible and therefore never created nor destroyed by experiments in chemistry by Antoine and Marie Lavoisier circa 1777, by experiments in thermodynamics by Sadi Carnot circa 1826, and by experiments inre the transformation of matter into energy and energy into matter circa 1905 to the present that confirmed Albert Einstein\u2019s e = mc2 and m = e/c2 and confirmed that m-e never was created or caused and cannot be destroyed and therefore, like space and time, has existed infinitely/eternally. Within matter-energy, and within all entities and events, there are two basic types of forces: (1) a push-force \u2013 found in electromagnetism and in atomic reactions; (2) a pull-force \u2013 found also in electromagnetism, the type of force that attracts elementary and subatomic particles, atoms and molecules, including gravity \u2013 the pull-force that surrounds massive objects such as suns and planets, and the strong and weak forces found within atoms and molecules. Comments: Whereas space has always existed, time has always existed, and matter-energy has always existed, then the universe has always existed. Bangs and Crunches may have occurred and may continue to occur, but they are relevant only to changes inre matter-energy and not to the existence or nonexistent of space as the infinite volume and time as the infinite existence of duration and the measurement of duration. Therefore prior to any Bang and after any Crunch, space, time and matter-energy has to and therefore had to have been present. The universe did not begin with a Bang and will not end with a Crunch.

            "answer_text": "People have it wrong when they call time the fourth dimension. Even more wrong than the flat earth fruitcakes. Time, duration if you will, is the prime dimension. Our entire universe exists within the framework of duration. The conditions required for \u201cThe Big Bang\u201d to occur were painted on the canvas of time. To say that there was a point that time did not exist would argue that nothing exists or could possibly exist. Occam's razor tells us that the simplest solution is the most likely. Doyle's \u201cabsence of evidence is not evidence of absence\u201d only reinforces this concept. Consider further that the universe is expanding at a rate that exceeds the speeds of light and gravity. This implies that time exists without depending on matter to validate it's existence. In short, the premise of a time without time is flawed and no conclusion based on that premise can be valid. ",

            "answer_text": "According to present knowledge, the early universe was a homogeneous phase of radiation only. Radiation has a positive pressure that can be calculated from the equation of state of a photon gas Photon gas - Wikipedia . This lead in the past to expansion and cooling. The result is a condensation of radiation into matter. But radiation alone can\u2019t do that without a catalyst in the form of a nucleus. We see this need clearly in the pair production process. So even if the initial state of the universe was pure radiation, there must have existed at least a single particle- an electron for example, to initiate condensation.. very much like a super-cooled water vapor or liquid water requiring a seed to start a phase change. Such an electron was either present since the start of the universe, or if conditions does not allow it to exist, must have been thrown at us from another universe. I did read a research claiming a singularity connection between our universe and what was before it. The electron could just be it. Coming to time now. If we had just radiation, then there is no way to tell time. What we always have is a space-time since everything is on the move, and has momentum. Momentum as we know contains all the units that are needed to create a whole universe in its radiation and matter phases, since we have mass, length and time. To separate space from time(artificially), we could associate space with linear motion and time with circular motion. Then time becomes simply the count of the number of such rotations. This count is a scalar quantity, and also going in one direction only- always increasing, as it should for the time variable. In general, we could distill time by infinite averaging over space, and space or distance by infinite averaging over time of the variable momentum. Thus, radiation can be associated with space/distance for its linear motion, and indeed this is how we define the standard meter these days- by the time taken for light to go (and come back) between two points. The timing for this is done by something that rotates. This in fact is provided by the electron- being a self trapped electromagnetic radiation in a circular path. And this in fact is the source of the internal clock of the electron- the Zitterbewegung. So, wherever we can find an electron, we can tell time. Since we must have had an electron from the start, we conclude that time must have started with the start of the universe too, and not later after a big bang. This shows the question has the right sense.. if there was no time, there could not have been a condensation and the big bang. ",

The universe as we know it will continue to stretch outwards until it either snaps and breaks or will shrink backwards and time will continue going forward and backward at the same time. Our exsistance will be recycled in time and we will possibly have the opportunity to become everything in the universe at least once or more until the universe stops stretching and shrinking . We will pass the time we were born time and again and at our point which is cyclical we have the opportunity to live our lives over again with the opportunity to turn right when you originally turned left. Time will move forward to us at our point of origin even though the universe will be expanding or contracting. It\u2019s like a plane is overhead at 5000 feet and you are on the ground looking at it from your perspective. Time has a different purpose for all of us. But if we live our lives accordingly we could be in one place or the other. In that way Time is like a tree and the bifrications and branches are different timelines and the trunk being base time. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all your question is based on two concept, Big Bang and time which must be defined before we can answer your question. Actually, time is defined as the energy fluctuation in a system between two evens (measure delta h). The evens can be photon or particules emission which are discret evens. If the mechanism behing the photon movment is not functional and there is no maters, there is no time. Did it means that there was no local fluctuation in space before the Big even ? No, but without movment, time can\u2019t exist. For the Big Bang, the physical measurments sustaining this theory are: a. The Univers is in expansion. b. There is a 3 Kelvin remanent energy background discovered by Mr. Hubble. It is establish that the universe starts from a local point with huge (almost infinite) density and energy. The problem I have with this theory is : why a photon generated 13 billion years ago suddenly decide to make a u-turn and come back to us ? So if the time is not perfectly defined and the Big Bang theory not completed (no information on what was the structure of the univers before), your question can\u2019t be answered directly. ",

If I remember correctly it is thought that nothing that happened prior to the Big Bang (if there was a before) could affect anything after. That is why we say that the Big Bang is the beginning of time. If we ever somehow prove that something existed before the Big Bang, we would probably make a delimiter such as BBB vs ABB (Before Big Bang vs After Big Bang). Also, if memory serves, it is believed that many of the fundamental rules of physics were created within the first tiniest fraction of a second after the Big Bang so time as we know it may not have existed before the Big Bang. All in all, the true answer is that we do not know. We can only theorize, albeit with an increasingly higher level of accuracy. ",

This ticking time element when cumulated might be the reason for expanding space; quantum behavior and virtual particles of space\u2026etc etc\u2026This cumulative compounding of time maybe continually creating space-mass-energy into universe, and therefore might be reason for almost equal average energy distribution around universe in every directions.

Once the Big Rip results in there being an event horizon at every Planck volume it will end up with a particle's worth of energy at every point in space, equal presumably to what the vacuum energy is theorised to be (10^123 times greater than what we actually see now); more than enough for a Big Bang. So it is possible to suppose there was space and time before the BB, although that space would not be the space in our observable universe (having expanded way beyond our event horizon) and that time would be inaccessible to us for a similar reason. The BB is then just an event horizon. ",

This is all speculative, of course, because I don\u2019t really know. But I like to think that space didn\u2019t exist until it was created. Must there have been a creator? Not necessarily. Causality is a hypothesis. We know that much of reality comes from causes, but we also know that much in physics happens spontaneously. The moment when a radioactive atom explodes, in current physics theory, is not causal but random; identical atoms can and do behave differently. ",

In developing cosmological concepts, as well as all forms of physics, if you always set t=0, the equations become indeterminate, and mathematically, the universe disappears, or comes to a halt. This is the relativity of Relativity(General and Special).  By definition, time is a key part of the universe, but even more important , the frame of reference must be defined specifically.

But if there wasn't time before the big bang, that wouldn't affect the contents of the Big Bang because they actually took up space and therefore had a progression of time. The lack of time was only outside of where the space that the contents of the Big Bang existed, just as it does on the ever expanding edge of our universe today. The contents then expanded based off of the fact that particles like to be a certain distance from each other, creating what we call today the Big Bang. ",

            "answer_text": "This argument about whether or not the universe had a beginning, persisted into the 19th and 20th centuries. It was conducted mainly on the basis of theology and philosophy, with little consideration of observational evidence. This may have been reasonable, given the notoriously unreliable character of cosmological observations, until fairly recently. The cosmologist, Sir Arthur Eddington, once said, 'Don't worry if your theory doesn't agree with the observations, because they are probably wrong.' But if your theory disagrees with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, it is in bad trouble. In fact, the theory that the universe has existed forever is in serious difficulty with the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Second Law, states that disorder always increases with time. Like the argument about human progress, it indicates that there must have been a beginning. Otherwise, the universe would be in a state of complete disorder by now, and everything would be at the same temperature. In a universe that was essentially static, there would not have been any dynamical reason, why the stars should have suddenly turned on, at some time. Any such \"lighting up time\" would have to be imposed by an intervention from outside the universe. The situation was different, however, when it was realised that the universe is not static, but expanding. Galaxies are moving steadily apart from each other. This means that they were closer together in the past. One can plot the separation of two galaxies, as a function of time. If there were no acceleration due to gravity, the graph would be a straight line. Source: hawking.org.uk ",

So did time exist before you were born to experience it? I will always say yes! So ascertaining time has always existed, irrelevant of your being there to witness it, is only part of the story. Time itself can be extrapolated back, before all life on Earth existed, with accurate science we can determine that space and time began from an infinitesimally small point and around 13.8bn years ago, quantum fluctuations look to have caused a period of cosmic inflation and ever since the Universe has been a fight between the attractive force (gravity) of its\u2019 mass and the repulsive force (dark energy) which we can witness today. Did time exist before that?\u2026Maybe! If it did then you are looking at the possibility of a cyclical Universe (Big Crunch Model) or something along the line of a Multiverse Model for our cosmos. If it didn\u2019t, then you have to look at accepting the idea that nothing whatsoever existed until those quantum fluctuations did their magic and we\u2019re all evidence of their beautiful work! ",

You would get 1 straight away as it doesn't matter how many times you rolled the dice it only happens when it happens as there was no time before that.

            "answer_text": "While there is plenty of speculation, such as in Mr. Sinha's answer, no one knows if or what may have existed before the big bang. Or even if it is meaningful to talk about time being frozen or about time \"before\" the big bang. A major stumbling block is that general relativity (our best understanding of gravity and how space-time behaves in the large) and quantum mechanics (our best understanding of all the other forces and how particles behave in the small), while both predict events to many decimal places of accuracy, are mutually incompatible in extreme cases such as black holes and the big bang. I hope I will live to see these two theories unified/superseded by one that also explains, among other things, how our universe came to be. String theory aims to be that theory, but it has a long way to go. Loop quantum gravity is another. Another possibility is that we live in a holographic universe -- one that appears to have three dimensions of space, but is actually two dimensional. No, I'm not making this up. See Holographic principle. ",

            "answer_text": "You are a bit incorrect about there being nothing that can happen without time. Things happening tell us there is time. The reason nothing can happen without time is that if it could, it would be a clear contradiction - it would contradict the definition of time. Now, for your question. There are some things we don\u2019t understand about the Big Bang that is time related. For an example, there is Planck time. This is basically the time it would take a photon to travel 1 Planck length, the smallest length where physics as we know it makes sense. Now, when the big bang happened, we know that it couldn\u2019t have just skipped over the Planck time. Everything that happens, happens from one time, but, as there is no time because the only thing you have is this singularity ready to explode, the Big Bang must have happened and had a period of what we call a Planck era. What we assume happened in that short time (it\u2019s around 10^(-43) of a second) is that all the fundamental forces we currently observe in the universe held that singularity together, had the same strength (now it\u2019s strong nuclear force > weak nuclear force > electromagnetism > gravity) and were unified. But as neither the radius of the universe nor the time the universe had been alive made sense, we can\u2019t say for sure - this is what general relativity predicts, and as you might know, general relativity has problems with forces and cannot be called the theory of everything. So in short, we don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t make sense if we think about it. ",

In layman's terms something that doesn't exist (impossible but go with me on this, lol) cannot of its own initiative \"decides\" to pop into existence. Before the existence of all MATERIAL existence, i.e. the Universe(s), I do wonder if time existed? Probably not as we know it. Our clocks started in the trillionths of a planck time unit after the initiation of the Big Bang. But \"before\" that event's moment, was the Universe just \"waiting\" to will itself into existence? I'd say not. But I love where the discussion leads. One other associated thought: there are \"things\" not yet existent but may in future. If I could name something that doesn't exist, would it after I did? How? ",

In a nutshell, we observed the known universe was getting larger and cooler, and, that therefore, it used to be smaller and hotter. That\u2019s pretty much the meat of it. The confusion involves some concepts, such as spacetime, which is what expanded. The big bang did not take place at a place, it took place at a time. Many consider this to be when OUR time started, and, that was about 13.8 billion years ago. There was a time before this, and, space itself is infinite, and always was\u2026.and it was spacetime that started expanding, not space per se\u2026.even though the large scale (Multiple galaxy scale) effects do mean that incredibly distant things get further apart, at that scale.

Given premises, there are certain procedures that be followed if we want a logical output. In your particular case, \u201cIf time did not exist \u2026\u201d is a sort of premise (Perhaps better put, \u201ctime did not exist then\u201d) but it is speculative because we do not know. We now have to make several jumps to get to the big bang. Aristotle then pointed out, if you cannot find established premises, and you ant to avoid random speculation, you have to induce your premises from observation to get started. Unfortunately, we have no observations as yet regarding the initial situation. So my answer to the big bang is, we as yet have no idea how it happened, let alone why it happened, and anything we say is simply a wild guess. That may change eventually, as we gather better observational methodology, e.g. possibly through gravity waves, but as yet, we have no idea. ",

The arrow of time, the thing that makes the past different from the future, appears to be a function of the increase in entropy from its low at the start of inflation towards infinity. Prior to the start of inflation there was no stable matter or spacetime, at least as far as our universe is concerned. Time, space (but again not spacetime), and the quantum fields existed but time did not pass in the sense we see it passing today. Without an arrow of time, quantum fluctuations simply occurred uncaused, as they still do now. It wasn\u2019t until a quantum fluctuation produced enough matter (about one gram) in a small enough space (about one billionth the size of a proton) that inflation was triggered and the matter became stable, giving entropy a chance to begin increasing toward infinity. Shorter answer: Time did exist before the big bang but past and future did not. The big bang, or more correctly the inflation that went on to trigger the big bang, happened because a rare but inevitable, uncaused quantum fluctuation produced enough concentrated matter to trigger it.

But we cannot impose a unique time-ordering on a curved spacetime, which means that you can\u2019t meaningfully speak of global causality. The big bang is most certainly a global event, and as such, causality isn\u2019t really a meaningful concept for the big bang. This is probably a unsatisfying answer, as I\u2019ve essentially said \u201cyou can\u2019t even really ask about what caused the big bang because the question doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d This is one of the unfortunate realities of general relativity, along with similar ambiguities in defining the distance or time interval between two events in a curved spacetime.

The big bang was not an explosion, despite what you have seen on TV. It was a shift in the balance of these dimensions, and they resettled in such a way that the time dimensional axis was available as a coordinate. It's not a 'before/after' type of question, the transition happened in zero time, from stresses along other dimensional axii ",

That is acceptable as a logical interpretation of nothing. Now here comes the rub, the thing is, we , on the whole, don\u2019t understand the intrinsic properties of this so called empty space. The truth is, we have evidence that even in this empty place, particles actually pop in and out of existence, as if it is an actual property of empty space, to try and partially fill it to balance out the apparent emptiness with some matter. There is evidence for this, quantum fluctuations, the Casimir effect etc. ",

The Big Bang is treated as a mathematical singularity which means that the math we are using cannot extrapolate beyond that point. No one has figured out how to do better than that yet. Science hopes to someday perform experiments that will lead to the discovery of new principals that will permit a proper understanding of what the Big Bang really was and where everything ultimately came from. That has not happened yet but keep in mind that science is having its own Big Bang and progress is happening at an accelerating rate. Perhaps these questions will be answered in new and surprising ways within our lifetime! ",

They transform so that they allow You to move only in circles around orbit of Black hole. If You do it with the speed of light then You go in circles, when slower then You continue falling into the Black hole. So one dimension is only a half dimension now. You can only fall faster slower or not. You cannot go out. If the Universe is higher dimensional and particles don't take one point but instead are ribbons (when You look at 4 dimension as if fine was like other 3 of then) then in some places there are more ribbons and it made a gravitational effect similar to a Black hole. In this region is where we are. Our senses let us record what was before because that is where we've been. Current moment is not existing, it is just Anna inavitable result of gravity moving You from past moment-position to current. On the other hand from future You have no way to return so You can't have went picked and returned to now with observation. But it is there waiting for You. Tl;dr; Universe may be for ever with all dimension equal but we live in a Black hole that allows one of the dimmension to only travel into direction of center providing an illusion of time - one way dimension ",

Some scientists have speculated there is a multiverse, that consists of an infinite number of universes, of which ours is just one.

(There actually may be ways of testing the hypothesis that our Universe was intentionally designed, but your question does not ask about this.) So, just because there are no scientific answers yet doesn't mean there will never be one, although that is a possibility.  It's interesting that if we do find an answer, this would leave us with more questions. Suppose we are one among many or an infinite number of universes in a multiverse. What caused the multiverse? Suppose a being such as God created out Universe. How did God come about? Most who think this consider God to be an uncaused being. What does that really mean?

I love the idea that in the beginning there was one very giant sun that exploded to create everything, rather than something from nothing. To an Ant we are Gods, We are there before they are born, there for their entire life and still there after they have died. Our understanding of forever is anything greater than 100 years. our life span. Things like Carbon Dating has been proven inaccurate and that the world could be far younger than first thought. They think the universe started 13 billion years ago, yet we can see stars 40 billion light years away. even if they have been expanding, just being able to see them means light has travelled for 40 billion years. The big bang is just a theory, and maybe it is what we see today, and like how galaxies swirl and move, maybe our universe is a swirling mass of galaxies. And the expanding is just them swirling. So if time is forever, and always has been and always will be. we have a haemorrhage, because we are used to things being born, living and then ending. So to justify this concept they developed the big bang theory. But if there was a beginning, what was before that, if God created it all, what was before God, do Gods die, if they do where do they go. If when we die we go to heaven to be with God, and if they Die \u2026 Wish I could answer your question. ",

However I don't know what does that actually mean (I guess no one does), or why should there be some meaning to it. It is also strange that why did it take some time before the conditions were right for this kind and level of interaction to be possible (like this quora interaction becomes possible only after ~ 10^60 planck time post big bang) -- perhaps suggesting that whatever mechanism creates universes it itself constrained in some ways. Also we ourselves are parts of the universe - discussing all this (interacting in such subtle ways)--- so whatever the big-bang is, it leads to us -- i.e- the evolution of the universe led to a small part of it (us) becoming capable of scientific self-inquiry (or whatever it could be called). There can be many such big bangs leading to many possible universes, some of those would evolve to this stage (like ours) where such interactions (like this one)  become possible.

The Big Bang is still the source of many questions. There are many guesses of how long ago it occurred. Scientists have varying estimates based on tracking motions of bodies throughout the the cosmos. If you want to twist your mind - in the time before the Big Bang, all matter is compressed into a single, solid mass. There is no motion of any kind, at the sub atomuc level through the singularity. No light, no sound, no detectable evidence of existence is present. In every way it does not exist. Some think that the singularity was struck by a God particle to start the Big Bang. Some believe it is a brief state that recurs with the universe expanding and, reaching a limit, contracting. So, the Big Bang is Time Zero, preceded only by eternity. Or perhaps our Big Bang was TimeZero version n, and n is an infinite number. ",

Prior to Big Bang, Universe existed as information construct in a space-less time-less zone. It is similar to the situation of a 3-D movie or Program stored on some kind of hard disk. Unless this hard disk is not connected to a system with a processor and time clock, it is not possible to see the movie or interact with the Program. Time starts(i.e. clicking of the system clock) when the system is turned on. For further insight into nature of time, clock frequency, speed of light please refer to my following answer and it's included links: Tufail Abbas's answer to What is time? How is time affected by gravity? ",

Then who created the grand. A bang cannot explode and form space. Cause where was the bang before that in another space, then where did that one come from so on and so on. The bang theory is one that should not be considered but only used as an example for alternate training of thought. Another is that space is expanding, how can you determine that when you cannot reach any end of space, by equation PLEASE. You need points of reference. And if all we have is our solar system, OK I'll give you our galaxy that is just merely one point. Lastly why not consider its moving, like milkshake mixing. ",

            "answer_text": "When physics uses phrases such as \u201cif time didn\u2019t exist\u201d before the Big Bang, it is using those terms in a semi-specific way. The concept of time can mean on a human scale, absolute time (e.g., Cesium vibrations). Or relative time, namely sjubjective to a person. Since-time is relative, a simple thought-experiment can prove that in a different frame of reference that is, one resting person and another is travelling away from the form man, the clock for the static observer will actually move slower and the clock of the unmoving man. Now to return to your question. In a propositional fallacy, a conclusion drawn from one set of facts cannot be used to prove the result of another state of facts. Thus the premise (or proposition) of a set of circumstances cannot be used to prove another fact not sharing the same assumptions. Thus, since our mind can have no conception of a state of non-time, the phrase outside time is used. However, that is no reason to assume time does not exist in that frame of reference. (I am not going to deal with the \u201cabsence of time\u201d since it is impossible to conceive or understand and is logical impossibility.) ",

Some scientists believe it was a fluctuation in a quantum field which caused the Big Bang, but a fluctuation can only fluctuate if it has changed from a previous state which would require time. We are very far off a theory of everything, but it is not the case that we know there was no time before the Big Bang, we just know there was definatly time after it. ",

Some believe  all the matter in the every where that we see is the  of many such contraction and expansions.we have found black holes that suck all matter up so it is quite possible that these holes have existed as long as the whole of everything,  sucking every thing up to spit to out at some other point in time to start the progression all over again. all we are able to do now it to observe how other galaxies work  and go hum.

After the Big Bang started the movement, began to count the time and began the process of evolutionary integration. Ceballos-Dosamantes (1897) says that: all the Cosmic Material is comprised in the following three fundamental states: 1 \u00b0 Neutral or primitive state. Big Bang 2\u00b0 Tangible state or transition. 3 \u00b0 Electrical or transcendental state. In the neutral or primitive state, the root elements of the two antithetical poles of Matter are neutralized (quasi equilibrium); There, in that infinite source of primes, are the atomic series corresponding to future evolutionary stages .........

I obviously have my own idea on the subject and think it's rational one in contrast to the aforesaid BB. I could call it Big Birth. :) BTW, what happened (by accident) some 14 billion years ago, was not creation of the universe, but change in its structure and not from the squeeze, but from the looseness. Namely, origin of matter from ether (in other words pre-matter). Ether =/= Matter. The latter is the complex form of the first (fundamental building block of all forms of matter). 2. Time is a synonym (among others) of motion / change. They are abstract notions if not referred to an object. Autonomously don't exist. Thus, time (e,g. 5 seconds, 13 weeks, 40 years, or mathematical formula, s/t) cannot have any impact on anything, because time depends on speed of something and/or distance to be beaten by something.

Time is just an instrument to measure the interval between two events,Personally i don't believe \"time\" exists as an entity or a force or whatever.its just a theoretical scale we produced to understand and define the events happening around us. Now Before big bang,there was NO EVENTS.Time was stagnant..then the first minuscule process of the big bang STARTED..Voila.. we got an EVENT..so time starts in exactly that moment. Now,in accordance with your question,if the singularity,the initial ultra dense mass which produced the whole universe, existed here in our known realms of universe,it could've started any\"time\"..means something should've \"put\" it there..it just cant came into being by itself waited and then decided for big bang..i would like to believe that the singularity,..emerged from another dimension to ours and then big bang happened.that emergence is the \"absolute zero\" of time as we know it.from that moment events started as a chain reaction and so time became to existence.

            "answer_text": "A2A: How can someone say that time started at The Big Bang? If time didn't exist before it was created, how could the transition from the 'moment' in which it didn't exist, to the moment in which it started existing happen? That\u2019s the problem with trying to sneak in your conclusions disguised as a premise. Upon close examination, you always run into fundamental logical flaws. In order for the universe - an time - to be created, there would have to be a creator that existed before there was time. Clearly that is absurd, so the next step is to pile a Special Pleading fallacy on top of your original Petitio Principii, and invoke a \u201csupernatural\u201d uncaused cause - without ever bothering to explain why, if your hypothesized creator can be uncaused, the universe itself cannot be uncaused. The simple and obvious answer is that it wasn\u2019t created at all, and that big bang cosmology doesn\u2019t assert that anything was created out of nothing. Long, long ago, the universe was so dense, and so hot, that even light could not exist. As it expanded, it cooled and thinned out enough so that dimensions, of which time is one, developed. That does not say, or imply, that it \u201csprang into existence from nothing\u201d, nor even suggest that such a thing as \u201cnothing\u201d ever existed. Those are creationist assumptions and until you shuck them off every attempt you make at understanding modern cosmology (among other branches of science) will be beset with contradictions. But here\u2019s the thing\u2026 modern cosmology doesn\u2019t contradict the evidence. It only contradicts the assumptions about supernatural agency people keep trying to tack onto it. And when there is a conflict between the evidence and your assumptions, it is not the evidence that needs to be discarded. ",

Releasing the pressure causes solidification in mass of overcooled liquid. This pressure release is due to the black holes where the pressure is lower than in surrounding places. ",

I push the power button and boom, big bang happens and my computer starts to boot. Lots of programs comes to life and they consume resources and evolve their own form and features. When my job is done, I will shutdown the computer and that's the Big Crunch.  Now here is the big catch, 'I don't wan't (for my own best interest) these programs to know that they are working for me'.

The modern Big Bang Theory is not a theory of the creation of our universe but the rapid inflation of, at least, a portion of the universe that includes our visible universe.  we aren't even sure what caused the inflation to kick off.  The initial condition of the big bang requires a positive, non zero volume, space in near perfect thermal equilibrium. This kind of implies that that region had been around long enough to reach thermal equilibrium. What created that initial condition is another question and there are hypothesises about them but currently they are impossible to test. All that said we really don't think there is a problem at T0 with regard to \"before\".  It is more that we can't currently say what happened.  Even if time did come into existence at T0 causality isn't a problem because we are at a realm where causality within our universe is not applicable anyway. ",

Kabbalists tell us that this universe was created for us. When the Bible says that God created man in his image, it is talking about a spark of this force. This force permeates everything and our role is to rise up to it's level consciously.  Mankind's next evolutionary step is to attain spirituality.  ",

(except God who\u2019s given a pass insofar as where he came from). But to think that matter/energy was always here would of course suggest infinite time. The human brain doesn\u2019t do so well thinking about \u201cinfinite\u201d anything (except that whole God thing perhaps). But if matter and energy didn\u2019t \u201ccome into existence\u201d because it was always here it would also suggest that there would not have been a single Big Bang but an infinite number. It would make no sense (there I go being human again) to think that after an infinite period of time matter/energy would suddenly explode this one time only. But of course if there is infinite matter/energy it would suggest that there was a \u201cbefore\u201d and there will be an after. ",

The Big Bang theory came about as an explanation for why the Cosmic microwave background measured on earth is the same in all directions. (Actually it isn\u2019t exactly constant as Robert Frost points out). The red shift of light from stars proves that the universe is expanding, so logically there should be more intense cosmic microwave background radiation from the zone which is the center of the universe. However, when the microwave background radiation was measured to be the same in all directions the only logical explanation was that the universe originated from a single point (or singularity) because the origins of the earth (and everything else) would have been inside that point so the big bang was in all directions. Inevitably as we learn more about physics, our models of the universe become more accurate. ",

            "answer_text": "It is my belief that our and every universe comes into being from absolute nothingness (my pleroma), despite being eternal and infinite, devoid of everything including dimensions such as time. The pleroma can be depicted as zero but since nature abhors zero as it abhors a vacuum, it becomes manifest as an entity (quantum fluctuation?) with plus & minus value. This is in accord with the Biblical account, 'In the beginning God (nature) created the heavens and earth'; a clear reference to a DUAL universe. As this event inflates, more time and space is created including coalescence with other universes all sharing the same laws of nature. So to answer your question, nothing really happened. Nothingness remained nothingness only it became a matching plus and minus and we exist in one of these entities. With the idea of dark matter/ energy I believe that we are beginning to get to grips with what makes up our so far unknowable sister universe. Too far fetched? Maybe, but remember that all of science and reasoning relies on the integrity of the number one and if I were to ask you what is the square root of one? You will know there are TWO correct answers, plus & minus one, like our universe. In our part of the universe if you have a camel and get another you will have two camels, but does this sum work in our sister universe? ",

            "answer_text": "One possibility is that in the quantum realm, objects can just appear out of nowhere, stay around for some time, and then disappear I think. According to loop quantum gravity, there might have been a previous universe which contracted to a very small size, and then started expanding. We know for sure that the universe was once very small and hot. This we know because of the cosmic microwave background radiation. There is also nothing which is uniform time. More gravity would slow down time. If we go very fast, time for us would slow down. So the concept of time itself is quite complex. ",

            "answer_text": "Good night everyone! Hi. My opinion: [1] If not for the possibility of quantum probabilistic physics creating several multiverses, and among them, by probability, there will be at least one, ours. FAQ # 1 = Could a black hole and a white hole (Einstein-Rosen bridges) have triggered the bing bang? My opinion: [1] I mean the black hole as responsible for keeping the seeds (matter) between the connected multiverses and the white hole for spreading the seeds, through the big bang. [1] An exit to the origin of this universe would be that this universe is connected to a larger, closed, cyclical universe (different from Penrose), older and spatially infinite. And when the first of a series of other multiverses comes to an end what happens is what we see in the Hubble parameter: a difference in the rate of expansion, an increase, due to the energy generated by the end of a multiverse. Thanks! cya \u270c\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4d Best regards, Cleiton da Costa \ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7 Brasil \u2013 RJ P.S.: my english is a work in progress, I accept corrections for a better understanding! Reference [1] Costa, C., (in progress). WOULD THE BIG BANG BE A CAUSE OF THE CONTINUOUS EXTENSION OF THE LIMIT OF A SPACE SURFACE OF ANOTHER UNIVERSE THROUGH A WHITE HOLE? ORCID orcid.orgCleiton Da Costa Cleiton Da Costa (0000-0003-4848-2478). E-mail: yamabushicleiton@gmail.com Dedicated to the memory of Fred Hoyle This article presents a scenario configured for what would have triggered the big bang. The inspiration came from renowned British astronomer Fred Hoyle. Until his death, he never accepted the idea of the big bang, even with the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation (Penzias & Wilson 1965), the oldest in the universe, present throughout the cosmos and practically the same in any direction, suggesting that at some point that distance had been much closer, in a hot and dense point until it suffered cosmic inflation. But his conviction that the universe has always existed, will exist and will continue to exist, an eternal universe, served as an expiration for this research, with the configuration of a scenario it was possible to put its persistence in a logical and linear model. RESUME In this article I will give an outlet to one of the greatest mysteries of astrophysics: what was there before the big bang? (Penrose et al. 2018) Apparent evidence for Hawking points in the CMB Sky, reported remnants of a universe prior to ours, were identified in cosmic microwave background radiation, through certain patterns that seem swirling, called Hawking. The Stationary state, (Hoyle et al. 1948) x inflationary state, Georges Lama\u00eetre (1927 and 1931), this defended an expanding universe, that a stationary, homogeneous, isotropic and spatially infinite universe. Alan Guth (1981) cosmic inflation, hyperinflation greater than the speed of light. Albert Einstein (1917), proposed his model of universe, based on his theory of general relativity, being homogeneous, isotropic and static. Stephen Hawking, BBC Brasil report (2015) \u201cIf you fall into a black hole, don't surrender\u201d, at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden; \"There is a way out\". Multiverse, Erwin Shor\u00f6dinger (1952), in a lecture in Dublin, the first known reference to the multiverse. One of Karl Schwarzschild's solutions, White holes, also foreseen in the theory of relativity. The big crunch, one of the theories for the end of the universe. If there was a way to combine all this knowledge, among others possible, in a single model of pre big bang, evolution of a universe previous to ours, where they all fit together to explain what was there before the big bang, however, not individually, in order to configure a scenario in which it may be possible to explain this questioning. I explore the possibility that all of these studies can complement each other to form a timeline. Research and observations over the next decades, for a more complete model, through technological advances for the collection of more data is necessary, as well as the use of synthetic scientific computer simulation methods, with algorithms and techniques, to measure, refine , define and reproduce this scenario.

It does not imply the creation of anything. The space and time that came into existence at that moment are the space and time we are living on. Since there is no physical way of finding out what happened before the Big Bang it has to be cut out of the Theory. At this moment there is no way for us to see beyond that point. Furthermore we can not even see the moment of the Big Bang because at that moment the density of the universe did not allow any information to travel out and therefore it is lost for the record. But here is another question that I find more interesting. Let\u00b4s say that the Big Bang was only one of many expansions and contractions of all the things there are in the universe. Then, where did all those things come from? ",

We are just one of the results of this calculation after it has been calculated to a point equating to about 14 Billion years. (N.B. Time does not really exist but is one of the rules of the calculation). There is no difference from our point of view to living in a REAL PHYSICAL UNIVERSE and to living in the mathematical concept of a universe, We can not tell the difference. The Big Bang is just the start of the calculation, so time starts at this point (but is local to this universe). Other universe definitions have their own time and rules. There are an infinite of universes. To understand this better read up on fractals which are very similar and can give very interesting results when performed on a computer. ",

In fact, the first two statements, while making no logical sense, do indeed hint of phenomena that show time itself to be no more than a creative construct. Time and space are in a fashion part of the furniture of the universe. The very experience of passing moments belongs to our psychological rooms in the same way that clocks are attached to your walls. Whenever science or religion seeks the origin of the universe, they search for it in the past. The universe is being created now. Creation occurs in each moment, in our terms. The illusion of time itself is being created now. It is therefore somewhat futile to look for the origins of the universe by using a time scheme that is in itself, at the very least, highly relative. Our now, or present moment, is a psychological platform. ",

If i reduce this frame/distance to zero then time becomes uneventful. It doesn\u2019t mean time doesn\u2019t exist but is in a sense meaningless as there is no space for entropic relations to evolve. Real time needs to be framed so it may have any quantifiable meaning. The big bang does just that; it creates the necessary distance between entities so that events can happen. Cheers! ",

The constant its self still exists though as the future for the big bang action and once energy has finish with an action in the moment that time and space that the action took place in goes back to being the constant again as the past for the present on going energy action. Information though from the past still exists in the constant. So time space and energy still exist in the constant from the past reaching the present action from the constant. ",

For the greater universe time is not measured in Earth days or revolutions around some object. That is all us. The universe also doesn't care at what speed it is expanding or whether we live or die, that's all us. In fact, one could argue that time is individual and starts when you are born, or more accurately, self-aware. In space, humans use time to discover. Look back through the universe and determine how many Earth years the universe is old. An Earth year is a unit we can understand, but when that unit becomes so large you need another unit. Just like meters and kilometers or yards and miles. So this gives us light years. Again a human construct to help humans visualize and understand the vast distances. Time becomes very important in the mathematics of things and has been shown that it can be affected by traveling at a high rate of speed. But in many ways that is where it stops. Before something is \"born\" does time really exist? To us, yes, but to the universe, perhaps not. ",

The most popular theory is that the Big-Bang was generated by the collapse of a low entropy, perfectly homogeneous gas cloud of very high density (a lot of mass gathered in very little volume). It is not certain what triggered the collapse, but such an event at such a great density resulted in the increase of the entropy, resulting in a high-rate expansion of the gas matter (inflation) and then, long story short, as a result of gravity pulling the matter together, stars and planets formed.

I think of time as a string of regular events that we create or compare other events with (the ticking of a clock, the rotation of the earth, the vibration of a cesium atom, etc). In that light (a pun), the Big Bang as we imagine it today wasn't a single event in a blank slate of a universe, but the result of a sequence of events leading up to a concentration of energy(something we can describe in terms of how it affects matter, but not what it 'is') and then an explosion/expansion (rapid unexpected disassembly of we know not 'what').Everything since then has been sequential, and I suspect that everything before that was sequential. Eventually, all paradoxes turn out to be measurement problems. ",

With the absence of time that which existed before time must have been in an unchanging state. With the addition of time that which existed could begin to change in a sequence of events. If it where pure energy then that energy could begin to form matter by letting go of a quantity of energy in exchange for a quantity of mass or vice versa. Mass and energy are likely to be in equal parts and some energy could be given up and an exchange could have happened some energy for mass some mass for energy but maintaining the balance of energy and mass. The story of how we have got to where we are is I expect more complicated than that but it is all a sequence of a chain of causal events that continues to this day. ",

There is an Atheistic overtone on the way we do science today and in an effort to show this universe in reductionist\u2019s terms made a lot of nonsense so many things. For example the expansion of Universe, before the Big Bang, emergence of life, consciousness etc. The Big Bang singularity is the beginning of expansion and our ever changing present is the limit of that expansion thus clearly signifying boundary for this universe. Therefore anything that is bound on either side must have a before and after and that before and after cannot exist outside time, or could it? Saying time is created at the Big Bang may be true but definitely there must be another time existing before that singularity that created our time. A bounded and finite universe, like our own must also ends, with it its time thus another time must also exist outside that universe that ends. What about the possibilities of a multi verse, would not they be existing on a different time than our own universe? If multi verse exist then we have to change the way we view time as a dimension.

Without movement of something there can be no time even if that movement solely consists of parts of an atom moving. Before the Big Bang no thing existed. Therefore time started with the creation of things that move. ",

For me personally its not about any type of denomination or belief system but just deciding to trust the one true God that i believe created all that there is.

Some last longer times, such as our own. The physics of a short-lived universe would be such that it could not hold matter together. A long-lived universe has physics that is \u201cfine-tuned\u201d to bring about a universe like ours. All universes, however, are created from nothing (an empty quantum field with virtual energy).
