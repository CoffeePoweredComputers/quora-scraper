            "answer_text": "No. Knowledge is among those things that represent \u2018true wealth' that cannot be stolen. In fact, that is the way we can determine 'true wealth' from false or transient ones. All the things that represent true wealth actually rather than diminishing, increase by sharing. More we share them more they grow. More we share our knowledge with others by teaching them, more our own knowledge grows. Apart from knowledge, there are quite a few other things representing 'true wealth' that grow by sharing, and hence cannot be stolen. For example, love, friendship, courage and kindness. No matter how much we shower these things on others, they never diminish in us. In fact, they increase, in turn increasing our capacity to share more and more. Every one is welcome to steal these qualities from us. More they steal more they grow in them as well as in us!! This phenomenon is such a wonderful part of the magic of life. ",
