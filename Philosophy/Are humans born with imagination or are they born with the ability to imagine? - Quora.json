            "answer_text": "Everything IMO, is imagined. So we should be thankful we all seem to be born with it. We like to think that what we consider real is actually real. IMO, it is not. It is imagined but so well imagined by so many of us, we can actually bet on it (trust it) as if it was real. It\u2019s actually a near perfectly orchestrated illusion, IMO. But skipping the drama (and truth) of what I just said, we all need to treat it as if it was/is real (even though it isn\u2019t). We\u2019ve all (at conception) parachuted into a surreal dream world called \u201cthis material reality\u201d. We get to modify the dream world we are in through our intentions, beliefs and our will to observe, think and take action. So all the world is a version of our imagination interacting with the imaginations of others. This is why we can imagine something and believe in it and with enough \u201cwill\u201d we can begin to see and create it into a new reality for us and eventually for others to see, as well. There are \u201crules of the material game\u201d much like a stage play, props, back drops and some laws of physics (cause and effect, thermodynamics, physics of motion, chemistry, electromagnetism, gravity, etc.). But we can effect our portion of the play itself with our imagination if we will it correctly. Most often that doesn\u2019t mean \u201cpoof magic\u201d so we need to follow a path and take the effort, side step or overcome the obstacles to achieve the result but it is imagination driven for sure. For sure, there are adults who pass on their lack of imagination to children and even discipline imagination out of them. Others groom and promote imagination in children. But imagination is what this \u201csupposedly real\u201d material world is really all about, IMO. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "Imagination is the thought process of forming new ideas, being resourceful. It is the bridging of understanding and growth with new things, ideas and environments. Having an imagination is the same as being able to imagine, don\u2019t you think? The difference is to understand the distinction of whether you can create from your imagination and whether the process serves to expand your mind rather than create confusion. ",
