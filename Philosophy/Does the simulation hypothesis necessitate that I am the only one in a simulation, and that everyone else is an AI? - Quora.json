            "answer_text": "If this were to be a simulation, the most likely versions would have all the characters running under AI\u2026 including you and me. The only versions that might have a non AI character, would not be strictly simulations\u2026 they would be games. A game player (from outside the simulation) would most likely be a God, or an outstanding character like Jesus or Hitler etc. A hero or villain. Or someone with an unusual skill set. So sorry\u2026 if this is a simulation\u2026 Then you are an AI.(realizing of course, that none of the game characters ever know that they are driven by AI) EDIT: in relation to your simulated character paired to a real person scenario\u2026 This would be an unlikely simulation version. Since its only value would be to find out what \u2018Fred\u2019 might do in a certain situation. It is extremely unlikely that an entire universe (or world), would be simulated to determine the outcome of one particular person. A simulation of this scale, if looking for anything, is looking for a trend, or likelihood of something happening\u2026 or perhaps to see if something is achievable. For example, to see if we as a species can survive, or whether we destroy ourselves. Or maybe\u2026 two or more species are put into action, to see if they ever meet, or to see which would dominate\u2026 Who knows\u2026 the options are endless. But as I said before\u2026If this is simulated, and the odds are high, then we are not paired, and you are AI. Just like me. ",

You are an AI whose experience and consciousness are fully simulated, the rest of us are less sophisticated software agents designed to appear adequately convincing to you. ",

Otherwise it would be just data stored somewhere and would not need to be rendered. So there is likely at least one or more outside viewer for every simulation. Everyone else is a NPC and just part of the simulation. ",
