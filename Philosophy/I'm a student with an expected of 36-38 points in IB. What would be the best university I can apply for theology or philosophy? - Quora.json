But this one speaker really hit hard, because everybody always talked about Ivy League University\u2019s, or \u2018popular\u2019 ones because of TV shows, etc. She simply just said, look for a uni that suits your needs, does the campus inspire you? Do you like the facilities offered there? Do you like the way they teach/expectations. Rather look for a school that will make you want to study, not for one where you feel like you have to be perfect. Because that\u2019s how most kids drop out. (Just my opinion! I thought what she said made a lot of kids second guess their choice) ",
