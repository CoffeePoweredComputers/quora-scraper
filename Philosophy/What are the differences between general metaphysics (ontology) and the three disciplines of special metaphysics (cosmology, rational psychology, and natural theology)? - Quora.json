            "answer_text": "There are differences in the parameters and validity of these four disciplines but first it is important to recognize that metaphysics and religion are, essentially, cut from the same cloth. Metaphysics can be considered to be the religion of science because it does not have the actual rigor of science to back it up. Metaphysics and religion both attempt to present the biggest pictures to explain \u201cthat which is existence\u201d and the conclusions brought forth from either of these approaches cannot be empirically verified. The difference between them is that metaphysics creates a story (hypothesis) from facts derived by empiricism, logic, and the scientific method whereas religion accepts the accuracy of a story created from a source that is specified by the religion. Ontology uses empiricism and logic in an attempt to establish large scaled assessments of \u201cthat which is existence\u201d. Cosmology uses science and mathematics in an attempt to describe an overview of the natural order of the universe: past, present, and future. In both of these disciplines, some groupings of evidence can be empirically verified. Rational psychology and natural theology also contain groupings of evidence that can be empirically verified but these two disciplines are saddled with a significant deficit. They both attempt to establish assessments of \u201cthat which is existence\u201d by building criteria around concepts that have been inherited directly from religion. Rational psychology is a \u201cmetaphysical discipline that attempts to determine the nature of the human soul by a priori reasoning\u201d. This definition, taken from the internet, may be too simple or even incorrect but if the word \u201csoul\u201d is actually an integral part of this discipline then it is dead at the starting gate because this word is vague and undefinable. This term is a noun that is used in contexts that carry great cultural authority yet it represents something that cannot be empirically verified nor even well-articulated. It is a word that would have more use in poetry than in a philosophical approach. Natural theology \u201cis a type of theology that provides arguments for the existence of God based on reason and ordinary experience of nature\u201d. This discipline has the same problem as rational psychology. It attempts to rationally explain the existence and disposition of a concept that was bred by religion. It builds itself around a word that is being used to represent a \u201cspecial\u201d male deity. A word that is defined by its user or by parochial consensus. This is a word that represents something that is devoid of existence because, besides for male deity, there is no real common denominator for its definition except as a focal point that is being used to represent the concept of \u201cthat which is existence\u201d. So, in natural theology, the best you can do is provide overviewing arguments, based on reason and ordinary experience of nature, about \u201cthat which is existence\u201d. Unfortunately, the only actual definition for \u201cthat which is existence\u201d, besides expressing the fact that I exist, is \u201cthat which cannot be known\u201d because, after all, we are only apes circling one star out of many. I\u2019m a firm believer in advancing an argument that uses well defined terms. I understand that the terms used in verbal reasoning can\u2019t possess definitions that reach the clarity of those found in mathematics but there is a great distance between nouns like rock and air and those like soul and god (with a capital g). To me, as a novice, it seems that, at the surface, the differences between these four disciplines is that; ontology is a logical empirical approach that is used to create unprovable hypotheses about something of which we have no idea what kind of paradigms are involved; cosmology, because it is more measurable and it is restricted only to the study of the universe, may create a lesser amount of unprovable hypotheses; and rational psychology along with natural theology attempt to use empiricism and logic to establish the disposition of religiously founded terms.

            "answer_text": "Basically, different philosophers used different classifcations to talk about the same things. Christian Wolff is the one that defined your three special metaphysics and he said they were empirical because they were not revelational (in other words, based on evidence, not divine intervention). Christian Wolff (philosopher) - Wikipedia But, metaphysics in general is the branch of philosophy that examines the fundamental nature of reality, including the relationship between mind and matter, substance and attribute, potentiality and actuality. Thus, general metaphysics contains special metaphysics within it. But, we only talk about metaphysics today with respect to history. Today, we talk about the particular area of the sciences. For example, mind is physiology, biochemistry and psychology, while matter is physics and chemistry. Substance and attribute are not the terms we use today. Potentiality and actuality are similar. And, they are subsumed under other areas of the sciences. ",
