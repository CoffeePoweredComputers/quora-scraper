            "answer_text": "Why would you want to ask questions? Let me tell you\u2026 To demystify the unknown, and therefore, opening up an ocean of possibilities\u2026 This was nicely outlined in this TedX talk by Mike Vaughan. Great leaders know how to ask questions that inspire creativity, fuel passion, and most importantly, spur people into action. Without any customer, you don\u2019t have any business. But worse, it costs 5 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain existing ones. Fair to say that we are better off understanding our existing customers and retaining them, right? Which means that we have to be good at asking questions.  At Feedier, we had the chance to partner and host a webinar with Alan Klement, an author, business owner, and coach. Alan is a specialist of the Job-To-Be-Done Framework, author of the great book \u201cWhen Coffee and Kale Compete\u201d. In this answer here, I highlight the main topics discussed in the webinar, and I give you additional information. Without further ado, let\u2019s get into the nitty-gritty and nail down the different steps to growth through customer understanding. Why Is It Important To Understand The Customer? Why is the consumer, or customer behavior to a business? The purpose of any business is growth \u2014 even a non-profit company wants to grow, right? \u201cGrowth means they still want consumers of that product or service. So even if it is trying to start fighting Ebola in Africa, we want to somehow persuade people in some of these areas to consume our vaccine or our change that we think will help improve them. \u201c Without getting people to actually consume what we are creating, then we don\u2019t have a business. Understanding the customer is therefore all about understanding its behavior, why it does things this way.  6 SaaS Survey Question To Get Inside Your Customer\u2019s Head If we understand how they behave and under what circumstances, then we can figure out how the customers will react to any product change. By truly understanding the customers, we are able to make him or here use more of our product and therefore be more satisfied with it, and continue to pay for it. One way of understanding the customer falls down to using surveys, which lead us to our second part\u2026 Why Do Surveys? Alan nicely quoted Edwards Deming in his presentation: Scientific data are not taken for museum purposes; they are taken as a basis for doing something. If nothing is to be done with the data, then there is no use in collecting any. The ultimate purpose of taking data is to provide a basis for action or a recommendation for action. The step intermediate between the collection of data and the action is prediction. This essentially reminds us that there is no point in collecting data if you don\u2019t know what you are going to do with it, what questions you want to answer. The aim is to get accurate data, and it requires having an intent behind it. This is the cornerstone of every survey, and help you ask the right questions supporting your goal. As an additional note, in her podcast episode in the Growth Hub Podcast, Claire Suellentrop from Userlist.io doubles down on the fact that surveys and interviews are meant to understand the \u201cwhy\u201d of your customer, what is their Job To Be Done, their intrinsic motivation to switching to your product.  Ultimate Customer Feedback Guide On a final note, Alan pointed out that One-on-one interviews with consumers is a great way to start sourcing good questions, the right way. However, once you feel like you have a good idea of what questions to put in front of people, then automating it through a survey is much cheaper and easier. You can scale in a way that one-on-one interviews cannot. In a nutshell, there is no good survey without the proper definition of the goals and premise of it beforehand. The Must-Haves Of Any Good Question Inspired by this TedX talk given by Dan Moulthrop, we have outlined different aspects that will help you craft the right questions. Develop Empathy First and foremost, you have to develop empathy. The person responding to your questions hasn\u2019t been through the same experience as you, hasn\u2019t experienced the same things as you, and you can\u2019t assume he or she will be able to understand your question. You have to really strive for empathy, and try to put yourself in this person\u2019s shoes. Focus On The Words Words matter, make sure to get your point right across and avoid sleazy or fuzzy words. Be Informed About Your Surveyed Person You likely have a lot of data, you likely have already run surveys before, and you need to use this data properly. Make sure to not ask any information about something you already know, or you have already asked before. Ask Simple Questions You don\u2019t want to ask questions containing technical or unclear jargon that will be completely bewildering to the end person. You want to ask questions that are easily understandable and make sense. What Makes a Survey Question Bad? A bad question is either inaccurate, nonrelevant, hard to answer or very subjective. Which leads Alan to give the example of the Net Promoter Score question. Arguing and explaining why he does not recommend using it. First off, you\u2019re asking someone to self-assess themselves, right? That\u2019s an even worse than that. You\u2019re asking them to self-assess the probability of something in the future. \u201cHow likely are you to do some action in the future?\u201d You\u2019re asking the person to one, being able, to be honest with themselves and to self-assess themselves correctly. The second point about NPS is that it\u2019s a numerical question, and numerical scales are subjective and interpretive. Which make it very different from one company to another, and doesn\u2019t make much sense to benchmark.  Measure the NPS Score with the promoters and detractors He then goes on over a few recommendations, such as having the respondent to rank the answers, which is an easy and very understandable question. You are also better off starting with easy questions and finish off with tougher questions. Such a tough question could be asking your respondent to report on constraints or goals. The point is to make the experience easy and smooth for the end user, but also relevant to what the customer is currently experiencing. Alternative To The NPS Question An alternative to the NPS would be to break that question into multiple ones. You could start off with: Have you ever recommended our company to someone you know? Yes/no/Can\u2019t remember. Then, if they say yes, you ask how many people they recommended. The next one could be: Are a lot of your clients tech savvy or a lot of your friends? Yes, no, not sure. And you can finally give him an open-ended question. Wrap Up There are a lot of things to consider before doing any survey, and writing down any question, and you must be aware of those common pitfalls. There are also common templates you can use, and adapt them to your needs. You can read more in our customer feedback guide. If you want to get deeper, there are also some good question templates in this article written by Scott Berkun. Watch the full webinar below.   ",

            "answer_text": "Life punishes the vague wish and rewards the specific ask. If you want confusion and heartache, ask vague questions. If you want uncommon clarity and results, ask uncommonly clear questions. This is true both in your own head (in other words: thinking) or when interacting with others. Fortunately, this is a skill you can develop. Milan Kundera, author of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, has said that \u201cThe stupidity of people comes from having an answer for everything. The wisdom of the novel comes from having a question for everything.\u201d Substitute \u201cmaster learner\u201d for \u201cnovel,\u201d and you have my philosophy of life. Often, all that stands between you and what you want is a better set of questions. Nobody can give you all of the answers, but let me demonstrate how you can train yourself to ask better questions, and we\u2019ll use a few examples. For my latest book, Tribe of Mentors, I asked 130+ world-class performers across domains the same set of 11 questions. The 11 questions I chose are listed below. Some of them might seem trite or useless at first glance...But lo! Things are not always what they appear. 1. What is the book (or books) you\u2019ve given most as a gift, and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life? 2. What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months (or in recent memory)? My readers love specifics like brand and model, where you found it, etc. 3. How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a \u201cfavorite failure\u201d of yours? 4. If you could have a gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it \u2014 metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions \u2014 what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph. (If helpful, it can be someone else\u2019s quote: Are there any quotes you think of often or live your life by?) 5. What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you\u2019ve ever made? (Could be an investment of money, time, energy, etc.) 6. What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love? 7. In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life? 8. What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the \u201creal world\u201d? What advice should they ignore? 9. What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise? 10. In the last five years, what have you become better at saying no to (distractions, invitations, etc.)? What new realizations and/or approaches helped? Any other tips? 11. When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused, or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do? (If helpful: What questions do you ask yourself?) OK, now, let\u2019s take a look at each, and I\u2019ll explain why they appear to work. You might ask, \u201cWhy should I care? I\u2019m not an interviewer.\u201d To that, my response is simple: If you want to build (or foster) a world-class network, you need to interact in a way that earns it. All of these points will help. For instance, I spent weeks testing the order of questions for optimal responses. To me, proper sequencing is the secret sauce, whether you\u2019re trying to learn a new language in 8 to 12 weeks, overcome a lifelong fear of swimming, or pick the brain of a potential mentor over coffee. Good questions in the wrong order get bad responses. Conversely, you can punch well above your weight class by thinking about sequencing, as most people don\u2019t. Example: the \u201cbillboard\u201d question is one of my podcast listener and guest favorites, but it\u2019s heavy. It stumps or intimidates a lot of people. I didn\u2019t want to scare busy people off, who might opt out with a quick, \u201cSorry, Tim. I just don\u2019t have bandwidth for this right now.\u201d So, what to do? Easy: let them warm up with lightweight questions (e.g., Most gifted books, purchase of <$100), which are less abstract and more concrete. My explanations get shorter toward the end, as many of the points carry over or apply to all questions. 1. What is the book (or books) you\u2019ve given most as a gift, and why? Or what are one to three books that have greatly influenced your life? \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite book?\u201d seems like a good question. So innocent, so simple. In practice, it\u2019s terrible. The people I interview have read hundreds or thousands of books, so it\u2019s a labor-intensive question for them, and they rightly worry about picking a \u201cfavorite,\u201d which then gets quoted and put in articles, Wikipedia, etc. \u201cMost gifted\u201d is lower risk, an easier search query (easier to recall), and implies benefits for a broader spectrum of people, which the idiosyncratic \u201cfavorite\u201d does not. 2. What purchase of $100 or less has most positively impacted your life in the last six months (or in recent memory)? My fans love specifics like brand and model, where you found it, etc. This might seem like a throwaway, but it isn\u2019t. It provides an easy entry point for busy interviewees while providing readers with something immediately actionable. The deeper questions elicit more profound answers, but profundity is the fiber of knowledge \u2014 it requires intensive digestion. To keep marching forward in the meanwhile, humans (yours truly included) need short-term rewards. I try to accomplish that with questions that provide tangible, easy, and often fun answers \u2014 Scooby snacks for your hard-working soul. To get the heavier lifting done, these breathers are important. 3. How has a failure, or apparent failure, set you up for later success? Do you have a \u201cfavorite failure\u201d of yours? This one is particularly important to me. To read why, check out some of my other answers on Quora about failure. 4. If you could have one gigantic billboard anywhere with anything on it \u2014 metaphorically speaking, getting a message out to millions or billions \u2014 what would it say and why? It could be a few words or a paragraph. (If helpful, it can be someone else\u2019s quote: Are there any quotes you think of often or live your life by?) Self-explanatory, so I\u2019ll skip the commentary. For would-be interviewers, though, the \u201cIf helpful...\u201d portion is often critical for getting good answers. 5. What is one of the best or most worthwhile investments you\u2019ve ever made? (Could be an investment of money, time, energy, etc.) This is also self-explanatory...or so it seems. With questions like this and the next, I\u2019ve found it productive to give interviewees a real-world answer. In a live interview, it buys them time to think, and in text, it gives them a template. For this question, for instance, I gave everyone the following: SAMPLE ANSWER from Amelia Boone, one of the world\u2019s top endurance athletes, sponsored by big brands and 4x world champion in obstacle course racing (OCR): \u201cIn 2011, I shelled out $450 to participate in the first World\u2019s Toughest Mudder, a brand new 24-hour obstacle race. Saddled with law school debt, it was a big expenditure for me, and I had no business thinking I could even complete the race, let alone compete in it. But I ended up being one of 11 finishers (out of 1,000 participants) of that race, and it altered the course of my life, leading to my career in obstacle racing and multiple world championships. Had I not plunked down the cash for that entry fee, none of that would have happened.\u201d 6. What is an unusual habit or an absurd thing that you love? I was first asked this when interviewed by my friend Chris Young, scientist, co-author of Modernist Cuisine, and CEO of ChefSteps (search \u201cJoule sous vide\u201d). Before responding, and while sitting onstage at the Town Hall in Seattle, I said, \u201cOooooh...that\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m going to steal that.\u201d And I did. This question has deeper implications than you might expect. Answers prove a number of helpful things: 1) Everyone is crazy, so you\u2019re not alone. 2) If you want more OCD-like behaviors, my interviewees are happy to help, and 3) Corollary to #1: \u201cnormal\u201d people are just crazy people you don\u2019t know well enough. If you think you\u2019re uniquely neurotic, I hate to deliver the news, but every human is Woody Allen in some part of life. 7. In the last five years, what new belief, behavior, or habit has most improved your life? This is short, effective, and not particularly nuanced. It has particular application to my midlife reassessment. I\u2019m surprised I don\u2019t hear questions like this more often. 8. What advice would you give to a smart, driven college student about to enter the \u201creal world\u201d? What advice should they ignore? The second \u201cignore\u201d sub-question is essential. We\u2019re prone to asking \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d but less prone to asking \u201cWhat shouldn\u2019t I do?\u201d Since what we don\u2019t do determines what we can do, I like asking about not-to-do lists. 9. What are bad recommendations you hear in your profession or area of expertise? A close cousin of the previous question. Many problems of \u201cfocusing\u201d are best solved by defining what to ignore. 10. In the last five years, what have you become better at saying no to (distractions, invitations, etc.)? What new realizations and/or approaches helped? Any other tips? Saying yes is easy. Saying no is hard. I wanted help with the latter, as did many people in the book, and some answers really delivered the goods. 11. When you feel overwhelmed or unfocused or have lost your focus temporarily, what do you do? (If helpful: What questions do you ask yourself?) If your mind is \u201cbeach balling\u201d (nerdy Mac reference to when a computer freezes), nothing else matters much until that is resolved. Once again, the secondary \u201cif helpful\u201d question is often critical. \u2014 That should help you get started. \u201cGet started?\u201d you ask? Yes, it\u2019s time to practice. Giving using these a shot, even with friends. And don\u2019t help them or let them off the hook too quickly! As master interviewer Cal Fussman once told me: Let the silence do the work. Good luck!
