            "answer_text": "\"To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people just exist.\" -Oscar Wilde  Truer words could not have been spoken. As people, we feel we are so busy tending to the various pop-ups that keep appearing in our lives, but or that we have not done anything significant in our life yet or.. Well, simply the thought of any of this can throw anyone into an existential crisis. Unfortunately, that's the truth though. Most of us aren't living our lives up to the fullest, while living is what we should be doing. Think of it like this: you have just one chance. How do you choose to utilize and capitalize on it? Travel: I cannot emphasize enough on the importance of traveling. Travel a lot, and to many different places. Go solo; see things for yourself. Immerse yourself in experiencing the various spectacular contours, phenomena, and aspects that nature has to offer all over the globe. Trust me, every mountain peak you stand on, every canyon's edge you look down into, and every forest you trek in is an exhilarating experience. Delve into learning and experiencing new cultures, traditions, and customs. Meet all kinds of people; participate in their events, make merry with them, and admire and respect their cultures that've been passed down over generations. Take lots of pictures. Trust me, every journey will be worthwhile. However, don't forget to take in everything with your own eyes too! Blend in with the environment. Eat different kinds of food; try anything and everything that's new in the place. Bring back lots of memorabilia. When you return home each time, you're going to have felt you've lived a little more.  Read: Read a lot. Anything that you can get your hands on. Delve deep into the world of imagination; explore and marvel at all the worlds, languages, people that have been concocted by the authors' imagination. When you read, you'll slowly become a part of the book. You'll see the book's events happening right in front of you; you'll be able to experience them firsthand. It's absolutely thrilling. Each book is a roller coaster ride. It's up to you whether you want to scream and cry, or enjoy the ride! Read books that'll help you expand your knowledge and help you improve as a person too. Don't leave any topic superficially learned; don't leave the subject until you've extracted every last bit of juice that it has to offer. While this will not only help you become smarter, and a better person, it will also have helped you gain different perspectives, and will help give you an idea on how to live better.  Follow your heart and your passions: All around us, we constantly come across people who say that all that their life comprises of is eating, sleeping, sitting at a desk 9-5 at work, coming back home, doing chores, etc. They're stuck in this viscious vortex, and it's preventing them from living to the fullest. They say they don't enjoy their job. Why? Maybe because they're job and their interests are worlds apart! I strongly believe that your job should be in a field you love; where you are constantly learning something new, and you're always kept on your toes. Introspect and find something that you love doing. Follow it with the determination and focus like a cheetah chases its prey. Master it. Own it. You'll find that it's exhilarating and it gives you a reason to say that your life worthwhile. Living is like a breath of fresh air. We don't realize we have it until we exit the cloud of toxic fumes chaining us. ",

            "answer_text": "It's all about the circumstances that you are in. And also about all the imaginary circumstances originating in your mind which doesn't have to do anything with the reality. Well, no one else can know why you feel like this. There can be many reason one can assume why you feel that you simply exist rather than living the life. The process to make sure you live a better life begins with a thought. The thought that you have to live a more productive life. Just start being happy about the life and routine that you already live. You can add a little bit of spice to your life. That depends solely upon you. Some may find the kick in taking break from their routine and going out for a holiday or some adventure trip or joining some social gatherings every now and then. Movie outings on weekends with friends/family. Movies can be enjoyed alone as well. If not much interested in visiting places, not a movie buff, somewhat introvert, etc. may be FOOD? Trying new dishes at new places? Or who knows you are already doing all these and fed up of these very things. And this is the primary cause of your concern. So better sort out a balance between work/career and the leisure part. Basically you need to convince your mind that this is the life you want to live. And once you accept the things the way they are, life becomes easy and sometimes amazing. More so you can keep yourself occupied by having some new hobbies. Reading a new novel, learning any musical instruments, joining sports club or may be playing games on PC/PlayStation/Mobiles. Joining gym, morning walks/joggings, etc. these also helps to make some new companions. One more thing, at times we begin to over-expect from ourselves, our career and our life. That causes disappointment. Expectations from oneself is good but in cases where our expectations remain unfulfilled shouldn't make us feel that our life isn't worth it. That we aren't living life rather we just exist! It's not about the problems that we face but it's all about how we deal with it. It's all in the mind. And human beings are endowed with the ability to manipulate their thoughts. And a change in thought also changes the life that you live. No fear about the future, no regrets about the past, just aware of the present. And a positive vibe. That's all you need! ",
