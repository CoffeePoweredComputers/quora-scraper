            "answer_text": "It makes the plot more smoothly that they don\u2019t have cameras. If the hallway did have cameras, Regina would be a bit of an idiot not to take that into account in the first place. Make no mistake, Regina didn\u2019t want to get caught, and cameras in the way meant that she would have thought of a different way to disseminate the papers; but the plot demanded one in which a locker room hallway fight ensued. Entertainment over reason, so such a cult classic might exist. ",
