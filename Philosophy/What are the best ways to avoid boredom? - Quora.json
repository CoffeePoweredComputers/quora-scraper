            "answer_text": "The best way to escape boredom is to keep our involvement in something interesting. This one should intrigue you to take further steps. Right now, I\u2019m spending my summer vacation. It\u2019s really a big gap for me again to go to my college. I think it\u2019s 67 days long holiday. And I\u2019m really doing nothing, but just keeps sleeping and eating and sleeping and eating and\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 For the first week, this was my daily routine: Wake up and take a cold bathGet some newspaper and read it completelyTake breakfast and get some sleepWake up. Take lunch and fall asleepWake up. Read some fiction. Take the dinner and then sleep\u2026\u2026.I\u2019m really tired of this and started to get bored. I still remember how I spent my last year vacation. I was so super positive and I learned a lot, had a good health routine and I was good at socialising. But this time, I\u2019m really really really wasting my time. So, this is what I\u2019m going to do in my vacation this year: Doing some body movements: Really, those days I was so positive and active in everything. Yes, I had my daily exercise and it was not that exhausting your energy completely out. But it was a mild workout like push-ups, sit-ups, crunches & pull-ups. I do each one 50 times except pull-ups which I do it 20 times. My body gets full charged once I get myself completed my work-outs. Research says that doing exercises increases the human-life longevity, helps to take clear decisions and keeps your mindset pure positive.This one should be my top-of-my-list: One should do this to get the full benefit for the entire day, as it decides your day. Many fail to do this thing and makes their full day goes wasted sometimes. This one routine makes the most of your mindset for the day. Wanna know it? It\u2019s waking up at 5 AM in the morning and taking a cold bath. Last year, after my even semester, I struggled to keep myself positive and there was this inner voice or trance which keeps saying something negative about me. I once read Shiv khera\u2019s You too can win! It reminded me that how waking up early can influence your mindset and actions we take.Drink water: Why I am saying this is, is that we get too much dehydrated while we get bored! So, it\u2019s good to keep ourselves hydrated and healthy all the time.Solving some puzzles: It\u2019s my great way to avoid boredom. Wow! It sometimes keeps me occupied when I get depressed. It\u2019s a super medicine for depression and boredom. Sometimes, I do coding in codechef.com.Calling someone: It\u2019s a very good time to call that someone whom you want to call and talk to them. That\u2019s okay, if you can\u2019t make that call.Read books: Haven\u2019t a single book yet? It can be a very good time to construct that habit. A single book can change your life upside down. Start with Radical Acceptance by Tara Barch. It will help you to see the life the way the real you can see.Wanna learn something?: Learn it that time.Talk to your parents: Come on, their love towards you can\u2019t be compared with anything. So, go on and make that call.Help someoneJournal: This time can be spent by studying about you. Start writing the journal. Write the positives about you and be grateful about it. Write the negatives about you and think how you can overcome those negatives.I hope it helps! :) Happy reading _/\\_ ",

            "answer_text": "Boring people get bored. You are the problem, not the situation. The good news is that being boring is fixable. Think hard about the art and the artists who changed the world, the people and the stuff they create that will be enjoyed, written about, talked about, and taught in university classrooms. Learn about those artists & consume their art. Do so everyday. If you do what I\u2019m telling you, you will not be boring; therefore, you won\u2019t get bored. Here are a few examples: Artists (film) Humphrey Bogart, Woody Allen, Marlon Brando, Tennessee Williams (Pictorial Art) Picasso, Chagall, Matisse, Dali (Poetry) Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Matthew Arnold, Tennyson, Browning, Yeats, T.S. Eliot, Thomas Hardy, Frost, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman (Fiction) Mary Shelley, George Orwell, F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Irving, Jack Kerouac, John Kennedy Toole, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson (Music) Gershwin, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, The Rolling Stones, Buddy Holly, The Ramones, Hank Williams, Consume and think about the art these (and many other) artists created and boredom will cease being a problem.
