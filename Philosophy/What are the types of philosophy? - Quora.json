Socrates was a very influential philosopher, who insisted that he possessed no wisdom but was a pursuer of wisdom. [36] Western philosophy can be divided into three eras: Ancient (Greco-Roman), Medieval philosophy (Christian European), and Modern philosophy. The Ancient era was dominated by Greek philosophical schools which arose out of the various pupils of Socrates, such as Plato, who founded the Platonic Academy and his student Aristotle, [37] founding the Peripatetic school, who were both extremely influential in Western tradition. Other traditions include Cynicism, Stoicism, Greek Skepticism and Epicureanism. Important topics covered by the Greeks included metaphysics (with competing theories such as atomism and monism), cosmology, the nature of the well-lived life (eudaimonia), the possibility of knowledge and the nature of reason (logos). With the rise of the Roman empire, Greek philosophy was also increasingly discussed in Latin by Romans such as Cicero and Seneca. Medieval philosophy (5th\u201316th centuries) is the period following the fall of the Western Roman Empire and was dominated by the rise of Christianity and hence reflects Judeo-Christiantheological concerns as well as retaining a continuity with Greco-Roman thought. Problems such as the existence and nature of God, the nature of faith and reason, metaphysics, the problem of evil were discussed in this period. Some key Medieval thinkers include St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Boethius, Anselm and Roger Bacon. Philosophy for these thinkers was viewed as an aid to Theology (ancilla theologiae) and hence they sought to align their philosophy with their interpretation of sacred scripture. This period saw the development of Scholasticism, a text critical method developed in medieval universities based on close reading and disputation on key texts. The Renaissance period saw increasing focus on classic Greco-Roman thought and on a robust Humanism. Early modern philosophy in the Western world begins with thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596\u20131650). [38] Following the rise of natural science, Modern philosophy was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the Church. Major modern philosophers include Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. [39] [40] [41] 19th-century philosophy is influenced by the wider movement termed the Enlightenment, and includes figures such as Hegel a key figure in German idealism, Kierkegaard who developed the foundations for existentialism, Nietzsche a famed anti-Christian, John Stuart Mill who promoted Utilitarianism, Karl Marx who developed the foundations for Communism and the American William James. The 20th century saw the split between Analytic philosophy and Continental philosophy, as well as philosophical trends such as Phenomenology, Existentialism, Logical Positivism, Pragmatism and the Linguistic turn. 2.2Middle Eastern philosophy2.3Indian philosophy2.4East Asian philosophy2.5African philosophy2.6Indigenous American philosophy3Categories3.1Metaphysics3.2Epistemology3.3Value theory3.4Logic, science and mathematics3.5History of philosophy3.6Philosophy of religion3.7Philosophical schools4Other approaches4.1Applied philosophyEastern philosophy - Wikipedia Eastern philosophy or Asian philosophy includes the various philosophies that originated in East and South Asia including Chinese philosophy, Japanese philosophy, and Korean philosophy which are dominant in East Asia and Vietnam, [1] and Indian philosophy (including Buddhist philosophy) which are dominant in South Asia, Southeast Asia, Tibet and Mongolia.

Never mix fudge with toothpaste Don't eat prechewed gum you find on the street or sidewalk And if you see someone's lips move it doesn't always mean anything intelligent can be heard\u2026at least 85% of the human race are clueless and can't walk and chew gum at the same time. Just because someone is behind the wheel of a vehicle does not mean they can drive but they can, text, eat, put on makeup, shave, play on their tablet and do many assorted other activities while the vehicle is in motion\u2026in the USA they don't even have to be able to read to get a drivers license and I think airline pilots crash their planes because they are screwing around with 1 or more flight attendants while trusting the copilot to take control and the copilot is fast asleep or high. And then there are the senseless bombings\u2026happy new year! ",
