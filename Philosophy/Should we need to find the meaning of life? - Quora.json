            "answer_text": "I would say find meaning IN life and not OF life. Because life as such doesn\u2019t have any meaning. All meanings are created by mind. If you don\u2019t find meaning in life you will live like a vegetable or animals (or even worse). If you cannot find the purpose using your intelligence / discretion to rise above your nature then you would be guided by the forces of nature, culture and society. Like a football - kick from one leg to other. ",
