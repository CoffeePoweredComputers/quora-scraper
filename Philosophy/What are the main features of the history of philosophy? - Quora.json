            "answer_text": "Western Philosophy begins around 400 BC with Socrates and Plato. It still retains the ancient structure of a polite debate between two opposing viewpoints, following the reasonable rules of logic. The idea is that by thorough rational dialogue (dialectic) the two parties might be able to arrive an an agreement, or a compromise, or at least a better understanding of the issues. No topic would be barred from such debates, which would include dialogues on Politics, Ethics, Art, Duties, Values, Health, Religion and more. It started that way, and it has remained that way for 2,400 years. Over the course of the centuries, two major schools of thought emerged, namely, the Materialist School and the Metaphysical School. The debate goes on. ",
