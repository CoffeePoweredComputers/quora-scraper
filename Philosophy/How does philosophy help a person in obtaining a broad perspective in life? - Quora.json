            "answer_text": "Character, motivation, and intent these are upstream characteristics. Philosophy is a downstream one at best. Philosophy exists to seek out wisdom, but that doesn\u2019t mean all philosophy equally serves in this noble task. Perhaps studying the dialogs of Plato would help you be more systematic about one\u2019s approach to various challenges and conundrums of life. This is a good thing. But truth seeking, rather than opinion rationalization is what is necessary. Moreover, good and right behavior extends well beyond the scope of simply being truthful. Being truthful, fair, and kind gets you started on being able to perhaps resolve conflicts, but humility, listening, and patience are also critical. A \u201cbroad perspective\u201d is a abstraction at best. ",

            "answer_text": "If we approaching philosophy with the right attitude, then it is essential to go beyond our own theories. We must know what it is that others say and why. We need to argue their points and our own as well. We can\u2019t assume that they are all wrong and we are all right, So, whatever your philosophy concentration is on, you need to be in the know. One day I was with a man and he was going on about how wrong and bad another group of people were. Their only sin was to look different. So, I asked him if he had ever met anyone from that other group. He said no he hadn\u2019t. So, then I asked him, what he knew about them. Again, he knew almost nothing. How can one be against or for anything if they don\u2019t know anything about it? ",
