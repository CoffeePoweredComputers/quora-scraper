            "answer_text": "Yes, it does and only truth helps though it may take some time but ultimately, truth prevails. Actually, our thinking span is too small and often we are not able to see both sides of a coin yet the emphasis upon truth would help you immensely in having the result you were trying to achieve. We, however, see the just opposite to what have been said earlier but the life span of lie is not long, it may be longer than our current situation and it might feel that the lie had won the game but that's a myth. Truth, in any form, will always be helpful but the truth should be for the larger good. In personal sphere, there is a fine line dividing the truth and the lie, one has to be careful in applying the truth because your truth may cause harm to others which is not a good way of having truth only, one should compromise in these situations. We, generally, make this mistake, in order to achieve truth, we tend to harm others. Your truth is your truth but it should not be a vaise to harm others. Truth would always prevail for the greater good otherwise ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, Always. But, you need to know the truth first. Truth has two forms:- Relative truth - this type of truth is different for different people and it depends on the stage of evolution of the subject. In other words, your truth changes with the change of your intellect and understanding. For example, things that you considered true and genuine in your childhood is not the same today. Some things underwent modifications and other things changed entirely & this process keeps on continuing.Absolute truth - Such truth never changes. It stands notwithstanding your situation, position and understanding. Therefore, know the truth & you will get your answer. And the PATH starts from you ( ie. Know YOURSELF and you will know everything). Nothing lies beyond you\u2026\u2026. ..",

            "answer_text": "No, truth in real world or in this materialism does not work. I think it is one of the best lie told so that people can be controlled and whoever lie, can control them. Just like politicians, fake religious people. But but, in spritual sense, in huduism truth is not guarantee of well being or for material gain. It is for shedding the ego and to realise the true reality. As Hinduism or Buddhism say that our gross reality is ever changing but the supreme reality is not changeable. So truth helps us to break the shackles of Maya or illusion in spiritual sense. ",

If you seek it, you can have it. Be dipped in its bliss, it's strictly yours. You cannot explain it to anybody. It's an experience. You can only participate in that experience. Be transcended by it. Truth is simply, all that exists the way it does. ",
