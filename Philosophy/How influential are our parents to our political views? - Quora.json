            "answer_text": "I have seen some of the research, but I\u2019ve not read it in any detail. It appears that children, from families where the father is the central authority figure and makes important decisions alone, tend to fear others more and tend to prefer more authoritarian and conservative political views. On the other hand, children from families where the mother and father make important decisions together, tend to see others as people they can work with, and they tend to prefer more collaborative and liberal political views. I\u2019m unaware of any other demographic or social factors that have any predictive value for political views. ",
