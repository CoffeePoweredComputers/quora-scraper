            "answer_text": "Chronic is the study of role of time in communication, and since communication is the process of sending message or messages from encoder to decoder with a feedback, time, however, plays important role in every, and perhaps all communication. There are two main types of chronemics 1). Monochronic: which is doing one thing at precise time, the set time, or agreed time. For instance, every worker has resumption time, break time, smoke time, lunch time, meeting time (for executives with high responsibilities, authority, power and control). Monochronemics may also include time set for certain activities which include but not limited to religious, social, educational, civic duties, special duties and many more. 2). Polychronic is doing more than one thing at a time. For instance driving, eating, and singing; receiving phone call and making notes. Each of these categories matters in communication, however, differently. Monochronic plays high priority on time, by focusing on time management; in communication, time matters because of deadline. News must reach its readers at a precise time, advertisement must reach the target audience at a particular time; Stock and financial services provided must get details of market at a particular time for them to operate effectively. Sports news must get to target audience at right and exact time. International traders who depend on global markets forecast must receive information at the right time to function effectively. This is why time is very important in communication. And since communication is a chain, it follows time sequence, when news occurs, when received, when processed, when disseminated, and when feedbacks are expected. On the other hand, Polychronic focuses on relationships instead of time consciousness. This type of communication takes place more in the community of close relationship. ",

            "answer_text": "Chronemics is a science dedicated to time\u2019s using in non-verbal communication. It researches human\u2019s reactions to temporal limits, as well as laws of time estimate and distribution by men of different types. It deals with such notions as punctuality, waste of time, and attitude toward time by various peoples during non-verbal communication. In terms of chronemics all cultures or civilisations can be classified in two types: monochronic and polychronic. Monochronic cultures use monochronic time system, which may be described by the following features: all tasks, missions or businesses should be done one after another, according to a plan or a schedule. \u201cMonochronists\u201d can only do one task at a time, they set a high value on time, and divide every their (working) day into portions to get maximal benefit of the scheduling. Good examples of monochronic cultures are USA, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, South Korea, Scandinavian countries. Polychronic cultures use polychronic time system whose characteristic features are: multitasking, functioning without strict schedule or agenda. \u201cPolychronists\u201d set a high value on personal relations, if they devote themselves to relatives there couldn\u2019t be \u201ctoo late\u201d for them at any time. They plan many tasks, businesses or missions simultaneously every their (working) day, thus they cannot stick to hard and fast rules or strictly adhere to the agenda. Characteristic representatives of polychronic cultures are Russia, Italy, Egipt, India, Saudi Arabia. As to some examples of chronemics, here they are (as characteristic features of mono- and polychronic societies):  ",
