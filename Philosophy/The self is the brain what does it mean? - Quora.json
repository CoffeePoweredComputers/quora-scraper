            "answer_text": "\u2026 the self is the brain what does it mean? \u2026 it is a possibly mistaken philosophical opinion. your brain is just one part of the instrument package called your body. your body is an extension of yourself. you are not only one small part of your body. \u2026 the entire multiverse is a part of you, an extension of yourself. so saying that one\u2019s brain and one\u2019s self are equivalents may be a bit absurd. however, many people who prefer hard science to philosophy will still use this over-simplified philosophical opinion to try to assign whatever a person\u2019s self may be to a specific part of human anatomy. \u2026 as nearly as we can tell, all of reality extends from yourself, including your own body. many rationalists prefer to believe that whatever yourself may be is an emergent property of your physiology and biochemistry. that sort of thinking just might put the cart before the horse. physiology, biochemistry, and multiverses are just things we use to explore whatever it is that life really is and have fun with it and have fun with other people. we think the two extreme points of view of hard science and philosophical speculation are twined around one-another like the twin strands of information in dna into a unified whole that neither viewpoint can adequately express by itself. \u2026 -enjoy! love, the grigs\u2026 ",
