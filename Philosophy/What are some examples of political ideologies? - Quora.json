            "answer_text": "Political ideologies are normally classified going from the left to the right. The left refers to ideologies that fight for the powerless in society. The right refers to ideologies that fight to keep society running efficiently as it is.  Beyond this you have some very broad ideological alignments: Socialists: (Far-)left. Want to move away from capitalism, and towards a system where wage labour is abolished. Workers should instead organise their own labour for their own ends outside a market system. Liberals: Centre. Most politicians are in this group. Liberals believe in a combination of capitalism and representative democracy. Right-wing libertarians: (Far-)right. Libertarians believe unconstrained free market capitalism gives the best results. Property rights are paramount. Reactionaries: Far-right. Believe the interests of capitalists should be married with the interests of the nation-state. May also believe in a traditionalist society ruled by religious law or an absolute monarch.  Here are some more specific ideologies belonging to these groups. Anarchists (socialists): Want to abolish capitalism by abolishing the capitalist state. This should be done bottom-up by the population. All hierarchies are severely scrutinised and, if found to be unjustified, abolished. Communists (socialists): Want to abolish capitalism by taking over the capitalist state and using it to suppress capitalist interests. After this the state is abolished and society organised by workers directly. Democratic socialists (liberal-friendly socialists): Want to abolish capitalism gradually by participating in elections and passing reforms. Try to build worker power until they can move away from capitalism peacefully. Social democrats (socialist-friendly liberals): Participate in elections and pass reforms to make life easier for workers. Capitalism is good but should be managed in favour of workers and the disadvantaged, not the wealthy who benefit from it naturally. (Social) liberals (liberals): Believe in a free market system with some state intervention to make it fair for everyone. Representative democracy effectively balances interests between workers and capitalists for the best results. Conservatives (liberals): Believe in a strong free market system without much intervention. The system is already fair, you just gotta know how to compete. Failures of the system are explained by a loss of traditional values in the population. Classical liberals (liberals/right-libertarians): Believe that liberalism as it was first formulated during the enlightenment was the best form of liberalism. A good society relies on strong property rights and a non-interventionist government that doesn\u2019t tax or spend much money. Randian objectivists (right-libertarians): Society is propelled by extraordinary individuals working for their own ideals. These people are naturally entrepreneurs under capitalism. The working masses, if given too much power, will only constrain the entrepreneurs and thereby make all of society worse off. Anarcho-capitalists (right-libertarians): All state functions should be outsourced to the private sector. Taxes should be entirely voluntary. The market is the most moral and efficient way to organise everything in society. Property rights should never be infringed. Fascists (reactionaries): All of society should be organised in function of the nation-state. Every element that doesn\u2019t strengthen the state should be removed violently. The state needs a strong leader to function properly. Democracy is a failed system. Nazis (reactionaries): Everything fascists want, but this nation-state should be an ethnic nation-state, and all lesser races should be expelled from it. Most of the world\u2019s problems are caused by a global Jewish elite.  Warning: You can\u2019t list ideologies without engaging in ideology yourself. Your description of political ideologies will always end up being written from a certain political perspective. The most you can do is try to ensure that different perspectives are represented in your description. A lot of the answers on this site don\u2019t do this, and you should always try to figure out what ideology people are trying to promote when considering their answer. I\u2019m personally a socialist. ",
