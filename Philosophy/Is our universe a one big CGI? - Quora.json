            "answer_text": "I wouldn\u2019t call it one big CGI but I will say that our universe its not what it seems. Someone made a comment below about violating the principle of least action and this indeed is true and that is why nature is the ultimate engineer. While science adds a whole load of complexity to our world\u2026 it doesn\u2019t need to be that complex\u2026 a brilliant engineer, which nature is, has designed our world using the principle of least action. How? Our universe is merely the result of expanding matter (a principle of the atom that science hasn\u2019t and will never discover because we are made of the same expanding atoms), and all movement of celestial bodies is straight line motion of accelerating expanding matter all left to freely interact. What we experience at the local level e.g. weight force, is caused by outward expansion of the earth, like an inflating balloon. Scientific theories are biased by what we see at the local level but the god\u2019s eye view of the mechanism shows a whole different picture that indeed causes these local effects. There is no pulling force of gravity\u2026 that is caused by outward expansion. Our universe is one of relative motion and geometric effects and \u201cillusions\u201d caused by this relative expansion. And the very most important thing\u2026. it can be accomplished without needing an eternal free energy power source to provide that gravitational force. There is no dark matter, dark energy etc. it\u2019s all relative motion and geometric effects of the relative motion of accelerating expanding matter. ",
