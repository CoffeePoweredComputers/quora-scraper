            "answer_text": "We all need the spark to start something radical and new. But that  is not enough, because like you said, most people give up when the winds  of doubt, the storm of persecution, and the whirlwind of opposing  opinions assail them, threatening to snuff out their 'youthful  idealism'. We need something MORE. We need something that will FUEL our  spark and fan into flame what was once a little idealistic hope. I know  in my heart of hearts that that hope came from somewhere, and for a good  reason. We cannot let it die. Question is, what is that fuel we need?  For me, I am a follower of Jesus & I believe that apart from his  empowerment, I can do nothing that will bear lasting fruit. A burn out  will occur if I do not constantly rely on His grace & allow HIS LOVE  to provide the fuel for my passion and fire to do the right thing. Having said all that, I am only still 18 myself, and ofcourse, even  with a little project I'm initiating called The BORNE Project  (www.facebook.com/theBORNEproject), people are already showing me by  their general apathy that it probably isn't going to work or make any  great impact. But is that my ultimate goal? To make a 'great impact'? Is  that my only hope? Is that my only motivation?  I think what separates youthful idealism from the 'veterans' is the  fact that the veterans may have a very different goal & vision in  sight. For me, I will always pray and hope that no matter how terribly,  impossibly ginormous the problems are in our world, I will still open my  eyes to see the individual faces, the unique stories of need and  suffering around me. If I see the problem as a whole all the time, I  will lose heart. If I see merely the terrifying statistics, I will soon  become numb to the sheer number of people in situations of such dire  need, poverty and oppression. But in all things, always, I will try to  see the one person I CAN help, wherever I am. I may be a tiny drop in a vast ocean, but I am nevertheless still a  drop that can make a ripple wherever I am! As Bob Pierce, founder of Christian humanitarian organization World  Vision said, 'Don't fail to do something just because you can't do  everything.'  ~ Janielle Beh ",

            "answer_text": "NOT AT ALL - GUILTY AS CHARGED Through our thinking and our choices, we create our life journey. I believe life offers endless possibilities and the possibilities can be waiting behind every door. Why not strive for creating the most IDEAL life for ourselves as possible? We have the ability to create the life that we want. Why not believe there is a better life that we can shoot for and actively pursue it? I do. I understand not everyone can see a bright future, and I accept that. I will not bog myself down with the things I cannot change, and I actively assert myself on the things I can change. Why settle for mediocre and mundane or unhappiness and discontent? There is no life manual for happiness so start creating a life that is IDEAL for yourself. Only you know the answer to what defines an IDEAL life from where you stand now. Don't worry about the \"IDEALIST\" label. Do what you can, when you can and while you can. I always believe people have more potential than they realize, and I am willing to encourage them to seek out that potential. Live a life with \u201cno regrets.\u201d Trust me, there will always be a \"reality\" check. Ideally speaking, I\u2019m a happy camper. I wake up every day with a song in my heart and when I hear the birds chirping outside of my window, I am even happier. I thank God for everything I have and everything I have overcome. I look forward to every day with positive anticipation. I give everyone the same consideration I expect for myself. My heart and mind are open and accepting to individuals living around me. I found a way to live my life in a very happy way. Things have fallen into place the way I want them to. I expect things to work out the way I want them to, and they usually do. Good things happen all of the time. When I\u2019m hit with a curve ball, I take a deep breath, and think it through, looking for the best way to resolve the issue at hand. (a) For instance, one morning I woke up at the time of my job interview. I called the prospective employer from my bed, told them I just left a job interview that took me much longer than I anticipated and did they still want me to come in. Of course they said yes and I rushed to Century City, but I forgot my resume. I still got hired. He started his own business and took me with him. Why am I an idealist? I\u2019m striving for the best life that I can possibly achieve. I work on myself inside and out. I\u2019m determined to live this life to the fullest. ",
