            "answer_text": "\u201cReality\u201d is the \u201cpotential heaven\u201d. So, you needn\u2019t think of escaping from it. It is your destination where you may, with your \u201cingenious thinking\u201d, avail the \u201cutilities\u201d in order to progressively turn your potential heaven into an \u201cactual heaven\u201d. The \u201cobjectives\u201d you foresee are the waypoints upon this forwardly path called \u201clife\u201d. Veracity of the objective is felt \u201csubjectively\u201d as \u201cpotential happiness\u201d which is consummated proportionately with every step forward. The objective\u2019s veracity is proven and portrayed \u201cphysically\u201d as \u201cevolution\u201d in every length of approach towards it. Thus, \u201chappiness\u201d and \u201cevolution\u201d serve as two lifeboats upon the ocean of \u201creality\u201d where the \u201cheaven\u201d occurs as a distant island. There is no \u201cactual illusion\u201d in this creation. What appears as illusion is only the interspace between two pieces of information awaiting to be correlated through your intellect. The intellectually-and-emotionally lazy ones who are reluctant to exercise their wit tend become an escapist terming this \u201cinformational interspace\u201d as \u201cinescapable illusion\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Even if you change your opinion about reality being an illusion, what difference with that make? It's here that's for sure, your understanding in one way or the other makes no difference. Our brain recieves signals in form of ether (electricity) and it's interpretation is reality. But our sense organs can only interpret material dimension of this reality. Mind on the contrary is free, it is not bound to this material reality. In the understanding of mind comes the answer to your question. ",
