            "answer_text": "In a self-referential system (of sufficient complexity), some statements may be true but are unprovable or false but un-refutable. Such a statement as you have given is the basis for G\u00f6del\u2019s Incompleteness Theorems. (From Wikipedia) The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e., an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of the natural numbers. For any such formal system, there will always be statements about the natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency. G\u00f6del actually encoded a similar statement to the one you gave in a mathematical system he created as part of his proof. If you want a really good explanation of all of this see G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, also known as GEB. It is a 1979 book by Douglas Hofstadter.
