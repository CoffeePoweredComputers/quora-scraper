            "answer_text": "SOURCE: Why Our Social Networks Are Better Than Us: The 'Friendship Paradox' Your friends are more popular than you. They are also happier and wealthier.   If you're at all social, chances are you\u2019ve felt or feel that your friends are more popular than you are. The fact of the matter is that basic arithmetic has proven this hunch to be true, and it\u2019s called the \u201cfriendship paradox.\u201d Now a recent study has given us more justification to have an inferiority complex by proving that our friends are generally better than us. In 1991, a sociologist named Scott Feld published a famous paper that figured out mathematically that a person is more likely to be friends with someone who has more friends than with a person who has fewer friends. At the time, social networks had nothing to do with the Internet. Yet bloggers, Facebook, and Twitter later confirmed that this trend pertains to any network where some people are more popular than others. The idea is based on simple yet unintuitive number-crunching of how people are connected together. The premise of the paradox lies in the fact that most people have few friends while a small amount of people has a lot of friends. This popular minority is the outlier that raises the average number of friends that your friends have and makes you look less like a social butterfly. Because this paradox is a rule of thumb in a social network, Young-Ho Eom of the University of Toulouse and Hang-Hyun Jo of Aalto University in Finland wanted to see how far it would apply to other aspects within a communal web that aren\u2019t as obvious, such as happiness and wealth. To assess these features, Eom and Jo analyzed the academic networks of scientists. They first verified that the paradox applies to this scenario by showing that the co-authors of scientists often had more co-authors themselves. But the findings go even further. Eom and Jo also discovered that these co-authors also had more publications and citations, which is the validating bread and butter of being a successful scientist. The authors of the study said this phenomenon exemplified the \u201cgeneralized  friendship paradox.\u201d According to this rule, the authors explain in their paper, you perceive that \u201cyour friends have on average higher characteristics than you have.\u201d Ultimately, the finding sheds light on how people\u2019s perception of themselves and the world is shaped by the status of their friends, colleagues, and peers. The generalized friendship paradox predicts that the way we view ourselves becomes distorted when we compare our popularity, income, reputation, or happiness to those of our friends. This warped self-perception happens simply when we compare ourselves to others regardless of whether they are an \u201caverage\u201d friend or \u201cbetter\u201d friend. \u201cThis might be the reason why active online social networking service users are not happy (since) it is much easier to compare to other people in online social media,\u201d the authors concluded.

            "answer_text": "The Birthday Paradox \u201cGiven a room with [math]23[/math] randomly chosen people, there is a [math]50\\%[/math] probability that at least one pair will have the same birthday\u201d The birthday paradox is a very counter-intuitive result in probability. It seeks to find the probability that in a randomly chosen sample of [math]n[/math] people, at least two have the same birthday. Let this event be [math]E[/math]. Let a sample of [math]n[/math] people be chosen randomly. Consider the event where no two people have the same birthday. It is [math]E\u2019[/math]. The number of ways [math]E'[/math] can happen is same as the number of ways [math]365[/math] dates can be distributed among n people, which is given by [math]^{365}P_n[/math]. The total number of ways to distribute 365 dates among n people is [math]365^n[/math]. Hence, we have [math]P(E')=\\frac{^{365}P_n}{365^n}[/math] and, [math]P(E)=1-P(E\u2019)[/math] For [math]n=23[/math], we have [math]P(E)=0.5073[/math] ie., [math]50.73\\%[/math]. For [math]70[/math] people, [math]99.9\\%[/math] probability is reached. The Giant Ring Assume the earth to be a perfect sphere. Consider a giant ring around a circumference of the earth. It is just touching the earth surface. The circumference of the earth (and hence the ring) is around [math]40000 km[/math], or [math]4\\times10^7m.[/math] If the circumference of the ring increases by only [math]10m[/math], how high will it be from the earth surface? Assume center of ring coincides with that of the earth. Intuition says few millimeters, or centimeters, right? No. It\u2019s a whopping [math]1.592 m[/math]. In fact, it is independent of earth radius, as you can verify with elementary mathematics. Let [math]R_e[/math] be the radius of earth (ring, originally). Let [math]l = 10m[/math] be added to the circumference, [math]2\u03c0R_e[/math], to get new radius [math]R\u2019[/math], and circumference [math]2\u03c0R'[/math]. The equation is: [math]2\u03c0R_e + l = 2\u03c0R'[/math] Solving, height [math]h = R\u2019 - R_e = \\frac{l}{2\u03c0}[/math] Which for [math]l = 10m[/math], is [math]1.592m[/math] The Monty Hall Problem \u201cSuppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\u201d (Source: wikipedia) Intuition may suggest, what difference does it make? However, the correct answer is yes, it is advantageous to change your choice. In fact, the choice doubles your probability of winning the car from [math]1/3[/math] to [math]2/3.[/math] Simply explained, the initial probability of choosing the door with the car is [math]1/3[/math], and that with a goat is [math]2/3[/math]. But if the door with a goat is chosen, the host is forced to open the other door with the goat, and on switching, you will win the car. Thus you win the car with the same probability as that of initially choosing the door with a goat, ie., [math]2/3[/math]. The result is so counter-intuitive that even the knowledge of the explanation will make you hesitate to actually switch choices, after the host has opened the door. ",
