            "answer_text": "Does any idea really exist? IQ is an idea, an attempt to measure differences in intelligence, and as such is as real as a kilometre -or a yard, or ell, thumb, or foot.Of those, it could be argued the kilometre is the most \"real\", as it is based on scientific constants, but even there, it's something that we humans invented and agreed upon.It's the same with IQ: we invented it, a lot of people agreed this is how things work, and we use it to the best of our ability.The only difference is, we do not fully understand (never mind agree on) all the details, and these are often discussed or downright bickered about.But that doesn't make the idea unreal or unrealistic, any more than all the confusion and bickering about all the various ways to measure distance that ran rampant through the ages means the idea of distance is unreal or unrealistic.We may yet find a good, reliable way to measure intelligence. Or perhaps we'll work out how to correctly divide various parts so we can correctly measure those and get more useful results than we do now. But the concept is real. ",

Then truly IQ exists as a measurement we\u2019ve invented. Intelligence, in its unquantified state, exists. Whether the former serves as a reasonable scale for the latter is another question entirely. Every manmade scale or doctrine exists in the way that we have made it exist, usually to simplify the abstract principles that we could not, in their original form, fully comprehend or scientifically utilise. Then again, we can\u2019t definitely determine that anything exists. ",

            "answer_text": "IQ does not exist because it refers to three entirely distinct networks in the brain as one thing. These neural networks are not uniform across all humanity, but they vary on an individual basis. Someone may have a way of solving problems similar to one on an iq test in a very efficient manner, but the particular way the test asks them to use their brain may not compute for them. There are too many variations in cognitive ability for any one test to quantify over. Finally, it isn't really the case that you can measure abilities. You can measure reaction times, but surely cognitive abilities are more than reactions. ",
