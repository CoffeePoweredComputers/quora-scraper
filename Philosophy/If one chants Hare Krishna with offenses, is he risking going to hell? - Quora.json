            "answer_text": "Yes. obviously! This is like elephant going for bathing and after bathing he will come and shower mud on him; than what is the use of bathing? Better don't bath only. Of all sinful activities, an offense to a pure devotee, or Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, is the most severe. An offense at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava is so disastrous that \u015ar\u012b Caitanya Mah\u0101prabhu has compared it to a mad elephant that enters a garden and causes great havoc by uprooting many plants and trees. If one is an offender at the lotus feet of a br\u0101hma\u1e47a or Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, his offenses uproot all his auspicious activities. One should therefore very carefully guard against committing vai\u1e63\u1e47ava-apar\u0101dha, or offenses at the lotus feet of a Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava. - (Srimad Bhagavat - 7.4.28) Therefore, chanting harekrsna and commits offences it's like making our life more hellish way. Better you don't chant and keep committing offences and it will actually make your life hellish. why to chant hare krsna and make offenses? this can be anyway done by not chanting. If you chant, chant in such a way that you will feel Krishna is dancing on your tongue. And, best remedy is to chant the holy name of Sri Krsna in the association of devotees and develop the taste to chant the holy name. In meanwhile, you will get taste for chanting and you will not commit offences. And even though if you commit offences(indirectly) you can ask forgiveness and try to do attonement for that offences you had committed. So, try not to commit offences and try always being connected to the holy name and Devotees, because the devotees and holy name is the only saviour to make our life perfect.  Hope you got your answer!\u263a Thank you very much Hare Krishna ",

Rather the Vedas encourage you to use your brain to filter out the bogus Gurus and leaders in ISKCON. If you are not comfortable with all that Prabhupada says in his books , you should doubt it. The brain that God has given you should be used. Use logic and argument to challenge all that you find nonsense. Be rest assured that using logic and being honest to filter out the nonsense is not blasphemy. No harm will come to you. So do not be scared :) ",
