            "answer_text": "Kant is known for being quite a stickler when it comes to morality. This answer should show you why. For Kant, to be moral is to do your duty, because it is your duty. In his view, doing the right thing for any other reason is not morally praiseworthy. At first, this can seem quite plausible: Imagine two people, Alex and Babette, confronted with a moral choice for which the right answer is not controversial: an old woman has tripped and needs help getting up.Alex helps the old woman to her feet. However, he was with a date at the time, and he only helped the woman because he wanted to look good in his date\u2019s eyes. Normally, he would\u2019ve walked past the woman, as it\u2019s \u201cnot his problem\u201d. His actions are not morally praiseworthy because they don\u2019t come from duty.Babette helps the woman to her feet. She did it because it was the right thing to do. Her actions are morally praiseworthy because they come from duty.Surely we want people to be more like Babette than Alex. But wait a second: Babette admits that she enjoys enjoys doing the right thing, and that she felt concern for the woman. She says that her enjoyment of being good and her sense of concern were also strong motivations for her behavior.In a strict Kantian view, she\u2019s now less morally praiseworthy, because she didn\u2019t act from duty alone.Hence Kant is rather strict. What\u2019s good is that a person who obeyed his rule would always do the right thing. What\u2019s bad is that they would be inhuman. I would propose a compromise rule: An action is morally praiseworthy if duty alone was a sufficient motivation. This way, we retain the strong sense of duty without penalizing people for being human. Furthermore, it seems plausible that the best people would be people who do enjoy doing good, since doing their duties would probably involve less willpower. ",

            "answer_text": "For Kant, the moral value of an action rests not in the action itself, but in its motivating principal. Hence there can be no purely moral action: no action that, regarded in and of itself, independent of its motivating principle, is actually moral. Moral actions, for Kant, must be done for the sake of being moral. If you \u201cdo the right thing\u201d out of fear of consequences, or even because it \u201cjust feels right,\u201d then you are acting in conformity with moral virtue, but not virtuously. And moreover it is impossible to judge whether an action is done for the sake of morality as such. Human freedom does not reveal itself unambiguously in the phenomenal realm. ",

That's Kant's line on universalizing maxims. Kant believes an action was morally repugnant if, when everyone did it, it caused social dysfunction. A morally good action according Kant would be telling the truth. ",
