            "answer_text": "You can know it within the next five minutes. Turn your attention away from everything you are normally aware of - which is everything but you - and place your attention on you. Within a few minutes you should notice a difference from what you normally experience. If you are anxious, you will notice your anxiety is less. A sense of happiness enters, even though you are still feeling anxious. This is the realization that you are not your anxiety, or tension, or whatever else that troubles you, that you may be feeling right now. If you don't notice such a change it means only one thing: You are trying to observe a concept of yourself, which is a mental object. Self-awareness in my sense, not the dictionary sense, means to observe who is looking, who is feeling, who is thinking, who is experiencing everything. The dictionary version of self-awareness, which is not self-awareness at all, is to be aware of your personality or character. Talk about a fruitless exercise in self-defeat! That is self-absorption, not self-awareness. Your personality and character are both illusory, a passing show. Neither are you. Self-observation means awareness of yourself, the observer (subject), not the observed personality or character. ",

With every interaction and every choice and every decision- you act in alignment with this concept of being \u201cwho you want to be\u201d and come out feeling slightly more empowered each time. but the challenge is balancing the id and the ego when you start recognizing that you are becoming more self aware- which believe it or not is the same challenge presented a different way. Don\u2019t get comfortable, bc there will always be challenges presented to strengthen you in your new alignment with self, or to weed you out back to the starting line. There is no finish line. ",
