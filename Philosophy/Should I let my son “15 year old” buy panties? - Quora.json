            "answer_text": "If you know that he is wearing panties and especially if he has been wearing your panties, then , yes, i would encourage him to buy his own rather than \u201cborrowing\u201d yours or other women\u2019s panties. It is not uncommon for young men to wear panties and use hem to pleasure themselves. I did it when i was a young teen and I have worn panties off and of now for many years. There is a good probability that his behavior will continue. If he has problems buying panties for himself, I would suggest that perhaps you can help him by taking him shopping and getting him a few pairs. It is also a great opportunity for you to exercise a little control and insist that he only wear his panties at home and that he keeps it a secret from his schoolmates. If they found out, they could be awfully cruel to him. Secrets don\u2019t keep long in school. ",

It took me a long time to get myself off the self destructive path that set me down. ",
