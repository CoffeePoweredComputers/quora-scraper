            "answer_text": "An action may be out of our control (i.e. we didn\u2019t directly commit it) but we can nonetheless be morally responsible for it in many ways. Plenty of people didn\u2019t hang slaves, but were morally responsible for slavery and the racism that supported it. No matter how far away from the direct action, we may feel enough moral responsibility to work to end similar actions. I think that\u2019s what the Vietnam war protests were all about, especially at the onset of bombing campaigns of cities. Turn the question around and ask if the soldier is morally responsible for killing the enemy, when \u201cthe enemy\u201d is defined and targeted by social and government powers. Thus, at best, a person may be morally responsible for not becoming a conscientious objector. Many, on the other hand, may feel they are fighting a moral war against dictatorship, for example. Some go with flow of patriotism, which may fall short of a moral reason for killing. So moral responsibility is like throwing a pebble into a pool. The thrower is accountable for having created the waves that result, but many others can be morally touched by those waves, enough, at least, to work against similar actions by others in the future. E.g., those who want stricter gun control to protect against mass killings happening again. ",
