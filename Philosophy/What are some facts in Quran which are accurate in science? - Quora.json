            "answer_text": "Some Brief Examples of Scientific Data in the Qur\u2019an a) The Earth and Heavens were Joined Together All scientific circles in the world today agree that the planets were originally composed of a mass of Sodium gas and that first the heavens and the earth were joined together as a single entity and then they separated from each other. Centuries ago, the Qur\u2019an referred to this scientific theory.  It says when describing the creation of the heavens: \u201cThen God turned to the creation of the heavens (the planets), when they were but a smoky substance.\u201d (41:11)  \u201cDo the unbelievers not see that the heavens and the earth were joined together before we separated them, and that We brought all living things into existence from water? Why do they still not believe in God?\u201d (21:30)  Thus the Qur\u2019an unveils one of the great mysteries of nature: the planets were originally composed of smoky substance (mass of Sodium gas), and the separation of the planets from a huge object and then their separation from each other. Since at the time of revelation of the Qur\u2019an, the general level of knowledge and science was extremely low, does this not constitute a proof of the heavenly nature of the Qur\u2019an? b) Expansion of Universe One of the most subtle discoveries in science concerns the expansion of universe, its tendency constantly to extend its boundaries. This was something completely unknown to the human being until the last century. This mystery is, however, mentioned by the Qur\u2019an in the following terms, which again bear witness to its remarkable profundity when discussing such matters: \u201cWe created the heavens with Our strength and power, and constantly expand them\u201d. (51:47) c) Force of Gravity We know that before the time of Newton, that great scientific personality, no one was aware of the force of gravity. Newton proved that the falling of objects to earth, the rotation of the moon and the Venus, the motion of the planets, and other instances of attraction are all subject to the single law, the law of universal gravity.  The Qur\u2019an describes the above mentioned gravitational force as \u2018invisible pillars\u2019: \u201cGod it is Who raised up the heavenly bodies to invisible pillars .....\u201d (13:2).  In conveying this scientific truth, the Qur\u2019an has used an expression that is comprehensible for the men of all ages. Are these \u2018unseen pillars\u2019, which prevent the planets from colliding with each other or falling, anything other than the mysterious and invisible force of universal gravity, a law to which the Creator of the universe has subjected all of the heavenly bodies?

            "answer_text": "The science behind aerial superiority and air bombardment was described in the Quran, few hundreds years before the inventions of airplanes. It\u2019s been written in the Quran that during some war between Prophet Muhammad and his foes, the army of Prophet Muhammad were badly outnumbered by the size of his foes armies. Then God sends many squadrons of birds to reinforce Muhammad\u2019s forces. There were thousands of birds flying and each of them carrying a pair of small rock in their feet. Then those birds starts dropping stones from high altitudes to the Muhammad\u2019s foes. The gravity took care the rest. The results was devastated to the enemy\u2019s forces that makes them surrendered to Muhammad. That\u2019s the importance to have an air forces, and Quran has mentioned it several hundred years ago.
