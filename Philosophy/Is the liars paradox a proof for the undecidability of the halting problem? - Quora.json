            "answer_text": "No - it\u2019s not proof of the halting problem - but the standard proof of the halting problem does rely on a similar paradox. The halting problem proof works like this: Suppose we can write a computer program that can \u201csolve the halting problem\u201d by examining some other computer program and figuring out whether it will halt or run forever.We can modify that program to say: \u201cIf the program I\u2019m presented with will halt for some given input - then I will loop forever - but if I find that the program will loop forever, then I\u2019ll halt.\u201dThen you feed the program to itself.If it loops, it must halt but if it halts, it must loop.This is a paradox - ergo, it is not possible to write a program that solves the halting problem.That\u2019s a lot like the liar paradox\u2026but it\u2019s not proven by the liar paradox.
