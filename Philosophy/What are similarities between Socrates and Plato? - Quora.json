            "answer_text": "The question presented: \u201cWhat are similarities between Socrates and Plato?\u201d There are no similarities between Socrates and Plato. Socrates was a True Messenger; Plato was not. Socrates did not write down his teachings. Plato, a student of Socrates, completely misconstrued and falsified Socrates\u2019 message and teachings, for his own aggrandizement. \u201cUnfortunately, some of Socrates\u2019 students misinterpreted his teachings in the presentation of their own. His few students found that they received value, prestige, and money in the community when they presented information that was politically and socially correct. So, they simply took some of Socrates\u2019 information that wasn\u2019t politically and socially correct and made it so. Whatever they learned from [Socrates], they changed it to conform to what their community wanted to hear, for which they were compensated handsomely (received a very good payment).\u201d SOURCE (which can be downloaded free-of-charge at www.realilluminati.org):  ",
