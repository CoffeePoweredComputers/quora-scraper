            "answer_text": "Logic and mathematics are eternal/universal. However, like \u201cthe scientific method\u201d it\u2019s only a system of reasoning - not a bunch of answers to questions. Math and logic take a set of \u201caxioms\u201d (which are essentially just unproven assumptions) - and from that may produce a range of \u201ctheorems\u201d. Theorems are statements that are guaranteed to be true only if all of the axioms we used to deduce them are also true. For example - we all learned (but maybe forgot) that the sum of the interior angles of any triangle add up to 180 degrees. It\u2019s one of Euclid\u2019s theorems and it\u2019s taught as fact to all of our children in Geometry 101. But suppose you draw a triangle between a place on Earth that\u2019s at roughly 0 degrees longitude (London, England, for example) and another at 90 degrees longitude and the same latitude (Thunder Bay, Ontario, for example) and the North pole. If you measure the interior angles of THAT triangle, they add up to roughly 270 degrees, not 180! The reason for that is not that Euclid was wrong - or that mathematics is somehow broken. It\u2019s because Euclid\u2019s axioms don\u2019t apply to curved surfaces\u2026they only apply to flat surfaces - and the Earth is a sphere. So if the universe was totally different, with different laws of physics and different physical constants, then mathematics, logic and even science would all still be perfectly valid\u2026although the scientific results and mathematical theorems that we learned in school much not have much meaning. But in any universe where Euclid\u2019s axioms are true - no matter how strange it is in other ways - the interior angles of a triangle will most definitely still add up to 180 degrees. This feature of mathematics (theorems that depend on axioms) is quite useful. In many cases, mathematicians deliberately think of axioms that aren\u2019t true in the real world - and come up with theorems that also aren\u2019t true. This can sometimes lead to profound insights into unusual branches of mathematics. Logic and reasoning work the same way - a classic logical inference could be something like this: Axiom 1: All men are humans.Axiom 2: Aristotle was a man.Theorem: Aristotle was human.We\u2019re assuming that the axioms are true - they certainly seem to be - and we can say that the third line is true if the first two are also true. But if we said: Axiom 1: All chimpanzees are human.Axiom 2: Bonzo was a chimpanzee.Theorem: Bonzo was human.Although this is a perfectly valid set of reasoning and it correctly obeys all of the rules of logical inference - but it\u2019s not true in reality because all chimpanzees are not in fact human. The logic holds up - but the first axiom doesn\u2019t (at least not in this universe). So no matter how the universe is set up, the scientific method, mathematics and logic are all valid things\u2026but the results they have produced are only as true as the experimental results (for science) and the axioms (for math and logic).

            "answer_text": "I can only answer your question if I remove the condition that physical laws come from the Big Bang - But I will give you a better condition. The Big Bang was a complicated process - It does not seem reasonable that the universe began with such complicated event. Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything starts before the big bang with one building block component ingredient and the energy that is associated with its initial alignment. This more simplistic beginning has relatively easier mathematics associated with it and it is this mathematics that then provides the logic and mathematically derivable sequence of inevitable events that we know as the Big Bang and beyond. The main stumbling block for physicists is the \u201cRuby Slipper Conundrum\u201d. This is where the math of the component building block is unlike any math we have ever used and/or encountered. The reason why is because the math of the component building block is applied to an entity, not a particle. A particle exist \u201cin\u201d spacetime which is the only math we know, the math of particles existing in spacetime. The Entity building block is the component structure of spacetime itself. We have no experience applying our current math to an entity that does not exist \u201cin\u201d spacetime. For doing so, we cannot express this entity in term of distance, time, dimesnions, and direction. Yet it is the math of a humongous number of these entities that give up the properties of spacetime and all the particles that come to exist \u201cin\u201d spacetime. Before the Big Bang, the entities of spacetime were aligned in each other\u2019s energy plane, creating an parallel planar universe of 2 spatial dimensions. The big bang represents the time when the perpendiculat direction (to the energy plane( was found to exist) and the entities realignedfrom the planar alignment to a cubic lattice creating three spacetime dimensions. During this process, some of the E0 energy associated with the entities of espacetime were able to make the jump up to the 1st Gordon Energy State creating the primordial photons of whose energy is proportional to c^1, the energy of light. The mathematics of Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything starts at the most fundamental level (before the Big Bang) from which everything else can be derived. If something cannot be derived from the math of Gordon\u2019s Theory of Everything, then that something does not exist in reality. ",

            "answer_text": "In my view, the laws of arithmetic exist independently of physical implementation. This is contrary to the notion that physics principles were created simultaneously with cosmic physiology. IMO, creation was the result of the underlying laws, rather than vice versa. Assume for example there is something which exists with two possibilities. It can grow at a rate which feeds upon itself, or it can decay at a rate that depends upon how much of the stuff is left to decay. Both of these processes are physically operative in nature. Radio activity is an example of the latter - but it is an un-experienced phenomena unless there is something to start with. Exponential expansion of the universe is an example of the latter - it can only be experienced if there is nothing to start with. Throughout most of the 20th century, the universe was believed to be slowing at an exponential rate due to gravity - But it is impossible to have a decelerating function with no beginning. Contrariwise, it is impossible to imagine an exponentially expanding universe with a finite beginning .

It is not clear at all that the physically laws came from the Big Bang, more likely the reverse. There are a number of interesting speculative ideas about these things but nothing is established or generally accepted by a majority of physicists. If anyone says they know they \u201cknow\u201d they are kidding someone, possibly themselves. Physics expect there to be a consistent underlying mathematical basis to the universe. This can\u2019t be proved, it is a working assumption. So far, this approach is has been productive and produced some great and useful physics. This progress suggests that there might actually be a consistent underlying mathematical basis to the universe and we are working towards it but we clearly aren\u2019t at there yet. There are a lot of fundamental unsolved questions in physics. ",

Indeed the universe existed 13.8 billion less 5000 years before there were any laws of physics. Billions of years of cosmic evolution across billions of light years and among hundreds of billions of galaxies. The dinosaurs even came, lived a couple hundred million years, and went extinct, all without any laws of physics. The laws of physics are observations of how things work. Newton observed an apple fall, and developed a means of communicating his observation to others. And again, for 13.8 billion years gravity has acted as the fundamental force in the universe \u2014 the only force that applies uniformly throughout the universe \u2014 before Newton was even born.

However, they are the way they are because we\u2019ve evolved to reason that way, because the universe/nature is the way it is. If the universe works in a certain way, then to be able to reason about it you need to evolve your brain in such a way that it reasons in a way that fits the universe. evolution would not produce a brain that doesn\u2019t work properly. We\u2019ve formally investigated logic and math, and continue to do so, and this is investigation into it is what we call \u201clogic\u201d and \u201cmath\u201d, and they are human inventions. Had the universe somehow been fundamentally different, then we would\u2019ve needed to reason differently about it, and our brains could only have evolved to reason in that other way. What I\u2019m saying is that you should not mix up the physical/concrete world with the world of reason. It\u2019s easy to accidentally do so, though, because we think that a chair really is a chair, rather than that a \u201cchair\u201d is a concept, and that we look for patterns in nature that we think conform to our concepts. So be careful about reification fallacies (treating a conceptual thing as if it was concrete). The physical laws are also human inventions in a similar way. A natural law is a description of something we find to be true, describing some relationship between things. What\u2019s actually fundamentally going on is a different thing, and we won\u2019t know that until we understand what the universe itself really \u201cis\u201d, and that could potentially be impossible for us to ever know.
