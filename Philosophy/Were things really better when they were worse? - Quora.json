            "answer_text": "I wish it would have been expanded upon. So I\u2019m going to try an assume that you mean is it sometimes better when things are at their worse(stint periods of time). I want to say no. I really do. But there is a psychological trick that I will paraphrase. \u201cif you are happy all the time, then eventually you will be happy none of the time.\u201d Basically again everything in moderation. But with that said. Does it mean you have to be sad sometimes to be happier? I\u2019m not going to say I 100% know that answer. But it seems like it. Can\u2019t know happiness unless you\u2019ve known sadness. But with that. I\u2019ll post a video, that will help with the explanation. As well as, the answer goes. It\u2019s a depends, and very large depends. Not the one you pick up at the store kind of depends. Just wanted to clarify that.

            "answer_text": "No they werent.What made them seem as though they were better is bc of our mindset at the time.Hindsight is the best teacher.When we're in a situation we have to deal as best we can to get through it and that teaches us tolerance, gives us wisdom and experiences. We see things differently after time passes and, we're able to honestly and constructively compare the times and situations.We like to believe that things were better bc we didn't know any better at the time and upon that realization we figure out that we were worst off than we thought.
