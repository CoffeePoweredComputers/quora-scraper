As soon as you make yourself responsible in all sincerity for everything and for everyone, you will see at once that this is really so, and that you are in fact to blame for everyone and for all things.\u201d - Fyodor Dostoevsky, \u201cThe Brothers Karamazov Yes, we are responsible to everyone for our actions, because we are responsible to ourselves and to the highest good. When we act, we set an example for the whole world, and if we act poorly, we may influence another to do the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Indirectly, we are. But it happens accidentally. By being responsible for your behaviours you are inadvertently looking out for others. For example, when you responsibly phone a friend to pick you up after a night of drinking you are proving yourself responsible for others to feel good about. Conversely, if you throw caution to the wind and put your own life at risk, you are effectively doing the same to others whether you accept it or not. Be a responsible human being and the rest will take care of itself. ",
