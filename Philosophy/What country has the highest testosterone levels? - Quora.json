            "answer_text": "Jamaican's have the highest base testosterone levels in the world.  Usain Bolt, the world's fastest man--is Jamaican! We know that testosterone is typically higher among wealthy countries; since wealth implies the citizens of such countries have access to more nutritious foods from a young age--hopefully, all their lives. To conclude, maybe you will find these study results interesting: American Study African Americans have 19% higher mean testosterone levels than whites. Whites have 15% higher mean testosterone levels compared to Chinese and Japanese people. I hope this helps. :) ",
