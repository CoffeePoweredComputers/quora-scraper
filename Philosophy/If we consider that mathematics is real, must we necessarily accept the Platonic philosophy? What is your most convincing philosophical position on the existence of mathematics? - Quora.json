            "answer_text": "There is a vocabulary problem here. Mathematical platonism is simply mathematical realism, and it has few relation with Plato\u2019s Platonism, even if I suspect this one came from Pythagorus \u201cplatonism\u201d or \u201crealism\u201d about the natural number. In philosophy of mathematics, you can defend realism for the natural numbers, which entails realism on integers and rationals, but remain skeptical on the realism about sets and functions (second order realism). Now, if you assume the hypothesis of digital mechanism in cognitive science, this needs arithmetical (first order) realism, and this leads to a theology close to the neopythagorean and the neoplatonist of the first 500 years. The theology remains pure mathematics, and even if you are a machine, it can only be used with some maximal precautions, as most of its truth are not assertable without making the machine inconsistent. Like in taoism, the wise remain silent, only the fool talk. No scientists doubt about the existence of the numbers and of most of their relations. Some scientists believe that there is also a *primary* physical universe, but we can remain skeptical, as there has never been any evidence for any sort of primary matter. That is speculation, but as mechanism and this materialism have been shown constructively incompatible, we can test them, and until now, it is the immaterialist mechanism which win. Nature behave exactly like mechanism predicted: it looks like a statistics on infinitely many computations, as it should. Not yet any evidences for Matter (Aristotle primary matter). Of course, since religion have been separated from science, and related to politics, the scientists are not yet really listen to. The belief in some Matter is still widespread. The subject is even still taboo in one third of the academies, I would say. ",

            "answer_text": "The mathematics that expresses itself in the universe is real, for how can something not exist and still affect real things? Such mathematics is also logically consistent, because the universe is not observed to contradict itself. Other mathematics, for example set theory, is possibly unreal, and we have no grounds for believing that it is logically consistent. That mathematics is real and expresses itself in the universe, is entirely consistent with Platonic philosophy. The fact that nobody has come up with a convincing argument as to how Platonic forms influence the universe does not invalidate Platonic philosophy, for there may be a means which is beyond human comprehension. However, there is also a means for forms to influence the universe which is within our comprehension. Only, it violates the Platonic principle that the relationship between forms and things is a one way street, so it is a halfway house between Platonism and Aristotelianism. The means may be stated briefly as follows: the universe is a quantum system, obeying the most fundamental law of QM, namely that a quantum system contains the same information only once. This is the principle which dictates the role of symmetry, and also produces entanglement.mathematics and natural law are also part of the universe, and are as such quantum phenomena.if a mathematical pattern occurs spontaneously in the universe, then that is a case of the same information. In the quantum system which is the universe, it will therefore come in to existence as a form.any change to the pattern will change the form, and therefore affect all instantiations of it.This approach to mathematics has an additional advantage that it prevents mathematics from being affected by Russell\u2019s Paradox, which is concerned with self-referencing leading to nonsense. Take as an example a French village, in which Jacques the barber shaves a man if and only if he doesn\u2019t shave himself. Jacques can neither shave himself nor refrain from shaving himself. If seemingly valid mathematical statements can lead to logical contradictions, we cannot trust mathematics. The above approach avoids this because there is no means by which quanta can refer to themselves, either directly or indirectly. ",
