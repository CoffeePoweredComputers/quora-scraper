            "answer_text": "Q: Are we the most advanced form of life in the universe? Or are there other, far more superior life forms out there? No. We are not the most advanced form of life in the universe. The universe is infinite in age. And if I am wrong about that, then it is at least 13.8 billion years old per best current theory, and best current measurement:  Source: How Old is the Universe? Our particular galaxy, the Milky Way, is about 13.5 billion years old:  Source: Google Earth, on the other hand, is a relatively young planet in comparison. Less than 5 billion years old.  Source: Google And just a hop and a skip from Earth (in cosmic terms), and I mean, really, really close to Earth, (just 190 light years away, in an observable universe that is some 46 billion light years radius) is a star so old that estimates suggest it is older than the universe itself supposedly is. Methuselah Star:  Source: HD 140283 - Wikipedia  So, here is the thing. The shape of galaxies throughout the observable portion of the universe far as we can figure, follows a consistent pattern. Which would suggest that the laws of physics, the properties of existence, are consistent throughout. It is estimated there are between 1 and 2 trillion galaxies within the visible universe. And an average galaxy is estimated to have about 200 billion stars. If a field of some 300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, it would be fair to imagine some 2/3\u2019s of them are older than Earth. By all best estimates, life on Earth sprang forth relatively early in Earth\u2019s life. So elsewhere that life forms, it is fair to imagine that it will also spring forth rather quickly, where opportunity presents itself to do so. So of the 200,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars (2/3rds of the total that are older than Earth), which are likely, and arguably a garden of life, doesn\u2019t it make sense to recognize that there will be some planets out there hosting life more advanced than humanity is??  BUT. The good news is, humanity may not be that far from \u201cpeak advancement\u201d. It might be that within a few years we will know and understand the nature of physical reality, exactly . We have put considerable effort into determining it. Also, we may be approaching the limit of what can be accomplished within the limitations of existence. Maybe within 5,000 or 500,000 years, we are finished advancing technologically. (and in the grand scheme of things, 1/2 a million years is not much, not much at all). Don\u2019t expect life elsewhere to be magical, and superhuman. There are very few forms and feature possible, for them to have. Perhaps eyes that see better at night than ours. Perhaps they have sonar like bats and dolphins. Gills allowing breathing on land and in sea?? There are some possibilities. But the possibilities are limited. They will not be moving things with their minds. That is just not possible. They will not be able to make themselves invisible. (disguise themselves the way some octopii can is not out of the question). They will not be able to levitate without technological assistance, nor jump through time. What is, then more advanced??  One would hope they have grown out of the age of belief in fairy tales. Perhaps they have grown past physical aggression and war. Perhaps they have starships and are a multi-stellar race (though there are no \u201cshortcuts\u201d in space travel, so they won\u2019t be bee-bopping through the cosmos like in our science fiction). Bet they will have great comedy. lol. And medicinal advancements, who knows. Maybe they have defeated illness and aging. We might, eventually. Hard to say. We will find out though, for ourselves. It will just take some more time. ",

            "answer_text": "A human being can be the best and the most perfect creature. As far as our knowledge permits, we recognise, comprehend and identify these beings according to given norms. If we compare man to any form of matter or living things such as plants and animals and so on, we will immediately draw an important conclusion that human beings are better, more intelligent and perfect. If man can cultivate a field and make use of the produce for his own and others' benefit, capture animals, make use of them and extract natural resources for upgrading his life and that of the society, naturally, we definitely come to this result that man is a higher being. For instance, an elephant is much bigger than a human, but man trains it and controls it to do some work for him. Thanks to his talents, physical abilities, mental powers, and the indomitable spirit that Almighty Allah has bestowed upon man, his life has adjusted according to the needs of his time and place. For example, the way of life today is completely different from that of the ancient ages. Again, when we compare the ancient way of life with that of life in the stone age, you will see that man has always been after improvement. The change of the mode of life can be studied in context with that particular age of man. However, this is not the case with the animals. All the animals have followed the same pattern of survival for centuries. The environment may have modelled their pattern of survival but they have never been the masters of the environment. Many animal species have become extinct due to environmental changes. Human beings have shown their capability to survive by modifying their environment to fit their needs. Consequently, we can say that man is more perfect than animals. Would it be wrong to conclude that man is the best creature? We can say yes, and we can argue for it in some ways, but we should be careful! When we give an affirmation of our status, it does not mean that every human being is better than every other creature! Are human beings better than the angels? We do not want to speak about one person. Yes, the Prophet of Islam (S) and Imam \u2018Ali (a.s.) are better than any angels. That is clear. But can we make a generalisation that a new-born child is better than an angel? It is difficult to say because the actual perfection that a child has is not sufficient to answer this question, but we can argue for the idea in other ways. According to a verse from the Glorious Qur'an we can deduce that man is very important and precious. \u201cThen we made the life-germ a clot, then we made the clot a lump off lesh, then we made (in) the lump of flesh bones, then we clothed the bones with flesh, then we caused it to grow into another creation, so blessed be Allah, the best of the creators.\u201d (23:14) This verse explains different stages of creation that a human being goes through. After the body achieves its perfection, Allah, the Most Glorious, gives him another creation. What it means here is that Allah, the Creator, bestows souls into the body. This is the final phase of creation. On the first day the embryo has no spirit, then after some months, Allah the Glorious breathes life into the foetus. So we can realise why Allah the Almighty has emphasised the stage of creation of the spirit by saying 'another creation' which means that the spirit is not an ordinary thing of the material world. The spirit belongs to another heavenly universe. When people were asking the Prophet (S) about the spirit and its nature, the following verse was revealed. The answer was that the spirit is from the command of Allah(1) or that it belongs to the abstract world (according to different interpretation, but the result does not change). \u201cAnd they ask you about the spirit. Say: The spirit is from the command of my Lord, and you are not given ought of knowledge but a little.\u201d (17:85) Notice that in the last part of the verse (23:14) Allah, the Almighty, says: \u201cBlessed be Allah who is the best of the creators\u201d. According to this verse of Scripture, we can now conclude that man is the best creature. Because it is the best Creator who can create the best creature. To understand this point more perfectly , we should take note of the following verse: \u201cAnd surely we have honoured the children of Adam, and carried them on the land and at the sea, and provided them with good things, and we have made them to excel by an appropriate excellence over many of those we created.\u201d (17:70) Since Almighty Allah has honoured man with the highest position on the earth and has bestowed upon him the highest respect, the Creator provided man with the means to excel many but not all of His other creatures. What this sentence really implies is that there may be some creatures superior to man, otherwise Allah would have pronounced thus: We have made them to excel over all of our creatures. Now the question arises whether man can be considered the best creature. Man can rise to the rank of supremacy if he makes use of his God-given possibilities. Man progresses on the ladders to supremacy according to his possibilities. These God-given possibilities are the natural or Divine gifts (talents) innate in every being. These talents are of two kinds: actualities and capacities (potentialities) for further perfection. Our corporeal body, being the first dimension, is, to some extent actualised at the time of our birth. But it is not the case with our soul which is the other dimension. Every individual is capable of reaching the highest level of perfection; they can be vicegerents of Allah; they can be the real servants of Allah. These capacities or potentialities, (although dormant at the time of birth) excel in quality compared to every other creature. Natural gifts do not make us better than other creatures at birth. However, when we opt for the right path to develop our God-given talents and begin to fully make use of the potentialities bestowed upon us, we start climbing the ladders to supremacy. The more constructively we make use of those potentialities, the better we become compared to other creatures. We can ascend to the ranks that no angel has reached. And if man takes a wrong path and begins making use of the God-given talents in a wrong direction, man can descend to the murkiest level where no animal has fallen! We can conclude that at the time of birth, because of our innocence and purity we may excel many creatures, but there are some creatures like angels who are better than us at that particular stage. Yes, human beings are equipped with the best talents and are made in a manner that can reach the highest levels possible for a creature. So Allah's power and wisdom is best manifested in human beings. That is the reason that Allah says: \u201cBlessed be Allah, the best of the creators.\u201d Now let's return to the Glorious Qur'an to see the values of human beings. We will give a list of attributes beginning with the good attributes of humans and then the bad attributes. There are many verses and it is not possible to mention them all. The Vices Attributed to Human Beings We can describe man in two different ways. We can view man in general terms as masses or speak about some individuals. When we say an individual is good or bad, it does not imply that all are bad or good. It does not mean that the same qualities can be attributed to all human beings. If an individual happens to possess an undesirable quality, that stain can be cleansed through strengthening his faith. Here we want to mention some undesirable attributes of human beings mentioned in the Glorious Qur'an URL The Status of Human Beings in the Glorious Qur'an ",

He posed a question to fellow physicists: \u201cWhere are they?\u201d He was referring to intelligent life on other planets elsewhere in the universe. It \u201conly\u201d took 400 million years between our planet coalescing and the first forms of life to originate. Four billion years of evolution produced human beings. It is likely that the same process would occur throughout the universe. But we have no hard evidence that we have been visited by aliens and no indication of their radio transmissions. My theory is that other forms of intelligent life did occur on other planets. But when they reached the stage when they produced nuclear weapons, inter-religious hatreds caused a massive war within a century or so that exterminated all life on their planet(s). Thus the time interval between developing radio and exterminating themselves may typically last only a century: a minuscule fraction of the life span of their species. Thus it would be very improbable that we could detect their radio transmissions. Intelligent life elsewhere either hasn\u2019t developed radio yet or has already exterminated themselves via a religious war. ",

In \u201cThe Eerie Silence\u201d Paul Davies, chair of SETI, relates a pretty convincing argument, concluding (with no small disappointment) probably not. Essentially he points out that because of the way the probability works. Either life should be either very common or very uncommon. We are pretty sure it\u2019s not very common. So it\u2019s probably very uncommon, so uncommon that a given universe would probably not have life. And because of the anthropic principle, we must be in a universe with some life, us. So we are probably alone, at least for now. Note that this argument really only holds for space age intelligence. It says nothing of things like unicellular life or dolphins, etc. Though I personally suspect that abiogenesis is probably the most unlikely step in the formation of intelligent life, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the universe was virtually sterile.
