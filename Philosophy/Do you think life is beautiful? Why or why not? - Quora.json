Ever noticed that why you have been choosen to be there in this beautiful world? Life is very beautiful within all aspects of culture, all aspects of love, all aspects of moments, all aspects of knowledge, all aspects of exploring everything. We should make use of the opportunites come across, as it is said before Opportunity knocks the door only once! Life is here to get fame and be well known. Life is to make others happy and get double joy out of it, yeah it makes life beautiful Now, you may think that your life is beautiful, no doubt but what of others who lack behind in everything, they lack in look, they lack in richness, they lack in figure, they lack in fame. But I wanna mention that whatever the condition may, karma let do his work and we shouldn't forget that there's some intention behind everything which happens all around. Many famous super stars are from financially backward class, but still their outmost efforts bring them up! Not every star is poor but there are many celebraties who have a famous background! Hence life isn't only to work for others but the chance to get up and tell the world that now I've born, let what the circumstances be I am here to change the History, to change the world, to change the records from the books! Life is a famous game, not to be played but a reality to be experienced! Thanks for reading! Edits are appreciatively welcomed! ",

            "answer_text": "A sweet short story with a great lesson.Worth Reading! A building construction work was going on. Lots of poor labourers were working there and their small children used to hold onto one another's shirt and play \"train-train\".Someone would become the engine and others would become bogies. Every day these children used to take turns becoming the engine and bogies.But there was one small boy wearing only a half pant who used to hold one small green cloth in his hand and become the guard daily. So the person who was observing them went to him and asked him Son, don't you also wish to become an engine or a bogie some time ? He softly replied .. Sir , I don't have a shirt to wear so how will the other children catch me to make the train? That person could see the slight wetness in his eyes. But he learnt a lesson on that day that the boy could have cried and sat at home and abused his parents for not affording to buy him a shirt. But instead he chose another way to play and enjoy himself. In life, we don't get all things we desire and we keep complaining . I dont have a bike, I don't have car , I don't have this or that etc... Life is like that.We need to make it beautiful and be grateful for what we have.Have an attitude of gratitude.  Life may not always be easy. It may not always be comfortable and joyful. But it always manages to surprise us and to provide us with exciting opportunities for growth.There are so many wonderful and awe-inspiring aspects of life that it would be difficult to list them all. Just think about the magnificent view of the sunrise and sunset. Or think about the marvelous times you\u2019ve had spending the evening in nature and watching the stars. Life is full of beauty. Notice it. Notice the bumble bee, the small child, and the smiling faces. Smell the rain, and feel the wind. Live your life to the fullest potential, and fight for your dreams. -Ashley Smith Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Be grateful. Thanks for reading! ",

We are camping in RV, something we\u2019ve never done before. We put the water in the wrong water hole and our toilet started overflowing with poop. After we cleaned it up, we sat around the campfire. Our son roasting marshmallows while we laughed big hearty laughs that wouldn\u2019t stop. Covid-19 shut us all up in our houses. Every time I hung up the phone I said, \u201c\u201cI love you\u201d to a friend or family member on the other end. I think life is beautiful; but it is most beautiful when you are able to see the snippets of joy, beauty and love through difficult times. It\u2019s very much like the rainbow. A burst of sunshine and color through grey clouds. ",

But they usually have thorns, this may be a defense for the rose to protect from scavengers attracted to its smell. So, pardon the cliche analogy but life is in a lot of ways like the rose. Lie is indescribably beautiful with infinite riches unfolding, but the condition of that beauty brings with it the other side of the coin. The other side of the coin includes harsh, brutal, ugly parts of life much like the rose\u2019s thorns that can make one bleed.  Does the ugly, brutal side of life take away from the side of life where there are unbounded beauty and goodness and where infinite riches are unfolding each second? Not necessarily. Billions throughout the ages might testify from different angles about how tapping into life\u2019s beauty, goodness and riches helped them get through the worst.

            "answer_text": "\u201cDo you think life is beautiful? Why?\u201d Life indeed is beautiful! It teaches us so much. Not only about others, but about ourselves. It teaches us that all things repeat themselves over and over, until we learn the value, the meaning in them. Once we have learned, we go on to the next \u201clesson\u201d Sometimes our path, our journey meshes with someone else\u2019s and we get lucky, we have a \u201cguide\u201d a partner along the way. Other times, we must travel alone. Sometimes, we are the teacher, it is our (do I say, destiny) to share what we have learned with others, and help them along their path. It wasn't until recently that I discovered this. That I was ready and willing to share. I would have been too shy to do so before. There is a difference in karma and dharma. Karma being what the world gives to us or what we find. Dharma is our gifts back to the world. It took me a long time to see. Embrace others, appreciate and live in the moment. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes-in some way. It could be an inner beauty of soul or purpose. Certainly Mother Theresa was not beautiful in any conventional sense of beauty, but she was beautiful in her selfless service to the lepers and poor of India. Mahatma Ghandi was a skinny, bald headed guy who was bug eyed and worn glasses-hardly handsome in any way. Yet he led millions on the path of non-violent resistance and won independence for his country. Nelson Mandela was a tall, lanky man with skin tags on a blotched face. He spent many years in prison-and came out to lead his countrymen to conquer apartheid in South Africa.  Beauty is far more that an unblemished face or a body that a society deems 'perfect'. Those are pretty-merely pretty. Pretty fades like a summer flower. Beauty lasts-sometimes for centuries. I'll take the glorious art of da Vinci over the pages of People magazine or the catwalks of Vogue any day. ",

They develop a hatred towards it and settle where they are. Only a handfew choose to ignore it and climb it towards the beautiful peatals. You are the ultimate reason why life is beautiful. You are alive. You have food, shelter and clothing. What else does one need to be happy. Wear a smile and you are beautiful. Happiness that life give you is why it makes it beautiful.
