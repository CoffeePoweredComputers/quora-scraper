            "answer_text": "Your question sounds to me like an honest plea for assistance to help you find the exit from our physical limitations, an exit other than death. Spacetime is a word that refers to a mathematical construct in the field equations of general relativity; we are not in spacetime; we are in reality which consists of overlapping gravitational and electromagnetic fields. Spacetime is often (mistakenly) used as a proxy for energy fields. We cannot escape the energy fields of reality; we are made of those fields, we belong to those fields, they \u201cown\u201d us. There is no escape from the fields, fields are us. But there is an escape from the ignorance of what we are - energy fields - which is the technique of extricating our attention from the energy field called the thought stream where we spend the vast majority of our waking lives, and focus that attention (itself a field) on the energy field of the living body. When the attention field is focused on the body field (the whole field and via sensation, not some image in our minds) then we have escaped the confines of the field of thoughts and images, and if you succeed, you will be gratified by this maneuver. Of course, it requires a sustained focus - not just a brief glimpse - to form conscious memories of the experience of the attention focused on the energy field of the body. One sign you are focused properly is the vivid impression of the downward pull of the Earth\u2019s gravitational field on the mass of the body, and if you\u2019re really sensitive, on the electrical power in the muscles that resist this downward pull, enabling our bodies to remain fully vertical. It\u2019s quite an impression, and if you like science (you mention spacetime so it appears you do) then you may appreciate the fact that this act of paying attention to the sensation of the whole body brings you directly in conscious contact with two of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism and gravity.

            "answer_text": "No ! It is not ! If you could do that you would have to be able to exist inside a different undefined set of dimensions not related to our space-time, therefore not inside our universe !! Sure you could move from one spacetime locale to another within our universe, even through a wormhole (Einstein-Rosen bridge) if you knew how to do that without getting destroyed in the process due to unknown eventualities, and appear and disappear switching between hugely distant areas of our spacetime field which harbors everything we know about, but it is not exiting spacetime still !! We would simply cease to exist in all likelihood if that were to occur\u2026 In a hypothetical situation if it was possible to enter a different universe guided by a different set of rules, then law of conservation of energy would not likely be there for beings or objects from another universe to stay as they are, and sudden cessation of existence could occur\u2026 But from all that we know, and can surmise such things are not possible\u2026 Kaiser T, MD.
