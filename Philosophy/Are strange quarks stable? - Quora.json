            "answer_text": "Strange quarks are heavier than the light up and down quarks (about 100 MeV/c^2) and for this reason decay via a weak interaction to an up quark . Strange quark - Wikipedia There are some speculations concerning their stability when in the core of a neutron star which is related to the Pauli exclusion principle limiting energy levels available for the light quarks. Strange matter - Wikipedia It was also hypothesized that chunks of strange matter called stranglets could exist but it was never confirmed experimentally. Strangelet - Wikipedia Contribution of strange quarks to diffferent high energy phenomena is one of the research topics of the high energy physics. Just now a conference dedicated to strangeness in quark matter is held in Bari (Italy) - SQM2019 . Strangeness in Quark Matter 2019 ",

            "answer_text": "Strange quarks do not exist by themselves but are components of mesons and baryons. That having been said, the strange quarks inside mesons and baryons do decay, weakly, with lifetimes of order 10^(-10) seconds or so - which is quickly by everyday standards but long enough for strange baryons and mesons to have observed macroscopic pathlengths and are thus (compared with many baryons and mesons) rather stable.

Only four leptons (and their antiparticles) are required to construct the entire universe. They are: up and down quarks and electron and electron neutrinos. ",
