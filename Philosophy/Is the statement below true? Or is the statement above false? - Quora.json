The preceding statement is false.\u201d Neither statement has any truth value at all. That\u2019s because neither statement refers to any external state or condition, with which it could be compared and judged either true (if it accords with reality), or false (if it does not). Each statement refers only to a string of words that refers to nothing. A nested recursion does not give anything from which we could judge truth, let alone falsity. ",
