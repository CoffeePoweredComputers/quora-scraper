            "answer_text": "No, because free will and moral responsibility are not metaphysical questions. If indeterminism were true, all your actions and decisions would be random and purposeless, and your mind would be too incoherent to be a \u201cmind\u201d in the first place. Free will is just a shorthand for human agency, exercised without undue coercion or pressure. It\u2019s a description of what people do, not a metaphysic. So the question is a Philosophy 101 category error. ",

            "answer_text": "Free will? Depends how you see it. Responsibility? No. Even if, like me, you consider human brains to be like computers with personalities as programs, you can still see the purpose in improving those programs and culling the most destructive units. And the fact that you couldn't change the inputs does not mean that you aren't responsible for the way you process those signals and generate output. If the power goes out and it turns out the transformer (trash can looking thing on the pole) blew, the transformer is responsible for the power going out and it gets replaced. Some blame may also go to those who designed and installed the transformer, but that doesn't change that the transformer is ultimately what failed. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I am among those, like Robert Kane, Isaiah Berlin, Karl Popper, and William James, who believe both the following propositions: as a matter of fact human actions are not fully determined, because nothing is fully determined \u2014 even the most ironclad laws of nature may prove to be probabilistic in time andwe should he grateful that this is so, for intuitively appealing ideas of free will and moral responsibility are incompatible with any thorough determinism.This is the in-in view (both incompatibilist and indeterminist). For further discussion, I would refer you to the pertinent works of the four authors I just named. Begin with this one: Isaiah Berlin - Historical Inevitability ",
