            "answer_text": "Doesn\u2019t seem like it from here. My life has more of a point since I admitted to myself that I\u2019m an atheist. It took me a long time to realize that when I was religious, I wasn\u2019t living for life; I was living for death. Life, I was taught, is nothing but trial after trial, tribulation after tribulation. It\u2019s full of sickness and death and everyone is evil inside but saved if they but believe. And what did \u2018saved\u2019 mean? It meant that after this horrid life, something nice would happen \u2014 after I die. So everything I did was for that moment after death, that undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns (sorry). I was very literally living for death. \u2018Pleasure\u2019, after all, was a sinful thing, so any pleasure that I took other than in specifically religious things (as long as they were of the religion I was following) was itself wrong. Now, however, I am living for life. It\u2019s all I have, so I better make it count as best I can. And making it count includes being a part of solutions to problems we have, even if those solutions only see completion long after I\u2019m dead. The people around me - they, too, only have their lives, so I have to respect those more. And I can choose justice and truth and morality as my guiding principles, and I can change my mind about what\u2019s right and wrong when evidence is presented that I was wrong. Thus, not only is it imperative that I enjoy life as it presents itself to me, but that I must struggle for a better world, for justice. I wouldn\u2019t want it any different. I am a much better person now than I ever could have been when I was a believer. ",

            "answer_text": "A2A I think you will get a lot of biased answers, so I don\u2019t think anyone can answer the question for you. However, for myself, with no God, life would be pointless. You can find excuses to further humanity as a race, you can make the world into a utopia, you can rid the world of war and create peace across nations, but in the end, aside from humanity continuing, it would really be pointless. Yes, as a typical Christian, I would like to point you to some verses. But really, try to consider them, even if apart from the Christian faith. Ecclesiastes 1: All Is Vanity 1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 2 Vanity of vanities, says the Preacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity.3 What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?4 A generation goes, and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.5 The sun rises, and the sun goes down, and hastens to the place where it rises.6 The wind blows to the south and goes around to the north;around and around goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns.7 All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full;to the place where the streams flow, there they flow again.8 All things are full of weariness; a man cannot utter it;the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.9 What has been is what will be, and what has been done is what will be done, and there is nothing new under the sun.10 Is there a thing of which it is said, \u201cSee, this is new\u201d?It has been already in the ages before us.11 There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be any remembranceof later things yet to be among those who come after. The Vanity of Wisdom 12 I the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 13 And I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven. It is an unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with. 14 I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and a striving after wind. 15 What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted. 16 I said in my heart, \u201cI have acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.\u201d 17 And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind. 18 For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow. Chapter 2 The Vanity of Self-Indulgence 2 I said in my heart, \u201cCome now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.\u201d But behold, this also was vanity. 2 I said of laughter, \u201cIt is mad,\u201d and of pleasure, \u201cWhat use is it?\u201d 3 I searched with my heart how to cheer my body with wine\u2014my heart still guiding me with wisdom\u2014and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life. 4 I made great works. I built houses and planted vineyards for myself. 5 I made myself gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees. 6 I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees. 7 I bought male and female slaves, and had slaves who were born in my house. I had also great possessions of herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem. 8 I also gathered for myself silver and gold and the treasure of kings and provinces. I got singers, both men and women, and many concubines, the delight of the sons of man. 9 So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me. 10 And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my reward for all my toil. 11 Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun. The Vanity of Living Wisely 12 So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only what has already been done. 13 Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness. 14 The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the same event happens to all of them. 15 Then I said in my heart, \u201cWhat happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?\u201d And I said in my heart that this also is vanity. 16 For of the wise as of the fool there is no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How the wise dies just like the fool! 17 So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for all is vanity and a striving after wind. The Vanity of Toil 18 I hated all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the man who will come after me, 19 and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity. 20 So I turned about and gave my heart up to despair over all the toil of my labors under the sun, 21 because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil. 22 What has a man from all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun? 23 For all his days are full of sorrow, and his work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity. 24 There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God, 25 for apart from him who can eat or who can have enjoyment? 26 For to the one who pleases him God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given the business of gathering and collecting, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.  If you\u2019re interested, please, read the rest of Ecclesiastes - it has a lot of thought-provoking ideas. ",
