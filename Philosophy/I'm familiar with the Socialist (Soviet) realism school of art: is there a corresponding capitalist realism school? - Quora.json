            "answer_text": "There was actually a Capitalist Realism school founded in 1963 in Berlin - during the Cold War. Gerhard Richter was one of the founders. From The Art Story: Though a relatively short-lived movement, Capitalist Realism took a darker, more ironic stance than most of the Pop Art that spread across Western countries at the height of the Cold War. Started in D\u00fcsseldorf among a group of art students, including Gerhard Richter and Sigmar Polke, the Capital Realists shared a critical stance toward the invasion of American capitalism and consumerism into West Germany. A play on Social Realism and capitalism, Capitalist Realism used various styles and media to create imagery that called into question middle-class values and aspirations and that hoped to remind Germany of its not-so-distant traumatic past that the artists felt was being too easily repressed and papered over. But I think what you might be after is Futurism. From Wikipedia: Futurism was an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It emphasised speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. Its key figures were the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carr\u00e0, Fortunato Depero, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo. Alfredo Ambrosias, note the image of Mussolini over the landscape.  Though Fascism and capitalism don\u2019t always have a clear cut relationship, fascism did support the private sector, private property rights, the market economy and the existence of the filthy rich. Stylistically, Depression Era Art corresponds to Socialist Realism in the West. From The National Gallery of Art: \u2018Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was elected president in a landslide in 1933 with campaign promises to fix the economy. Roosevelt acted quickly to create jobs and stimulate the economy through the creation of what he called \u201ca New Deal for the forgotten man\u201d\u2014a program for people without resources to support themselves or their families. The New Deal was formalized as the federal Works Progress Administration (WPA), an umbrella agency for the many programs created to help Americans during the Depression, including infrastructure projects, jobs programs, and social services. Through the WPA, artists also participated in government employment programs in every state and county in the nation. In 1935, Roosevelt created the Federal Art Project (FAP) as the agency that would administer artist employment projects, federal art commissions, and community art centers. Roosevelt saw the arts and access to them as fundamental to American life and democracy. He believed the arts fostered resilience and pride in American culture and history. The art created under the WPA offers a unique snapshot of the country, its people, and art practices of the period. There were no government-mandated requirements about the subject of the art or its style. The expectation was that the art would relate to the times, reflect the place in which it was created, and be accessible to a broad public.\u2019  Thomas Hart Benton  George Biddle  Seymour Fogel, a student of Diego Rivera As you can see, it hardly glorifies capitalism. read more: The Progressive Spirit of Italian Futurism | Widewalls ",

            "answer_text": "The larger portion of American commercial art and illustration work is realist. It doesn\u2019t necessarily promote the same themes as socialist realism, but the technique of selling an idea by depicting people as being happy with it is the same.    Everything looks like what it is. There is very little abstraction or deep symbolism at work. ",
