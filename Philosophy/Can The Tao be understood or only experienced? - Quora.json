            "answer_text": "The Tao can be understood and experienced. And we can understand and experience the Tao through various kinds of activities, which include but are not limited to meditation, contemplation, observation, reading, thinking, working, playing, and behaving. These activities can be mutually reinforcing and confirm one another in terms of understanding and experiencing the Tao. That is why the Tao Te Ching not only tells us what is the Tao, how it works, why we should follow it, but also inform us how to know it and how to follow it in our self-cultivation practices and social activities. For example, chapter one not only tells us what is the Tao (Being and Non-Being), how it works (Being and Non-Being transform into each other constantly and form the gateways to guide beings to be born and to return), but also tells us how to experience it directly (by following the guidance of Being and Non-Being and observing how they work together): The Tao is teachable, yet understanding my words is not the same as following the Tao. The guidance is describable, yet knowing the description is not the same as following the guidance. Non-Being guides to the origin of Heaven and Earth. Being guides to the mother of all particular things. Thus, through the guidance of Non-Being, you can observe the beginning; through the guidance of Being, you can observe the returning. Non-Being and Being come out concurrently, but point to different directions; both together can be called the mysterious transforming power. They constantly transform into each other, and form the gateways for all wonderful things. . And chapter thirty-Seven not only tells us how the Tao works (wu wei \u7121\u70ba and ziran \u81ea\u7136) and why we should follow it (wu wei er wu bu wei \u7121\u70ba\u800c\u7121\u4e0d\u70ba), but also tells us how to be a great leader (by following Tao\u2019s way of action): The Tao never coerces anyone to do anything, yet nothing is left undone. If lords or kings could realize this, the people would develop spontaneously. When the desires are about to explode during development, we shall let Non-Being guide us back to the state of simplicity. Following the guidance of Non-Being, there will be no greed. Without greed there is tranquility. Hence the world will settle into peace naturally. . This answer is based on the translations and explanations of the following book: Tao Te Ching: The New English Version That Makes Good Sense ",

            "answer_text": "Allthough I am a novice in Daoism, let me tell you what I believe: I think it can be both understood and experienced, but understood and experienced in a different way. We cannot understand it in the same way we understand something in our common sense. Understanding implies recognising causal factors, how something is caused, what comes first and what follows. Recognize similarities and differences, and so on. Dao contains all causes and all results, it is before everything but seems it is following everything. It works by reversion as Lao Zi wrote. It is understood when it is not understood. \u201cThe name that can be named, is not the real name\u201d. Can it be sensed? Maybe everything we sense is a glimpse of Dao. But everything we not sense must be equally part of Dao. Since what we sense is a small fraction of what there is\u2026 not sensing brings us closer to Dao. ",

            "answer_text": "The Tao (I prefer Dao, sounds more accurate compared to real pronunciation) can be understood as a standard of benevolence at the highest degree in the universe. The Tao can be understood, but not through reading books regarding this field. In order to understand Tao, the only way is to go according to the way of it. It is the experience that you gained that is hard to explain to people. For example, a billionaire wears only a casual t shirt and shorts to attend events. Its about putting yourself to the lowest even though you are extraordinary, its about doing charity that do not get you fame, its about heping people and do not want any return, its about staying as humble and low as possible, its about sheltering people by sacrificing yourself. If you can do this, the experience you gained shall fill your soul, you no longer need anything to excite your life. This is Tao. The blissful experience you get is hard for people to understand. ",

The tao exists with or without our perception, affirmation or negation of it. Separated mentally from it, we call it the tao or the way, and when reunited there is no need to identify it. The way to be at one with the tao can be known, but the tao itself can only be experienced. The way for the mind to be one again with the tao is not difficult. Only our lack of desire for the truth concerning the cause of human suffering and conflict and how to eliminate that cause from the mind, keeps us from it. ",
