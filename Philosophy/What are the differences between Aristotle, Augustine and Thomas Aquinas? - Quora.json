            "answer_text": "St. Augustine (354-430 CE) and Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) were two of the most influential philosophers in Western history. St. Augustine's theories revolved around the concept of two cities: the Earthly City, defined by earthly desires and actions, and the City of God, defined by spiritual pursuits. As he speaks to the philosophers of his times, Augustine reasons in Platonic terms. But he really pokes a hole in the Platonic balloon. Aquinas, however, incorporates Aristotelianism into the Christian faith. Aquinas lived in an orderly universe, because he believed in \"natural law\" and the celestial spheres. It\u2019s typically held that Augustine based his philosophy and theology on the teaching of Plato. Aquinas, by contrast, is said to have based his teachings on the thought of Aristotle. Did that put them in conflict? Well, actually poor St. Augustine didn\u2019t have really any knowledge of Aristotelian works. When the libraries of Alexandria burned down, essentially these works either were burned or lost. The present versions of Aristotle\u2019s works that we have, are really like class notes, very, very well-done class notes of his lectures, After the original works of Aristotle were lost, the class notes of the students of Aristotle, were still around, and of course Aristotle had edited some of them. So these works were kind of in the Middle East, and they were well-known but they were not known in Europe, and of course Saint Augustine knew the works of Plato. So when St. Thomas Aquinas comes along, this guy who is really a remarkable intellect, but also a remarkable memory, he is literally absorbing the entire Platonic tradition, the Neoplatonic tradition from St. Augustine and Boethius, all the Neoplatonists. And he\u2019s also absorbing the whole Aristotelian tradition, because of course it had come up from the Middle East, via the Crusaders, up into Thomas Aquinas\u2019 Paris, and of course he is able to comment on the works of Aristotle and of course he is the one who does the great synthesis, the great blending of both the Platonic and Aristotelian traditions, though the Aristotelian tradition, being an empirically-grounded one, is the one that is dominant in St. Thomas. So he doesn\u2019t ignore the Platonic one, but he is more grounded in the Aristotelian one. He\u2019s not simply an Aristotelian. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a common saying that Augustine \u201cbaptized\u201d Plato while Aquinas \u201cbaptized\u201d the philosophy of Aristotle. That isnt entirely accurate but there is a certain truth. This is a long topic. Here is a simple one: Thomistic philosophy gave emphasis to the goodness in created materiality and so took the middle path in viewing the body and rational soul as one complete being in man which is very Aristotelian. Augustine had his own pessimism on the body much like Plato did and probably due to his own sinful experiences. Augustine therefore focused on the need for grace bec man alone cant be good w/o it. Thomas tried to balance both by taking Augustinian theology with Aristotelian and Platonic thought that although man is in need of grace, we ought not to forget that materiality is also part of our being and is sacredly assumed by God in Jesus Christ when He took on human nature. That is just one of their differences and sinilarities at least in the simplest I could think of. ",
