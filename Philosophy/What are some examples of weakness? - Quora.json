There are physical and psychological and spiritual and moral weaknesses, to mention a few.\u201dThe most excellent jihad is that for the conquest of oneself.\u201d \u2014Muhammad said that.As you win freedom from your lower self, your higher self emerges. We are like little gods, you and I, and the test of courage is to work toward that higher self.When we are young, the ego works beside us, helping us establish a good place to stand for achieving adulthood. At some point you must renounce the ego. The ego will try to convince you that such an act is suicide. That you will die. When it all comes to a head, your must renounce all earthly things and live for the betterment of all. If you fail at that point, ego will lead your life and doom you to destruction. If you overcome ego at that point, the Angel of your Higher Self will guide you to help the community of souls around you.You will no longer fear Death. You will know Peace beyond understanding.I am not a Muslim, Catholic, Voodoon, Pagan or whatever. I just know what I have seen.~**Surrendering to impulse is a leading sign of weakness. Often a second or two of thought will reveal that many impulses are counter-productive or increase danger instead of reducing it. Anger, for instance, practically ALWAYS reduces our time for creative options to \u2014 for instance \u2014 kicking the door in because we\u2019ve forgotten our keys (I\u2019ve done it). Some impulses are useful and may be life savers, but most are a sign that the person who yields has not yet conquered him or herself. ",

            "answer_text": "I was watching a Raptors/Cavs basketball game last night. My newest gripe is: when a bunch of folks all do what \u201ceverybody\u2019s doing\u201d, it\u2019s an embarrassing display of weakness. On the Raptors team, and among millions of young Black men right now, it has been decided that the current \u2018look\u2019 is to wear your hair in a lumpy fro with the sides trimmed down. Weak people toe the line; weak people are quick to obey. So I saw a whole bunch of guys, all with obediently matching haircuts, and it stank of \u2018weak\u2019. It reminds me too much of when I was a teenager and used to see schoolgirls smoking. They\u2019d all be wearing the same style clothes and have matching hairstyles, and when they were out, they\u2019d decide to \u2018smoke\u2019. They\u2019d all stop, pass around cigarettes, stand together and pretend to enjoy smoking, hoping that people were seeing them. Watching a bunch of grown men faithfully wearing matching haircuts that are cool right now, feels just like that. An African male is supposed to be the exemplar of strength, grace, creativity and manhood. So in these wayward times, seeing an exhibit of Black men parading around openly declaring their weakness and unquestioning adherence to whatever the requisite \u2018look\u2019 is, is a special embarrassment. Seeing Black \u2018men\u2019 going about with pants obediently sagging, with underwear faithfully on display, like a bunch of spineless punks is, again, a singular embarrassment. Weakness. ",
