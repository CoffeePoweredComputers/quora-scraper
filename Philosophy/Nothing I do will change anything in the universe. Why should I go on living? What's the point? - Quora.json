            "answer_text": "Hi there, Your Life is very special, you must take Good care of yourself. 450 Billion years of Growth of this planet resulted in you, here, now, today. And then there\u2019s the fact that you are unique between some 7 Billion people on this planet\u2026 2 great reasons to say WoW, and to understand that you are special ! (How good is that.) I cannot know who has taught you \u201cthings\u201d that have led you to think the thoughts that you have at this point in your Life, but you coming here already means that you know that there\u2019s \u201csomething wrong\u201d with your mindset. And YES, it\u2019s easy to change, to do better. Your Life was never meant to be about sickness, you were born healthy, and your Natural-you only wants to be healthy and Grow, all cells in your body re-generate new on a daily basis based on the foods and drinks that you take in. Growth is just your purpose in Life that happens \u201con automatic\u201d. (But living peaceful-happy is the key, NOT in sickness or with other bad \u2018things\u2019, you don\u2019t want/need Badness, because only GOODness will make you enjoy, and Grow. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Today is YOUR day, a peaceful-happy day where you can LEARN from GOOD experiences that will make you grow to become your BEST you, so you are optimized while you are connecting with other people near you. That\u2019s the meaning of your Life, that\u2019s all and there\u2019s nothing more to it, no matter what other people may want you to believe/say or do. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - The feelings that you are having; the Problems, Stress or that feeling that you\u2019re \u201cjust not in the right place\u201d are signs > listen to your own inner self more: you got these illness-feelings that you\u2019re having, well, your inner you is warning you that you need CHANGE. You need to make BiG changes, and then you\u2019ll become your peaceful-happy self again, the one you were when you were a child, but then your today-you with a lot more experiences that you learnt from. Learn differently, you can \u201cstart new and re-freshed\u201d; start to use SIMPLICITY in your life, because everything will become clearer to you. Easily, and pretty Fast too. I can\u2019t possibly mention all factors that influence you every moment of every day, because your Life is too BiG. Some conscious and some subconscious \u2018stuffs\u2019 are good for you while others are not good. Things are unclear and troubled these days with too many influences from a.o. Media, Social stuff, Political and even Religious things. Everything is too much for you, and so you become dis-eased. Time for you to change your Mindset (your inner you) and your Perspective on Life (out there). Start by > recognizing the GOODness and \u2018Bad stuffs\u2019 around you, and then\u2026. separate everything into 2 columns: Good on the left column and Bad on the right side. Whatever comes to you > place it in the Good or Bad column. The Badness you do NOT want, and the GOODness; you need more of that/those. That\u2019s your start to avoid/block/eliminate/end/stop all the badness. More of the GOODness then can come to you. 2 NOTES: 1. Nature works slow to change and so do you, so give yourself a year or more to get to that moment in your Life where you have optimized all parts of your daily Life. Optimizing things for the rest of your Life is the way to go, but you\u2019ll get there later-on. First-things-first; make your slow start. 2. YOU are responsible for your Life, not other people. So be in control and do everything by yourself. It\u2019s all up to you, it\u2019s your learning Life. Once you optimized your GOODness and you block all the badness you can enjoy today and you will be Strong, Confident and empowered ! Conclusion: Stop to copy the lives of others, but instead find out what \u2018works\u2019 for you how YOU feel good, (and how YOU can grow and help others to grow). Follow the 85-15-principle that you\u2019ll find in my Quora Spaces page. (as of now, it\u2019s still \u201cunder construction\u201d by Quora [regretfully], but return here very soon, like after a few days, I hope, and then it will be available again.) Here is the right stuff for your mindset that you need: https://www.perspective-mindset.quora.com/ You\u2019ll come to that point in your Life where you see \u201cthe point\u201d, don\u2019t worry. But that can be at 85-years-of-age as a grandparent who\u2019s doing good for grandchild. Maybe you will have truthful understanding of your purpose then, until then: Experience - Learn - optimize your Life to become your BEST YOU. Grow your GOODness. ",

We have close-up pictures of every planet in our Solar System. We are still discovering the Wonders of the Ocean\u2019s Deep. Will we live to see full disclosure on the UFO mystery? Will we see the President of the U.S. standing at the podium in the White House introducing Zytar, the Ambassador from Andromeda ? Will we be \u201cdriving\u201d flying cars like George Jetson ? Will we see the cure for cancer discovered ? Maybe a more loving, peaceful World ? My friend, there are just sooo many mysteries waiting for us to find. Let\u2019s not miss out !! Peace. ",
