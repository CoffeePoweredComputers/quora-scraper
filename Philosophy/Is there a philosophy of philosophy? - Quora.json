            "answer_text": "Philosophy has always been strongly self-reflective, yes. Plato, for example, spends a great deal of his energy thinking about what it is that philosophers do, what makes a good philosopher, and what the role of philosophy should be in the context of the society. Over the history of Western philosophy there has been a general trend -- though there are plenty of exceptions to it, to be sure -- toward what we might call the esotericization of philosophy's self-image. That's in part just a fancy way of saying that philosophy has gradually come to limit its own bounds to a certain extent. The reasons for this are complex and multifaceted.  The Platonic view was essentially that philosophy was the noblest possible endeavor and the only path by which one could both arrive at true knowledge and approach divinity. For Plato, philosophy was actually sacrosanct and only a certain mettle of person was worthy to practice it.  Compare this with Wittgenstein's Tractatus from 1921, a youthful work of staggering genius in which the author methodically whittles philosophy down into a specialized language-game which can help to order and manage our concepts about the world, but can never approach the world itself apart from language, suggesting that all philosophy is fundamentally just a commentary on language (Wittgenstein later revised this position somewhat, but never totally abandoned it). In recent times there has been increased interest in philosophy about more clearly delimiting the realms of the rational and the irrational, as in the work of philosophers like Stephen Toulmin. One area of interest in this regard is the determination of what empirical, quantitative science is good at doing and what it isn't good at doing, and what the dangers might be of misusing it or of remaking in science's image a world that does not wholly conform to it -- a sort of philosophy of Pygmalion, if you will.

            "answer_text": "Yes. Metaphilosophy is another name for the philosophy of philosophy. Metaphilosophy (sometimes called the philosophy of philosophy) is \u2018the investigation of the nature of philosophy.\u2019[1]Its subject matter includes the aims of philosophy, the boundaries of philosophy, and its methods.[2][3] It is considered by some to be a subject apart from philosophy,[4] while others see it as automatically a part of philosophy,[5][6] and still others see it as a combination of these subjects.[2] The interest in metaphilosophy led to the establishment of the journal Metaphilosophy in January 1970.[7]http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphilosophy",
