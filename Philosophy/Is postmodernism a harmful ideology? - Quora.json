            "answer_text": "In postmodernism, ideas are \u201csocial constructs\u201d which competing pressure groups use to oppress one another and impose their power over one another. Postmodernists tend to believe that there is no actual reality, or that human concepts are unable to describe it, so everything is subjective, made up by the human mind. Postmodernism - Postmodernism and relativism As a consequence, if someone is trying to persuade you of some idea which you do not believe, or contradicts what you believe, that person is trying to oppress you, or is a representative of some oppressive group. To a postmodernist, whites have their own truth and logic, and blacks have theirs, and both are equally valid. Western civilization has science, and primitive witch doctors have their own science, which is also just as valid, even if they claim they can alter the weather through their primitive rituals.  The working class has their truth, and the rich capitalists have their ideas about free markets, laissez-faire, emergent order, and increased productivity providing people with continually improving prosperity, which are just their means to keep the working poor under control. To a postmodernist, all argumentation is just a mind game used in conflict between competing groups. As long as there are different groups, there will be conflict. The consequence is that there are just two ways to deal with conflict. You eliminate the differences which create these pressure groups, or you just periodically have the oppressors and oppressed switch places. The first way is exemplified by the Nazis or Soviets. Although their ideologies long preceded the postmodernists such as Derrida and Foucault, they agreed that logical arguments are weapons in class or race conflicts. The solution to conflict was to eliminate all but one class or race. Thus, the Soviets tried to eliminate the \u201cBourgeoisie\u201d and the Kulaks, while the Nazis tried to exterminate the Jews and other unwanted racial minorities. More gentle postmodernists simply try to eliminate different warring groups by bringing them together, trying to eliminate the distinctions which separate them. This requires social engineering and mental reconditioning to persuade people that there is no such thing as gender, or that there are no IQ differences between racial groups, or even within racial groups. The solution to eliminate conflict is to make everyone the same.   To achieve this, dissent cannot be tolerated. Any idea of objective truth or difference of opinion is a source of \u201coppression\u201d. Discourse is \u201coppression\u201d, but if everyone agrees, if everyone has the same ideas, there is no need for discourse. See the comments by postmodernist Chris Pierce below my answer. Others seem to want to perpetuate the conflict by having the oppressed and the oppressors switch places. No matter how much white people have paid in the past for slavery, no matter how hard many white people have worked to achieve equality under the law, more reparations are demanded. Either way, conflict cannot actually be eliminated. Postmodernism overturns the ideas of the Enlightenment, which say that there is an objective reality, that we can come to know it, and that if there is a conflict between two people, they should either settle it through persuasion, or go their separate ways. Under Enlightenment principles, people can live in peace so long as they do not use violence against one another. Toleration is possible, even necessary, to allow negotiation and discourse, and for people to live in peace when discourse does not settle their differences. Postmodernism makes such peaceful coexistence between men with different ideas impossible. Their different ideas are only their means to try to oppress one another. The only hope the oppressed have is to switch places with their oppressors, become the oppressors themselves. If I believed postmodernist nonsense, I would be a male chauvinist, white supremacist, homophobic, American fascist. Instead, I am a libertarian who believes that each individual should be judged on his own merits, that we should eliminate the initiation of coercive violence from society, that the state should be minimized, maybe eliminated altogether as an institution of coercion, and that we should celebrate our differences, living together in tolerance if not appreciation of our differences. But under postmodernism, that is impossible. In fact, a postmodernist would conclude that I actually AM a male chauvinist, white supremacist, homophobic, American fascist. A postmodernist would conclude that my support for laissez-faire capitalism is just an ideology made up and accepted because I am some rich capitalist who loves oppressing the workers. The enlightenment (the \u201cmodern\u201d in postmodernism) has gives us the most prosperous society in history. It has brought us relative peace, reduced child mortality, prolonged life expectancies, and provided us with a vast amount of wealth and comfort.  Postmodernism would destroy all of that.  Postmodernism is what is behind the SJW phenomenon and the rise of Antifa.  These SJWs cannot tolerate dissent. They are uninterested in learning the ideas of people they oppose. They aren\u2019t interested in finding out if someone they don\u2019t like has a valid point to make, or facts to back them up. They don\u2019t care. They see your attempts to engage them with fact and logic as an attempt to oppress them, so their only possible response is to try to oppress you right back. Freedom of speech is seen as just an excuse to defend oppressive ideas. The only solution they have is violence.  So, yeah. Postmodernism is harmful to society. It rips society apart into warring factions and destroys any means by which peaceful coexistence can be achieved. ",

            "answer_text": "Postmodernism is not a harmful ideology. Why? Because postmodernism is not an ideology. If the concept of ideology means anything at all, it refers to a program or system of thought that addresses itself not only to a specially trained elite (as in the case of \u201cscholastic\u201d philosophy), nor to a literate middle-class readership (the popular philosophy of the Enlightenment), but to all of society, providing a general framework, applicable to all, for how to live. Ideology, in this way, demands complex processes by which \u201cesoteric\u201d philosophical or scientific ideas are translated into forms that make them accessible even to an illiterate or (with universal literacy) semi-literate audience. Esoteric ideas get translated into popular political movements, educational programs reaching down to the lowest levels, and also coercive state violence. In this sense, moreover, ideology is the telos of philosophy \u2014 or, indeed, we could speak of a kind of entropy in the realm of ideas. It is almost unnatural for a powerful idea to remain constrained to a small segment of the population, even if this segment remains the only one who can understand it. But at the same time, philosophers, to the extent that they\u2019ve recognized the tendency of their ideas toward exoteric diffusion, have sought to \u201cinnoculate\u201d these ideas from within, not only by insisting on a distinction between genuine understanding and popular misunderstanding, but by insisting on the impossibility of genuine understanding ever taking a perfectly communicable form. (\u201cThe Dao that can be spoken is not the enduring Dao\u201d) In the Ancient world, the tendency of the development of ideology culminated in Christianity. Plato, who had already made a rather clumsy attempt to turn his own philosophy into ideology while at the same time upholding its esoteric purity, served as the \u201coven\u201d of ideology: Platonism and Neo-Platonism made it possible for the most diverse cultural and religious elements to get baked together into a single theological-political solution. Modernity began when irreparable fissures appeared in the Catholic ideology. These fissures took many forms. On the one hand, a few esoteric ideas challenging late-Medieval scholasticism \u2014 a philosophy that had taken upon itself the task of preserving the ideological integrity of Christianity under the pressure of the new learning that was flooding in from the periphery while replacing the \u201cvolatile\u201d Plato with the sedate \u201cAristotle\u201d \u2014 laid the groundwork for the scientific revolution, which resulted in an understanding of the world that, impossible to refute, directly challenged the existing ideological formation. On the other hand, the Reformation, while insisting on a return to the more fundamental truth of Christianity, exploded the political-theological apparatus that had emerged during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Specifically, it challenged the idea of institutional mediation: it challenged the very mode of Ideology\u2026 It replaced this with textual mediation. So, in essence, you have two things: 1) an esoteric scientific challenge to the essential kernel of the Christian world view: the relation of the unique human soul to God as creator. 2) a new mode of ideological consensus \u2014 textual mediation \u2014 which challenges the entire framework of the Catholic church, and its claim to authority, and yet, far from challenging the essential kernel of the Christian world view, \u201cdoubles down\u201d on it. Science develops toward the popular philosophy of the Enlightenment. Classical liberalism may be seen as a \u201chalf-baked\u201d ideology: half-baked, because it did not seek to replace the Christian kernel with scientific rationality, but rather to contain it within a framework of tolerance and a kind of utilitarian rationality. This can even be seen in the illiberal Hobbes, whose message is already ideological in the sense that, while expressed more geometrico, it speaks to everyone. Rousseau is also a \u201chalf-baked\u201d ideology, though it goes further than the English and Scottish enlightenment in seeking a kind of synthesis. But, for all his brilliance, it lacks the philosophical wherewithal. Enter Kant! Enter German Idealism \u2014 and Hegel, above all! Hegel\u2019s idealism is the great oven of ideology\u2026 It offers a powerful new way to connect \u201ceveryday life\u201d with the most esoteric truth. And yet this ideological oven is still fueled by a hidden Christian kernel. Enter the Young Hegelians! Enter Marx! Marx offers, in germ, the first account of how a thoroughly secular scientific rationality can offer an overarching \u201cethics\u201d of life. (This is not to deny that a certain theological eschatology underlies Marx\u2019s view of history \u2014 it remains a work-in-progress. But this eschatology is not essential) to it) But Marx was only the basis of ideology, the germ of ideology. To become ideology, something more was needed: Marx had to become Marxism, a revolutionary program\u2026 (Marxism is, I think, a dimension of Marx \u2014 one shouldn\u2019t seek an artificial separation between Marxian thought and Marxism). Marxism is thus the first \u201cfully-baked\u201d ideology to stand against Christianity. But Marxism quickly gives rise to a counter-ideology: Fascism, and the specifically Racialist ideologies of National Socialism. (The role of Nietzsche in this is very complex; he was more a philosopher than Marx, but he also clearly recognized the ideological potential of his thought and the danger this posed.) Moreover, the old order doesn\u2019t go quietly: Fundamentalism emerges as a kind of counter-ideology to the ideologies of Modernity. And at the same time: liberalism, realizing that it is too \u201chalf-baked\u201d to stand up to post-Enlightenment ideological complexes, seeks to reinvent itself as a \u201cfully-baked\u201d ideology. And so you get neo-Liberalism (von Hayek\u2019s principle of self-organization offers a kind of scientific foundation), Ayn Rand\u2026 And, especially in the US, an bizarre alliance between Fundamentalism and Neo-Liberalism in which, in the name of liberalism, the true virtues of liberalism, its sanity and tolerance, are abandoned for fanaticism. Post-modernism emerged in the wake of the second world war. It is not an ideology, but a counter-ideology: a rejection of the hegemonic historical narratives that, baked in a Hegelian oven, underwrote the ideologies that emerged in the 19th and 20th century. Of course, it also opposed Christianity as ideology \u2014 but not Christian belief per se. One could even say that post-modernism sought a return to the epistemic modesty that one finds in Locke. Of course, post-modernism also challenges the claims of science, but only in so far as they present themselves as a new ideology \u2014-passing from science to scientism. But now we have people like Hicks and Jordan Peterson. They are both neo-liberal ideologues: they seek to marshal all the powers of ideology in order to elevate \u201cclassical Liberalism\u201d to an all-encompassing world view. (JP indeed offers a comprehensive account of \u201cmeaning,\u201d and speaks to a non-Academic audience) And, as such, they oppose Marxism. But at the same time: they can\u2019t admit that they speak for an ideology. They want to present their ideology as an anti-ideology. (But this is the sleight-of-hand of Neoliberalism \u2014- it presents itself as natural, unproblematic, common sense) Hence it is necessary for them to present post-modernism, which is basically a critique of ideology, as an \u201cconspiratorial\u201d extension of Marxism. In order to present their own dogmatic \u201creturn\u201d to liberalism by way of a social-Darwinian scientism as a non-ideology, they need to neutralize the critique of scientism by painting it as ideology par excellence. For just this reason, however, I would argue that postmodernism is dangerous \u2014 not because it is a dangerous ideology, but because, as a non-ideology, it is incapable of confronting either the need for ideology or the present danger of ideology. It is worth noting that communist revolutions have only succeeded in countries where institutional mediation rather than textual mediation was the norm: Russia, Catholic countries in South America, East Asia\u2026 Western Marxism (what JP misunderstands as \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d) is really \u201ctextual Marxism.\u201d Against the barbarism of institutional mediation (violence, mass ritual, reducation camps) it sought a textual solution\u2026 It is this critical gesture, rather than the \u201cinstitutional\u201d, Statist ambitions, that led to the morphing of Marxism into post-modernism\u2026 Deconstruction, in particular, is the apotheosis of the textual critique of institutional power. But Jordan Peterson gets this all mixed up - deliberately, I think\u2026 At the same time, though, Leftism never really managed to develop an alternative to positive rather than merely critical textual mediation. Liberalism, in contrast, drawing on Protestantism, did. Western Marxism, by returning the rich philosophical traditions of the long 18th century \u2014 a tradition that was suppressed by dogmatic Marxism \u2014 sought to do this, but these philosophical currents, on the one hand, remained too esoteric, and, on the other hand, this attempt was undermined by the critical vigilance of deconstruction. And so we are left with a void. At the present moment, textual mediation, by way of social networking, has rapidly gained an hitherto unimaginable power. Institutional mediation is nearly meaningless. (This is the real meaning of all the talk about post-truth). Leftism has simply not been in a situation to assert itself in this situation. And yet, more than ever, ideology is needed. We live at a moment in which humanity is faced with an existential threat to its existence. There is a pressing need for a way of understanding how the ethical life of the individual can understand itself in relation to the fragility of the earth, and for a global politics of ecological responsibility grounded in economic and social justice. Post-modernism cannot provide this, and its failure has opened the door wide for new forms of fascism. ",
