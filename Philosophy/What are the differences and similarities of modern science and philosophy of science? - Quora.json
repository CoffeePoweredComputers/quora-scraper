            "answer_text": "What are the differences and similarities of modern science and philosophy of science? They are categorically different things. Philosophy of science isn\u2019t science - it\u2019s just a bunch of words seeking to explain how science works. Most of these words apply only to physics, and the farther you get from physics, the less meaningful they become. Because you can\u2019t make a good experiment in geography or sociology. Modern science, at least in physics, which I know, tries to work according to the most popular theory of philosophy of science, \u201cscientific method\u201d. The one about making experiments, checking if they work according to theories, adjusting theories and making more experiments to verify new theories. ",
