            "answer_text": "The questions is, How does Genesis present the origin of evil in the world? The origin of evil in Genesis is said to be due to the free choice of one man named Adam who disobeyed one specific command of his Maker at the behest of one woman named Eve who is reported to have been enticed by a Reptile who challenged the veracity of that one command. Whether the narrative be historical or myth, each of the \u2018actors\u2019 in the old narrative is apportioned varying degrees of blame : Adam is blamed, largely because he is regarded in patriarchal cultures as the covenant (responsible, representative) head and steward over the woman and all their progeny. Eve is blamed, because she was deceivable and deceived and because she seduced the man (Adam) into disobedience. The Reptile is blamed, because it denied the specific word and order of God and seduced the couple into district and disobedience along with the consequences. and, logically God is blamed for setting things up to fail or, at best, for not setting things up in a foolproof manner! When the narrative is lifted out of the cultures that extrapolate on it and that exploit it in the form of exclusive religious franchises that say they can reverse the consequences and effects of this evil act, blaming God makes a lot of sense. God certainly appears to have set things up to fail. Well, there is more than a grain of truth in that, but it is not about blame. The set up was designed, from before the foundation of the world, to disarm the accuser, to render accusation true to the lie but fruitless in real terms which was and is to establish a cosmos wide foundation of failure proof grace (contrast conditionalism). To avoid writing a theological tome in the Quora.com forum, and to be as inclusive as my conscience allows, I offer the following for your consideration. In the circumstances described above, the issue of historicity is not important. Fiction is one thing, Myth is quite another. In the light of that difference, and in the light of the fact that the New Testament is written not essentially to clarify the Genesis account but more importantly to answer it, it is worth considering specific points and perhaps some important quotes found in the New Testament response to the old narrative: 1) To be as inclusive as possible, let us not argue about historicity; let\u2019s just suppose the garden episode is an authoritative sacred myth of and over a particular culture which has had enormous consequences in human affairs. 2) As such, its declared effects are embedded guilt, obligation, alienation and death plus tyranny, cost, waste and suffering. These corruptions, fears and threats naturally become deeply embedded in the \u2018psyche\u2019 and \u2018psyches\u2019 of that culture\u2019s adherents and subjects and of those who, for whatever reason, have to do with the culture. 3) It becomes advantageous to power to perpetuate that myth. The \u2018rule of law\u2019, even of just that one \u2018law\u2019, empowered by dire threat as it is, seeds existential guilt into human existence (cf: \u201cWhere there is no law there is no sin\u201d). Law legitimises guilt which legitimises the power of priests and permits legislators (the state) to lord it over the adherents/subjects of the culture formed by the myth. Liberation is required regardless of the historical status of the story, and that liberation must be felt! 4) The question becomes, How might a \u2018liberator\u2019 best disarm the power of the priests and legislator dictators (the state) whose authority derives from the original myth and the assumption that their rights to power is divinely bestowed and authorised by \u2018the words of God\u2019? 5) The solution must be in terms convincing enough to undo, reverse, delete and truly free the adherent psyches from the felt consequences of the myth with all its obligations as exercised through the power of the legislators (law makers, the state and the elders) and the power of the priests who appear to hold sole franchise over divine forgiveness - they even say they hold the keys to the Kingdom of God? 6) The solution has to be a commensurate in its redemptive efficacy with the problem in its condemning efficacy. Since the ultimate declared consequences of that one act of disobedience are said to be death, and since substitutional deaths (sacrifice, sacraments) were/are the products and forgiveness was/is the profitable service rendered by the religious franchises, there would have to be a death (a sacrifice) to end all other sacrifices. Such a death would disenfranchise the priests, the state and the original myth and the consciousness that was blind to the fact that God is not like that; that grace is archetypal righteousness, the sustaining power of all things, literally\u2026 i.e., no condemnation. Some passages for contemplation. \u201cThe death he died, he died to sin once for all\u2026\u201d Romans 5:12 Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned - (Paul inserts a parenthetical note of explanation here:) [To be sure, sin was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not charged against anyone\u2019s account where there is no law. 14 Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam,who is a pattern of the one to come.] - (St Paul does not complete the sentence at v 13, but it is implied\u2026 ) 15 But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God\u2019s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! Here is another, briefer statement, and it is quite stunning. To answer the Genesis problem, St Paul reasons like this: \u201cFor God has bound everyone over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.\u201d That is from Roman 11 at verse 32. The \u201cset up\u201d as expounded in the original narrative and exploited by \u201cthe accuser\u201d and by franchises that abuse by accusation and by the denial of God as love and compassion, is answered brilliantly here. God has considered our condition under the schema of projections of \u2018divine\u2019 accusation via laws and obligations abstracted and extrapolated on from the narrative \u201cso that\u201d grace, not conformity, might be the way and might be seen to be the way. \u201c\u2026 sin is not charged against anyone\u2019s account where there is no law\u201d. \u201cFor sin shall no longer be your master, because you are not under the law, but under grace.\u201d \u201c I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, \u201cYou shall not covet.\u201d \u201cSacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire, nor were you pleased with them\u201d\u2014though they were offered in accordance with the law.\u201d \u201cThe sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.\u201d \u201cno one will be justified in His sight by works of the Law. For the Law merely brings awareness of sin.\u201d [It creates the problems it purports to resolve! It\u2019s \u2018good\u2019 business.] \u201c\u2026 the Law brings wrath. And where there is no law, there is no transgression.\u201d \u201c\u2026 sin, seizing its opportunity through the commandment, produced in me every kind of covetous desire. For apart from the Law, sin is dead.\u201d \u201c\u2026 the sinful passions aroused by the Law were at work in our bodies, bearing fruit for death.\u201d \u201cTherefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified.\u201d \u201cthe law entered, that the offense might abound. But where \u2026\u201d \u201cThe former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless, for the law made nothing perfect, and a better hope is introduced, by which we draw near to God \u2026 Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.\u201d \u201cUnlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself. For the law appoints as high priests men in all their weakness; but the oath, which came after the law, appointed the Son, who has been made perfect forever.\u201d and us along with Him! It\u2019s endless! and it is glorious. The major hermeneutical problem is the assumption of continuity between the Old Narrative (Old Testament) and the New. The error is that discontinuity is barely accounted for in Judaeo-Christianity and, where it is, it is too often in the form of unconvincing cheap grace commensurate with a cheap understanding of righteousness which is namely the righteousness of law. In fact, the Judaeo-Christian situation is far worse than that. The New Narrative is now used to send devotees of Christ, the one who liberates from the law and its effects and consequences, back to the law and its effects and consequences. Well, if you got this far, Congratulations. Grace, mercy and peace be unto you\u2026 in Christ Jesus. ",

            "answer_text": "Interestingly, the Genesis account presents the serpent as the perpetrator of the evil in the form of misinformation (\u201cthou shalt not surely die\u201d) by offering a misinterpretation of God\u2019s words. But the \u201corigin\u201d of evil as depicted in Genesis included two others. Even more interesting is the fact that 1Timothy 2:14 clearly explains that the one deceived had the greatest guilt. In other passages in the NT, we are given to understand that one must have faith to please God (Hebrews 11:6) and faith is equated with knowledge (Matthew 17;14\u201321). Thankfully, the knowledge we must seek is defined as the word of God (Romans 10:17) so we know where to look. So, we can conclude that to origin of evil (as depicted by Genesis) was made up of 2 primary constituents: the intent to deceive and the vulnerability to that deception . Obviously these observations engender additional questions, thereby encouraging the development of knowledge and making one less susceptible to being deceived. Think about it\u2026. ",
