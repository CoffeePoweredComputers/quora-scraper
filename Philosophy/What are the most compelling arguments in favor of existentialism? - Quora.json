            "answer_text": "You live your life aware that one day you will die. It could be today, it could be tomorrow, it could be twenty years from now. You are the kind of being who seeks knowledge, wisdom and understanding, and you live in a modern world which changes very rapidly. The claim that everything is divinely ordained seems less realistic than it did centuries ago when our religions began to take form. You can choose to ignore these facts and go on living your life, or, you can choose to confront the fact that you will die, that transiency is a fact of life, that nothing is assured. If you choose to see how far down the rabbit hole goes you would do well to consult the wisdom of those who have sailed these waters before. In the face of puritans of philosophy who say that existentialism is not a rigorous part of the philosophical tradition I ask: Can you use your \"rigorous\" philosophy to address the above questions, or, absent that, should we just leave these questions of extreme importance to religions and pop-stars? Because that certainly seems wise! ",
