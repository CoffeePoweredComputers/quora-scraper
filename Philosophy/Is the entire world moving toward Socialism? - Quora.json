            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s not confuse socialism with social democracy. Socialism is a range of economic and social systems characterized by social ownership and workers' self-management of the means of production as well as the political theories and movements associated with them. Social democracy is a political, social and economic ideology that supports economic and social interventions to promote social justice within the framework of a liberal democratic polity and capitalist economy. The world is moving away from socialism, since every attempt at implementing it has produced a failed economy. The world is not moving away from social democracy, it\u2019s the foundation of every other modern western country, and the US ill get there too eventually. ",

            "answer_text": "No, sadly not right now. Since 1989 the world has been moving rapidly far far away from socialism- not just the bad Soviet kind but also the good social democratic kind, and despite the most devastating collapse in international capitalism since the 1930s hitting in 2008, zombie capitalism still goes marching on in search of brains to eat. Instead of socialism, these days it\u2019s lots of angry incoherent demands to chase out immigrants and \u201cstop islamisation\u201d and \u201cbuild more walls\u201d rather than \u201cworkers of the world unite\u201d. More\u2019s the pity. ",
