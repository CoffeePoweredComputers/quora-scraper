            "answer_text": "I think postmodernism as school of thought (philosophy) has already lost a lot of it's appeal. (especially the \"anything goes\" extreme)Personally, I think we are in a more science-based era again, though not as absolute as during the modernism period. We came to understand the usefulness of constructs, and realize the great stories are gone, except one: reality. And science seems to be the best way to approach it and get a decent understanding (that approximates truth). I do think some of the non (or less)-scientifically informed intellectuals still hold to postmodernism though.  In society, there is always a lag, and I think there is a great deal of deconstruction to do in many cultures and societies in order to become more relativistic. ",

It is also very real in the fact that current societies face problems strucutrally different from those of the early modern(ized) era. ",
