            "answer_text": "Lying is uttering known falsehoods or deliberately withholding the truth. It includes claiming knowledge one does not have. In human interactions it would be pathological to always express yourself with total honest transparency to others. It would also in many instances be cruel or dangerous. When needed and important, truth is essential. The appearance of being truthful is highly virtuous. Knowledge of truth is power. Life is a quest for truth. In science, truth is a basic requirement for learning, which is the goal of the scientific method. Deviation from truth is deviation from science. In psychic consultations, fortune telling, faith healing and using religious influence to assist the grieving, truth should be used sparingly in order to obtain the listener's belief, and lying freely utilized, so as to achieve your goal. Also, in military leadership, truth should be used when appropriate in training one's followers and soldiers to fight and obey, but  only when it fosters that result. As to the enemy, the goal is to deceive sufficiently to win. Truth with oneself is extremely important to avoid errors. However, when one must act against the apparent odds of success, truth may be a distraction and contrary to your purpose, so that substitution of patriotic, magical or religious confidence may yield one more power. A wise man knows that when blinding oneself to truth has served its immediate purpose, it is time to immediately focus upon truth again. Lying is not a virtue or vice, it is a tool. Like all tools, it can be used for good or evil.  To not be aware of all this will cause misfortune in life. Often (but not always) that is the true cause of what people call, \"bad luck.\" A reputation for lying makes one weak when dealing with others. However, as can be seen in the game of poker, any reputation may permit one to prevail in confrontations with others. To assist others generously and without any intent of manipulation, it is best to share knowledge of the truth to your best ability. It will then be up to them to recognize its truthfulness and gain the power it imparts. The internet is an excellent tool for the collective wisdom of the human species to locate and discredit lies and share truth for our collective betterment and social advancement over time. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that \u201cwhite lies\u201d are a necessity required in order to effectively navigate social life. Many social customs and social rituals require us to use deception and/or outright lying in order to meet the demands required of those customs and rituals; in effect, we often have to be less than truthful and deceptive in order to act in appropriate, polite ways. If we didn\u2019t \u201cfake it\u201d at times or use deception as social grease to navigate the social world, our worlds would quickly devolve into chaos. So, in my view, \u201clying\u201d is sometimes necessary not only for our own personal success and function, but also for the success and function of society and social institutions. ",
