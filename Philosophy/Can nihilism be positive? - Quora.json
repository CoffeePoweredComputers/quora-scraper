            "answer_text": "First thing is, positive in what sense? Basically, as mentioned over here, nihilism is a denial of meaning of anything meaningful. Even if we assume \u201cpositive\u201d with a purely utilitarian notion, the nihilist will question the very meaning of the utilitarian stance and stand against it. Secondly, this question brings me to address a little on some modern misinterpretation. According to some writers here on Quora and other forums, nihilism is seemed to be interpreted alongside with existentialism and absurdism. There also seems to be some assumed correlation between nihilism, rational capacity of a person, and intelligence. But again, nihilism is a denial of all things meaningful. Casting some meaning into this doctrine is simply self-refuting. Sure, the whole existentialist movement was conceived to overcome nihilism, so it is somehow founded on this doctrine. Sure, the ability to question meaning of our activities and everyday life can be a sign of intelligence. But these are all attempts to fantasise a very simple, blunt concept that only has a simple reference. Nihilism did give rise to the existentialist movement, but it didn\u2019t serve as its foundation. The doubting of meaning in the things we do is not a result of nihilistic beliefs, but simply the application of critical thinking. What I am trying to propound here is that nihilism is just simply the denial of meaning and the active destruction of meaning, nothing more. This means that we can\u2019t judge nihilism as a model of evaluation, as we do for the scientific method, and thus lay judgement on whether it has positive or negative repercussions. It simply refers to a way of thought, an aged doctrine, and at most, a concept. We can only judge nihilism to be positive or negative based on how we interpret and take action based on it. But then again, the actual question would be the accuracy of the interpretation and the framework of judgement the action is based on. ",

Positive or negative has no meaning for a nihilist, if you're talking about \u201cPositive\u201d as perceived by general public in terms of success, well being, kindful and so on, well it can be achieved, since the very thought that everything is futile can be quite liberating since it pushes an individual to it's maximum extreme without being afraid of any kind of consequence. If your actions do not matter then all that matters is your action I prefer to take nihlism in the sense it frees me from any kind of social responsibility and isloates me from ongoing struggle to mend in such that I could focus better on myself and relish a simple yet impactful life, yes it'd be worthless but wouldn't doing anything be worthless too?
