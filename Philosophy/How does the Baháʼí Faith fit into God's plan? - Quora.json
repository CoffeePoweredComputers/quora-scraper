            "answer_text": "I quote from an article on the Baha\u2019i Faith that explains in my view: The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed view of God is essentially monotheistic. God is the imperishable, uncreated being who is the source of all existence.[1] He is described as \"a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresentand almighty\".[2][3] Though transcendent and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation. The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator.[4] God communicates his will and purpose to humanity through intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God, who are the prophets and messengers that have founded religions from prehistoric times up to the present day.[5] God in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith - Wikipedia Abdul-Baha wrote in 1912: At a time when warfare and strife prevailed among nations, when enmity and hatred separated sects and denominations and human differences were very great, Baha\u2019u\u2019llah appeared upon the horizon of the East, proclaiming the oneness of God and the unity of the world of humanity. He promulgated the teaching that all mankind are the servants of one God; that all have come into being through the bestowal of the one Creator; that God is kind to all, nurtures, rears and protects all, provides for all and extends His love and mercy to all races and people. Inasmuch as God is loving, why should we be unjust and unkind? As God manifests loyalty and mercy, why should we show forth enmity and hatred? The Promulgation of Universal Peace I recommend the following book by John Hatcher:  Author: John S. Hatcher The Universal House of Justice has identified the \u201cPlan of God\u201d: The Guardian ...\thas stated that God's plan for mankind is going forward in two ways, that He has, as it were, two plans. One, the Major Plan, is inexorably driving mankind towards the unity and maturity that God intends for it. This plan operates in ways that are mysterious to us and as it pursues its tumultuous course, may even seem at times to interfere with our work, but we can be confident in the beneficence of its goals. The second plan is the one that has been given to the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds and it is to the achievement of this that we must devote our attention and energies. It is the part that God Himself has chosen for us in the working out of His grand design. (24 January 1979, written on behalf of the Universal House of Justice to an individual believer) [11] Holocaust, the Greater Plan of God, and the Destiny of the Jewish People ",

            "answer_text": "Baha'i believe in the Bible, Quran, sutras Hindu and Buddhist, and one other. They feel each of these religions teach there is only one god: the god of Abraham. They believe that each religion above has a manifestation teaching about God and his plan for unity of all people regardless their faith. World Peace. Manifestations include The Buddha, Krishna, Jesus, Muhammad, and Zorastar. Bahuallah is the latest manifestation. I can't remember if others come after him. I'm not an advocate of saying every other religions outside of Christ is bad. That is an insult and totally not of love for other people. If you mean gods plan of salvation, they probably do. The problem I see with their faith is saying all chosen religions come from one source. The particulars? Each Baha'i is different. No one needs to put down a religion they disagree with. The Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith I'm not Baha'i but I know all religions don't come from the same source so no, they are not of \u201cthe Christian\" god's plan. Nothing wrong with that As long as they don't combine religions under one roof, it is what it is. Don't belittle it and move on. Not everyone needs to be saved ",

            "answer_text": "Baha\u2019i Faith is aspiring to establish a Baha\u2019i inspired New World Order, a Baha\u2019i Super-State. We Bah\u00e1'\u00eds are one the world-over, we are seeking to build up a New World Order, Divine in origin. (Shoghi Effendi, The Light of Divine Guidance, Vol. 1, p. 123) Baha\u2019is believe that all other religions are dead or will eventually die and only one faith will rule the people and their hearts. Baha\u2019u\u2019llah claims: \"...Every house that is raised up will one day fall to ruin, except the house of God; that will grow more massive and be better guarded day by day. Then serve the Court of God with all your might, that you may discover the way to a home in Heaven, and found an edifice that will endure forever.\" https://bahai-library.com/rev_bahaullah_4/taherzadeh_revelation_bahaullah_4.txt \u201cWorld order of Baha'u'llah will be built on the ashes of the Old World Order\u201d  Check this video from 5 minutes 30 seconds. And Baha\u2019is also believe that all calamities (small or big) are the plan of God.  I am a former Baha\u2019i and I think a Baha\u2019i NWO is a very bad idea due to many reasons that can be addressed in some other answer. ",

            "answer_text": "No it doesn\u2019t\u2026 Holy Quran in Surah number 7 Al-Araf explains the purpose of sending the Prophets: \u2026.O my people! Serve Allah, you have no god other than Him; surely I fear for you the chastisement of a grievous day. So whichever Prophet came from the side of God has given the same message i.e. the Unity/Oneness of Allah. No Prophet called himself \u2018God\u2019 However there are proves in Baha\u2019i books which clearly state that Bab and Bahaullah both have called themselves God. And their followers hiding this fact from innocent seekers is itself a proof of their falsehood. Bahais do not believe in the concept of Hell and Heaven. That means a terrorist who kills hundreds of people will not be chastised for his bad deeds and a person who spent his whole life serving humanity will not get any reward for his good deeds. Can both the persons be same?? At multiple occasions in the Holy Quran it is said: \u201cGive glad tidings to the doer of good\u201d - This makes it clear that the doer of good action will be rewarded and the person who does evil will be chastised. So to conclude, Bab and Baha does not serve the purpose of Prophethood and they calling themselves God makes it clear that there was some evil intention in their creating this man made faith. ",
