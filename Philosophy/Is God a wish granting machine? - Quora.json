            "answer_text": "God is an abstraction we believe to exist. Religion is a promoting organisation of his existence but no one has confirmed for real that he exists for real. Its just a metaphysical entity we consider and remember to seek salvation and freedom from pain and suffering and pain. The reality is Mind over Matter, meaning whatever happens or will happen is because of the willpower of the mind. What we think we become, with out thoughts we create our world. When we visualise ,then we materialise. Nothing is permanent and everything is perishable and everything is in constant motion with time. This motion and vibrations in time and space is what acts as a wish granting factory. Butterfly Effect and Ripple Effect are real and with our thoughts and actions we create our fate and seal our luck. So in brief all is as a result of our thoughts and actions. Our behaviour is the action and what comes back as a result of our behaviour is the reaction . Thus everything is consequential i.e. cause and effect. Nothing is independent , rather everything is entangled and interconnected with everything else and putting one thing to vibrate creates a chain reaction and the chain ends with vibrations running back to the source of origin. We create our destiny with our actions. What we think , we feel, we act, we behave and that we become. So its nothing but we ourselves containing everything we create for ourselves and not a third entity controlling us. God is just a matter of belief ,if you believe in him,he exists for real, and if you don\u2019t believe in his existence, than he doesn\u2019t exist for real to that person. ",

            "answer_text": "We are born to fulfil all our positive wishes. ONLY THEN WE WILL BE LIBERATED! God fulfils all our wishes, at the time decided by our relevant karmas, after we do sufficient hardwork for fulfilling them. Just by asking something nobody gets anything. One has to slog for it. Tapasya ke bina kuchh bhee nahee milata. Which means we wont get anything without hardwork. BUT THERE IS A CATCH. We also get entangled in debts with others when we try to fulfil our wishes and wishes go on increasing (as given in a demo in Bruce Almighty movie.) So, only when we possess wishes for the good of all, we forget our ego, i.e. ourselves and truly get rleased from all karmic entanglements and become free or liberated souls one fine day in steps. Though GOD grants our wishes, he makes us eat the fruits of our desires/deeds. You may read my other answers on God in the below blog. BLOG: Wisdom: WISDOM: Let's make our life easier and better! ",
