            "answer_text": "No. Science says that the universe is made of energy, and energy comes in the form of matter (such as electrons, quarks, and atoms) and radiation (such as photons and gluons). Consciousness is a phenomenon that arises from these constituents. Most forms of matter and radiation (stars, for example) appear to have no consciousness, but some forms (such as humans and many other animals) do appear to have consciousness. ",

This question invites confusion\u2026 this articles says why: On A Distinction Between Access and Phenomenal Consciousness. Does science say the universe is made up of access consciousness? \u2014 this would clearly be an absurd question. Does science say the universe is made up of phenomenal consciousness? \u2014 since p-consciousness is entirely non-empirical science cannot gain any traction upon it, so science says nothing about it.

There are 3 things you need to create universe. EnergyMassAlot of energy.And according to the statement E = MC squared, ENERGY and MASS can be considered same. So now you need just 2 things energy and a lottt of space to expand the universe. ",
