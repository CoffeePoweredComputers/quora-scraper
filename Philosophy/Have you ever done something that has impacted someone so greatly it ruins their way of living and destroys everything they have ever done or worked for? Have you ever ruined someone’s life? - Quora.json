            "answer_text": "I ruined her life\u2026 (This is going to be very long and my english is bad so sorry for any wrong phrases or words). So this is when i was 16 years old , i was a depressed and socially anxious teenager that was a reject most of his life with no girlfriends and nothing and trying to fit in and be cool (just like every normal teenager) , thus having too much peer pressure on me i got into some stupid things that a wannabe rebellious teenager would\u2019ve do to be cool. I used to smoke weed and hashish and cigarettes , drinking till midnight with friends and getting high and drunk at the same time because i was depressed and hated my mental illnesses i thought that killing myself slowly slowly would make me feel better. So while i was being drunk and high i had a friend of mine that i met in social media (we were like 800 miles away from each other) that i used to talk about my depression and shit together and he was a friendly guy always listening , preventing me from suicides and stuff. He told me to join his group chat where his girlfriend whom they dated long distance was in there (Yasi), so we can hang out and chill and maybe make my mood get better. The first moment when i joined i noticed she was trying to chat and talk to me, me being the guy that hates picking on my friend\u2019s girls , i tried to reply to her in a bad mood and stuff , but hence i was drunk and high at the same time i just was cracking alot of jokes and utterly making the whole group chat die from laughter so she kind of liked me and just got along with me anyways. She used to say everyone that\u2019s their name is Ali are funny and amazing personalities so i kind of liked her (never got a compliment from anyone in my life , that actually made me feel very good). After like a few days she kind of came into my private chat and wanted to get along , so i was like it\u2019s cool she can be a friend of me so i went along with he and we got along very good. I had a big crush on a girl i liked while asking that girl out for 5 times in 6 months and getting rejected very badly from her , me and Yasi used to complain about our personal lifes , she telling me about he relationship with my friend while i was complaining that i loved a girl but i got rejected from every girl i knew my whole life and that love is nothing for me , so i just liked to get high and drunk everyday. Me and yasi became like brothers and sisters for 6 months and were each other\u2019s backup when we needed someone to talk to. Hence she was telling me about her relationship with my friend , my friend really was becoming distant with her and i found out my friend had a crush and loved his Ex gf that he was talking with and actually was dating him at the same time, me being the good friend that kept the secrets , never told Yasi about that but at the same time told her not to feel bad and that i\u2019ll talk to my friend about it , tried to encourage my friend that Yasi is an amazing girl and that it\u2019s not worth the new girl but he liked his ex so he actually wanted to end it up. So they broke up and i had feelings for yasi even tho i didn\u2019t want to admit it (she had too but never told me) i was kind of happy that she is single and maybe i can date her. I remember i told Yasi that i am an addict to hashish and cigarettes and that no girl would like an addict brother , but she told me \u201cNo matter what you do or are , i love you the way you are and want you\u201d. That made my heart beat very very hard for her but still i didn\u2019t admit to her that i love her (Never date your friend\u2019s ex rule and stuff).. She helped me get over the girl i loved and blocked her off my life completely. About a month after their break up i wanted to ask Yasi out to a date because i couldn\u2019t let go of this feeling i had for her but all of a sudden my best friend called me and told me we are going for a friendly trip to gether (4 best pals) to a city so we can smoke weed and do stuff while he meets his long distanced gf, he told me we are moving in 4 hours so pack your stuff and meet me so we can move. I told Yasi that i\u2019m going to a trip and i won\u2019t come back in 4 days or more , so becareful and take care , she told me to take care and got worried for me but i said i\u2019ll be alright and packed then moved to my friend. When i was in the trip from the very start till the very end i had Yasi all in my mind , couldn\u2019t think of anything even while high , i found that i loved he to bits and she is my dream girl , i will ask her out when i come back home. 4 days later that i arrived home i was really in a hurry to just reach home , turn my laptop on , and ask her out then sleep. I was excited and happy that i can finally confess my feelings to her so when i arrived i turned my laptop on , went to our private messages but what i saw broke my heart to pieces. She had love/dating photos in her profile and her bio saying \u201ci love you\u201d. At first stupid me thought it\u2019s about myself , so i messaged her at 6 AM (she was sleeping) that what\u2019s the meaning of her photos and bio? Then i slept. When i woke up i found out she is dating one of my acquaintances that i smoked weed with twice and that they dated exactly the night where i was returning home. I got mad and told her good job in a sarcastic way. She even told me \u201cif you are mad i can broke up with him for you\u201d, i said no i don\u2019t want a guy that knows me lose a girl just because of me being mad , i hope you be happy together and i left to drink and smoke 4x the time i did because i was crying alot. The very next day she told me to give her my number and that we can talk over the phone , i said no because of her boyfriend he will get mad, but she said that he knows we talk and call each other our love and darling, so he won\u2019t have a problem with us talking over the phone, so i gave her my number (i never talked to a girl over the phone before her , only twice with a girl that i didn\u2019t love at all) so she was like my first. After that we would talk over the phone 24/7 from morning till night , she never even gave her number to her bf , but would talk to me 24/7. I felt bad and good at the same time, i even was waiting for them to break up because their relationship wasn\u2019t working out at all , he didn\u2019t love her it was obvious because she was very sad behind the phone. So i told her \u201cif you were my girl i would never make you sad\u201d and we even became closer after i told her that. After about a week (their relationship lasted for a week in total) they broke up and i was happier than even , so i said i\u2019ll take the chance and ask her out. I did and the reply i got made me sad. She said \u201ci\u2019ll think about it\u201d , i said why would you think it\u2019s a yes or a no? She said \u201ci can\u2019t say now because i broke up yesterday and i can\u2019t date his friend the very next day , what would they think about me??\u201d So i got mad but respected her decision and said \u201cwhen will you answer?\u201d she said tomorrow i will. So i told he good night and we went to sleep. The very next morning i was at school but was excited to see her reply so i actually jumped over the walls of our school (my everyday habit :p) to rush home and see her reply. I arrived and told her what happened and she said yes! I was very happy but that lasted for 30 seconds till she said \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody that we\u2019re dating\u201d, i said why? she said the very same reason when i asked her out. I went mad and tried to tell her to explain to me and that i want everyone to know we\u2019re officially dating but she said no. I still respected her decision and said till when? She said \u201cuntill i say so , maybe a week?\u201d So i said ok. A week finally passed and she officially told everyone in the group chat that were dating. I lost my friend that used to date her , even the acquaintance, but i was very happy for having my dream girl with me so i didn\u2019t care. We were happilly dating for the first 3 months of our relationship, she was my first serious gf and maybe my first gf if i didn\u2019t date a girl that took me for granted that lasted for 4 days. We were very happy talking about our future and that we might get married in 10 years and all that stuff till one day she told me something that broke my heart. Yasi - \u201cAli we might not last together forever\u201dMe (in a joking way) - \u201cWhy??\u201dYasi - \u201cMy parents are strict and we are arabs , you know arab families\u201dMe - \u201cYeah i know , they are strict\u201dYasi - \u201cYes but they won\u2019t let me marry whoever i want. They are searching for a groom and they want to arrange a marriage for me\u201dMe (Tears in my eyes) - \u201cYasi you\u2019re joking right? This can\u2019t be! You\u2019re just playing with me it\u2019s no real\u201dYasi - \u201cAli seriously , they just talked to me about it and i knew it from the start that they will do this to me , my elder sister was just like that and was forced to leave her love because of her parents wish\u201d Me (Crying uncontrollably) - \u201cYasii?? Why didn\u2019t you tell me this earlier? I can\u2019t believe this you\u2019re joking\u201d Yasi - \u201cAli look , you need to convince my parents that you\u2019ll be their groom , you need to work on yourself and to marry me in 3 years\u201d Me - \u201cYasi you know i hate marriage and told you i\u2019m only marrying you in 10 years just because i love you , or else i won\u2019t marry any girl or if i\u2019m in my mid 30s\u201d Yasi (Crying uncontrollably too)- \u201cIf you love me , you need to marry me , don\u2019t worry i won\u2019t let anybody force me to marry someone i don\u2019t love , but you need to work hard too , if you want us to be together\u201d There you go , i lost hope but still didn\u2019t give up , 3 months later we met for the first time , first kiss , first hug , first girl to hold my hands , first making out. Mind you she was 3 years older than me. She made me promise her that i will quit smoking and drinking and start working , and will ditch my friends all of them because of her. Because of the love i had for her i couldn\u2019t resist so i said who needs friends , i love you more than anything. So when i arrived at my own city i ditched my friends , quit smoking cigarettes , reduced my drinking to once every 3 months but kept smoking weed only on weekends (for my social anxiety). Found a job at a workshop (mechanics) because it was my dreams and i needed to settle for marrying her in 3 years so i had to work hard for her. Me being the good bf i told her the truth about smoking weed only once a week for my anxiety , she at first was ok with it, but after she started having problems with it. It all went downhill from there after\u2026 We used to fight over stupid problems , she always had problems that i never had time for her , always hanged out with my friends (i only just hung out once a week , had to ditch 50 of my friends , 7 of my friend group circles and reduced them to only 2) , cope with all the gossips of my friends that Ali left all his friends only because of a girl, that left me with no other choice rather than stay away from social media and forget my friends and keep working hard to learn mechanics. She always told me i smoked alot of weed (i only did on weekends) tried to explain that it\u2019s good for my social anxiety once again and she was ok with it , told me i was always at work and never there for her (wtf? i would come at night time and chat with her till 2 am while i had to wake up in the morning for work)\u2026. The fights were there till 2 months that i couldn\u2019t take more of it , my boss was verbally and emotionally abusive , but i was there still only because of my love. After seeing her not cherish my works i just left the job , even tho i got fired from my boss that made me depressed to death so i ended up smoking much more weed , because when i smoked for once a week and she never understood , i smoked everyday to calm myself down. This continued for a year till we met once more. This time we had sex too. After we had that , her sister talked to me and told me that if me and yasi want to marry i really need to think of settling myself for a job or else i need to forget about her. The amount of love i had for her was over the roof so i said it\u2019s ok and i\u2019m working on it. So i went back to my city and found another workshop to work the for free and learn mechanics. At that workplace i had the most fun. Best 2 boss i saw , best customers we would laugh all day and work and learn , there was nearly 12 girls that were hitting on me at the same time but me rejecting them but i had a friendly gesture so i would smile at them and laugh at them or even joke (I had 0 feelings for them). Being the stupid nice bf again i would tell all that stuff to my gf that there were girls hitting on me and stuff and that i will never cheat on her (I just wanted to boost my ego from the girls but use my confidence on my gf , and that i wanted her to know what a bf she has that everyone wants him but he is only for a single girl). I even remember calling my gf when one of the popular hot girls in our neighboorhood that hitted on me was passing , and i loudly said wow Yasi last night was awesome , your hickeys are all over my chest\u2026 To the point that she understood that i had a gf and stopped hitting on me (I know i was a jerk for that\u2026 but i loved Yasi wayy to much and wanted her to know that i\u2019ll never cheat). But she always told me that i was cheating on her with these girls , no matter how much i swore and explained , still she said i didn\u2019t have time for her and would work alot , smoke weed alot , and never care for our future. I always told her that i am too young to marry and she can just leave me and get a guy more rich and settled if she wants , that i loved her alot and would respect her decision but she always said \u201cI will do whatever for you , i love you and would even be homeless but just to be with you\u201d. When she said that i smoked alot of weed and that i prefered weed over her , i got mad and shouted that i can\u2019t stop weed because of my anxiety , if i stop weed i cant work , and if i dont work i can\u2019t marry you\u2026 I even told her it was weed that gave me the courage to ask her out and make it to the place we are right now\u2026 But she continued and gave me an ultimatum that my mother talked to her about it \u201cThe me or weed method\u201d. Since we had alot of arguements of it i said weed, broke up with her , tried to hook up with the girl that i rejected but got rejected (she revenged by sending her bf on me and nearly beat me). So i was really sad , went to my gf and told he she ruined my life , now i have nothing left and everyone is gossiping behind my back at my workplace so i can\u2019t go there. I ended up quitting that job , started really really abusing weed and just became a couch potato because i had nothing left. Yasi left me saying that \u201cI cheated on her with that girl\u201d. I didn\u2019t! Fast forward to 8 months , i was a stoner that couldnt stop smoking weed. She told me that she\u2019s sorry for what she did and i said ok , i\u2019ll need to quit weed now because i can\u2019t , i was smoking and drinking alot just like 2 years before\u2026 It\u2019s going to be hard because i might be emotionally abusive towards her and i had huuge family problems in my house because of being a stoner (got kicked out 19 times). So i told her \u201cyou\u2019re waayy better off without me\u201d But she kept saying \u201cno matter what i\u2019ll stand beside you\u201d. So i was happy and told her i\u2019ll try to quit with all i have but it will take time and i might not make it to be the groom your parents want , but she said \u201cno matter what i\u2019ll wait and try to convince my parents to wait and you just quit\u201d. So it took me 8 months to quit and i finally did (even tho i was really really emotionally abusive , my anxiety was over the roof so i couldn\u2019t stop the fights with her). I had really intense fights in my own house because of my parents not supporting my quit and being very emotionally abusive sine my childhood, so i would burst my anger on everybody even Yasi. That\u2019s where i ruined her life\u2026 No matter how much i told her to leave me alone she would stick by my side , i always told her she\u2019ll regret standing by my side , but i always promised her i\u2019ll be better and quit and make the life she deserves and make our future. So after 8 months of me finally quitting for 3 days, I had very strange mood swings , being really angry to really calm and quiet , told her \u201cyasi this first week i don\u2019t want you to be by my side so i\u2019ll rather stay alone so i won\u2019t abuse you any more\u201d She said \u201cNo pls stay with me\u201d. I said \u201cOk if you want , but i\u2019ll be away the first 3 days so i\u2019ll calm down because weed isn\u2019t bad and the first 72 hours are the worst.\u201d So finally the first 72 hours passed , the 3rd night of me quitting i called her and told her i need her by my side and she calms me down and that if tonight passes it\u2019ll all be good and i\u2019ll find a job to continue to settle myself , i even got my highschool diploma and found a technical school to learn both mechanics and tunings race cars that was my ultimate dream and the best success to find a life with her. But she was very very distant\u2026 she said good night and said she\u2019ll go to sleep, She said maybe we can\u2019t talk to eachother the next morning because her father is at home (odd excuse , her father was always at home). I couldn\u2019t stop crying because i had severe mood swings so i went on social media and found her online\u2026 I was really out of my mind so i ended up cheating on her with a friend i had. Over text we was sexting\u2026 The morning when i woke up i realised what i\u2019ve done and went to her and confronted her that i did that, she was really really mad at me and said she don\u2019t want me in her life anymore\u2026 After i told her that , she told me that she is indeed talking to another guy for 5 days (4 days before i cheated) and that it\u2019s the groom her parents want her to marry. At first she said it\u2019s by force , then she said she wanted him because he was settled and that \u201cLove is not enough for a marriage\u201d. I was crying uncontrollably , relapsed and started drinking and smoking like a maniac over what i\u2019ve done and that i can fix it all , i can settle down. But she was making fun of my attempts that they\u2019re not enough. For a whole month and a half i was trying to make her talk to me and tell me what she really wanted\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what she wanted from me, one day she said \u201ci don\u2019t love you at all ,and that one morning i woke up and i found out didn\u2019t have feelings for you\u201d. I asked when? She said \u201cexactly 1 month before i quit\u201d. I said why didn\u2019t she break up with me instead? She said \u201cBecause i didn\u2019t want you to stop quitting weed\u201d. So this went up for a whole week and i found out i made alot of damage so i need to stop texting her. Told her i will block you and just stop talking to you but she always said \u201cNoo please i can\u2019t stay without you , it\u2019s not by will , it\u2019s a forceful marriage, i love you and never lost feelings for you\u201d. Then after a few days she would say \u201cI can\u2019t stand talking to you , i don\u2019t love you and lost feelings for you\u201d. I was very confused and angry , at the same time all of my family members knew i was a stoner that made my reputation worse. I couldn\u2019t stop blaming her for making me like this , but didn\u2019t tell her that. All of a sudden i told her that it\u2019s all her fault that she made me force to marry her because i loved her. She would tell me \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my fault , you could choose not to marry me and move on\u201d. I said but i loved you , now that i lost everything you tell me to move on? She would say \u201cWhen you cheated on me with that girl that was hitting on your in your neighbourhood , you could go on with her\u201d. I said \u201cIf i was cheating on you i wouldn\u2019t call you in front of her to tell you about a fake hickey , and hear the gossips and the bullies after that\u201d. But she told me \u201cI hate you for over a year , even before that incident happened\u201d. She even told me \u201cI hated you because you ruined my life by cheating on me with multiple girls , abusing me verbally from doing drugs , and that i hate you for this and wanted you to feel that way too\u201d. And this is when i got really really mad and told her \u201cif you are trying to revenge me on that , i can revenge too\u201d. So i got really really mad, tried calling her dad but she answered the phone (if her dad finds out she dates , he will beat the hell out of her), so i ended up calling her mother , telling her that if her daughter is getting married she needs to stop calling me and emotionally manipulating me , or else i will call her dad and ruin her family the same way she ruined mine. Then she called me again , this time i got really wayyy more mad and i lied to her that \u201cI am spreading your nudes all over the internet with your phone number under it , so they will call you and ruin your life\u201d. She begged me to stop and i said \u201cI didn\u2019t spread your nudes , only 1 picture of you (not nude) and that my friends are saying what a sexy girl this is and stuff\u201d. Obviously i lied , just wanted her to feel that revenge is not a good thing and that i can do it 10x worse. Shortly after that i started shouting at her , very bad , calling her bad names and that she needs to stop calling me , or else i\u2019ll ruin everything in her life the same way she did\u2026 After like 15 minutes i heard really heavy breathing and screaming and crying uncontrollably. Then only heavy breathing. I thought she had an asthma attack (She has asthma), then she didn\u2019t answer when i was calling her name. I called her 15 times , no answer. I got worried , like really worried and regret. I called her the 16th time and her little sister answered. She said that she collapsed and went to the hospital.. I was VERY worried now! After like an hour her elder sister called me and said \u201cWhy did you call my mother? She is screaming and crying in the hospital and that she is frightened that i might call her dad, if you want to do something call me instead\u201d. I said \u201ctell your sister to stop emotionally manipulating me or else i\u2019ll do more than that the next time\u201d. But i was very very worried so i called her. She answered and told me she had a severe panic attack , leading to her having some sort of temporary paralysis , and that she can\u2019t feel her legs anymore , she can\u2019t walk anymore and might stay like this for the rest of her life. It\u2019s been 5 days that i\u2019m talking to her and she feels a bit better but can\u2019t walk i think , can\u2019t stand on her feet anymore. :( I know i will get very bad replies but i needed to take this out of my chest. Sorry for it being very very long , but i regret it very much and i\u2019m suicidal now, She hates me and we fought once more behind the phone but i can\u2019t stop trying to hurt myself anymore.. Yasi\u2026 Baby , i\u2019m sorry for ruining your life :( ",

            "answer_text": "Yes though other people may disagree. I have shared before my past of being sexually abused(as well as physically, mentally, and emotionally abused by my father. As well as sexually abused by my older brother, but on my father\u2019s orders to do so and a few times, just because the situation was so messed up did he hurt me. No it does not make what he did to me okay but it does make the situation complicated. To read the full story, please click on the link below. Kelly Stewart-Quinn's answer to What is the worst thing a family member of yours has ever done? My older brother and I were very close as children, before he began sexually abusing me and even while he was hurting me. That may sound messed up but if you click on the link above and read the whole story, it made sense for us at the times that this was happening. My older brother taught me to walk. I don\u2019t remember any of this of course but I have been told the story enough times to relate it here. We lived in a home with hard wooden floors and the first time I tried to walk on my own, I fell down and banged my knees on the wooden floor and after that refused to try to walk again on my own. Well my older brother wasn\u2019t going to accept that because he loved me. He lined the floor with as many cushions and pillows as he could find and then tied one end of a rope around him and one end around me and gentle pulled me to my feet and slowly taught me how to walk by basically not giving me the choice to do anything but walk where he walked. And when I fell down inevitably, I fell on cushions and pillows and so got back up and tried walking again and kept doing it. This boy who would go on to hurt me later, loved me so much and I loved him growing up. He was my favorite person aside from our sadistic father who favored me above all others. But when the abuse came to light, I could not remember that my father had been sexually abusing me more than my brother had. I could not remember that he had been doing it first, before he made my brother start hurting me, and I could not remember what he made us do to each other while he watched. When the abuse came to light, I could only remember what my brother did to me. And that was the only thing I told the police. Where we lived, by state law juveniles in this situation were to be given a second chance at life but to be taken away from the home. My brother was put into foster home after foster home. When he was taken away, when my mother found out what he had done, she had loved him so much, he was her miracle baby(health issues of her own, like having a uterus and a half of another uterus as a part of her reproductive system) and suddenly, it was like flipping a switch for her, she no longer loved him, it seemed to me at all really, but I hope she simply did not and does not love him as much as she used to. My parent\u2019s divorce literally happened at the same time the abuse came to light though nothing about my father\u2019s abuses of us came to light. He threatened to kill my older brother if he ever told and neither I nor my younger brother could remember what he had done to us though my younger brother was only 4 and the abuse that our father had been doing to us had been going on since he was in diapers. My younger brother still remembers nothing of that abuse from our father to this day and I hope he never remembers. Those are hard memories to bear, even being as healed as I am from my own PTSD. No one ever saw my older brother as anything but a child molester, a child rapist. Every foster home, except one when he was about 16(the best one he was ever a part of) only saw him as a child molester, a child rapist and treated him terribly, despite them supposed to be being the people who gave him a second chance, while he got therapy and the like. This affected deeply how he saw himself, as if what our father had done to him and how our mother began treating him had not affected his self esteem and how he saw himself enough at this point. Once he was an adult, he was still being treated the same, like he was only this thing, a child molester, a child rapist. As if he could be nothing else, even though he never hurt another living soul that way. And the more people treated him this way, the less and less he thought of himself and the more his problems with anger grew. He lived on the streets for years. He struggled with drug abuse though he is now clean thank god. He did all of this completely alone. To this day, our mother treats him like she wishes he didn\u2019t exist at all and I blame myself, I will always blame myself. If when the abuse had come to light, if I had remembered about our father and told on him as well, my brother would not have been hit so hard by the law because the law and all the social workers involved would have saw him for what he was, not just someone who had hurt someone else, but also a victim/survivor of a sociopathic monster, the man who fathered us and enjoyed our pain. But because I could not remember what my father had done and because no one would believe my brother, he got hit with the full emotion of the law and no one saw the truth. Years later, he moves around from house to house with his friends. He had a job and his own apartment for two years and I saw his life improving and then one thing went wrong and it all went tumbling down and he\u2019s back to moving around from room to room with friends who treat him like shit. And while I am very sure there is more to the story than I am hearing, people who don\u2019t let you eat while demanding that you drive them everywhere, people that get pissed off when someone sends you money for food(as I and my mother have done) are not good people, regardless of the situation. And they are not people I would call friends. Though he swears up and down that they did not act this way before they offered him a place to live. Our mother refuses to allow him to move in with her, even when he lived on the streets for years, eating out of dumpsters. Even when he lost his job and had proven for over two years that he could live his own life responsibly, without anyone\u2019s help, she refused to allow him to stay with her. She said to him that she wouldn\u2019t allow any of her children to move back in with her and our stepfather because they enjoyed their peace and quiet. But our younger brother who has a steady job whereas my older brother looks for work and bounces from temp job to temp job just to make money and bounces from crap friends to crap friends who refuse to allow him to eat unless he does what they want him to for them, our younger brother winds up leaving the room he was renting from a friend because his friend allowed bed bugs to become a problem in the house(I get why he left but what happens after is crap) and our mother allows our younger brother to move into her and our stepfather\u2019s house while begging me not to tell my older brother. She just expects me to accept the crap way she still treats him. He told me in the last few weeks that he felt like our family wished he didn\u2019t exist at all. I assured him I did not feel that way but that I had been made to feel that way by our mother and stepfather before. Sidenote: If you did not click on the link, yes I forgave my brother. I love him and I know that what happened between us was not all his fault, was not even 90% his fault and we have talked in depth about what happened between us, when he abused me by his own choice and why, and when he abused me on our father\u2019s orders. He has apologized over and over again. And he has this black hole of guilt for not being the big brother he thinks he ought to have been for all of those years, not just as younger children but as we got older. I have forgiven him and he knows this and we have been building a relationship with each other for two years and it is a good relationship, trusting, open, honest, blunt, loving, and caring. I lost my older brother for decades. But I have him back now and I could not have asked for more given the situation. Anyway, during the conversation where we discussed how we both had been made to feel like the black sheep of our family, at separate times and like our siblings at those times were just wonderful people, I had the unpleasant and most painful task of telling him the truth of just how our mother feels about him. I swore I would never tell him unless he asked me, how our mother truly acts about him and talks about him when he is not around, when she is not talking directly to him. I think you get the idea. Telling him the truth broke my heart. My mother and I struggled for years to have, finally, a good relationship that is healed, open and honest, and actually trustworthy. And I have told her for years, even during the times we struggled, that as much as she owed me emotionally, to fix our relationship, that she owed my older brother more as she treated him like he was a monster. She has brushed me off for years but I feel like she may not be able to do that for much longer as he is now aware of the truth about her and how she feels about him. Telling my older brother that the year after it had all come out and he was in a foster home that our mother had been, in her own words \u201cforced\u201d to spend Mother\u2019s Day with her eldest son, instead of with us(my younger brother and me and these are all her own words) had pissed her off. Because she didn\u2019t want to take him to get some cheap hamburgers at McDonald\u2019s she couldn\u2019t really afford and she didn\u2019t want to take him to the park to watch him play and she didn\u2019t want to take him to the video game stores he wanted to go to. I believe he was between 13\u201314 at this time. She wanted to be spending \u201cHer Mother\u2019s Day\u201d with \u201cHER\u201d children. As if my older brother were no longer her child. Needless to say, his reaction to the truth of this story was painful for him, he was angry, and he was also validated in his suspicions of her and how she treated him, lying to his face about certain things, especially how she feels about him. And in my mind and heart, after all these years, it is my fault. My fault that I could not remember the whole story of ALL of these abuse, how my father was truly involved in the whole of it, how my older brother was just as much a victim as I and my younger brother were, my fault that no one saw him as the victim he was and treated him as the ONLY perpetrator of the abuse and therefore the worst scum on the face of the earth no matter which family he was sent to, my fault that my mother has stopped valuing him as a person deserving of the value a loving mother gives her child, especially a child that according to her doctors, she was never supposed to have had, her miracle child that she called him for years and yet now treats him like a villain, like the scum of the earth that she thinks he is, my fault that he has not had the chances in life that every person who has been through what we three(my older brother, I myself, and my younger brother) have been through, should have, my fault that he views himself with such loathing as he does and while he has gotten better with that through the years, he still struggles with it, my fault that my family was split up. Not my father being kicked out of our family but my fault that my older brother was taken from us and never given the help he so desperately needed despite having court ordered therapy. The was his life is crap now, I feel is my fault for not remembering the whole of the abuse at the beginning. And while I am aware and respect that my older brother and my mother are adults and of course make their own choices, I cannot help but see the domino effect my lack of remembering the whole story and not telling the cops the whole story has had on his life, my life, my mother\u2019s life, and my younger brother\u2019s life, as well as our sociopathic father\u2019s life and his never having been caught for what he has done to us. The statute of limitations prevents us from trying to bring charges against him now because it has been too long since the abuse and since I remembered the abuses. It is a shame but it is what it is. I get that many people may disagree that I ruined my brother\u2019s life. But I cannot help but feel that way. I feel that way now and while I understand that I cannot change the past, I have to learn to make my peace with it. And in truth, I don\u2019t think my older brother would even agree that I had ruined his life. But I cannot help the way I feel. I can only hope to make my peace with it and that my mother gets her shit together(forgive the language) and realizes that her eldest son deserves more than her forgiveness, he deserves her respect, the most sincere apology she has to offer as well as effort on her behalf to create a good and honest relationship between the two of them. As a last example of how I feel I ruined his life, I\u2019d like to share a nightmare I had right after my older brother was taken from us, after I\u2019d related only what I could remember. My older brother was in the Juvy center and I was staying with my mother at our home while my younger brother and I were to be sent to my mother\u2019s best friend\u2019s home the following day so that my older brother could come home on a tether until the state had found him a suitable foster home. That took about two weeks and it was our father who watched over my older brother until he left for his first foster home. I think you can imagine from what I have relayed here how those two weeks may have gone for my older brother. Anyway, the nightmare I had at age 7 can only relay the regret I felt then as well as the horror of having my older brother taken away from us and my horror and fear of the entire situation. I was 7 after all and the entire situation was beyond frightening to me. But in my nightmare, I was a 7 year old girl, standing in my back yard as a pick up truck backed up to my back porch. In the bed of this truck was a giant rectangular piece of ice, almost like an ice sculpture of a piece of wall of ice. And on the front of this wall of ice were four metal cuffs, two at the top, one on either corner, and the same at the bottom, two cuffs, one on either corner. One large man got out of the truck as I stood on my back porch and one large man dragged my older brother out of the house, in his underwear which was one of the oddest things about this dream, and then both large men picked up my struggling older brother and put him in the back of the truck, cuffing him, spread eagle style, to this large wall of ice in only his underwear, he wore nothing else. And at the time, my older brother was a thin 13 year old boy, very very thin, malnourished I would say, looking back on it. In my dream, as they began to drive away, I followed the truck down our driveway, and into the road. I followed the truck like this because my brother began yelling at me \u201cLiar liar pants on fire! Liar liar pants on fire! Liar liar pants on fire!\u201d over and over and over again. He yelled that at me so loud and he looked so furious at me. I followed that truck to the end of the street where it turned left and my older brother kept calling that out to me until the truck was out of site and yet I could still hear him calling that to me. I woke up right after that. If that is not the sign of a guilty conscience at the time, or a subconscious saying \u201cWake up, wake up!! He\u2019s not the only guilty party here!\u201d, I\u2019m not sure what is. But I would hope that you all can see how long I\u2019ve felt guilty for ruining my older brother\u2019s life. At the time, I had no idea how he\u2019d be punished for what had happened and what I had told the cops about. But now, I carry so much regret. And I truly feel I have ruined his life. I\u2019d give anything to take it back but it is not going to happen. Thank you for allowing me to share this, finally. It feels good to get it out there. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, in a way. When I was 21 I met this truly amazing young woman. If you had asked me to guess her age, I would have said 25. After a few weeks of seeing her socially, she finally confessed that she was 17 and still in high school. Well, we ended up having a marvelous relationship that lasted nearly four years. The latter two years were marred by the fact that she lived in San Jose, and I was in grad school in New England. On one visit (two years into grad school) she tried to convince me to change schools so we could get a place together somewhere around Silicon Valley. I really didn\u2019t say anything, but kissed her and left. We never heard from each other again. Fast forward a little over 30 years and I get a friend recommendation on Facebook. It\u2019s her. Fifty two years old, but still recognizibly her. I sent her a friend request and she responded within just a few minutes. Over the next week or so I got friend requests from her family, old friends from way back, pretty much anyone who had stayed in touch with her over the years. A couple of months later I got an e-mail from a mutual friend. She had died the day before (turned out to be an unexpected drug interaction). I attended her funeral the following week and learned a lot about her life. Notable was that she had a 13 year old daughter (adopted), didn\u2019t marry until she was 42 (even that was a marriage of convenience), and had been widowed four years earlier. A couple of years later I was having lunch with one of our mutual friends who had stayed in touch with her throughout the years. I was baffled. How could this amazing (and truth be told, quite beautiful) woman have remained single for so long. Certainly she had to have been courted by a lot of guys over the years. The friend looked at me, somewhat sadly, and said \u201cJerry, you set the bar too high. Nobody else could measure up\u201d. I felt sick to my stomach. She had dreams of buying her first house and starting a family before she turned 30. She loved children, and wanted to be able to enjoy raising them while she was still young. She believed strongly in family and marriage, and that belief was part of her identity. Now that\u2019s not to say her life was a loss, far from it. She made more of her 52 years than many if not most do of a much longer life. The size of the crowd at her funeral (well over 200, standing room only) was a testament to that. But to have missed out on so much just because of a guy she met at age 17. It made me sad. At least she didn\u2019t resent me for it (her mother and two of her friends said that when she got the friend request she was happier than she had been in a long time). ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. I ratted out my best friend to her boyfriend that she was cheating on him. The following text is pretty big. You could read the text in bold to get a gist of the story. I\u2019m going to call her Shane. So Shane and I were not really the thickest of friends at school. We had a long history together, as our parents knew each other, but our childhood friendship had more rivalry than friendship. I had lost touch with her when we were 15. I was 19 and I had recently heard that Shane was at the same college that I was going to. I had also heard a lot of rumours about she dating this rich guy in our city, who was not really the best of characters. She was not among the poor in our society either. One day she came over to my house and cried her heart out in my room and told me how she was cheated and betrayed by her boyfriend (that rich kid). How he had \u201cused\u201d her to create an image of having a hot girlfriend (yea, she is hot). I then told her to relax and forget about it. It was a scene with more drama, but I\u2019m trying to keep it short. Well, we forgot our past differences and made up. I soon became her minion, who always hung out with her and bunked classes whenever she demanded I do. Well, I was having fun participating in her spontaeneous plans and watching all those boys at college do her bidding at the snap of her finger. So I did not have much to complain. Then she introduced me to this really cute Jain (Jainism - Wikipedia) guy. I\u2019m going to call him Sandy. He was a strong follower of his religion, but pretty open-minded about others. Anyone would be lucky to be his friend. She made it pretty clear to both him and me that she was very interested in him. She would tease the guy so much and make so many sexual innuendos that I wondered if that was actually harassment. But he did not seem to mind, and even seemed to enjoy it. So I only admired her ability to know what and how to say stuff, that gets a person doing what she wants. Soon they were together and he was head-over-heels in love with her. I acted as their third wheel too sometimes, where I would accompany them to avoid problems that may be caused by nosy citizens who want to \u201cprotect the virtues of our society\u201d. A year went by. He was a scholarship student in one of the top colleges in my city, and for the first time, feeling the beauty of romance. I was moved by the way he would talk about her or do things for. We bonded well, because we both cared for our \u2018other half\u2019(I had a boyfriend) the same way. I tied him a Rakhi (Raksha Bandhan - Wikipedia) and we soon shared a friendship that did not depend on Shane. Shane soon started getting bored of her relationship. I noticed this when she was hitting on my (now ex-)boyfriend\u2019s friends. I tried talking to her and explaining that she not fool around while in a relationship with Sandy, but in vain. She started avoiding me too. I did not try to be in touch with her, because I could not look Sandy straight in the eye while knowing that Shane was lying to him. They were still together. Then one day, Shane and I went to a party with some friends. I introduced her to one of my childhood friends, who was a notoriously good looking guy and was even notorious with girls. Even before the party begun, Shane wanted to leave as she was not feeling well and she wanted to be dropped home. Oh what a surprise! The only person with a car in the group was my childhood friend. He agreed. And sigh. That\u2019s where it all began. I got a call from my friend a week later saying that she was hitting on him strongly. On further questioning he shamefully agreed that he had actively participated in their amourous dates (they had been on more than a few). She had been forcing him to break up with his girlfriend. I was aghast. I stopped talking to him then. I was shocked and hurt to learn that Shane had been cheating on Sandy and lying to me about it. I was angry at Shane\u2019s behaviour, as I remembered all those times she was hitting on the guys I introduced her to. This is where I made the mistake. Instead of demanding an explanation about it from her, I called up Sandy and told him all about what she had done. I don\u2019t know why I did it then\u2026.but I regret it sorely now, but only because of what it did to Sandy. Sandy was livid. He couldn\u2019t believe I was party to all of this. He called up my childhood friend and made clear what he thought of him. It wasn\u2019t nice. He then did something crazy. He went to Shane\u2019s parents and told them that they needed to know what their daughter was doing. He then told them how much he loved her and that he could \u201crectify her mistakes through love\u201d. Well, Shane\u2019s parents were not really in the mood to agree to give their girl to the guy who had just exposed things about their daughter, which they had conveniently ignored all these years. They could not appreciate the fact, that instead of going around bad-mouthing Shane to his friends, Sandy had actually gone to her parents and asked her hand in marriage \u2018to protect her name\u2019 in our society. Shane was asked to stop seeing me and Sandy. She soon got an opportunity to study abroad, as her parents have pretty good influence in our college. I stopped all contact with Shane too. I felt too betrayed. Sandy never stopped loving her. He hasn\u2019t moved on. He continues to be in touch with Shane, who doesn\u2019t want to let go of an \u201cadmirer\u201d. Whenever Shane heard Sandy was somehow moving on, she would tell him something that would make him come back to her. But she hasn\u2019t shown any signs of being interested in getting back together with him anytime. I knew her well. So I told Sandy, that she\u2019s not comin back. Sandy told me he loved her, and that she will come back. I regret telling about Shane to Sandy before talking to her. But I think I still would have done it if she did not come clear with Sandy. That is how I ruined Sandy\u2019s love life, from which he carries pain and heavy scars even today. UPDATE: Sandy is now married to a beautiful girl, who was also working as an air hostess and they like each other very much. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I was the trigger, but I wasn\u2019t at fault. A bit more than twenty years ago, I worked as a long-term security consultant for an e-commerce startup. The company offered a comprehensive e-commerce suite, with everything a retail vendor would need to set up an on-line retail store: a secure web-server, a matching browser, crypto libraries, and administrative tools. This came out just as Microsoft offered IIS, and was a few years before IBM\u2019s WebSphere server came out. The startup\u2019s timing was good, in that e-commerce was not yet the obvious thing, but to those of us who had ridden the Arpanet from the 80\u2032s into the Internet age, it was obvious that some kind of online shopping was definitely going to happen. Now, I wasn\u2019t an employee per se, so when this startup went public, I didn\u2019t make any money from the IPO. But I had two non-technical friends, both older than me, who had separately bought Microsoft stock very early. By the mid-90s, each of them had something north of $500k work of Microsoft, and both had decided that they wanted to diversify. One of these friends, a woman, had started buying rental real-estate, and later on, she guided me through the process of buying my house. The other friend, not as close to me, worked for the endowment office for one of the major universities here in the Boston area, so he knew a good bit about the stock market. When my startup\u2019s IPO came along, this friend asked me whether I thought it was a good company and a good product. I was wary, because I don\u2019t know anything about investing. I told him I knew the product pretty well, especially its security details, and I knew the guys who had written the bulk of the code, and they were smart guys. But I also told him I didn\u2019t know much about the rest of the company, like its executives or its salesforce, and I said fundamentally, I didn\u2019t know enough about this new e-commerce industry, to feel sure that the company would do well. I recommended that it might be a good idea to invest a small amount of money in it, but only a small amount. I found out later that he thought he had gotten a sure-thing inside tip from me, so he sold all of his Microsoft stock, and bought into the IPO. Sadly, a few years later, after I\u2019d left, many of the startup\u2019s engineers quit en masse, because management decided to move the company offices to the suburbs. This happened just as IBM introduced WebSphere, and the smaller company just couldn\u2019t compete with Microsoft and IBM. So, in this way, my friend lost all of his life\u2019s savings. I was dismayed, and though I had warned him not to bet everything, I still apologized to him. He has moved away, but he\u2019s more-or-less broke now, and I still feel really bad, every time I think about him. But AFAIK, I\u2019m the only one who blames me. 507 words.

            "answer_text": "I came across this question days ago & couldn't get it out of my head\u2026 here it goes Sad to say but yes I have ruined someone's life. Not just anyone My mother. maybe all my siblings took a piece. Growing up we were super poor. My mom had 5 kids & left my dad (I was 4) because he spent all his income on drugs. Her last string I would say was when my older brother 6 or 7 at the time accidentally caught him in the bathroom sniffing a couple of rows. After that situation my mom quickly went on to live with another man. My stepfather. He was at the same level (drugs)as my dad only was violent & did provide as much money as he could to keep us fed. You could say I had a good relationship with my mom compared to the rest. I was 12 & met my brothers friend at the house. We started to feel something for each other & when I turned 13 he asked my mom if he could be my BF. Mom said yes. Now I'm 29 & thinking WTH is a 13 yr old doing with a bf. Anyway things never changed in my home I was the middle child & my older sister had just came back after running away 2 yrs ago at the age of 16. She came back with a BF & they took my room. I have never met someone so violent, mean, careless like my older sister till this day. I was sleeping in the living room going to 7th grade & fed up with everything that was going on around me. Mom never worked to stay with all of us but it was awful not having 3 meals a day during summertime when there was no school. She got a job & spent less time at home. I spent more time trying to do what she did. Cooking, cleaning washing everyone's clothes. I still had this BF & one night I dared him to take me away from the hell I was going through at the time. He did & things failed. The police caught up with us & sent me back home. Lectured me & then it got worse at home. I was almost locked to live in my moms bedroom not being able to even step outside. I hardly ate & everything was the same in my home violent stepfather, violent sister, no bedroom... my mom was alway violent so that was no surprise. We then tried to runaway again. This time we went to Mexico. He had family down there & I lived in Mexico for 5 yrs within the first month I spoke to my mom over the phone & she was so upset of course screaming at me & telling me I had to return to finish school & I was too little to be on my own. I didn't call her back. I didn't return home. It wasn't all happy & fun in Mexico . I worked at an early age. I was a house wife at age 13. I had no family but the guy I ran away with. But I broke my moms heart. I left her with countless nights of no sleep. I can't imagine how much & for how long she laid in her bed crying. All the worry I brought to her heart & soul. I ruined her life at the time Not worrying about the other 4 children she had at home, at least maybe not paying as much attention to them. I spoke with my older brother here & there & he never asked for me to speak with my mother. He just told me she was hurt & later learned she never knew I was calling that often yrs later. I felt I had ruined my siblings life in a way. I saw my mom again at the age of 18 My siblings have not turned out to be in the bestest position ... just a couple months ago my older brother had left prison & tried to stay clean but the drugs got a hold of him & 2 cars ran him over. My real dad is in prison over possession of controlled substance. The other 3 continue with drug problems. Stepfather just drinks now EVERYDAY I'm more than 15 hrs away I speak with my mother every week & I try to help her as much as I can Till this day I feel at fault. Part of me feels I failed & ruined her life & my siblings. I've never talked to anyone about this. Sorry for so long Phew! Breathing again ",
