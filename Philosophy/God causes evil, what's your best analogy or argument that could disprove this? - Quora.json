            "answer_text": "You and your wife are going out for the weekend. You leave your two teenaged children unsupervised at the house with a few ground rules: friends are allowed but no alcohol (because it\u2019s illegal anyway); no more than 6 guests between the two of them; they clean up any mess they make; unexpected calls will be made to check in. On your first call, the kids seem to be behaving, but you\u2019re fairly certain one of them is trying to \u201csneak a few things by\u201d. You\u2019re not too worried about the other one. You receive a call from your neighbors about the noise. So you call home, and the one you were worried about if quickly attempting to talk themselves out of the trouble they are in. You talk to the other one, and they really don\u2019t want to rat out their sibling, but they confirm which rules were broken, and that they were involved in the whole thing. All while choking back tears and asking to be forgiven. When you arrive at the house, you find the police there and teenagers scurrying in all directions. Your \u201ctroublesome\u201d child is vehemently denying their wrongdoing, while accusing you that the rules shouldn\u2019t apply to them as they\u2019re \u201cno longer children\u201d. Due to the nature of the events that took place at your house (while you were away), both kids have juvenile records, but only one of them is repentant of their actions. Now\u2026 Did the parents cause the kids to exceed their mandate? (Does God create evil?) No! Eventhough his \u201cabsence\u201d allows for such events to take place. Is it the parent\u2019s fault that the children didn\u2019t follow the rules? (Can\u2019t God make it so no one can break His rules?) Wouldn\u2019t this reduce the children to automata? Not only would the children be \u201cpretty dolls\u201d, the \u201cparents\u201d would be sad sacks as they wouldn\u2019t have a relationship with real people. People receiving genuine contentment from people who can only confirm their preconceptions are shallow and one-dimensional. Should the parents have remained in eye-sight of their children to prevent them from doing \u201cthe wrong thing\u201d? (Why doesn\u2019t God prevent evil if He is truly all powerful?) When parents micromanage the action of their children, the children fail to learn how to grow and develop as people. Their parent\u2019s micromanagement prevents the kid\u2019s from learning how to develop their own moral senses. The parent would lack the maturity to allow their children from exercising their own free will. Should the parents allow the unrepentant child from facing the consequences of their actions? (Why does a \u201cgood\u201d God send people to Hell?) No. Even the repentant child needs to face the consequences of their actions, but the attitude and relationship between the parents and repentant child will not face the turmoil and potential estrangement the unrepentant child will face.

            "answer_text": "We find sickness, old age and death. We see things that are ugly, people who are insane and foolish. There are storms, earthquakes, floods, draught and famine. We also see people commit sins, show disloyalty, unfaithfulness, greed and insincerity. We see people commit rapes, murders; they fight and make wars. We know all these and many more problems. There are evils caused by human beings and there are natural disasters. There are suffering for individuals and there are those that involve a large number of people. But we also know that this is not the whole story. Besides all these negative things, we also see beauty, health, prosperity, life, birth, wisdom, intelligence, growth and progress. We also see goodness among people, faith, sincerity, charity, love and the spirit of sacrifice. We also see a lot of virtue and piety. It is wrong to see one side of the coin and not to see the other side. Any philosophy that concentrates on one aspect of the creation and denies or ignores the other side is partially true and partial truths are no truth at all. It is also the fact that the element of good is more in the creation than the element of evil. We all see that there are more people who are healthy than those who are sick. There are more that eat well than those who starve. There are more that lead decent life than those who commit crimes. Goodness is the rule and evil is the exception. Virtue is the norm and sin is the aberration. Generally trees bear fruits, the flowers bloom, the winds move smoothly. 1. First of all, God did not make this world a permanent world. This is a temporary world and everything here has a time limit. When its times comes it will die, come to an end and finish. Neither the good things of this world are forever, nor the bad things eternal. We are here for a short time and we are being tested. Those who will pass this test will find an eternal world that is perfect and permanent. Those who will fail this test shall see the evil consequences of their sins and corruption. 2. God has placed a physical law and a moral law in this universe. God allows suffering to occur when one or more of these laws are broken. The physical law is based on cause and effect. Sickness comes if one does not take care of one\u2019s health or is exposed to infections. A car accident occurs when one is not alert, or drives in a careless manner, or if the cars are not checked, roads and freeways are not made and kept in right shape, or the traffic laws are not right or not properly enforced. Study of causes and effects is very important to facilitate safeguards. Even here we should keep in mind that God often saves us and He does not let us suffer from every negligence. How many times it happens that we are not careful and still we reach safely to our destinations. The way people drive in some cities, it is a miracle that more accidents do not happen and more people do not suffer. 3. Suffering can also be a test and trial for some people. God allows some people to suffer in order to test their patience and steadfastness. Even God\u2019s Prophets and Messengers were made to suffer. Good people sometimes suffer but their sufferings heal others and bring goodness to their communities. People learn lessons from their good examples. Martyrs die for their faith, soldiers give their lives for their nations and this brings liberation and freedom for their people. 4. God sometimes allows some people to suffer to test others, how they react to them. When you see a person who is sick, poor and needy, then you are tested by God. God is there with that suffering person to test your charity and your faith. ",

            "answer_text": "God created all things. God did not create evil. This seems like a paradoxical statement at first, and it is, but only if you consider evil to be a \u201cthing.\u201d When God spoke the world into existence, bringing order out of the chaos that preceded it, everything was good. There was nothing in creation that was evil in any way. On the last day of the creation week, God stopped creating and rested. It was after creation was finished that evil entered the picture, therefore God did not create evil because he was done creating. \u201cBut then,\u201d you might say, \u201cif God created everything, how can there be evil if he did not create it?\u201d And to that I say, evil is not a thing (strictly speaking). Evil is not so much part of creation as it is the un-creation, that is to say, evil is rebellion against the order that was created. Here\u2019s an analogy: I take a cup of water, then I put it in the freezer. After it has frozen solid, I take it out and it begins to melt. You can think of the water/ice as the universe. When it is in its liquid form, it is chaotic, but when frozen, it is ordered. The melting of the ice is not a thing, rather it is the process of the order returning to disorder. Through Satan\u2019s rebellion against God and Man\u2019s subsequent rebellion evil has taken hold and the good creation has fallen apart, continues to do so, and will continue to until judgement day. The ice is melting. ",

But it must be this way, as God has given us the freedom to choose to follow him or not to follow him. If we were given no choice in this, we would simply be robots and the Universe would be pointless. We were created in God\u2019s image and so have the opportunity to do choose to do what is good as well as what is not good. However, God knows this and in his mercy he provides the opportunity for us to be redeemed by him after we choose not to follow him (which is the definition of evil). God pays the punishment for our evil on the cross by laying down his life as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. The is the most opposite to causing evil as you can get. In this, God is destroying evil. ",

In one of the the creation stories in the Bible, which happens to be one I\u2019m familiar with, it is said that pretty much everything God created was good, and we can assume this is because God himself is benevolent. The main difficulty is the problem of free will. Now we tend to agree that free will is in itself a virtue, i.e. good. But for free will to be real, a sentient being must be able to act on it whether the consequences will be experienced as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d from the point of view of other beings it affects.
