It made my mother cry: There's Only A Handful Of Forms (Song/ Poem) - Poem by Nathan Coppedge There\u2019s only a handful of formsIn the moonlight kept all in tetherThe people laugh and they shake their headsThey ask me about the weather There\u2019s only a handful of formsIn the darkness below and aboveThe people laugh and they shake their headsThey tell me the answer is love There\u2019s only a handful of formsOn the faces of the strangersThe people laugh and they shake their headsThey tell me there\u2019s no danger Science says it and religion says itMy mother says it and my father says itIs there a human voice to withstand the despair of disknowledgeThey tell me \u201cgo to college.\u201d There\u2019s only a handful of formsOn the darker side of the moonI tell them they\u2019re all strangers And they tell me I\u2019m a loon There\u2019s only a handful of formsOn the faces of the strangersThe people laugh and they shake their headsThey tell me there\u2019s no danger But people laugh and people cryPeople grow and people diePeople grow weary and people get wedSome of us don\u2019t want to be dead! A voice calls out from the shadowsIt tells me there\u2019s a door\u2014And if I ever cross itI won\u2019t be here any more Wisdom says its nothingOr nothing to exploreWeakness fills the recessWith some dark allure Time will tell meThere\u2019s a price to cross the shadowsAnd many beastly sorrowsI\u2019ve got nothing to regret Though there\u2019s much to endure It\u2019s a race cross the shadowsNo man could have asked youBeginning and end are darkly secured With a name to be gatheredAnd roses gatheredWho\u2019s to be had in this silly old world? (I don't know if I laugh. But would you laugh, Gotschiem?) - Dec.2004/January 2005 Nathan Coppedge ",
