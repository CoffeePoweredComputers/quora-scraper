            "answer_text": "It is indeed very misunderstood. I\u2019ll copy paste from my other answer which is what I believe is the correct interpretation. \u201cThink of it like this. Mersault is an expression of absurdity in the universe. He is not an ideal person, and is not meant to be interpreted as such - obviously not, as he is a murderer. The point of Mersault is not that he is free of morals and emotions, but that he has lived an absurd and pointless life, and will die pointlessly as well. Realizing his circumstance, he rebels by accepting his fate. He only wants to feel joy in his heart as he is being executed. It is a metaphor for life as we know it. We live absurdly pointless lives, and then die for no reason, and nothing really significant ever comes from it all. Camus believed in rebellion against this lack of meaning. He believed that rebelling against our fate by accepting it and loving it was the only way we could create meaning in the universe. The plague expands on this idea of rebellion. The main character is faced with a futile struggle in which he knows he will lose, but he continues on, day after day, refusing to be conquered. He, too, is rebelling against the absurdity of his existence. The plague is my least favorite work, personally. If you want to understand Camus\u2019s philosophy of the absurd more in-depth, The Myth of Sisyphus should be your next stop. It is non-fiction, though.\u201d Why was Albert Camus so contradictorial?

            "answer_text": "Q. What is your interpretation of Albert Camus\u2019 The Stranger? (1) Thanks for the A2A. (2) Short answer: The protagonist animates Camus\u2019 Absurdism philosophy.The protagonist is totally unmoved by the people, events, experiences around him. Demise. Love. Murder. Court case. Death sentence. Whatever.The protagonist is somewhat perturbed by his own attitude. But, there\u2019s nothing he can do about it.At story-end, he is reconciled to this dissonance. Dies at peace with himself, and the inherently meaningless world.(3) Movie adaptation: The Stranger (1967). The key scene, the protagonist, Meursault, shooting the Arab, from 50:35   (4) Much of the story deals with Meursault continually testing himself whether he could feel any emotion, concern or attachment about anyone, about anything. Deep down, he perceived the strangeness of his own utter indifference to his mother's demise, and other important life decisions.When his girlfriend broached the subject of marriage, Meursault was like, whatever, whenever is cool with me.(5) Meursault\u2019s angst pangs represent Camus\u2019 \u201ccontradiction\u201d. As human beings, we have consciousness. Hence, we seek meaning and purpose in life.But, the world has no inherent meaning and purpose. It just is.The meaning and purpose reside in our minds. Mental constructs.This is the contradiction that human beings live. As did Meursault.(6) The shooting: \"My whole being tensed and I squeezed my hand around the revolver. The trigger gave; I felt the smooth underside of the butt; and there, in that noise, sharp and deafen\u00ading at the same time, is where it all started. I shook off the sweat and sun. I knew that I had shattered the harmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I'd been happy. Then, I fired 4 more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.\" (6a) So, Meursault did kill the Arab in a fit of sunstroke. Shit happens. (6b) Shooting to kill is a heightened serious action. An emotional arc. Yet, Meursault having pressed the trigger, had the flippant capacity to note: \"I felt the smooth underside of the (revolver) butt\". The ultimate high, and yet, Meursault drew an emotional blank, again. It was as if he had fired a blank. (6c) Meursault pumped 4 more shots for good measure. Metaphorically, 4 more emotional blanks. \u201c\u2026 fired 4 more times at the motionless body, where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace\u201d \u2192 Metaphorically, no emotional traction\"And it was like knocking 4 quick times on the door of unhappiness\".Meursault was knocking incessantly on his own emotional door. There was no response. The \"unhappiness\" was that he was not at peace with himself. Not because of the killing. Perversely, because of his persistent indifferent void. (7) At the end of the story, before Meursault was guillotined per his death sentence, he came to terms with his indifference. \"Finding the world so much like myself, so like a brother, really, I felt that I had been happy, and that I was happy again...\". In other words, the world is indifferent, andso am I.So, we're cool.There you have it: Camus' Absurdism (8) Related: Sam Qwato's answer to Why is life meaningless according to Albert Camus?   (9) Story pertinent extract: \"...The sun glinted off Raymond's gun as he handed it to me. But we just stood there motionless, as if every\u00adthing had closed in around us. We stared at each other without blinking, and everything came to a stop there between the sea, the sand, and the sun, and the double silence of the flute and the water. It was then that I realized that you could either shoot or not shoot. But all of a sudden, the Arabs, backing away, slipped be\u00adhind the rock. So Raymond and I turned and headed back the way we'd come. He seemed better and talked about the bus back. I went with him as far as the bungalow, and as he climbed the wooden steps, I just stood there at the bottom, my head ringing from the sun, unable to face the effort it would take to climb the wooden staircase and face the women again. But the heat was so intense that it was just as bad standing still in the blinding stream falling from the sky. To stay or to go, it amounted to the same thing. A minute later I turned back toward the beach and started walking. There was the same dazzling red glare. The sea gasped for air with each shallow, stifled little wave that broke on the sand. I was walking slowly toward the rocks and I could feel my forehead swelling under the sun. All that heat was pressing down on me and making it hard for me to go on. And everytime I felt a blast of its hot breath strike my face, I gritted my teeth, clenched my fists in my trouser pockets, and strained every nerve in order to overcome the sun and the thick drunkenness it was spilling over me. From a distance I could see the small, dark mass of rock surrounded by a blinding halo of light and sea spray. I was thinking of the cool spring behind the rock. I wanted to hear the murmur of its water again, to escape the sun and the strain and the women's tears, and to find shade and rest again at last. But as I got closer, I saw that Raymond's man had come back. He was alone. He was lying on his back, with his hands behind his head, his forehead in the shade of the rock, the rest of his body in the sun. His blue overalls seemed to be steaming in the heat. I was a little sur\u00adprised. As far as I was concerned, the whole thing was over, and I'd gone there without even thinking about it. As soon as he saw me, he sat up a little and put his hand in his pocket. Naturally, I gripped Raymond's gun inside my jacket. Then he lay back again, but with\u00adout taking his hand out of his pocket. I was pretty far away from him, about ten meters or so. I could tell he was glancing at me now and then through half-closed eyes. But most of the time, he was just a form shimmering before my eyes in the fiery air. The sound of the waves was even lazier, more drawn out than at noon. It was the same sun, the same light still shining on the same sand as before. For two hours the day had stood still; for two hours it had been anchored in a sea of molten lead. On the horizon, a tiny steamer went by, and I made out the black dot from the corner of my eye be\u00adcause I hadn't stopped watching the Arab. It occurred to me that all I had to do was turn around and that would be the end of it. But the whole beach, throbbing in the sun, was pressing on my back. I took a few steps toward the spring. The Arab didn't move. Besides, he was still pretty far away. Maybe it was the shadows on his face, but it looked like he was laughing. I waited. The sun was starting to burn my cheeks, and I could feel drops of sweat gathering in my eyebrows. The sun was the same as it had been the day I'd buried Maman, and like then, my forehead especially was hurting me, all the veins in it throbbing under the skin. It was this burning, which I couldn't stand anymore, that made me move forward. I knew that it was stupid, that I wouldn't get the sun off me by stepping forward. But I took a step, one step, forward. And this time, without getting up, the Arab drew his knife and held it up to me in the sun. The light shot off the steel and it was like a long flashing blade cutting at my forehead. At the same instant the sweat in my eye\u00ad brows dripped down over my eyelids all at once and covered them with a warm, thick film. My eyes were blinded behind the curtain of tears and salt. All I could feel were the cymbals of sunlight crashing on my forehead and, indistinctly, the dazzling spear flying up from the knife in front of me. The scorching blade slashed at my eyelashes and stabbed at my stinging eyes. That's when everything began to reel. The sea carried up a thick, fiery breath. It seemed to me as if the sky split open from one end to the other to rain down fire. My whole being tensed and I squeezed my hand around the revolver. The trigger gave; I felt the smooth underside of the butt; and there, in that noise, sharp and deafen\u00ading at the same time, is where it all started. I shook off the sweat and sun. I knew that I had shattered the harmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I'd been happy. Then I fired four more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace. And it was like knocking four quick times on the door of unhappiness.\" ",
