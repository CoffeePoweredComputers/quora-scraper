            "answer_text": "This is a marvelous topic, and challenging for several reasons. It\u2019s challenging because the monstrosity of PoMo has its tentacles all over the library. There is PoMo philosophy, PoMo sociology, cultural anthropology, theology, linguistics, political science, art, architecture, and theater. PoMo is huge in literary criticism, media and communication technology, and the philosophy of science and education. PoMo\u2019s wide range tends to make for eclectic top ten book lists. Some people are interested only in the effect of media, others in literary criticism, others in science, and others only in politics and the culture wars. Adding to the challenge is the fact that even the experts can\u2019t agree on a definition of PoMo. There\u2019s an inherent fuzziness to it, such that whenever two informed people discuss or argue about PoMo, the inevitable claim will be that the other person doesn\u2019t understand it. And because PoMo is so much a part of America\u2019s fifty-year-old culture war, it is difficult to maintain a dispassionate and balanced perspective. PoMo began as a weapon of the \u2018New Left\u2019 but was quickly adopted by a \u2018New Right\u2019. In academia PoMo is always liberal. But the reemergence of Creationism, for example, has also been the result of postmodern thought. The Trump phenomenon and fake news are just the latest manifestation. Nevertheless, if you are willing to accept the challenge, i can\u2019t think of a more profitable subject to investigate. For me, all the mysteries of my Boomer generation were revealed by understanding the advent, the pervasiveness, and the persistence of postmodern thought. But where to begin\u2026 If you are intellectually humble, as i am, you won\u2019t mind starting with this comic book intro: 1.) Postmodernism For Beginners, Jim Powell, (1998) The major players are introduced: Saussure, Nietzsche, Levi-Strauss, Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard, Jencks, Jameson, Kristeva, Baudrillard, along with the major concepts: structuralism, poststructuralism, de-centering, deconstruction, simulacra, social constructs and so on. * * * If you are a devout Christian, you should start with this book: 2.) Postmodernism 101: A First Course for the Curious Christian, Heath White, 2006 He puts the concepts of postmodernism into simplistic terms while avoiding the irritating language that postmodernists use \u2013 a language primarily used to justify their own existence. * * * If you are neither humble, nor Christian, then the best two intros to this topic are from the \u2018Very Short Introduction\u2019 series. 3.) Poststructuralism: A Very Short Introduction, Catherine Belsey, 2002 4.) Postmodernism: A Very Short Introduction, Christopher Butler, 2002 I think of this series as intellectualism distilled. They invite a top scholar in a field to write in 120 short pages the most informative and interesting ideas for the general public. I\u2019ve found that even when it\u2019s a topic i\u2019m already familiar with, these books are a joy to read. * * * This next book is an absolute must read if you are interested in the philosophy and politics of postmodernism. 5.) Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to Foucault, Stephen R. C. Hicks, 2004 I tell people that if they are only going to read one book on this topic, Stephen Hicks\u2019s book is the one they should read. * * * I\u2019ve listened to well over a hundred courses from The Great Courses. This course by Professor Steven L. Goldman was one of the most memorable and enlightening. 6.) Science Wars: What Scientists Know and How They Know It, Steven L. Goldman Though you wouldn\u2019t know it by looking at the chapter titles, this course is about a particular skirmish in American academia that took place in the last thirty years of the 20th century. The battle was between the soft and hard sciences and the differences in the way they conceive the quest and creation of knowledge. It was part of a much larger conflict we call America\u2019s culture wars. In this course Goldman does what i think all great scholars do; he puts the conflict into a larger historical perspective, saying that we have always argued over objective truth and socially constructed truth. The course is an explanation of intellectual politics in the late 20th century. But if you are an American you\u2019ll recognize the greater political and social implications, and understand why i\u2019ve included Professor Goldman\u2019s course on my top ten list of sources to understand postmodernism. * * * Into the fray: 7.) The Truth about the Truth: De-confusing and Re-constructing the Postmodern World, edited by Walter Truett Anderson, 1995 There are so many great authors in this selection of essays and interviews. It\u2019s a book that can be read over and over with new insights gained each time. * * * I\u2019ve always thought of my Boomer generation as being in some way sick. But it wasn\u2019t until i investigated PoMo that i was able understand it. PoMo is the sickness. (As i\u2019ve said, it is hard to be dispassionate on this subject.) Ken Wilber is known as a \u2018New Age\u2019 philosopher. 8.) Boomeritis: A Novel That Will Set You Free!: Ken Wilber, 2002 It\u2019s a satirical novel that pokes fun at Boomers and the postmodern way of thinking. Fun stuff. * * * Much of postmodernism has nothing to do with politics and philosophy. It\u2019s all about technology and particularly communication technology. By the time this book was published, the word \u2018postmodernism\u2019 had become unfashionable. But this author describes a \u2018post-truth\u2019 or \u2018post-reality\u2019 world. 9.) Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live in It, Thomas de Zengotita, 2005 Intro \u2013 \u201cThe issue is no longer representation versus reality, phony versus authentic, artificial versus natural. That was for nineteenth-century romantics to worry about. A few existentialists and a bunch of hippies tried to revive those concerns in the twentieth century, but we know what happened to them. We\u2019ve read the books, heard the music, seen the movies \u2013 and the remakes. But there is no going back to reality just as there is no going back to virginity. We have been consigned to a new plane of being engendered by mediating representations of fabulous quality and inescapable ubiquity, a place where everything is addressed to us, everything is for us, and nothing is beyond us anymore.\u201d P18 \u201cSome people refuse to accept the fact that reality is becoming indistinguishable from representation in a qualitatively new way.\u201d - Thomas de Zengotita * * * Finally, here is recent book that describes the long journey America has made toward a denial of reality. Postmodernism is scarcely mentioned in this book. But once you have some knowledge of PoMo, you\u2019ll understand that the current state of American culture is the culmination of fifty years of postmodern thought. 10.) Fantasyland: How America Went Haywire: A 500-Year History: Kurt Andersen, 2017 * * * There are so many more books to read on this subject. As i\u2019ve said, the topic is spread out all over the library. It\u2019s a matter of what particularly interests you about PoMo. If you are crazy enough, and crazy about this topic, here are eighteen more books to consider: 1.) Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason, Michel Focault, 1961 2.) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Thomas S. Kuhn, 1962 3.) Understanding Media: the Extensions of Man, Marshall McLuhan, 1964 4.) The Social Construction of Reality, Berger and Luckmann, 1966 5.) Of Grammatology, Jacques Derrida, 1967 6.) The Postmodern Condition: a Report on Knowledge, Jean-Francios Lyotard, 1979 7.) Is There a Text in This Class? The Authority of Interpretive Communities, Stanley Eugene Fish, 1980 8.) Simulacra and Simulation, Jean Baudrillard, 1981 9.) Postmodernism: or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, Fredric Jameson, 1984\u20131990 10.) The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today's Students, Allan Bloom, 1987 11.) Postmodern Theory: Critical Interrogations, Best and Kellner, 1991 12.) The Construction of Social Reality, John Searle, 1995 13.) A House Built on Sand: Exposing Postmodernist Myths About Science, edited by Noretta Koertge, 1998 14.) Concilience: The Unity of Knowledge, E. O. Wilson, 1998 15.) Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science, Sokal and Bricmont, 1999 16.) The Sokal Hoax: The Sham That Shook the Academy, editors of Lingua Franca, 2000 17.) Beyond the Sokal Hoax: Science, Philosophy and Culture, Alan Sokal, 2008 18.) Save the World on Your Own Time, Stanley Fish, 2008 * * * E. O. Wilson put postmodernism into the most simplistic terms possible in his book Concilience when he wrote: Postmodernism is the ultimate polar antithesis of the enlightenment. The difference between the two extremes can be expressed roughly as follows: Enlightenment thinkers believe we can know everything, and radical postmodernists believe we can know nothing. (p40) - E.O. Wilson, Concilience, 1995 In this sense, postmodernism can be thought of as endarkenment. And it\u2019s telling that the Washington Post, one of America\u2019s premier newspapers, has recently adopted the slogan \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness\u201d. The wonderland of postmodernism awaits. Enjoy your journey. ",

            "answer_text": "My top 5 definitely include, and happen to be some of my favorite books in general, in no particular order:  Infinite Jest, by David Foster Wallace  Gravity's Rainbow, by Thomas Pynchon Crying of Lot 49, by Thomas Pynchon Unbearable Lightness of Being, by Milan Kundera White Noise, by Don DeLillo  These are just a few. Some other favorite titles that come to mind are Super Sad True Love Story (Shteyngart), Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Eggers), Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse Five (Vonnegut), Less Than Zero (Ellis), and Kafka on the Shore (Murakami). There are many more but these are just some of my favorites. If you are looking for a good, short novel to start off with, I recommend Crying of Lot 49. ",
