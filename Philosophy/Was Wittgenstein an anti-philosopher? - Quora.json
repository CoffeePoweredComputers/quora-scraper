            "answer_text": "Yes. Wittgenstein did not consider the great philosophical questions we all inherited from Plato and Aristotle or Descartes and Kant to be meaningful. These so-called \u201cdeep\u201d problems are actually pseudo-problems which arise when our intellects are \u201cbewitched\u201d by language in various ways. Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus and his Philosophical Investigations both, in very different ways, were designed to combat the temptation to answer traditional philosophical questions or to even take them seriously. Wittgenstein also believed that it was almost impossible for an academic philosopher to be a \u201cdecent human being\u201d (although he admitted that G.E. Moore pulled it off). He often counseled his favorite students at Cambridge to, upon graduation, learn a trade or become a doctor (anything but a professor). There was one Great Dead Philosopher, however, who commanded his respect. As he once said, \u201cKierkegaard was the greatest philosopher of the 19th century. Kierkegaard was a saint\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t call him an \u201canti-philosopher\u201d anymore than I would call Diogenes the Cynic one. Wittgenstein had such an interesting outlook on philosophy when compared to his contemporaries. He would preach the virtues of silliness and not taking life too seriously, but he was obviously a very serious man. There are so many levels of complexity inherent to Wittgenstein\u2019s thought processes that it would take a Phd to accurately reveal the many \u201conion skin-like\u201d layers of his mind. One of my favorite Wittgenstein quotes, and one I feel encapsulates his personal philosophy of life as succinctly as possible is, \u201cA serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes.\u201d This demonstrates his playful attitude towards life, but I still have a sinking suspicion that a man of such brilliance was, in fact, extremely melancholic in his private hours.
