I have been cheated on in business, lied to by colleagues and I have to admit that I have done the same to many. It has been really hard to find peace. It has taken contemplation upon contemplation about the true happiness that millions of people talk about and very few actually enjoy. I have read countless books and articles. I have seen thousands of movies recommended to me to understand the nature of humans and the decisions we make under certain circumstances. All this shared knowledge, all the words written by thousand of men over thousands of years, bring the message down to just two aspects of life to make it simpler. Acceptance of everything.Expectations of nothing.",

            "answer_text": "Taking responsibilities seriously and getting them tended to guarantees that life will be pretty much be care free. I highly recommend it to anyone who is always late on rent or mortgage payments, car payments, or the electric utility bill. Of course it helps to have a good mate to pitch in and many wives or partners fit the bill. Around tax time it may be a little lean so going out is less of an option but great meals at home are available for a fraction of the price. Stay out of credit card debt or bargain for no interest on larger purchases and pay them off early. The job can be a pain sometimes but even that is bearable. Everyone has to work, even those who are living off of an inheritance. ",
