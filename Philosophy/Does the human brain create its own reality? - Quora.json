            "answer_text": "Q: Does the human brain create its own reality? Sort of. You have to realize that the human brain is locked in a dark box (the skull) and only senses the outside world through electrical signals, which are generated by biological sensors for sound, light, chemical combinations we call odors, pressure, temperature, touch or texture, and some other odd sensors like orientation (which helps you keep your balance), body positions, accelerations and so on. But it all gets to the brain via electrical cables we call nerves, and those are interpreted to create, in the brain, what we call a \u201cmodel\u201d of the environment and the self. This is usually composed of thousands of sub-models, which can also be composed of sub-models. In my view right now through the window, is my neighbor\u2019s white pickup truck. that is one sub-model among two dozen trees and bushes, five lawns in various states of health, fences, doors, solar panels, chimneys, mailboxes, sidewalks, the street, birds foraging on my lawn, roses, potted herbs on my other neighbor\u2019s lawn, etc. All of those are sub-models within my environment. I am not really seeing them, per se, my brain takes signals that trigger a model, composed of neurons, that represent, say a potted plant I happen to know is tarragon, and that model then emits electrical signals to other models that might be associated (with potted plants in general, or tarragon, or Allison, the owner of this potted tarragon.) Inside the brain there is no image! We feel like there is, because actual images of a potted plant excite the same neural models as an imagined image of a potted plant. What seem like images to us are feelings of neural net works firing. (And guess what, Allison just came out to water her potted plants!) Models are idealized versions of the things we see in reality. My model of a sparrow is no specific sparrow, but in a way an average of all the sparrows I have seen, an ideal sparrow, and then when I see a real sparrow, the brain will \u201csubtract\u201d the ideal sparrow from it and annotate the differences: This real sparrow is bigger than the ideal, it has fewer tail feathers, the differences from our ideal make it look less than ideally healthy. Psychologists have shown that this is how we perceive beauty and health as well: for males or females, if we (using computers ) take metrics for faces and \u201caverage\u201d them all together, we will end up with a face that most people regard as more handsome/beautiful than the real faces. (They\u2019ve done photo beauty contests to prove that.) This suggests that our mind perceives beauty as a kind of \u201cflawlessness\u201d: Our model of a female face is the average of all the female faces we have seen (which varies by our locale) and when we see other faces, what we notice are the differences between them and the ideal. The fewer differences, and the less the severity of the differences, the more beautiful we perceive the face as being. (For elements that cannot be averaged, like eye color, sometimes harmless rarity wins; pale blue or green are uncommon, and often considered more beautiful then the common brown. Red would be uncommon, but not harmless and therefore not beautiful: Our model of \u201cred\u201d associates with health problems, like infections, rashes and bloody injuries). It doesn\u2019t just apply to faces, but to everything we model: Flowers, cars, whatever. A \u201cflawless\u201d car is clean, shiny, without scratches, dents or wear. So yes, we create our own reality in this sense. The brain takes clues from its millions of sensors, and tries to reconstruct the external reality internally using these idealized models, perhaps with exceptions. Our models are being updating throughout our life. But they are necessarily an inaccurate representation of the actual reality. Things will be missed, glossed over, you may not even SEE them in the sense that they were in sight but your brain was too busy to incorporate all the exceptions, especially if your attention was elsewhere. So what you remember is the idealized model with few or no difference tags on it; e.g. all you remember is there was a \u201ccar\u201d. Color? Model? I don\u2019t know, officer, a car. Not a truck. Not a motorcycle. You didn\u2019t \u201cforget\u201d, you were too busy to ever know. We can see this with experiments in which people watch actors doing something, and then recall what they saw, and that differs from the tape. Magicians can be very adept at this sort of misdirection, so when the magicians Penn and Teller watch another magician, to defeat this tendency, Teller is watching the magician\u2019s right hand, while Penn is watching their left. This attentional focus defeats the magician doing something with both hands simultaneously, like distracting with the right while they do something sneaky with their left. The reality created by the brain is an attempt to model the external reality, but because models are necessarily simplified versions of the external reality, idealizations tagged with notable exceptions, actual reality can be a lot different than our perceived reality. That can be especially true when it comes to qualities we infer and do not sense directly at all, like properties of personality or emotion, or quality in product, or the quality of food before you can smell or taste it (judged on sight, e.g. on TV or on a menu). Because the model of a meal that looks ideal will link to a model of taste that is ideal, but might come up short in that sensory department. (Happens to me with apples all the time!) ",

            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cDoes the human brain create its own reality?\u201d It has no choice. The brain isn\u2019t an amoeba rolling around in direct contact with the earth, nor can it pry back its skull to feel the wind and experience the sun and stars directly. Instead, it is wrapped in the protection of the skull, depending on incomplete senses to provide some understanding of the outside reality. We know how the senses work, at least to a first or second order, and we know how long it takes for a sensation in the foot or eye to reach its first stop in the brain. We know how long it takes a novel sensation to be processed before it becomes available to our cognition, and those times range from 100 milliseconds (foot) to over 500 milliseconds (eye). All of the traditional evidence suggests that a human being is some sort of automaton, receiving inputs from the external senses, using them to construct a unified picture that matches the world, using the picture to formulate actions, and instructing our muscles to make the actions happen. This is the input-process-output (IPO) model of the brain. While this has been the physical model of a human for thousands of years, philosophers have known for that same time span from simple observation that it doesn\u2019t explain human behavior or experience. The earliest and perhaps clearest expression of this dilemma is Plato\u2019s Allegory of the Cave, where he suggests that there is a \u201creal\u201d reality available if we will only step outside the cave. This conundrum has encouraged thinkers to create many explanations of our lived experience that can be consistent with our understanding of how the material of the body works. Most of them involve inventing a new substance, called variously the mind, soul, consciousness, etc., that is related to the brain somehow, but has a more direct connection with \u201creal\u201d reality. The fact that we humans, and all but the simplest animals, live life in real time requires an explanation. I believe that we have evolved to live in an incomplete internal reality in real time, rather than a complete, objectively true reality that lags the present moment by seconds. In other words, any animal that chose to live with the IPO brain architecture was eaten by an animal that accepted a lesser reality. I\u2019ve written extensively about the limitations of the human senses. They are far from perfect, and I would characterize them only as \u201cgood enough\u201d. The limitations of our senses lead inexorably to limitations of how we see the world. Our evolution allowed us to succeed as a species by disconnecting us from reality. The only reality we can experience is the one we create inside the skull. We must make the best of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Does the human brain create its own reality? The human brain perceives reality based on the things we have learned. Most of the things we have learned, are based on the perceptions of reality created by other people. People that lived in the past and people that are currently sharing their perceptions of reality. Realities are perceived through social interactions, the writing of philosophers, scientists, religious leaders, and from the various types of transmitted media. The things we have learned from other people\u2019s perceptions of reality, has influence our perceptions of reality. Based on these influences the brain creates a version of reality. The word reality is a \u201creference\u201d to a moment of perception. A perception that is experienced due to the \u201ceffects\u201d of a sensory experience, or due to the \u201ceffects\u201d generated when we access our \u201cinfluential\u201d memories. Our moment to moment realities, are moment to moment perceptions. Example: The perceived reality of a sensory experience is based on sensory memories that trigger the recognition of a stimulus. Creating a sensory perceived reality. This in turn triggers access to word associative memories and from them we create a language-based version of reality. Our word associative memories are the basis for how we typically perceive reality. Our thoughts are language-based creations of reality. The things we perceive are \u201crepresentations\u201d of our experiences. This has been pointed out many times in other Quora postings. Most people don\u2019t know that what we perceive are \u201crepresentations\u201d of our experiences, and all of us that do know, still perceive our sensory experiences as word associatively triggered moments of reality. Knowing that our perceptions are only representations of sensory and language triggered mental events, does not change our perceptions of reality. \u201cDoes the brain create its own reality?\u201d It does, but as you can see, the answer is a little complicated. Based on individual experiences we create our own realities. Example: Hitting your finger with a hammer, triggers the creation of a reality and the creation of an \u201cinfluential\u201d memory. A language-based description of the experience is a representation of the reality of the experience. When we access the memories of hitting our finger with a hammer, (sensory and language based) the \u201cinfluential\u201d aspect of the stored memory triggers the perception of the reality. Our language-based perceptions of reality have been influenced by the perceived realities of various people. People that are living and people that died centuries ago. I hope this answers your question. If you want to delve deeper into how our memories \u201cinfluence\u201d the creation of our \u201creality\u201d then continue reading. Accessed memories influence our moment to moment perception of reality. Accessed memories trigger our emotions. Motivate us. Influence us to defend the realities that our beliefs represent and determine the strength of the realities we perceive. When we create a memory, it is assigned a memory encoding. The memory encoding is based on a stimulus and is translated into electrical impulses. The electrical impulses are represented on memory traces electro-chemically. This is accomplished by charging neurons and the assignment of neurotransmitters. One of the functions of neurotransmitters is to represent a memory\u2019s importance level. Neurotransmitter represent the level of a memory\u2019s stored valuation. A valuation that determines a memory\u2019s \u201cinfluence\u201d when it is accessed. Memory valuations vary from low temporary levels of valuations, to levels of valuations based on repetitive experiences and valuations that are assigned due to survival and or emotionally triggered events. All memories receive a level of assigned valuations as they are created and stored. The perception of our moment to moment realities is the \u201ceffect\u201d triggered by the influences of our accessed (valued) memories. Memories that represent sensory experiences (Reality) or language defined perceptions of reality. Example: If it looks like a cardboard box. Feels like a cardboard box and triggers access to visual, and tactile memories. Then a reality is perceived. The sensory memories trigger access to word associative meanings, and the triggered perception of a cardboard box. When we access memories that have been assigned emotional levels of valuations, the accessed memories trigger the emotions of the previous experiences. The emotions trigger the \u201ceffect\u201d of a perceived reality. Emotions, such as joy, fear and even anxieties are \u201cat the moment\u201d triggered perceptions of reality. Many of our realities are based on memory valuations that have been corrupted by misinformation. When accessed, corrupted memory valuations trigger the creation of bogus realities. ",

            "answer_text": "As most others have said, YES. However, the reason it does so is one of limitations. Our brain is very slow by computer standards. Our memory capacity is also very limited. Accordingly, we have evolved to make a lot of assumptions. The world around us moves very quickly. We have to be able to make an internal map of the external world with very little information and react with very little time to think. Mostly our brain makes very quick guesses and even acts on them before we have time to even start to think about the situation. That is why a tree root can appear to be a snake and we jump back for fear of it before our conscious thinking process has even noticed the root at all. We may remember seeing the snake clearly, but magically it has turned into a root after we recover. This is perhaps the reason why we originally believed in magical creatures in the forest. This is why we can read books that provide little description and still give us the type of imagery normally seen in watching movies. We also come up with many \u201crules of thumb\u201d based on very inaccurate assumptions of the world. We may not even be aware we have done this. We may unconsciously assume that all bearded men are evil because a couple of them in our life treated us badly. The \u201creality generator\u201d in our brain is very important. It pieces together an image of the world around us from a few quick glances, smell, touch, and lots of filling from memory and our imagination. It keeps working at night, creating vivid dreams that seem real while we are having them. But it is the reason our memory of events is very poor and changes over time. Future AI will have to have a robust reality generator, but most likely it will not be nearly as good as ours. Rather, more accurate sensors, a huge memory capacity, and thousands of parallel processors, each specializing in a different kind of analysis, will generate far more real maps of the external world than ours in the same amount of time. Unlike humans whose short term memory starts to fade quickly to open up space for new sensations, sensory buffers in robots will store lots of data that can be analyzed later to produce a more accurate analysis of the world, potential threats, the identity of all people in view, chemical analysis, etc. Most robots will pause for a few seconds to complete a more accurate analysis before taking action, unlike more reckless humans. However, military robots will kill far more quickly and efficiently than anything portrayed in movies like Terminator. ",

            "answer_text": "I see it the way Mark explained; there is just the one reality (all that which is actual.) However, our sense (or perception) of it is merely a useful fiction. An experience that exists only in our own minds but with the fidelity necessary to survive. For example, the colors we experience are pure fictions even though a small fraction of them do correspond to wavelengths of light the majority are manufactured by our minds to interpret a mixture of those frequencies. Our internal model is finely tuned for efficiency. A very small fraction of your visual field can detect color (the rest only brightness) yet our brains hide that from us by making it seem like our entire visual field is registering color. Likewise for our blind spot which is also cleverly concealed. That aspect of our minds\u2014blending prior knowledge with incoming sensory data\u2014is what we experience as reality. The most noteworthy aspect of this process is that we\u2019re ill-suited to be uncertain about practically anything. We\u2019ve evolved a host of deeply ingrained prejudices (like the presumption of agency to explain the unexpected) that unconsciously fill in all the blanks. But there\u2019s good news too. While we can\u2019t directly experience reality we can deduce what is real. For starters, we can deduce that the universe must be an inviolately lawful place for pure mathematics to be capable of describing it with such astonishing accuracy. And that simple fact allows us to rely on a straightforward algorithm (the so-called scientific method) to eventually work out as much about the true nature of reality as it is possible to know. And even why what we experience is what it is, and how it got that way. So in a literal sense the answer is no. Brains are manufactured by reality\u2014not the other way around. However, only our experience or perception of reality matters\u2014can shape our behavior, affect us, and is what feels real to our cognition. And that \u201cplace\u201d is a product of our brains. In that sense the answer is yes. ",

            "answer_text": "Does the human brain create its own reality? Reality is a hypothetical medium by which one individual (you) can interact with other (hypothetical) individuals. I would say: no. \u201cReality\u201d is a euphemism there. As it appears in your question. Reality is not really the word. Let\u2019s get real. It\u2019s obvious that all you experience of reality is in your head! Same goes for me, just sub in \u201cmy head.\u201d \u2018Course. We know that. All sensory input streaming into conscious awareness. Building up in memory, stored experience. Whipped out into connection and relation, deducing and concluding. Spotting discrepancy and refining out error. Building up and improving a conceptual model of reality. All this is yes, in your head. However, let me just be sensible and observe: most of us perceive or accept that other individuals (perceived) are more than likely things like us. Not creations of our head. I mean, this is theoretically possible, but what\u2019s more likely? That you created me? That you are the only one in existence, and all apparent others are your beloved figments? Or that other perceived beings are beings, much like us, existing in the same relation to each other: headspace shut-ins, each equally dependent from a shared reality. Moving and negotiating a perceived outer shared realm of physics by means of reflex, intellect and sense(s). Chiefly we navigate by assuming that reality is what\u2019s outside one\u2019s head. I mean yes, your head is in reality too. It\u2019s part of reality. Yet if we think of it on the \u201cshared reality\u201d model, there really is almost no reality inside your head. Almost none. Compared to how sheer much reality is outside? What have you got in there? It\u2019s a slow-cookin\u2019 big noodle in a bioelectrochemical fizz broth! It\u2019s a lump of wet jazz. It\u2019s an amazing thing to be sure, and let\u2019s not stunt it. But let\u2019s not inflate it to cosmic proportions, either. Compared to the cosmos? There is no comparison. The reality\u2019s out there, chum. I believe that\u2019s accurate. \u201cReality\u201d is an inadequate and inaccurate word for what\u2019s in one\u2019s head. \u201cConceptual model of reality, continuously updated by live sensory input,\u201d sure. Perception! \u201cPerception\u201d is just the word for what\u2019s in your head. What the human brain creates is not \u201cits own reality.\u201d It creates its own perception. Its own perceptual/conceptual matrix. \u201cBased on\u201d or \u201cinspired by\u201d reality, sure. Not \u201ca reality.\u201d A perception. Not \u201cits own reality.\u201d Its own dynamic senses-spiked conceptual model of reality.  However, if you or anyone speaks of \u201cmy reality\u201d or \u201cmy own reality,\u201d that\u2019s totally okay. People in general know what you mean. You don\u2019t mean you think reality is all in your head. You kind of mean the opposite. Be fair! To speak of \u201cmy reality\u201d or \u201cone\u2019s own reality\u201d isn\u2019t grandiose at all, it\u2019s humble. You mean you\u2019re aware that in your head is where you keep your copy. You mean that you\u2019re aware bias is the woodgrain of conscious awareness. Unavoidable and universal to humanity, but each one\u2019s bias as it grows, is caught and throttled and refined away, is not caught and thrives unawares, directing us by distortion of perception in ways that induce noncorrespondence to reality - each individual\u2019s bias is unique, and some bias (typically known bias) may even be good. You know that you are biased, that \u201cyour reality\u201d (i.e. perception) is not a perfect overlap with reality. For one thing, some distortion and loss are entailed by limitation alone. By the fact that all this available content is being spot-sampled via an often inattentive awareness in one single point of you. Point of you. Yes, \u201cpoint of you,\u201d too, but more to the point: point of you. It means you\u2019re aware of your own subjectivity. And that\u2019s cool. In fact, I\u2019d call it \u201cpretty cool.\u201d By saying \u201cits own\u201d or \u201cmy reality,\u201d you\u2019re pretty much copping to the fact you know your copy is NOT reality per se. It\u2019s a much, much tinier and far greater (in some senses) (such as perhaps yours) personal picture. A funky slice - your own. It features random, superhuge zoom on things others probably wouldn\u2019t notice or care about! It has an overall minuscule fidelity by comparison with the whole real deal. The hard copy. But nobody has that. Nobody has objectivity. It\u2019s the fantasy viewpoint: the view with the viewer subtracted. No one has had or ever could come out upon such view. So yes, limited! Yes, biased - in favor or against, according to our bent, tendency, inclination. According above all to what we value. Yet a pretty nifty app, for all that. Continuously-updated live by streaming content. I mean, how much do we expect to fit in there? It\u2019s not much bigger than a volleyball. I\u2019d say we get a pretty good-sized land of make-believe and make-it-fit in there. Respectable feat for a relatively-puny creature of our instincts and drives, capacities and inclinations. In most cases, preferences as well. A perception of reality. That\u2019s what the human brain creates. From scratch, since before birth. From available materials of sight, sound, scent, taste, touch and balance. From within the pull of gravity, and without appreciable let or hindrance once we bust loose all grabby and walky and talky. A perception that builds depth and resolution as it goes. Well, depending on the goer. ",

            "answer_text": "I think that this question is the wrong way around. The brain does not create its own reality. Our mental states reflect the reality that produces them. This is done by electrical signals from the sense organs being thoroughly processed by neurological brain structures, which are continuously improved by experience. We do not perceive things in terms of mental models or representations. We perceive objects in the external world, directly, by means of the sensory signals that objects give off, and our neurological processing of them (which is done automatically, extremely quickly and unconsciously). However, these systems can be fooled by sensory illusions. These help us to find out exactly how these systems work. With such illusions, we soon realise that direct perception does\u2019t work, because we get contradictory, absurd or distorted results. So, we then unconsciously fall back on constructing mental models, to try to understand the illusion. Subjective experience is often objectively the case. For instance, when a lot of people observe the same event. And \u2018\u2018this \u2018mass objectivity\u2019 is good evidence in favour of my hypothesis. Although the sensory experience is the same for nearly everyone, taking different view points into account, different people will almost certainly have different opinions and different emotional reactions to what they\u2019ve experienced, and this could affect their account of it, even if they\u2019re trying to be honest and truthful. There are many global, mental and emotional variables which could affect someone\u2019s account. Eg bias, political persuasion, religious beliefs, opinions etc etc. Physical reality is a definite state of affairs, and our perceptions of them are generally an excellent reflection of that reality which gives rise to it. Furthermore, our various perceptions all agree with each, when experiencing a particular event. Which means that they are very sensitively integrated. This is no model. It is an accurate mental experience of our external world. Mental reality, based on brain malfunctions, rather than on objective experience, are very difficult to understand, diagnose and treat. All that we can say is that they are based on an interaction between past experience, which may include psychological trauma, genetic factors and present circumstances. If the illness was cased by trauma, then therapy can be very helpful.. If it\u2019s genetically based, then only medication can help, and there are now excellent, clean meds that are now available.

            "answer_text": "Does the human brain create its own reality? Absolutely! I wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to do it! In fact no one else can. Everything that you have done, thought about doing, along with how you compare that to what other people say, is an integral part of that. So, it seems that lots of beliefs are going to be considered delusional, because they are. That\u2019s why they are beliefs, and beliefs are different than facts. You can be delusional in a group, and it is considered normal. There are many examples throughout the world, so I won\u2019t mention them specifically. There is a profound difference, between delusions and psychosis. If someone has an account that sounds impossible to have occurred, doesn\u2019t mean delusions or psychosis. Whatever your reality is, it\u2019s created by your brain. Many parts of everyone\u2019s reality are composed of shared delusions. To someone with psychosis, their hallucinations are reality during that time, and likely has an identifiable medical condition. It would affect their reality. What we really mean when we say reality, is that we probably don\u2019t understand it ourselves. We do the best we can to interpret and integrate experiences, and to correlate them with others, further contributing to our reality. At that point confirmation bias becomes a significant factor. In order to keep a clean interface, or whatever other reasons, we will notice things that conform to our perceived reality. Depending on a variety of factors, confirmation bias can make a simple set of circumstances, flow into entirely new experiences. It\u2019s an easy shoot from the hip response people can use to argue against lots of things, making reality a difficult property to define. ",

When you talk about reality do you mean what we think and feel, say and do on a daily moment to moment basis? Because really that is just conditioning from past experience and from significant role models particularly from our youngest age. Generally our reality confirms our conditioning and vice versa.Psychologists largely agree that our view of ourselves and hence world view is set by the age of three.Some take the rest of their lives attempting to alter that self image. Some find confirmation only good or bad.Jesus taught \u201ca man is as he thinks\u201d but it hasn\u2019t sunk in yet, the wider implications. \u201cEnergy follows thought\u201d, which is why the great spiritual teachers all taught harmlessness of thought, or correct thought.Our world is filled with wrong thought, desire for war, greed, and complacency which causes starvation and other harm and all this has a direct affect on matter. Even the matter that forms weather and forms the planet itself.The main reason we can think like this is because we have been educated by the prevailing systems to believe we are separate from one another. It is a myth, the myth of separation.When we comprehend that there is no separation in Life we will stop doing terrible things to each other and an equilibrium will return to the natural world in return.Energy follows thought. Yes we can make our own personal reality to a degree and we can influence those around us to a degree. And we can lead loving lives helping each person we have contact with but world change will only come with change of world thought.I forget who said \u201cchange oneself to change the world\u201d.A big part of the problem is our attachment to material planes, to money, profits, to power over others and to this end the Buddha gave us The Four Noble Truths. Our reality changes when we lose our attachment to the material levels. As Jesus taught, we will be in the world but not of it.Reality, no one persons reality is separate from anyone elses. ",

As the human brain can \u201cdeny reality\u201d by refusing to acknowledge or accept it for a variety of reasons (some cannot face the truth and accept facts). So their mind will perceive \u201creality\u201d another way that they can cope with or which fits with their belief system or agenda. In this regard the human mind is creating its own perception of reality which may become distorted. Where others through acceptance of reality, have a sounder perception of it, that the mind processes but does not create; - and are more likely to be able to deal with it, make logical judgments and find solutions. The human brain can be trained to create its own reality through one\u2019s \u201cbelief system\u201d or through \u201climited knowledge and experience\u201d. For example some who have had bad experiences may believe and define the reality of the world/life as \u201can unsafe, cruel and a bad place or state of being\u201d. Where others have the insight that there is good also and view the real reality of life as a shade of grey. Reality depends on how the mind perceives things and its capacity to \u201ccomprehend reality\u201d. Whether insight is present that \u201ccan see and grasp\u201d the truth of any matter being the reality. Or perceives a \u201cdistorted version\u201d of it either willingly (to suit/denial), or through faulty thinking and/or limited knowledge and life experience. Some will be more \u201cin-tune\u201dwith reality than others as they \u201copen up their minds to it\u201d through acceptance, thus acquiring more knowledge and a deeper insight of reality. There are less psychological barriers which produces a \u201cclearer perception\u201d, freeing the mind up to process a sounder grip of reality. While with some through either denial of reality, disease/mental illness, faulty thinking/mindset, tunnel vision/grandiose pride and lack of insight - results with the mind creating and processing a reality based on \u201cmisguided or distorted perception\u201d - that if severe enough the mind can potentially lose \u201ctouch with reality becoming delusional\u201d.

            "answer_text": "The human brain creates our individual perception of reality. Reality exists whether we perceive it or not. Evolution has, over millions of years, finely tuned our senses and perceptions to experience the natural world quite accurately\u2026. Else we would not have survived. We are capable of detecting the very minor visual differences between ripe and unripe fruit, or fruit with perhaps diseases\u2026. We can tell if meat we\u2019ve cooked has \u201cgone off\u201d and is dangerous to eat\u2026. We can detect patterns and movement very acutely. Other animals can do these things better than we in many cases\u2026 A dog has a sense of smell thousands of times more acute than our own, for instance. But the meat is still rotting, whether we must hold it to our nose to sniff, or if a dog can detect this from 50 yards away. Note that our individual perceptions differ from each other\u2026.But only slightly. If I ask 100 people to describe this reddish hardened clay object I\u2019m holding, they would likely all say \u201cthat\u2019s a brick\u201d. Not, \u201cthat\u2019s a cucumber\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s a turtle\u201d. If I hold up a red rose, again the vast majority of people would say that it\u2019s color was \u201cred\u201d. (Even though roses come in other colors) The only exception would be the small percentage of the population who are having some degree of \u201ccolor-blindness\u201d. We may not individually perceive the \u201cexact\u201d same shade of red, but it would be quite close. Color, after all, is dependent on the particular frequency of visible light that\u2019s reflected from a given object. The frequency is exactly the same, in the case of our rose, so very likely our individual visual cortexes see it pretty much the same way. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. Yes in two ways (maybe more) \u2014 1. Optical illusions. You ordinarily look at something, the brain interprets it, and gives you an image.  However, the interpretation may be an incorrect representation of the actual thing you\u2019re looking at in some cases.  He owns a gun... Or is that just a drawing? /  A wine cup. /  The cat\u2019s going up the stairs, not down. / 2. Dreams. This is another way the brain creates its own reality. We\u2019ve all had bizarre dreams which we had no control over. It seems the brain just makes up whatever images or places or faces it wants to in these cases.  / On the flipside, no, the human brain does not create its own reality strictly speaking. Reality is totally independent of what the brain perceives or prefers. Gravity for example will take effect whether we like it or not. That being said, the Bible does mention that we have the ability to change reality by faith. In essence creating our own reality. Peter for example created his own reality when he walked upon the sea. At that point he didn\u2019t care too much for the phenomenon called gravity. His brain however began to pay attention to the turbulent winds and waves, which in turn made him become afraid, and thus reverted him back to the ordinary default reality as he began to sink. So the brain creates its own reality, and the brain does not create its own reality.  \u201cO ye of little faith\u2026\u201d Thanks for asking. ",

            "answer_text": "There are different perspectives from which this can be approached, but increasingly these all lead to the same answer - yes - but each with a different implication. (1) From the current scientific paradigm of objective realism (the assumptions that the universe is physically out \u201cthere\u201d (real) and open to independent scrutiny (objective) - both of which is being challenged by quantum physics) the simple answer is yes. Sensory inputs are turned into biochemical cascades in the brain. It is claimed that these are then turned into mental models which we experience as sensory objects. Therefore, the world you perceive with your senses right now is, according to science, being created by your brain. Because of its foundational assumptions (objective realism), science believes that we can, nevertheless, deduce the nature of the (assumed) reality out there. This, however, is beginning to unravel as quantum physics challenges both objectivity and realism. It should also be noted that this perspective leads to the hard problem of consciousness, which is insurmountable. In this perspective the brain is considered real, and the perceptions are subjective secondary effects. (2) From deep Darwinism, experience did not evolve to represent reality, but only to show us useful representations that enable us to best survive. The assumption that the fittest mental representation would be the most accurate has been shown to be wrong. From this perspective, all we ever experience is a selected \u201cicon\u201d which has no inherent need to represent truth. Cats, tables, Colours, space, time\u2026 everything\u2026 is just a functional interface for survival like the interface of your computer. The icons on your computer desktop \u201cwork\u201d but tell you nothing about the functioning of the reality (electrons in silicon) that is behind it. Likewise the world we see, study and measure can tell us nothing of the reality behind it. In this perspective the reality \u201cout there\u201d is the forever unknowable Darwinian \u201cSelector\u201d. Experience as a whole is the selected (created) reality, but not created by the brain as we usually think of it, as that is itself merely another icon (selected representation), and as such has no intrinsic reality. The unknowable selector behind it all is the real source of reality. (3) From self-knowledge. If you engage in correct self-observation you can arrive at a direct perception of the method by which you create your reality. It is possible to see how sensory experience (E.g. the room in front of you now) is mixed with your imagination (E.g. the adjacent room, street, country, planet that you can\u2019t see right now) to create the impression of an extended 3d world which you never directly experience. Through careful observation of your own thinking mechanism you can learn how thinking involves you accepting reasonable impressions, I.e. accepting you are perceiving what you are not (I.e. accepting self-told lies). Through meditation, in which you learn to detach from this compulsive conceptualising, there is the possibility of seeing the nature of reality behind your perception directly. The psychological method by which \u201creality\u201d is assembled can then be understood and the unknowable reality behind it (the \u201cselector\u201d in 2, above) can be directly perceived (But only to the degree that imagination is put aside) and is found to be identical to the mystic\u2019s (but not the theist\u2019s) god, reality, or divine consciousness. It appears as \u201cnothing\u201d (uncreated), permanent (eternal), causative (the creator), foundational (the origin or alpha), final (the destiny or omega). But such things cannot be conceived only experienced for yourself. In this perspective only consciousness of the nothing is real, and the brain is only a concept created within consciousness through a kind of unconsciousness (thought). ",

We can grow up being educated earth is flat, as long as we eat healthy, exercise daily, we can still live a happy life and die in old age. The truth is average Joe like you and me would have difficulty proving or disapproving if Earth is really flat or not. Our knowledge are built upon others study. And the more we know about the world, the more we don\u2019t know about the world. Knowledge of science is constantly expanding. Whatever latest discovery in science becomes obsolete in 30 seconds. So it all comes down to are we a nice person in practice? You can believe whatever you like. The question is. Can you get rid of your bad addictions? Can you get rid of impulsive behaviour, and random emotional explosion? Can you be in equanimity in 60 minutes of silence? Our vision are very limited compare with eagle. Our sense of smell is almost like blind compare with dogs. We have zero echolocation. We can\u2019t really tell the direction. We can\u2019t really fly at all. Our running speed is behind a rabbit. Our consciousness is a very limited prediction and hallucination machine. We use a lot of our hunches and other people\u2019s knowledge to figure out this world. We are never right at this absolute reality and truth. So each person and animal created their version and painting of reality. Only good enough to survive and pass on their DNA codes in our particular environment. Every day we should have a meditation session to reset our understanding of our universe and truth. So that we are not so attached to outcome and results. Too much attachment with our reality causing us to have emotional bankruptcy and the suicide rate growth in last 20 years. You know each year, there are more than one million people suicide? Why die for a hallucinated reality? We all need to wake up and realize that our waking state is just another level of sleep. How is meditation able to awaken our understanding of reality? The real meditation is 60 minutes in silence where you shut down all your mental tasks. No Pavolov\u2019s dog conditioning. There will be many sensation in that 60 minutes. However, there is no reaction. When you are just day dreaming for 60 minutes, you would have a truck load of different reaction. BUT in meditative state, you lock your reaction into equanimity. You only observe your breath as it is. You train twice per day. This absolute zero reaction is the absolute truth about this universe. Any reaction would be a hallucination in absolute truth. Some would argue meditation is an escapism and turning people into vegetable. The truth is the opposite. You only invest 8% of your time to restore your emotional body, motivation system and allow maximum rest. You have 92% of your time to take care life, pay taxes and love your family. Meditation is only an extension of your rest and sleep. Modern human are all lack of sleep and rest. And real meditation is not hiding in the mountain. Minimum practice time per day is 2 hours. And maximum practice time per day is also 2 hours. Many would also argue 1 hour is too difficult. I like to start with 2 minutes, 10 minutes and 20 minutes. I love instant gratification. Unfortunately, meditation is the complete opposite of instant gratification. Without 60 minutes, there is no real benefits. The real meditation begin from the 46th minute to the 60th minute. The first 45 minutes only a warm up and settle down. The equanimity in the final 15 minutes has the most power to break our habit pattern and past conditioning. That\u2019s just simple biology of human brain. You show up at gym for 10 minutes will not give you muscle growth. You must hit the required minimum dosage. Don\u2019t believe a word I said here. Simply try it for 10 days and experience the non-hallucinated reality of truth. I maybe wrong. ",

            "answer_text": "Does the human brain create its own reality? The human brain does create its own reality. This is what the philosophy of Adam Smith, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, and Arthur Schopenhauer established. David Hume\u2019s whole explanation of this was a critical part of Charles Darwin\u2019s education. It was the special indoctrination of Darwin by Hume that was responsible for his knee jerk anger to Wallace\u2019s spiritualism. Immanuel Kant developed Hume\u2019s complicated take of reality farther. He was true to Hume\u2019s views on causality yet he is credited with correcting Hume in that pure reason is involved. Here is a good passage from Schopenhauer that explains it. I am not saying I can discuss this clearly only that it is a nice and neat clip directly of Kant\u2019s correction of Hume: \u201cIf any truth can be asserted a priori, it is this: for it is the expression of the most general form of all possible and thinkable experience: a form which is more general than time, or space, or causality, for they all presuppose it; and each of these, which we have seen to be just so many modes of the principle of sufficient reason, is valid only for a particular class of ideas; whereas the antithesis of object and subject is the common form of all these classes, is that form under which alone any idea of whatever kind it may be, abstract or intuitive, pure or empirical, is possible and thinkable.\u201d The correction of Hume by Kant and the subsequent development of it by Schopenhauer is well and good yet it is dampened by Kant\u2019s drift (in his later years) from the straight and narrow, which he himself fell into in his vigorous youth. I am talking about Kant\u2019s absurd ethics he developed in his old age. Schopenhauer did correct Kant on his mistake. He was very thorough on how age played a role and he, in Smith fashion, brought to mind the pestering for a ethics more suitable to the system the capitalist made up, that Kant was subject to. The capitalist of the era didn\u2019t like the ethics of Hume as it led to the economics of Smith simply because it brought to mind how and why to subject them to regulation. It was because of this last that he can be understood to not understand the power of the ideas of Smith and Hume. He did explain it to the best of his ability but he would have been more complete and accurate had he used these more suited ideas. In light of this it needs to be realized that the lack of awareness of basics is the chief cause of haughtiness. There is a disconnection that tends the mind to explain critical development as a correction. No one has a clear understanding of how Kant corrected Hume. If they did they could explain it whereas Hume\u2019s basics used to give us economics and evolution would be corrected. This doesn't make sense unless there is a better economics and evolution and whereas they are connected more so that Smith\u2019s economics and Darwin\u2019s evolution are connected. The modern mind that feels Kant corrected Hume has to explain how this correction had no bearings on Hume as the critical aid for two critical sciences, economics and evolution, that are compatible. If Hume were indeed corrected it would be a serious blow to economics and evolution. There are evolutionists that will explain the impossibility of evolution being proved wrong yet none will explain the full impossibility but I will. The evidence that Hume is responsible for Smith as well as Darwin and Smith is part of the antecedent to Darwin (Hume\u2019s ideas with Smith\u2019s system that resulted from them are together a bigger antecedent to Darwin than either separately) provides proof of Darwin on top of what the typical eggheads are aware of. All I am saying is the eggheads are aware of extreme weight behind Darwin yet they are not aware of the full extremity of it. It is the nature of the complex precursory Hume with Smith to Darwin [is], that is, the human mind clearly evolved, that gives to the eggheads so aware by [this] route, the full extremity of the proof for Darwin\u2019s theory. Just to be clear, the eggheads that are aware of the particular contribution of Hume with Smith on top of the traditional stuff, the biology of it, grasp the full extremity of proof for Darwin. These are the precious eggheads for they know how to explain the mistakes of western philosophy, Kant\u2019s ethics was the whopper and Wallace\u2019s spiritualism next in line, completely whereas the full weight of proof supporting evolution is brought to mind. I need to make one more point to cement this understanding. Adam Smith\u2019s reality is the central reality. This means there is not a dumb ass of economics, evolution, psychology, political science, philosophy, etc., in existence where the dumb ass ness can\u2019t be exploded by the reality that was in his head. This is true if the mind with [it], Smith\u2019s reality, will go to the trouble to understand how it is connected to Hume and with Hume to Darwin. Just to be clearly understood as far as the reality that is in my head and bursting to get out, there is a great number and variety of dumb asses out there. Just as Smith is extremely complimentary to evolution the dumb asses are complimentary to dumb ass ism itself. You could not have the difficulty in tying Adam Smith to evolution without the complex dumb asses and the complex debate they are responsible for. ",

To get past this question I have to explain a logical error which appears everywhere in scientific circles, and which scientists are happy to promote \u2026 it flatters them hugely. The Fallacy of Prediction: When once scientist manages, by hard research to learn how to predict a phenomenon (like light, gravity, magnetism, radiation etc.) he/she goes public and the public telling that he/she can predict something previously unpredictable and the public is hugely impressed: Einstein, Curie, Avogadro, Volta, Newton, Galileo etc. then become famous, are lionized, and it will inevitably be said of them that they discovered how nature works because they figured out how to predict previously mysterious events and if they can do that then they are geniuses and they understand that particular bit of nature. It\u2019s rubbish, all they can do is predict, they can do that without understanding gravity, radiation or the true nature of light. Tons of evidence for this phenomenon. That\u2019s the fallacy of prediction: all of use assume that the woman or man who discovers the predictive formulas must understand what they predict. The next thing you find is that people (the whole culture) will stop worrying about the now predictable events and a new mystery takes the attention of the research community, and the public drives them on so that they and the public will come to understand \u201cour World\u201d. teachers will explain it all, roughly, to all the kids and they will grow up \u2018knowing \u2018why\u2019 there is gravity, why light is the maximum speed attainable, why electricity can flow down a solid copper wire (it doesn\u2019t) as if it were a pipe, etc. In short, they come to believe that a mystery has been solved, an explanation is now available to them. Well, that be the myth. Science predicts, yes, but it does not explain. Newton was asked soon after he became famous for having got the first general equations for gravitation, he was asked \u201cwhat then is gravity\u201d he replied immediately that he had not the slightest idea, he only knew its effects. He was credited with knowing what gravity was and he stubbornly denied it. He was a mighty good logician! And an honest man. Now, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen with the brain. We will study it carefully, scientifically, until we can predict its effect on the human body its in. That will happen. But we will not get to understand how the brain discovers reality, how it sees colour a thousand miles away etc., . So that\u2019s the answer: the brain research reaches the public and the prediction come rattling in, they, us, will feel that the mysteries of the brain, and so of the mind, have been resolved. Look, even Newton did not claim to understand gravity! The discoverers of electricity remained baffled! We can learn to predict but explanations elude us. What you are asking for is an explanation and, guaranteed, neither you nor me will ever get one. And that\u2019s philosophy. ",

            "answer_text": "Your personality is not the same as mine or even not the same as any of the members of your family. Twins don\u2019t have the same personality and beliefs? Your mind created all this separately from another from the verbal thinking mind. Even though your pathway of the mind is the same as the next person you still created your own illusions and your personality came about as a result of these experiences. This is what the verbal thinking mind does. It is its job to create ideas and also create the Lie in the Truth that is also in you. It creates the Lie in you by spinning an observation or a fact in you to something else which is completely different from its source. You can ask an artist how from one idea his mind could have created a 100 1000 possible ways to manifest the idea. The mind can make different patterns of the same idea and hence twins becoming not the same together even though they might look alike. The process of this and that of the mind can be so subtle that when one same idea shifts between 2 people it can create 2 entirely different patterns in the mind. All done from here in the verbal thinking mind where one has to self-talk what one wants to think if one wants to think at all.  It is a real zinger this road map. Drop anything on to it or any problem you have and it can tell you where it is coming from. Try and not make up too much with your own verbal thinking mind when you are trying to investigate a problem using the road map. The road map is what the ancients have passed onto us. The baseline and how we use it is common to all of us. Yet if we continue to use the verbal thinking mind to interpret a problem then we are just going to create one lie after another all over again. Only the intuitive silent mind can show you what is hidden from you and it solutions possibly come from the greater larger and all truthful Universal Mind or the repository of the Cosmos. Stop verbalising your thoughts and become silent in mind and observe intuitively, being watching making no judgements of what you are \u201cpictorially thinking\u201d in the silent mind and see if a solution come to mind, like magic it appears in an aha moment. Thinking is no effort on your part after you leave the verbal thinking mind. Choiceless observation of active being state of mind. Just watching. Your personality is your own reality. Thinking created that. What type of thinking created it? Verbal thinking created it.  See we are all made up of a combination of this visual-spatial or self-talk thinking. So on top of our personalities of not being the same our minds also come in different amounts of different patterns. Are you surprised twins don\u2019t have similar personalities or different realities? See how the minds of the world are created just because of the way we think and how much of what type of thinking we use. Can you believe it of how we separate each other from another just because of the type of thinking we use? Not how we think! but the type of thinking we use more over the other.  Are you looking for more proof of what I am saying is correct or not. Here from some of the greats of how the thinking mind works:  Catch this live stream discussion tomorrow and see what they say. See what Jiddu Krishnamurti says: \u201cBut then we went on to consider the general disorder and confusion that pervades the consciousness of mankind. It is here that I encountered what I feel to be Krishnamurti\u2019s major discovery. What he was seriously proposing is that all this disorder, which is the root cause of such widespread sorrow and misery, and which prevents human beings from properly working together, has its root in the fact that we are ignorant of the general nature of our own processes of thought. \u201d \u2014David Bohm In spite of my rudeness, you must still want to know the Truth as that is the passion which is needed for the new in you to come into being. So if you don\u2019t think via your verbal thinking mind but in spite of all the problems you have created for yourself from your verbal thinking mind, intuitively you passionately move forward with your silent mind to finding the Truth of all things so you become a Tathagata of this world and of that world. In that way, you discover what is real and the Truth in you and the illusion or the Lie in you which you created by your own mind.  What you want? Dropping the mic. In spite of, you still read as there might always be something \u201cnew\u201d you or I might find and as sure as tomorrow will be there for you, you know we will share what \u201cnew\u201d comes our way. The collective consciousness working as ONE. One mind too many never, looking for the same thing. 28th August 2020 ",

            "answer_text": "Scientifically speaking, I would say that the brain creates its own simulation derived from a series of sensory input from reality. Think of a can laying on the ground. You see it from one perspective, and a friend sees it from another perspective. You ask your friend what they see, and they say a circle because they see the can from the top. You say you see a rectangle because you see the can from the side. Neither of you know that it is a can, so the natural conclusion people come to is that THEIR version of reality is true which makes all other versions false. The truth is, more often than not, different based on the perspective chosen. In the case of the can, the truth is a combination of the truths from both perspectives, and possibly more. Even your eyes require difference in perspective to convert the knowledge of two different two dimensional simulations into an amalgam offering knowledge provided by a three dimensional simulation. Each person cannot experience life in its fullest. Each neuron is a living being that cannot experience life in its fullest. It takes a cooperative and collaborative effort for a group of neurons to communicate and develop an understanding of their surrounding beneficial to all neurons in the group. The same applies to each person. Speech and language provide that communication that allows two or more people to function like a single mind to help each other experience reality more fully. It is through communication that our individual simulations can be amalgamated into a shared simulation beneficial for all\u2026.if we communicate to share our different perspectives, not to prove one perspective superior than another. Imagine deciding which eye to close because one perspective is \u201csuperior\u201d than the other\u2026.you would lose one whole dimension of understanding of the reality around you. ",

            "answer_text": "Does the human brain create its own reality? Reality = Nature/Universe + Brain/Mind Reality by definition is the individual and subjective experience of the external and the internal worlds. For creatures having brains, the reality cannot be separated from their mind or brain*. But in this observation about reality, care must be taken NOT to confuse the reality with the nature or universe. *(there are living forms without brains like trees, amoebas, sponges who also must be sensing and experiencing some reality of their vicinity or more \u2014 for surviving at least.) The nature and universe are existing by their own regardless of experiencing them in any brain or mind. Reality is the interaction of the nature/universe with brain/mind. Nature exists outside brain/mind. Reality exists only inside living brain/mind. Hence a stone or a dead person aren\u2019t considered as having any reality of their own, because they are not supposed to have any living mind. Reality requires both the brain/mind and the universe. So the bottom-line answer to your question is, YES. But the reality the brain creates is dependent on the external and internal worlds. ",

These senses among others are only able to perceive a small fraction of their total energetic spectrums. For example, we only perceive a combination of shades and primary colours, we can see less than 1% of the visible light spectrum, we can hear less than 1% of the sound spectrum, etc. We filter the small fraction of information we receive through the brain, which is inherently bias depending on the vocabulary that we use to interpret the world. So not only are we interpreting a small fraction of reality, but we also define reality through our own unique vocabulary or perspective. And in many cases, there are gaps in our interpretations, so we will fill those gaps (visual, auditory, olfactory, somatic, gustatory, etc.) in order to create a fluid experience. And that's only accounting for the things we actually experience. Most of our world now with globally accessible and constantly active social media and information sharing can lead us to fill in gaps with mostly unfounded projections and assumptions. So it is VERY important to trust but verify. Seek to understand reality at a fundamental level, and build models from there. ",

I do not think that brains create reality, I think that brains are the way that our personal awareness represents its sub-personal dimensions. As Aldous Huxley and others suggested, the brain may not create conscious experience, but rather act as a reducing valve or filter from the much larger context of universal, eternal conscious experience beyond our personhood. Brains create organic compounds and electrical twitches - that\u2019s it. Any reality creation is not being accomplished through any physical mechanism that we can observe or imagine. We can only presume that it is happening or speculate on something other than consciousness which creates both minds and matter. I don\u2019t see why either of those theories is superior to the hypothesis that it is not consciousness itself which subdivides and masks itself in these various forms, percepts, concepts, objects, and subjects.

We know entangled particles can interact with each other, instantly even if they're galaxies away, far faster than light speed. It was tested on a satellite at the distance of 1,200 miles. We know that a photon somehow knows if we will observe/measure its state it changes from wave to particle behavior. Oh, and it knows even if it started its voyage thousands of light years away before the observer was even born. We also know an atom can be transposed in two realities until measured. It can have two temperatures and spins at the same time. So how come a human mind just knowing about it forces it to choose a state? You could train a monkey to watch the results and color code them so they could tell you if the light made an interference pattern. They would give you the same result, even if you did the experiment a million times. No interference. But we dont know if the monkey forced the collapse or if the collapse happened because before it departed the light already knows the monkey will impart that knowledge to a human. If you filmed it and never watched the film, the interference pattern would be on the film, because it knows you will never watch it\u2026 It doesn't make any sense. Yet we know it happens. It has been tested millions of times. The experiment is the double slit and I cite wheeler's delayed version for the part about it knowing before you are born. So while I don't speak in absolutes, we can say, with confidence, that the interaction between the human mind (and possibly other mammals) and the environment is far from understood. ",

It attracts or repels realities based on what you are thinking. Indeed, the same applies to any physical object that stores information. The universe is constantly splitting into copies of itself at every point in the universe. Each copy is very very slightly different, yet all obey quantum mechanics. During this split, for a very brief time before the copies are formed, it makes the decision of associating the local information content with the universe copy that matches it the best. By putting our brains into states where the local information content (what we are thinking about) is the future we desire we tend to move toward those universes. My physics theory explains what is actually going on at the quantum level:  It is the best mathematical theory of magick to date. I did not originally intend it to explain magick. I only realized several years after I wrote it that it also explains magick. My original intent was to explain dark matter and dark energy, and create a more detailed theory of quantum mechanics. ",

Let me just hedge that if the human brain does create its own reality, are you asking whether that reality supplants some other one? This other one might be, let\u2019s say, the visual reality. But there have to be multiple realities because certainly it is impossible to match my visual reality with yours. Maybe I don\u2019t understand reality. I think it\u2019s convenient for people - that is their conventions are involved - seem to want to think that there is one reality, viz. \u201cthe world or the state of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealistic or notional idea of them.\u201d This definition pits idealism (notional, idea, futurist) against reality in a type of competition. But that\u2019s not fair because reality is not a simple construct. All I\u2019m saying is that reality is not cut and dried. Sure there is existence separate from our brains - newspapers, carpets, my 3 inch woodland friends melamine wolverine - are real objects. Are they reality? I think our brain can create something like a separate reality. It can intervene and interfere in the material world. Depending on the person, the brain may control a good deal of their reality. And I think everyone has a distinct set of assumption, expectations, and inferences about \u201creality.\u201d It is nothing like an absolute idea. Pat ",

            "answer_text": "To a large extent, it has to. Everything we think we know is based on internal models, shared among many \u2014 but still only models. The theological premise about Heaven being a place of light is largely influenced by the experiences of folks having undergone near-death experiences. The brain, when in the early stages of death undergoes hypoxia (oxygen deprivation), which causes those regions which have the highest oxygen dependency to experience the earliest effects. For most higher-order chordates, that is the frontal lobes. Not only are the frontal lobes used extensively in mapping memory into a personal timeline, but ever since our very early Cambrian ancestors these portions of the brain evolved to become sensitive first to heat, and ultimately to light \u2014 eventually becoming our eyes. It shouldn\u2019t surprise us therefore that those experiencing hypoxia would have \u201cflash-backs\u201d to earlier memories, and to experience a growing sense of white light as our visual centers start to degrade. The latter is due to the inability of our visual cortex to distinguish shapes, boundaries or colors during oxygen depravation. In essence, our visual cortex \u201crewinds\u201d to it\u2019s earliest evolutionary role, namely allowing our bottom-feeding marine ancestors to detect sunlight (and presumably warmth) overhead. I\u2019m sure there are many other \u201cbrain model\u201d behaviors I\u2019ve omitted. ",

The human brain is an organ composed of millions or billions of neurons that somehow creates consciousness, in a way science still doesn't understand. It doesn't do this by itself, because there is a greater consciousness, which can be called cosmic consciousness, that created the universe, and the mind is somehow able to link into this. This leads to what the psychologist Carl Jung called the collective unconscious, which is responsible for such things as our knowing when the phone is going to ring just before it does. Our individual mind adds our own consciousness to this collective unconscious, and this creates what we know as reality. Since each mind is different, due to biology and the experiences we have had, each person's reality is different. ",

Furthermore, due to internal biological dysregulation, like in schizophrenia or sleep deprivation, perceived stimuli that don't actually exist can be created by the brain. No. The brain is in a sense physically entangled with the environment. Our neural networks are typically oriented towards things that actually happen.

The human brain receives lots and lots of information, through the sensors of the human body, and by means of that torrent of information, builds up a picture, a simulacrum, of what the real physical world is like, out there. This is a reality, which usually matches the actual reality out there in the physical world. But occasionally, the brain goes nutso, and regardless of the information coming in from the sensors, develops an entirely different view of the world. It is wrong, in a whole bunch of different ways. But it is in this way that the brain creates its reality, because in this (rare) case it believes that the world is a wholly different thing than all the rest of us perceive and believe. So yes, the brain creates its reality, but sometimes that \u201creality\u201d is wrong. ",

When brains are malfunctioning, people see hallucinations that are widely different from the normal range. This is the human brain creating an alternate reality: sometimes horrifying, sometime transcendental. In other ways the brain protects us from experiencing harsh realities by filtering the world with rose colored glasses. Have you ever wondered if you are seeing the world in the same way as others?

You have several choices here ,scream and yell,Cut them both out of your life, cut her out and never introduce a woman to your boyfriend again, or dump his ass and never trust your friend again Or you could talk to them see we all have different perspectives who you thought was your boyfriend could\u2019ve on his side been a fling , your girlfriend could\u2019ve heard.

So, if someone ignores you at a party, say, and you don\u2019t understand why, your mind can go all over the place, ruminating that he hates you or knows something that you don\u2019t know or you\u2019re not \u201cgood enough\u201d. In reality, the person probably just didn\u2019t notice you or doesn\u2019t even think anything of you. Your \u201creality\u201d is your reaction to the event. Suffering comes from the reaction or the attachment to our feelings about something, and that can create many negative outcomes. That is my personal opinion. Not from a scientist. ",

A belief is simply an idea that you hold which you often give attention to. Most notably, the area that gives rise to most beliefs is the Media. There is so much more to understand regarding beliefs, - it is quite complex indeed. ",

Like running faster then a jet plane is highly unlikely unless you have a certain technology to do so. I don't wanna get into that, but my point is that yes belief does create reality in many areas. I would list down the things my higher mind has told me about what belief can do. Increase Healing speed Heal OCD Remove blocks Lucid dream or increase it's chances Increase speed Increase strength Increase flexibility Increase intelligence Increase memory Increase brain processing speed Manifest a specific dream character( and yes I mean any dream character you can possibly imagine) Manifest a specific person in real life( send love energy to them, I don't know how much but I'll ask my higher mind) Answer a specific question in a yes or no fashion and explanatory fashion.. (Yes it has that ability) Much more as well, I'll ask more to my higher mind later. But of course belief is not unlimited despite what you may of been told. Humans can only do so much but that shouldn't stop us from doing what we can do. Take advantage of the gift you've been given and use it for good. ",

However, certain psychedelic drugs can so affect the brain that the sense experiences are passed through a \u2018chemical filter\u2019 altering how those sense experiences are presented, often giving the impression of an alternate reality. I recall working at a coffee shop as a busboy. We employees would often have to rush to the staircase that led to a Second, but half, floor, in order to rescue someone high on LSD from attempting to fly off those stairs! [The staircase overlooked the first floor.] Talk about an alternate reality clashing with the real thing! In a very different sense, concepts, sometimes called ideas or forms, exist only in the mind, [not the brain]. They are immaterial things that we make as we experience reality. In this sense, the human mind creates concepts as an expression of reality! ",

Humans have an extra feature; we have language, not just symbolic acoustical communication, but real language, with sarcasm, double meaning, metaphors, humor, high flying concepts, etc. Language evolved to help us navigate the social terrain. In order for us to survive, we had to learn how to cooperate, communicate, and follow a leader, which establishes a social hierarchy that requires complex symbolic communication to implement. Now, the word \u201creality\u201d only means, it exists. So, what exists outside of our minds is a shared, universal reality, and a tiny bit of that shared, universal reality manages to make its way into our minds via sensory impressions, at which point our minds interpret the meaning of those signals, thereby setting up a non-shared, non-universal, subjective realm inside our heads, and we call that \u201creality\u201d. In our attempt to share this subjective realm in our heads, language emerged. That is where the \u201cperson\u201d inside that head lives, in the linguistic map of reality. If you turn your attention inward, you may be able to \u201chear\u201d the continuous internal monologue that is the basis for your own personal sense of what is real. ",

The brain mirrors the environments and the mind is generating its micro-world, \"small-scale models\" of reality. The image of the world around us, which we carry in our head, is just a model. Nobody in his head imagines all the world, government or country. He has only selected concepts, and relationships between them, and uses those to represent the real system (Forrester, 1971). It is known as mental models of reality, a representation of the surrounding world, mental representations or mental simulation generally. As an internal symbol or representation of external and internal reality, experienced as consciousness and self-awareness, the mental model play a major role in perception, feeling, cognition, learning, reasoning and decision-making and behavior.  Mental models help you understand the world, its relationship with you and between things. Mental models are deeply held worldviews, beliefs about how the world works. 100+bn neurons with 100+trillion of connections in your brain are working together to generate a conscious experience of the world around as and ourselves in it. But if life itself is good and pleasant\u2026and if one who sees is conscious that he sees, one who hears that he hears, one who walks that he walks and similarly for all the other human activities there is a faculty that is conscious of their exercise, so that whenever we perceive, we are conscious that we perceive, and whenever we think, we are conscious that we think, and to be conscious that we are perceiving or thinking is to be conscious that we exist...

Molecules and atoms are entirely imperceptible. Thus, what we think we \u201cknow\u201d about the world is, on the face of it, vastly incomplete. For much of what we do, none of this matters, and we go about our lives blissfully unaware of both our limits and our misperceptions. In other words, the world is not as we think it is. If that is true, then we do, indeed, create our own reality. ",

There might be a file - perhaps a word document - placed on the centre of the computer desktop. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there is actually a document sitting somewhere in the middle of the computer. In Hoffman\u2019s evolutionary modelling (also performed on a computer) it appears that species having an accurate view of reality are driven to extinction by those who perceive (or see an interpretation of) reality that is purely driven by increasing their fit with the environment in which they live.

Sometimes its interpretation of what\u2019s going on outside your head is skewed by bias, cognitive dissonance, poor memory, or hallucination (perceptions not caused by the outside world). The further you get from the absolute physical you get, the more skewed your model can get because more of it is guesswork.
