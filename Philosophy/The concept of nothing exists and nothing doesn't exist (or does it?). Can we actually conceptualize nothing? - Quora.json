            "answer_text": "This answer was first posted under the question, \"Does nothing exist?\" There are ways of speaking loosely in which the distinction between nothing and non-being is not consistently maintained.  If we want to give a meaningful answer the question, \"Does nothing exist,\" we must clarify what we mean by these terms and stick to those meanings.   So let us begin by distinguishing between the following two distinctions: 1) being vs. non-being2) things vs. nothing Consistently maintaining a distinction between these two different distinctions will involve speaking in ways that are unusual. They are unusual because they are more disciplined than the way we usually speak (since I will be endeavoring to consistently maintain the distinction between non-being and nothing).  The fact that this way of speaking is unusual does not imply that this way of speaking is meaningless.  It only means that it is innovative. Grammar is not permanently fixed.  It is possible to have an innovative, meaningful grammar. Laying the groundwork for the distinction between being and non-being  The distinction between being and non-being depends on the idea of \"predication\".  A predication is a sentence that asserts something.  Every properly formed assertion sentence either uses a being verb, a non-being verb, or can be restated in a form which contains a \"being\" or \"non-being verb.  For example, \"John ran to the store\" can be restated as \"John was running to the store.\"  The restated sentence using the being or non-being verb is used only rarely, so it sounds awkward, but the restated sentence does make sense. Some examples of being verbs are \"is,\" \"will be,\" \"was,\" \"might be,\" \"should be,\" and \"would be.\" Some examples of non-being verbs are \"is not,\" \"will not be,\" \"was not,\" \"might not be,\" \"should not be,\" and \"would not be.\" These sentences we are calling predications all have at least one subject term and at least one predicate term.  For example, in a sentence having the form \"X is Y,\" the subject term of the sentence is \"X\" and the predicate term is \"is Y.\"   A subject term refers to the subject or the predication.  For example, in the predication, \"Thomas Jefferson is the author of the Declaration of Independence,\" the words \"Thomas Jefferson\" are the subject terms of the predication, and the subject of the predication is the person who those subject terms refer to.  Often the subject is  imaginary.  For example, Tom Sawyer would be the imaginary subject of the predication, \"Tom Sawyer lived in Hannibal, Missouri.\" An attempted predication may either be meaningful or not meaningful.  An example of an attempted predication that is probably not meaningful is, \"The sun is one, two, three.\"  I say it is probably not meaningful because I cannot imagine some way of understanding it so that it might have some truth or falsity, but it is possible that my imagination or knowledge is deficient. Definition of \"being\" as a property of a subject When we say that some subject has \"being,\" we mean that it is the subject of at least one meaningful positive predication. Definition of a \"being\" as a subject having certain of properties The word \"being\" has a second meaning.  Every subject that has \"being\" is said to be a \"being.\" Definition of \"non-being\" as a property of a subject \"Non-being\" is the opposite of \"being.\"  A subject has \"non-being\" if it is the subject of a meaningful negative predication.  Note that the same subject may have both being and non-being.  For example, \"Thomas Jefferson is the author of the Declaration of Independence,\" but \"Thomas Jefferson is not the author of Les Miserables.\" Does non-being (as a property) exist?  Yes.  My hand not being green is a situation that exists. Definition of a \"non-being\" as a subject having only negative properties  Is there a second meaning of \"non-being\" like there was for \"being?\" We could take the same approach and say, \"Every subject that has \"non-being\" as a property is said to be a \"non-being.\"  But that would not come close to tracking the way we speak,  We do not say, that Thomas Jefferson is a non-being just because he is not the author of Les Miserables.  That leaves only the following possibility: A subject of a meaningful negative proposition is a non-being only if it is not also the subject of a meaningful positive predication.  Thus, a \u201cnon-being\u201d is a subject of a meaningful negative proposition that is not also the subject of a meaningful positive predication. Do non-beings exist? Strictly speaking, No.  Consider the predication, \"A non-being exists.\"  We can restate the predication with a being verb as, \"A non-being is existing.\"  If this is a meaningful predication, then the subject of the predication cannot be a \"non-being\" as defined here since there is at least one meaningful positive predication that applies to the subject of the predication.  If the predication is not meaningful, then that would also rule out the possibility that a non-being exists. Thus, \"non-beings\" as defined here cannot exist. But this does not mean that there is no meaningful way to assert that non-beings exist or may exist.  Consider that we often call things squares that are not perfect squares.  We call them squares because they come close enough to an ideal square that it is useful to treat them like squares in a given context.  We could do the same with the word \"non-being.\"  If there are almost no significant meaningful positive predications having the same subject as a negative predication, and the positive predications are not so significant as to preclude our calling the subject a \"non-being\" in a given context, then it may be acceptable to say, in that context that the subject of the negative predication is a \"non-being\" that exists or may exist. Perhaps this is what Neo-Platonists had in mind when they said God is beyond being. In conclusion, there may be contexts in which it may be useful to speak less strictly and talk about non-beings that may exist.  Those involved in such conversations would be wise to remember that they are not speaking strictly, because they need to make sure that their looser way of speaking does not lead to unjustified conclusions. Definition of \"thing\"  I have spent some time on the distinction between being and non-being, because we need to keep those ideas separate and distinct from our ideas of \"things\" and \"nothing\". We sometimes distinguish \"mere things\" from beings who have special importance like persons, sentient animals, gods, spirits, God, etc.  However, that has to do with manners and it has the unfortunate consequence of making a mess of the distinction between things and nothing.  We would usually object to anyone saying that people, sentient animals, gods, spirits, God, etc. are nothing.  So, for purposes of our current discussion, the word \"thing\" will be given a broad meaning so that it includes people, sentient animals, gods, spirits, God, etc. When we separate the distinction between things and nothing from the distinction between being and non-being, the idea of causation (being a cause of determinate or probable sequences of events) becomes paramount. A \"thing\" is a being (including beings that are sometimes called non-beings in loose speech) that has causal efficacy.  Definition of \"nothing\" \"Nothing\" is the absence of any \u201cthing.\u201d  In other words, \"nothing\" would exist if  there were no existing beings that have causal efficacy.  Note that \"nothing\" is a \"being.\"  There are meaningful positive predications about nothing.  For example, \u201c\u2018Nothing\u2019 is the absence of any \u2018thing\u2019.\u201d The inherent character of nothing is that nothing is pure possibility  Since, by definition, a being that is nothing (not a thing) cannot determine or even influence what will happen, and therefore, does not include within its being any requirement that anything (or any being) that happens must have a cause, a being that is nothing is a state of pure possibility (except to the extent that some thing has limited the possibilities that would otherwise be present in that nothing).  Thus, if it ever was the case that there was a moment when nothing existed, then that moment of nothing would have been a moment of unlimited possibility.  Consequently, the reason that something exists rather than absolutely nothing, is that nothing has no causal efficacy with regard to maintaining its existence.  It is an openness to the happening of time, and thus, everything that happens in time. It may be objected that it is improper to speak of a moment when nothing existed because (1) if nothing existed, time did not exist, and (2) if time did not exist, there could not be any moments. The argument fails because it depends upon an equivocation.  If by \u201ctime\u201d we mean we mean the openness to the happening of multiple moments, then the first premise is wrong, but the second premise is true.  If by \u201ctime\u201d we mean the actual happening of multiple moments (which is generally the idea of time that has generally been used by philosopher\u2019s and scientists since Aristotle), then the first premise is true, but the second premise is false.  Consequently, if we do not equivocate, but are consistent as to which definition of time we adopt, then the argument fails. Does nothing exist? Yes.  Whether there are a finite number of things that exist, or an infinite number of things that exists, no other things exist in addition to those that do exist.  Thus, nothing else exists.  That nothing that exists beyond all things that do exist is not a thing.  It is only a being.  It asserts no causal influence over reality.  It is just included in our list of beings that are included in reality.   To the extent that the things that exist may be finite and have finite causal influence, the nothing that exists may still include infinite possibilities that have not been closed off by the finite limitations on possibility that have been imposed by the things that exist. Postscript: Does free will exist I am aware that there are other ways of making the distinction between things and nothing that still maintains a distinction between \u201cnothing\u201d and \u201cnon-being.\u201d Specifically, one could define \u201cthing\u201d as a being that has a \u201cnature,\u201d or in other words, a being that has \u201cregular\u201d causal efficacy.  Then, \u201cregular causal efficacy\u201d could either be defined as including only determinate causal efficacy, or as including both determinate causal efficacy and probabilistic causal efficacy.   \u201cNothing\u201d would then be any being that does not fall under the definition of \u201cthing\u201d that we choose to employ.  In any event, regardless of the way we choose to cut up the categories, we end up with one category of \u201cnothings\u201d that are beings with no causal efficacy at all. Sartre says that consciousness is a nothingness.  He means that Consciousness is not a \u201cthing\u201d because it has free will which is a kind of causal efficacy that does not follow a strict, determinate pattern.  He admits that free will does tend to follow patterns.  That is obvious.  Our behavior is not random.  So he effectively admits that the pattern of free will\u2019s causal efficacy is the consequence of probabilistic causal efficacy of something. Nevertheless, he insists that the will is \u201cfree\u201d in the sense that it is not determined by anything other than itself.  So if we follow Sartre\u2019s way of distinguishing things and nothings, the question does nothing exist could be understood as including the question does \u201cfree will\u201d, understood as being a will that has causal efficacy that is not determined by anything other than its own probabilistic causal efficacy, exist? We know that the kind of nothing that has no causal efficacy does not prevent \u201cfree will\u201d from existing.  So the question becomes whether the will\u2019s choices are determined by any being other than the will itself.  I think the evidence is pretty clear that physical processes in the brain do play a role in causally influencing what we choose.  The question is only whether the will, understood in some dualistic way, has some separate causal influence of its own that might affect the choice. Even if it does have such an influence, that limited influence is not enough to provide us with the kind of radically self determined free will that Sartre has in mind when he said that consciousness is an existing nothingness.

            "answer_text": "Yes, the existence of \"nothing\" is a negative existential claim. You can define something according to what there is, but this is simply complementary to defining it in terms of what there is not. If you say an apple is red, you are implicitly negating that it's not yellow or green. If you say there is nothing, you are negating that there is something. The negation is as real as the affirmation, because if you affirm something you are necessarily denying what is opposed to it. What does not exist is not part of the world, but it's part of reality. \"Nothing\" is not an object, but it's a fact. It's indeed a real fact when you have the absence of anything. The philosopher Wittgenstein explored this issue when discussing States of Affairs. In order to have a proper understanding on this matter, you need to be able to differentiate between existence and truth, or between the world and the reality. Nothing cannot be said to exist in the world, but the reality also includes non-actual states of affairs. The concept of nothing is a language construct, and language operates in the realm of reality, not of the facts in the world. ",
