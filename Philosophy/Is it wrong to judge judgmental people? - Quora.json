            "answer_text": "If you judge someone as lesser because they're judgmental, then you're a judgmental person. Being nonjudgmental doesn't mean you need to like everyone. Judgmental and negative people can be draining. It's good to develop strategies for spending as little time as you can with them. If you think judgmental people are less intelligent or attach any negative trait to them because they're judgmental, then you're judgmental. It helps, I've found, to see their judgmentalism as a symptom. They may have heard only criticism growing up. They may not have learned a way to build themselves up except by tearing others down. Whatever the cause it's often a defensive trait. That doesn't make them bad people. It doesn't make them good people. If you find them draining, it makes them people it's best to spend as little time with as you can.  ",
