            "answer_text": "Mindfulness Being aware of your self and how you react to things and situations is a form of wisdom that a lot of people miss. when you are aware you don\u2019t necessarily act and react or think the best way possible, but if it doesn\u2019t mean that it means that you will act better the next time because you chose to notice. Curiosity When you are constantly curious about life and people and how things work you are more likely to learn rather than just memorise what you have to. And I don\u2019t mean the curiosity that makes people chase the details of each other\u2019s personal lives, as that is not wise at all, I mean the curiosity that makes you see every interaction with the world as a way to learn something new and to be genuinely excited about it. Be the one to ask questions and look deeply into the answers you\u2019re given. Being humble.. Being humble enough to know that every single human being carries within another world that you haven\u2019t experienced or haven\u2019t had the chance to notice. So when you speak to people bay attention no matter how shallow they might look compared to you, because there\u2019s something to learn whether it\u2019s how to or even how not to be or think. Acceptance Accepting reality is one of the hardest things for someone who seeks wisdom, it is making the decision to let go instead of trying to bring the wisdom you\u2019ve learned and believe in into application. You have the control over your personal life or aspects of it and that\u2019s were you experiment with wisdom, you also have the power to affect the community, no matter how big or how small, now a days with internet our community is almost all humanity by representation if not by an actual percentage, but there are things in life and even people who are broken that you can\u2019t fix. A good example is witnessing a car accident and the driver have injured their back, if you try to help even if helping seems like a good idea, the consequences will not be good more likely than not. The world is a chaos of possibilities and accepting the fact that some of those might go wrong is a form of wisdom specially when our time of those possibilities is limited. This is what I have learned so far. Following your question for more :) ",

            "answer_text": "Let me narrate the story of a boy who was (still in love) in love with a very cute and hot at the same time girl but they are destined to fall apart. Boy: Do you still love me? Girl: You are my bes of best friend who is more than a friend even a boyfriend. Boy: Do you accept me as boyfriend? Girl: Plz, don't leave me. I need you. Boy: Changed the topic and asked what problem she was going through. Girl: Told many personal stuffs. Boy: For almost six months never asked about his relationship status just to make her feel happy. Throughout these six months he stand by her side and did whatever he can for her. Girl: Day by day started ignoring him and behaving in a manner which was not appropriate. She took him for granted sometimes she abused him. Boy: Never told a single word just to make her feel good because throughout he had done many things for her, so he thought if he will ask anything about relationship then it would be selfish and kind of forced on her. Girl: Call her everyday but just to say she has too many things to fix so she cannot talk today. And this is her everyday behaviour. Boy: Once told her that he will not be available for next one month because he has some stuffs to fix because now he knows that all the problems of his girlfriend was fixed. And she was somewhere just carrying her because of his good deeds. So, he thought to relieve her from this burden slowly without bothering her but destiny had some other plan. Girl: Called her 26 times and massaged around 50 text massages. Boy: He keeps his phone switched off just to relieve her from duty of calling him once a day. But he usually check his phone after 1AM just to make sure his parents call and some of important friends. But that day he called her back and did a lot of things because in massage she has mentioned that she will suicide if he will not call her. So, this poor guy have no option because he loves her more than anything. Girl: After one month she started acting weird. Boy: He never questioned her because somewhere he felt that she is in trouble but she started acting smart. Finally, one day he wanted to make things clear perhaps he knows her answer. But she refused to talk about anything related to relationship. Boy, finally request her to block from everywhere and he will not call her. Girl: Now, she wanted to control the damage and started making him fool because somewhere back in her mind she wanted to keep him as an option. Boy: He just wanted at the end also not to make her feel bad so he told that he doubt her so there is no point in staying together. He cried a lot like hell and still cry everyday but just to relieve his pain without any grudge about her and past. For me this the best example of wisdom. Kindly, advise because your advice will improve me in many ways. Your very own Sachin Jai Hind ",
