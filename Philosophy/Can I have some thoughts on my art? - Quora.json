            "answer_text": "It seems like you\u2019ve got a great basis here. Your symmetry is good, you\u2019re accurate in your proportions, and your line art is pretty consistent. I\u2019m not personally capable of drawing, but I\u2019ve been making other content (i.e: digital illustration, music, video, writing, etc.) I understand drawing, I\u2019m just spatially inept. There will be other people that could more specifically critique you, however, I found a part of your writing particularly interesting and couldn\u2019t help but want to reply: \u201cI\u2019m kinda in a weird place with my art right now, knowing I\u2019m skilled for my age but still doubting my abilities.\u201d This sentence sounds entirely too familiar. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a statement that enthusiastic artists repeat consistently. Every person I know who considers themselves an artist seems to get down on themselves, I do this a lot too. If you haven\u2019t heard Ira Glass\u2019 monologue in \u201cIra Glass on Storytelling (pt.3/4)\u201d, sometimes referred to as \u201cThe Gap\u201d, I highly recommend you watch it. It really has some great words that I feel like you could relate to. It\u2019s important to acknowledge that you\u2019re 14. You\u2019re definitely better than I was at 14, and I\u2019m sure you feel like there are people that are your age (or probably much older) that are exceedingly better than you. That is perfectly okay, you\u2019re young and have time. The most important thing to keep in mind is that what separates good artists from not-so-good artists is patience. A well-known recording artist once told me that the only that separated his music from my music was time. He would consistently say this to aspirational artists. I feel like this applies to all sectors of work and all mediums. For you, it\u2019s just a matter of time. My last bit for you: do a ton of work, take classes in high school that revolve around your artistic interests. The thing that puts you ahead is the fact that you\u2019re already capable, and as a result, you can only get better from here. If you have any questions, there are always people out there that can answer them. I recommend Quora, obviously, but make sure you check out some reddit communities for artists. If you have any questions about art colleges, admissions, portfolios, and all that jazz, feel free to send me a message. Finally, best of luck to you ! You\u2019ve got great potential, I assure you that. :) ",

            "answer_text": "It looks pretty good. It looks like you\u2019re still developing your style and that\u2019s okay, because your future art style(s) will be better than this one(no offense). It still depends on what you're trying to go for. If you're going for a realistic style, then keep on moving, my brother. You\u2019re on the right path to realistic sketching. If you're going for cartoon, make the eyes bigger. ",
