            "answer_text": "This is a question that is very dependent on the thing in question. In terms of nature, a tiger hunts it's prey because it needs to eat, birds migrate for warmth and food, etc. As far as human interactions, how humans treat one another and their surroundings can come from any array of motivations. In both of these scenarios, you can chalk both answers up to reason. There's a reason why nature (including humans) act the way they do. So you can say that everything happens because of reason. And depending on your religious inclination, you can say  everything happens for \"a reason\", but be aware that there is a distinct difference between the two. ",

            "answer_text": "There are two assumptions in your question.1. You have assumed some things are happening.2. You have assumed an effect needs a cause. The \"thing\" thing in your question needs to be explored first and then we can jump to cause and effect. You should form the right question only then it becomes eligible for an answer.So the right question is \"Are things really happening?\" or even better, \"Are there things that I think exist? ",
