            "answer_text": "Well, i used to think, \u201cNothing is impossible\u201d But after giving it a certain amount of thought, i proved myself wrong. I would say, in my opinion, \u2018Anything is possible\u2019 i.e. \u2018Nothing is impossible\u2019 over the course of time. Some things seem impossible because the life span of matter is lesser than the required time to achieve the required \u2018thing\u2019. For example If we consider the possibilities of something impossible to occur, like i can say \u201cI saw humans fly without any machinery\u201d, it is highly unlikely to happen now. But over the course of time, after many millenniums has passed, it will occur and so that particular sentence is not absolutely a lie, but a thing which can occur in course of time. Let us stick to that particular sentence for now. Consider a possibility where a single human has an infinite life span, which means he would eventually see evolution and can finally say \u201cI saw Humans fly without any machinery\u201d, and so proving that \u2018nothing is impossible if the time is right\u2019 Consider this past incident, during the invention of phone, many thought, \u201cWhy is this so big and heavy, i wish i can have a small and convenient phone, but it seems impossible!\u201d So they said, \u201cThe sentence \u2018nothing is impossible\u2019 is a lie!\u201d But some persons worked hard to develop what they thought was impossible and now, we got what they thought to be impossible, proving that nothing is impossible over the course of time. Conclusion If and only if, the life span of a particular person/ place/ matter tends to be infinity, everything is possible i.e nothing is impossible\u2026 Unless the life span is infinity, this sentence is a paradox, and this sentence must be replaced by \u201cNothing is impossible if it is logical\u201d or \u201cEverything is possible if you can keep your mind to it\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Like they say, with vision, determination, and discipline, nothing is impossible. Prove me wrong. Is there a single thing in this uncertain world of ours that is by definition, \u201cimpossible?\u201d NO! Of course, many people misinterpret the meaning of the word \u201cimpossible.\u201d If something cannot be done now, does that mean that it will never be done? No, of course not. For example, we humans used to think that flying was impossible, that it was the stuff that only happened in fairytales. But look at our world now! Airplanes! People probably also thought, at a certain point in time, that seacraft made of metal was impossible. Well, look at our harbors now! Metal ships everywhere! So what really is impossible? In my opinion, nothing is strictly impossible. If you can\u2019t do it, that doesn\u2019t mean that others won\u2019t be able to. A fish would obviously think that climbing a tree was impossible, but little did the fish know that it was indeed possible. For the fish, it was impossible, but for a monkey, it was possible. In the same way, the monkey would think that it was impossible to live in water, but the fish demonstrated to him that it was indeed possible. Now, there are some things that are possible but not plausible, as I like to say. Have you ever wondered why humans haven\u2019t built any flying cities? Many people would say that such things are impossible. But are they really? No! Flying cities are possible, just not plausible. If you build a gigantic metal platform and attach millions upon billions of engines and propellers to it and build a city on the platform, you have a flying city! It is indeed possible, but the cost of building such a mammoth would be extremely high. That is why we are still stuck to the ground. But if something is deemed impossible now, that may change in the future. In some cases, particular things that were possible in the past are now impossible. A good example of this is Greek fire. In conclusion, is anything truly impossible! No! The Earthly view of this is, \u201cWith vision, determination, and discipline, nothing is impossible.\u201d The correct way to view this is, \u201cWith God, anything is possible.\u201d Have a great day.

            "answer_text": "No. In fact, all kinds of things are impossible. You can\u2019t go faster than light. You can\u2019t compress normal matter into infinitely small spaces. You can\u2019t eat just one Lay\u2019s potato chip. This saying is somewhat annoying. I think it gives people false hope in times when a dose of realism would do them good. If you\u2019re tone deaf, spending your life trying out for American Idol might not be the best use of your time. Trying to join the NBA when you\u2019re a 40 year old 5\u203210\u2033 science teacher with almost no athletic abilities is genuinely foolish. That\u2019s not to say people shouldn\u2019t take risks, or even that people shouldn\u2019t have dreams or goals. But, realize that the more unlikely your goals are to actually happen, the more likely you are to fail at achieving them. That failure can be OK - sometimes it can be really great. But, it can also be pretty awful. So, I\u2019d like to replace the dreamy, vapid, and incorrect \u201cNothing is impossible\u201d with the concrete, albeit utilitarian, \u201cSet realistic goals and then strive to meet them.\u201d Yeah, it\u2019s not poetic or inspirational. It\u2019s also not as potentially damaging and horribly incorrect, either. ",

            "answer_text": "When I read this question at first I was going to say \u201cOf course some things are impossible\u201d\u2026 However, I could not come up with even one example! Of course there can be things that seem impossible\u2026 but even those may be possible at times. Some of the most ridiculous things, that we 100% believe to be impossible today, may very well be possible tomorrow. In the future we may be able to grow wings, shoot fireballs from our hands, or lasers out of our eyes. We may be able to travel faster than the speed of light, may be able to create a universe in a laboratory or may be able to travel back in time. And while not impossible, these things are highly unlikely to happen. It used to be thought that flying was impossible, that we could never ever reach the moon or that Mt. Everest would kill everyone and anyone who tried to climb it. Those used to be indisputable facts in earlier years. No one doubted the validity of the impossibility of these things, yet, today, we have done all of them and more. Someone ran a mile under 4 minutes, someone made a device that can travel without the use of horses, and we even have light without fire! There are so many things that we deem as impossible just to avoid having to work for it. If it is impossible then there is no use in you trying\u2026 right? But the truth is that nothing is impossible.   That being said, please do not fall into the idea that you will get to do everything in your lifetime. While it is not impossible for you to do any one of these things, and is not impossible for you to do them all, it is getting far more unlikely the more you put on your plate. But there is always a chance. Relying on that chance is not always the best idea though. \u201cNothing is impossible\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cYou can do Anything and Everything\u201d. Make sure you ask yourself whether or not it\u2019s worth it before you commit to the making the impossible possible. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, I\u2019d say that this statement is both True and False in itself. I\u2019ll explain both the scenarios. How this statement is TRUE? Let me explain this by taking one example from various times of the world. Example 1: Just suppose, if you were living in the year 1850 and someone came to you and asked for a mobile phone, so that he could talk to his girlfriend 1,000\u2019s of miles away and chit chat about his ongoing life. You would certainly take him as a gone case and would think such thing is impossible. Well, the world evolved and interpersonal communication became more and more important. People starting looking for ways and Graham Bell came out with the first set of instruments that could convert the sound waves into electrical energy (through input transmitter), send it miles away through wires and then convert them back to sound waves (through output speakers). The impossible was done. Example 2: Slowly and gradually the world was covered with all the wires. Telephonic instruments were installed in all of the Hotels, Offices, Homes etc. People said how convenient it would be to carry a phone everytime. But with all those wires it\u2019s impossible. Wireless technologies came in, and people found out new ways of transmission of these sound energies. Mobile phones came into pictures. Impossible was done again. Example 3: Then people said, owning a mobile and moreover talking over a mobile is too damn costly and it was impossible for almost everyone to use it for convenience purpose. Well, it\u2019s needless to say that we all are living in an era where mobile phones are being distributed in mere INR 250 and talking over the phone has become absolutely free. Impossible is done yet again. Like these there are countless number of examples which were impossible earlier but necessities made them possible. So what do you learn out of this: Necessity makes impossible, possible. Everything is impossible for a man unless there is a necessity. Everything that you have now (which looks quite obvious to you now) was once impossible. What you feel is impossible now, will be obvious in coming years. All you need is, create a necessity and give some (sometimes a lot of) time. Considering this, yes NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. How this statement is FALSE? Argument 1: Well, Nothing means, when there is no thing at all. As per Hindu Mythology, Shiva is a word given to nothingness. When Shiva is possible, that means, Nothing also must be possible. Argument 2: When you say Nothing is Impossible, you also mean that Nothing is also Not Impossible. (You might have to read and thing through this multiple times to really understand this). May sound stupid to many but is logically correct. ",

            "answer_text": "YES, ONLY BECAUSE OF THE MATHEMATICAL MEANING AND Wordplay. Outside of it, it is just a feel-good inspirational statement to lift ourselves. To motivate us. If you think through a little, you will realize that a lot of things are improbable. But they are definitely possible.Possibility just means that it doesn't have a probability of zero.It needs to happen once before eternity. Sure. A gazillion things will fit into this.Say, you wish to become a billionaire. It is definitely possible. Going by the precedents, human beings have done that.And of course, there is a course to be followed. You cannot not do something, and say, hey it is not possible.So there is precedence. And that itself makes it possible.But whether it is probable or not, is the problem.Improbable is the keyword here. It just means that the occurrence is so low that it really is not worth it.E.g Say you want to rob a bank. If the bank contains, 1 million dollars, and if you end up spending 2 million dollars to do the robbery, it defeats the monetary purpose of the robbery. Not worth it.So if you want to be a billionaire or a rocket scientist or a Hollywood actor, the probability becomes very low. One in 100,000 might make it. One in a million might.And I think the statement alludes more towards \u2018one can become a billionaire.\u2019 rather than \u2018you can become a billionaire.\u2019At that point, the human nature associates improbability with impossibility.But if you notice folks have become rocket scientists, Hollywood actors and billionaires.Similarly a lot of things are possible in this life, but not probable.The statement is beautiful once we don't think of it from the mathematical or wordplay aspect of it.There were probably soldiers caught in a trench, sureshot sitting ducks thinking they won't be alive tomorrow. And then they were.There are probably physically disabled people, doing therapy and recovering and ending up becoming athletes.There was probably a guy who fell into the lake, about to die, but swam his way to his boat or a shore. Thousands across the years wouldn't have made it.It also denotes that all that we see around us: millionaires, celebrities, intellectuals, sports people, world changers, or a good citizen. We can be all that we want to be.As you can see, there is a lot of wordplay in it. So a better takeaway from the statement is not its truth value, but the inspirational quotient of the statement. ",

            "answer_text": "No. There are plenty of things that are mathematically impossible, such as the three famous impossibilities (\u201csquare a circle\u201d, \u201ctrisect an angle\u201d, \u201cduplicate a cube\u201d). Please note that there are specifics to this before you rush off to prove me wrong. For instance, trisecting an angle must be done using only a straightedge and a compass - no ruler, no templates - nothing else. There are things that are easier to show impossible, such as the square of a real number being negative, the sum of a number and its reciprocal being sqrt(3)*, a ball hit completely horizontally from ground level flying out and going over a wall 400 feet away, finding a way to divide by zero that is consistent with the rest of mathematics**, and so, so many more. *Note that there was a question on Quora last week that actually started with that as an assumption. Most solvers never considered its impossibility and consequently gave meaningless answers. (We all make mistakes - I have made plenty and will continue to almost surely as long as I live. Key is to try to minimize the severity and the frequency.) **There was a whack job in England several years ago who claimed he found a way to divide by zero, but he was full of sh@$. Despite his Ph.D. in computer science, his knowledge of math was off and it turns out that what he suggested had been done long ago. And to the guy\u2019s shame, he was subjecting 10-year-old kids to his nonsense, knowing they could not rebut him or even understand. ",

There r projects that take immense computing power speed resources n funds n cooperation. N alligned technology n peace in same century.Then there are things that even if u had all the above u cant do it. For example LHC is trying to create the \u2018god particle\u2019 to idk maybe satan told them to create another universe to outdo god.wishful thinking \u2026the opening ceremony is psychotic n demonic.looks like possessed workers. But anyways u need unlimited n constant power source to stabilize the tempreture of space time or deep space as big as space.now theres no creature or substance that can do that other than god.the word unlimited is assigned for god n only god. The broadband companies n marketing saying unlimited joy or service. Thats rubbish. You have range limit, u have speed limit, capacity limit, how many devices limit, the company service provider maybe exist 20 years maybe , thats a limit.its all limits in your faces.what r u talking about? Do u even know what limitless means? \ud83d\ude49 So god has unlimited amount of energy to stabilize the tempreture of space n he doesnt need a top up or rest.he is limitless.but everythingelse n everyoneelse have limitations.n some things are possible n somethings impossible for humans. But nothing is limited or impossible for god. For example. I dont think human could create a balanced biodiverse planet or stable universe.humans dont have the power source to chill deep space at constant tempreture . Which i think makes the helium a superconductor electromagnetic substance that counter reacts with all magnets in planets core that allows it to float n levitate with quantum locking. Dont shit YOURSELF. You cant be god n u dont have unlimited endless amount of energy n u cant stabilize a deep space time temperature.especially when u sleep. KNOW YOUR PLACE!! But u get to be human.for free. Hearing brain eyesight , thermal regulation, reproduction, orgasm, ideas, creativity, communications, eq, iq, bonds, comedy, art, music, story line, my god. Life is an amazing creation of god, to be experiencing geobacter, animals, life n death cycle, planet cycle, to watch fetus formation the birth n death of stars, supernova and other humans creature like u n being sentient enough to understand whats going on.did u know we have emotional sensors? Like u can see someone\u2019s face n body gesture n tears n then get data in your neuron sensing \u2018beep beep shes sad, beep beep shes angry' .the level of sophistication in design.its amazing.every morning i feel so blessed to be apart of the lawhunmahfuz. It is epic. N im just glad n feel blessed to be apart of smtg wayyyy bigger than myself. N im not gna be soooooo arrogant like those nutcase in LHC to even for 1 second pretend i could stabilize a universe. Maybe u can create the \u2018god particle\u2019 maybe even luca but u cant stabilize that universe or the tempreture of your own deep space. U cant even stabilize endless unlimited supply of free ac for global need.n u wana stabilize n create your own universe?? Get outta here. Satan is that u? running LHC. What a joke! Unless u have endless unlimited supply of energy like god.u aint stabilizing a universe with your \u2018god particle \u2018so bow to him or scadadle! Before he yanks u n throws you in hell jail.stop trying to steal god's credit.its pathetic. How could u criticize god??? Who r u? Show me your universe credit of portfolio!! I mean have u heard he imvented oxytocin.??? I've been battling w myself on whats my fav body features. Its down to 2 ' i mean they are alll amazing but I really love thermal regulation app adapting to outside tempreture. that stuff keeps me up at night n oxytocin i mean orgasm n pheramones n when your baby cries your milk ducts secrete drops of milk.

Like howwww \ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude49\ud83d\ude49 god loves surprises. Love it.love all of it. Amazing. Oxytocin is top of the list. For now.

Just as the man who places his bet on the roulette wheel, then sees his number \u201chit,\u201dbelieves he is in some way worthy or deserving, so will all who witness the win be confirmed in their magical thinking that is it is indeed possible for them, as well. Possible, yet unlikely. Pasteur once said that chance favors the prepared mind. Sometimes, but not always. Laying a scientific or schematic groundwork upon which to build bears no resemblance to stumbling on a once in a lifetime event. I had an uncle who was a truck driver. Many years ago, he took his wife to Las Vegas for a small vacation. Just before they left, at 3 a.m., he went in to use the restroom before the long ride back to California. Once inside the stall, he found a brown paper bag. Peering in, he could see it was filled with $100 bills. He grabbed his wife and did not stop the car until they were in their driveway hundreds of miles away. With that money, he paid off his children\u2019s debts. Within two years, both offspring were in debt again. He drove his 18-wheeler until retirement, then bought himself a small piece of property in Northern California and lived in a trailer there until he died. He was a modest man and the money allowed him to live out his life modestly. Did he ever think it was possible he would find a quarter of a million dollars in likely drug money in a toilet in Las Vegas? Did it change his children\u2019s lives? Did it change his? What is possible is that which you earn because of who you are rather than what you expect life will, or should, bring you. Anything else that arrives is simply a blessing to be reckoned with, but not because it is your due. Next time you go into a public restroom, look for that bag. How much are you willing to wager that it will be there if nothing is impossible? The question is if it is probable. ",

But if we make one very simple, but utterly consequential assumption\u2026 the answer must definitely be that yes, anything is possible, and further, that everything is actually not only possible, but in fact inevitable. That one assumption is that time is infinite in both \u2018directions\u2019, forward and backward. The simplicity of this concept is belied by its immensity and unfathomability for a normal human brain like mine, and most of ours. We just cannot quantify the necessarily uncountable \u2018measure\u2019 of infinity. But our feeble minds can\u2019t help but try. Quantifying everything is our primary method for trying to understand everything that we can observe. It\u2019s our best method for trying, in the day to day, anyway. -I digress. Back to it, then\u2026 Assuming time is infinite- \u2018forward\u2019 Everything that can happen, will happen. And, since there is no end to the time domain, a literally unlimited number of things (everything) will come to pass. Assuming time is infinite- \u2018backward\u2019 Everything that can happen has also already happened. Further, \u2026and this is where even approaching the idea becomes very fuzzy for my fragile brain\u2026 Everything possible, (see again; everything!) may (must?) also be happening all at the same time. Right \u2018now\u2019. -For lack of a better, more accurate concept. That last part is where I am think we begin to approach as yet undiscovered and indescribable \u2018dimensions\u2019 or something of the like. I cannot even begin to make sense of things past our physical three, and sort of, time as a fourth dimension. To sum everything up: If time is infinite, then everything that is possible will occur, has already occurred, and will occur again an infinite number of times endlessly. And possibly, everything is constantly and concurrently, happening in some dimension. Experts, and truly intelligent folks, please correct me if I\u2019m certainly wrong here in some way. I find this to be potentially a fundamental truth about all existence, however, again.. I may not be understanding something or many things that are critical. Anyone else, please share any thoughts you have. I\u2019d love to hear them and examine them, as they relate to this idea. Edit: In the immediacy of our commonly perceived \u2018real\u2019, single lifetimes.. there are many things that are probably or even definitely not possible, as some other answers have mentioned. In the above answer, I don\u2019t mean to suggest that I think everything is possible for us to experience, or to happen while we are alive. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothingness is a word automatically reflecting its implicit opposite, \u2018everythingness\u2019, as is the reverse situation. Likewise, impossible is a word that exists in opposition to its partner in crime: possible. Such are the dualities and polar opposites inherent in these our puny concepts. Words are abstractions, and wonderfully if not beautifully vague, made of light and shadow, but just exactly where you are, in shadow or light, or some mix of the grey is debatable in every moment in every incidence. Enter maths to calm our little brains: count it that will prove it exists, or not, or could exist, or not. Nothingness is absence. As is impossible. Their opposites are presence. (Random wild assertion: I wonder if the concept of nothingness has its genesis in the fear of death : the personal and perhaps only true \u2018nothingness\u2019, or not!) Absence of what? Material absence? Nothingness of what in particular: we can answer these specific questions by observation: I have \u2018nothing\u2019 to eat etc, likewise with specific examples of possibility and impossibility : it is impossible (currently with tech how it is to the best of my knowledge) for me to lay on a cloud and count how many incidences of nothingness float by and give me a gingerbread biscuit for my travails because I can\u2019t quite conceive how much nothingness is actually everythingness in disguise. Alas our little brains do fry so easily. These words all stand in for what is, and only describe what we perceive or know of what actually is, frankly not a lot : we do not have enough information to actually know if true and literal \u2018nothingness\u2019 actually exists anywhere, in a pocket down the loo, through a hole in a spacewall we can\u2019t see or even as a potential Universal and by definition if it exists, it really doesn\u2019t because it is nothing. But calling nothing Nothing doesn\u2019t that by default make it something? See the problems? So far evidence suggests nothingness does not exist, there are the quantum fluctuations that are embedded in spacetime, however that does not make nothingness an actual impossibility- eradicate spacetime what is left? I digress, more just perhaps so far \u2018nothingness\u2019 has always thus far been something and everything but one day (which won\u2019t actually exist as a \u2018day\u2019) we will be erased and so a true state of nothingness will come into being as a something so profoundly real from a sapien perspective, if we could be there to see our own ceasing, and the word and the concept will disappear into our own personal and species void. Perhaps \u2018one day\u2019 a total and complete Nothingness will pick up Impossible, put it in its non-mouth, give it a good non-chew then non-spit it out, and non-wander off to a different world where the observers don\u2019t feel the need to think in black and white, and can give Nothingness a big hug and say \u2018there there we believe in you, it\u2019s all going to be alright .. have you met impossible far more fun than possible to play with!\u2019 After all the pesky law of conservation of energy rather suggests that nothing as something and impossible as possible are going to around for quite some time having a mad tea party- just depends what hats they choose to wear on any given \u2018day\u2019.

            "answer_text": "Yes, but with some important caveats. Let's assume that maximum possibilities exist within reality, perhaps within a multiverse, for example. Now, within infinite possible realities we are limited to one per lifetime at present. Within this lifetime, there are many possible yet highly unlikely things that still may occur. In fact, any occurrence which can be proven possible is actually destined to occur eventually. Through being possible an event becomes inevitable. It may be so rare that it's occurrence is statistically insignificant but it will happen, because it can happen. Being possible implies a chance of occurrence, and if existence continues long enough, even the least likely events will eventually take place. Probability tells us that amongst a set of possible events which are most and least likely to occur. No event represented within the probability model is impossible. This is crucial for understanding the nature of both probability and reality itself. If one looks into the true limits or boundaries of possibilities included within probable events, even those so remote they may only happen once a millennium, very few things are technically impossible from a scientific, objective standpoint. Time could begin running in reverse, for example, without violating the known laws of physics. A single person could lose every game they play for the span of an 85 year life. It is not common. It is not average. But it is possible, and if humanity lasts long enough this will occur. Just like the person who wins at every game will be born one day, time and population permitting. So, actually, although many extreme scenarios are highly unlikely, they are technically quite possible, just exceedingly rare. I am not arguing for an individual to place one's hopes in the hands of something only .00002 percent likely to occur. Turning one's existence over to the fates so completely for any reason will probably not result in a fulfilling life. If we can look beyond the mundane, however, the idea of what is truly possible can be a source of inspiration, spark our creativity, and potentially lead to new insights and innovations that see beyond individual comforts to a bigger picture of the human race and the cosmos with potential to spark innovations and insights from the genius in us all.

It is difficult to respond to and impossible to disprove, like Anselm\u2019s theory of God\u2019s existence\u2014that which is greater than anything you can imagine. Nothing is impossible simply means that in an infinitely large universe of an infinite number of occurrences, anything can happen at any time\u2026 But on a practical level here on earth, where life is short and gravity is a strong force bearing down on us, this sort of statement seems preposterous. Can a man on social security walk onto the field and play NFL football? Can a person with no scientific training discover a cure for a cancer? Yes, possible, but improbable. And probability is a more reliable marker. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends how you define your question. To start with the term \u201cnothing\u201d, it seems impossible to define what it is. No kidding. In theology, there is the notion that God created \u201cex nihilo\u201d (out of nothing), but in the last century or so, what exactly this nothing was before anything was created, has become a major question. Later, nothing was defined as a vacuum. I remember that the intuitive idea was to suck all matter out of a certain amount of space, and an experiment showed that the presence of a vacuum within two half balls has the surprising effect that the halfs can not be separated (or at least with extreme force that might break the half balls in stead of separating them). However, as time progressed (and my knowledge about vacuum was updated), it turns out that spontaneous matter creation happens in a vacuum. This was discovered by a Dutch physicist in 1948, and the effect is called after him, the Casimir effect. Two thin plates are measured to attract each other in a vacuum if they are placed close enough to each other. The explanation is that the random matter creation is likely to happen on the outside of the plates, but not between them. So, the matter that is temporarily formed causes a pressure from the outside only. Hence, vacuum is not \u201cnothing\u201d either. What is \u201cnothing\u201d? That is the million dollar question. In an intuitive reading of your question, it is half of a negative statement. \u201cNot something\u201d or \u201cNot anything\u201d is impossible? I believe it would be better to ask an affirmative statement such as: \u201cAre all things possible?\u201d But \u201cthings\u201d here is also a vague concept, and the answer is likely no. Do you mean objects, or actions, or circumstances? It\u2019s only by defining what the question means that it becomes a bit clearer if the predicate \u201cis possible\u201d is applicable. It may be possible to confirm that all things that can be imagined and are logically possible to exist, can actually be made. Or that any action that can be imagined and is logically possible, can actually be performed. Or that any situation or circumstance that can be imagined and is logically possible to occur, can actually occur. There is a theorem of probability theory that point in this direction: The probability that an event w with a probability p > 0 will happen tends to 1 as the number of events increases.Note. The probability p > 0 can be as small as you want. As the probability 1 \u2013 p is close to 1, but not equal to 1, (1 \u2013 p )^n will exponentially decrease with increasing n. But the probability will still be rather high if n is of the order 1/p. Especially if p is very small, (1 \u2013 p)^(1/p) ~ 1/e, and so if n = k/p, (1 \u2013 p)^n ~ (1/e)^k. To make this probability smaller than say 0.001, we have to take k at least to be about 7, hence n about 7/p for p very small. If p is about 1/1,000,000, it means that if we repeat the experiment about 7,000,000 times, that the probability that the event has occurred is now larger than 1 - 0.001 = 0.999. Still, with a probability of 0.001 it may not have occurred yet . . . As an application, we can say that for sure the Earth will be hit by a meteor, because it has been hit in the past at least once (Gulf of Mexico). So, we know there is a positive probability it will be hit. However, to alleviate the fear, the expected time before it happens again may be so far in the future, that it could be more likely that the Earth will be destroyed by the explosion of the Sun first. Why? Well, the meteor that hit the Earth in the past is definitely gone and won\u2019t hit us again. We actually don\u2019t know anything about this \u201cpositive probability\u201d, as there isn\u2019t any working model of meteorites hitting the Earth. Regardless, we can see on the surface of the Moon that it has been hit by numerous meteorites. It is hard to compare the fate of the Moon with that of the Earth. Perhaps the likelihood of a meteorite hitting the Moon is larger . . . It is a tricky situation. Another application might be that it is possible for an avalange to hit a train in the Alps with a small probability. Well, then it will certainly happen given enough time. Or, there is a small probability that a driver gets a heart attack on a freeway. Then it is certain that there will be accidents on the highway of which the cause is a heart attack. Etc. In the positive. If it is possible for mutations to improve an organism to become \u201csmarter\u201d, it will certainly happen given enough generations (and mutations). This is a theory that could explain why humans exist. But it doesn\u2019t necessarily explain why we exist on Earth. (That is more subtle.) ",

Does nothing represent zero. This is not mere repetition. Absence. David\u2019s absence, Sam\u2019s absence, Frank\u2019s absence. Does the totality of absences equal Nothing? Is absence a thing? We can experience someone's absence, so do we experience a bit of Nothing then? We can think our own absence from the world, but can we think nothing? God is not a thing, not any thing. Does that make God Nothing? Is that what we mean when we say God created everything, from Nothing? Has Nothing always existed? Taoism teaches that Nothing is useful, as a window is a Nothing that lets light in, as the Nothing in a cup allows it to hold tea. If Nothing is useful, must it exist for there to be something? Is Nothing the luminous void of which Buddhism speaks? Is the void a thing? You can't grasp it, yet it can be contained. You can't see it, but it is useful. You can have it in your pocket, but you can't hold onto it. So, it's not a thing in the ordinary sense. Is it a concept, that sort of thing? Once again, you can't grasp, hold, or get a handle on thinking utter absence, until you name it. Nothing. There, now it's something. We've done it., we've labeled it, put a handle on it. Now we can use it, as 0, as a starting stage for whatever mathematical or philosophical drama we wish to create. Being that can be understood, then, is language. Does that mean that Nothing is language? Of course it does. Nothing is a part of 2 binary oppositions: 1) nothing/something and 2) nothing/everything. This is the use I referred to in the example of the window and the cup.This is the abstract use. This is the use that stuns our minds when we try to think it. Like Everything, Nothing as its opposite attempts to reach the end of an infinite (Everything an infinity of things and Nothing an infinity of absences) which, of course, cannot be done, by our minds at any rate. Both terms are abstractions, and, hence, are real things in a different manner than everyday things. This is the use for mathematics and philosophy. A very useful use of Nothing.So, I would say that nothing is a very useful thing indeed, for the very reason that it is nothing, i.e., not a thing. if nothing is not a thing, then, Nothing both is and is not a thing.

If your soul supercedes, intercedes and impercedes everything and anything, past present future. Then no physical action can prevent it. Ill sum it up my friend. Nothing is impossible. State change to being energetically powerful in the positive, being in good space, good heart and good soul, then the physical will be ovewhelmed. Just like free will it is something that you must use. If you dont. You will not be possible from within. without is just a result of what is going on in your soul. Peace and love to you my friend.

So, technically, it's not impossible for me to do so.  But really, practically, it's impossible. No matter how hard I try, how much I want it, how much I train, it's nearly impossible for me to be point guard for the Celtics. So effectively, it's a false statement.

When I tell this to people, they start saying stupid things like \"Climb this wall\", \"Fly across the city\" but it does not mean in this way. Its about logical things that can be done. I have achieved several of my targets which many said were \"impossible\". I had to do an exam in May 2013, and in February 2013 in the mock exam I got a \"D\" grade. My teachers told me to drop the subject, but I didn't. I worked VERY HARD for the next 3 months, worked my ass out, to get an \"A\" grade in the same exam. My teachers apologized from stopping me and discouraging me before. Another time, I told some people I would start dunking, and one of my friends laughed and said I'm waiting. I started working on it very hard 4 months back, and today I can almost dunk the basketball in the rim and I can reach the rim now! So to me, everything is possible as long as you have the will and determination to do it. If you have no interest in something, then whatever happens, you'll not be able to do it. You can only do the impossible if you like, love and you're interested in that thing. Just be consistent, work hard and know your priorities! Comment if you have questions! ",

            "answer_text": "\u00a9 Short Answer: 0+0+0+\u2026=0 (Infinitisimal+Infinitisimal+\u2026.)Infinite terms=1 Where, 1/Infinity=Infinitisimal. Zero or nothing is absence of values. Absolute Origin of Absolute Reality isn't Absolute Nothingness, but the Absolute Totality of all Raw/Unrealized Options. Relative Perspectives are finitized sliced perspective of Absolute Totality of Reality. Singularities/Primeval Atom(s) are peephole(s)/ floodgate(s) between our Finitized Local Universal Cumulative Perspective and The Absolute Reality. Details:  Perspection can be considered as Conscious/Non Conscious collapse/realization/interference/Interconversion/interaction of waves of Raw Unrealized Probability waves function. According to my theory, Space-Mass-Energy (and other Expressions of Reality in Our Local Universe like Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Anti Matter, Exotic Matter etc) are representations of Quantized Infinitesimal Singular Entities called Qanta/Atoms of Reality. Size of Infinitesimal and Infinite depends on Local Universal Perspection, i.e., Quantization depends on Local Universal Perspection. Expansion of Space, Wave-Particle Duality, Virtual Particles popping in & out of existenc, Gravitation and other force fields, Gravitation lensing, etc can be given better explanations with these set of theories. Matter-Energy represents higher densities of Quanta/Atoms of Reality, & Space represents lower densities. Michelson Morley Experiment assumed aether of space to be a viscous fluid, that gets dragged by Mass-Energy, but low densities Quanta/Atoms of Reality that forms Space are non viscous, and doesn't get dragged by motion of mass. i.e., Quanta/Atoms of Reality can be moved by force acting perpendicular to it, but usually don't have viscous drag. This laminar nature/lack of turbulence(which limits vortex formation) of Quanta/Atoms of Reality is the reason for rarity of wormholes, which could act as hyperloop for Deep Space Voyages. Everything exists as raw unrealized possibilities until we perceive it. It doesn't mean that perspective is changing the reality, the reality is independent of perspective, & the reality remains the same, but an infinite wave of possibilities with which reality can be perceived get materialize/collapses/realized into a singular option. We might represent conscious part of Boltsmann brain, but there might be other sub conscious entities guiding & controlling us. Everything physical are different representations of Process Value-Time of Our Local Universe. We perceive Space and Time as separate entities, we worry that space will end somewhere, but are carefree about Time suddenly hitting infinity and coming to a sudden halt. Time is The dimension of Our Local Universe, every other Expression of Reality of Our Local Universe like Space-Mass-Energy are various representations of Cumulative Time Content. Primeval Atom(s) are like peephole or floodgates between Our Local Universal Perspective of Reality and Absolute Reality. Details: Beginning and end have meanings that depend on how it's being perceived. It's like the food chain, older meaning constantly gets diluted with newer ones. Energy, Consciousness, Natural or Artificial it all depends on perspective. If a video game character thinks that it's alive and Conscious, then it will be based on its own perspective & it's Relative definitions. But for us, those definitions might seem irrelevant. Video game universe's doomsday might be just a laptop shut down for us. the only certainty in a video game universe might be the processing time, according to which all processes in those universes are working. Every process and everything else is working according to process value-time. Similarly, in our universe things should be similar. Only Time might representative of Absoluteness in Our Local Universe, not local time, but local Universal Process Value-Time. i.e., Everything physical are different representations of Process Value-Time of Our Local Universe. Time is The dimension of Our Local Universe, every other Expression of Reality of Our Local Universe like Space-Mass-Energy are various representations of Cumulative Time Content. More Detailed Explanation: Images below give a brief introduction to my theories:  Absolute Origin is used as a concept, such that, not even nothing didn't exist before it.  Absolute Origin of Absolute Totality is the Absolute Beginning before which not even Absolute Nothingness didn't exist; every meaning, perspective, value, time originated in Absolute Origin of Absolute Totality. By the definition of Absolute Totality at Absolute Origin can't be Pre-biased, because not even nothing existed before Absolute Origin. =>Absolute Origin should be in Absolute Unbiased Conditions. By it's definition, Absolute Origin can't be a Specific Preferred State. =>State of Absolute Origin represents not only Absolute Nothingness but also all raw unrealized options. i.e., meanings, including the meaning of Absolute Nothingness originated from Absolute Origin. Being in Absolute Unbiased Condition, Absolute Origin should represent Absolute Totality of All Raw/Unrealized Options, which under different perspective might be perceived as different values/entities. Symmetry represents Unbiased-ness =>Absolute Unbiased perspective of Absolute Origin represents Absolute Symmetry. By Noether's theorem, continuous symmetry & conservation coexists. => Absolute Symmetry leads to Absolute Conservation of Absolute Perspective of Absolute Totality, and also this represents Absolute Totality at Absolute Origin. Absolute Perspective of Absolute Totality (which is also The Absolute Totality at Absolute Origin) is Immutable, Eternal & Immortal. => From the Absolute perspective of Absolute Totality at Absolute Origin, Time & Values loss their significance/meaning. According to my theory, Space-Mass-Energy (and other Expressions of Reality in Our Local Universe) are representations of Quantized Infinitesimal Singular Entities called Quanta/Atoms of Reality. Quanta/Atoms of Reality represents Singular Wave/Particle nature of Infinitely Infinite superimposed state of Primeval atoms. There should be at least some form of linearity between the logic of Mathematics and the logic of Physical world, otherwise, they aren't ta rue representation of each other, then our perspective of at least that logic If we assume that Physical Logic and Mathematical logic are linear (we don't have proofs to assume otherwise & physics-mathematics are still used to take logical calculated decisions), then there should be a physical equivalent for Mathematical Infinitesimal represented by Quanta/Atoms of Reality. If measurements are \u201cways of quantitatively or qualitatively ascertaining\u201d, then linearity between mathematical and physical logic should ascertain the existence of Quanta/Atoms of Reality. This Quanta/Atoms of Reality represents Process Value-Time of Our Local Universe. Mass-Energy represents wound up parts of the clock. Dark Matter represents the physical form of entropy, stalemate quasi-static condition of Space-Mass-Energy Interactions. Absolute Totality is Superimposed Summation of all Probability waves of Raw Unrealized & realized options, every Real-Imaginary, all Possibilities-Impossibilities, All Past-Present-Future, etc ere in da dissolved state as components of Absolute Totality. Options get realized by their constructive interference through Universal Cumulative Conscious perception. What we perceive as creation is the realization of existing options. Let's consider the example of Newton's laws of Motion: In simple words, Newton's First Law :An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. Newton's Second Law of Motion :Force is defined as rate of change of momentum. Newton's Third Law of Motion :Every action has Equal and Opposite Reaction. Newton's Theories are special case of Law of Equi-Preference as mentioned below:  In Absolute Totality, Value, Time, Space, etc lose their significance, they are tools of perception, like colors assigned by us to some narrow set of the electromagnetic spectrum. What we perceive as colors or voice are qualia perceived/manifested by Our Collective Consciousness in response to a narrow range of electromagnetic spectrum or narrow range of pressure variations. Additional Details: The time which we perceive is the Process Value-Time which acts as a representation of Space-Mass-EnergyInteractions, a lion share of Time perceive is a representation of Mass-Energy interactions with Space-Time It's not just Space that's intertwined with Timeto become Space-Time, but Space-Mass-Energy (and other expressions of Reality of Our Local Universe like anti-matter, dark energy, dark matter, exotic matter, etc) are also intertwined with Time to form Space-Mass-Energy-Time. Depending upon the degree of intertwining, different expressions of Reality are transcribed into existence like Space-Mass-Energy (and other expressions of Reality of Our Local Universe like anti-matter, dark energy, dark matter, exotic matter, etc). Let's take the example of Anti matter: We could annihilate matter and anti matter to create high density Energy source. But, Scientists have only detected only miniscule amounts of anti matter yet, even in high energy collisions, they are produced in miniscule amounts( in nanograms) yet. Reasons for disparity in the amount of matter-anti matter might be because of below reasons:  Image showing hypothesized analogy between Energy-Matter-Anti Matter production to kVA-kW-kVAr produced in Power Plant Alternators(AC Generators), as a crude representation of beverage with foam in a glass. Image credit: Free Image on Pixabay - Beer, Cold, Drink, Refreshment Edited only for demonstration. WHY ANTI MATTER IS SO RARE?!  According to my hypothesis, Antimatter is reactive component formed while Energy-Matter Conversion. Energy should had convert fully into Matter if there wasn't any variations in magnitude of Energy, but variations always exist in a dynamic system Because of very large values of Energy involved, magnitude of variation compared to actual magnitude, variations can be considered as negligible. But this variations in Energy act as reactive component to actual process, and create out of phase matter or Anti-Matter. Charge and massiveness(matter and anti matter nature) might be algebraic opposite for matter and anti-matter, but Energy-Matter conversion that created/is reason for matter in our local universe followed vectorial summation principle. This is similar to power production in power plant generator/alternator. Direct or steady Voltage current doesn't create reactive power, this produces only active components and inefficiencies; but Alternate Voltage-Current on top of this creates Reactive Component of power. This hypothesis can explains lower concentrations of anti matter compared to matter. This hypothesis maybe used to boost up antimatter production. In true sense, Space-Mass-Energy (and other expressions of Reality of Our Local Universe) are various expressions of Process Value-Time of Our Local Universe. Let's consider a simpler version of this train of thoughts to understand how Time can be perceived differently.  Energy drives the Mass-Energy interactions. Energy represents the momentum of m\u00d7c. Mass represents momentum of m\u00d70. Other velocities v are grey states created by Mass-Energycombinations. Below image shows a layman representation on why Mass-Energy systems find it difficult to achieve speeds more than c.  Image credit: Free Image on Pixabay - Smoke, Historic, Travel Einstein's Equation E=m\u00d7c^2 under current understanding is defined as Mass-Energy Equivalence, my theory extends this approach to cover Mass-Energy Equivalence with Space-Time and further more. If we consider E=m\u00d7c^2 only as Mass-Energy Equivalence, then we have failed to see the presence and importance of \u201cc^2\u201d in the \u201cE=m\u00d7c^2\u201d. \u201cc^2\u201d represents Space-Time((dx/dt)^2) Entity. Square of \u201cc^2=((dx/dt)^2)\u201d represents the fact that \u201cEnergy-Mass\u201d represents an Integrated value of \u201cSpace-Time\u201d. c is usually equated to 3\u00d710^8 m/s, but i have used c in my equations as speed of causality which represents relationship between relative absolute change in Space dx and relative absolute Change in Time dt; the relationship dx/dt should reasonably represents Elemental Speed of Space-Time Causality. Speed of light should be a representative of Relative absolute sense of Speed of Causality in Our Present Local Universe. I'm aware of E^2=(((m\u00d7c^2)^2)+(p\u00d7c)^2), that this equation applies more accurately to Mass-EnergySystems. But, mathematically we can conclude that (((m\u00d7c^2)^2) & ((p\u00d7c)^2) are partial representations of E^2, also that (((m\u00d7c^2)^2) & ((p\u00d7c)^2) are also equivalent entities, otherwise they can't be meaningfully added; we can with reasonable accuracy presume that (((m\u00d7c^2)^2) represents Mass-Energy entities or particle nature, & ((p\u00d7c)^2)represents wave nature. Also, under context in consideration here, proving Energyis Equivalent to Energy-Mass (of Mass-Energy systems) should be reasonably same as proving Mass & Energy are Equivalent. Also, c^2 is an important element in E=m\u00d7c^2. c^2 differentiates Energy from Mass. Mass-Energy aren't equal but equivalents. But, E equals (((m\u00d7c^2)^2)+(p\u00d7c)^2). So, c^2 can't be an insignificant entity, it should represents physical essence that physically differentiates Mass & Energy. Taking E=m\u00d7c^2 as Expression of Mass-EnergyEquivalence makes it reading partial truth. Equations needs to be read in a complete sense of it. E=m\u00d7c^2 represents relationship between E , m & c^2(square of speed of causality). We usually measure physical quantities by effects of their actions; in a crude sense, E=m\u00d7c^2 is total measure of effects produced by mass acting at speed of causality, and it represents Energy during the action. There're much more detailed explanations to each of my decisions; but my answer will become more and more longer, and will go out of contextual importance for the question asked. If E=m\u00d7c^3, that means in that Local Universe Energy-Mass represents double Integrated states of Space Time, higher density/condensed states. This might be state of matter in Black Holes/Singularity, where E=m\u00d7c^n, where n is greater than or equal to 2 and in wormholes value of n should be less than 2(most probably less than 1). (Unlike Time, Space-Mass-Energy are Real Physical Property/Phenomenon. Mass is a property represented by Cumulative Potential Energy Content.) (If c^2 was a dimension less quantity, then considering c^2 as a Mathematical Entity without physical significance would had been more reasonable. If c is significant, then c^2 should be significant too. Mass and Energy aren't equal, but Energy and m\u00d7c^2 are equal. c^2 is the Dynamic Essence that changes Mass(Static Entity) to Energy (Dynamic Entity). Energy represents Mass entities that can interact with Space-Time. Energy is a representation of Mass-Space-Time Interactions. E= (m\u00d7(dx/dt)^2) & m=(E\u00d7(dt/dx)^2) (Energy represents momentum of (m\u00d7c). Mass represents (m\u00d70). Mass and Energy are like binary states of Momentum/Speed in Our Local Universe. We use Energy to move Mass-Energy Systems. Under Normal Conditions, Maximum Momentum that can be achieved by diluting Mass-Energy System with Energycan be (m\u00d7c). We may need infinite dilution for completely purging out Mass Components with Energy Components in the System. Because of above reasons, Mass-Energy systems can't remain stationary in space unless dynamically stabilized. Further addition of Energy to the System after achieving speed of light will only momentum by increase mass with constant speed to (M\u00d7c). So, system will convert into form of light beam.) If c^2 is considered as a Mathematical device/Entity with no physical significance, Mass and Energy will become Physically Indistinguishable.) i.e., \u201cE=m\u00d7c^2\u2033 really represents \u201cEnergy-Mass Entities\u201d is Equivalent to \u201cSpace-Time Entities\u201d. Unlike Time, Space-Mass-Energy are Real Physical Entities/Properties. But, Mass is a property representing Cumulative Potential Energy Content, like Quark Potential Energy. Energy resulting from Higgs field interactions etc. On above premises, let's Consider \u201cE=m\u00d7c^2\u201d and \u201cc=dx/dt\u201d E=m\u00d7c^2 (Energy-Mass Equivalence - This has been proven by Einstein beyond any doubt with best knowledge of mathematics and physics.) and c=dx/dt (velocity=change in position w.r.t change in time), this equation help us understand that it takes 8 minutes for sun\u2019s rays to reach earth.) When we combine E=m\u00d7c^2 and c=dx/dt or dx=c\u00d7dt => c=(E/m)^(1/2)=dx/dt => i. dx/dt=((E/m)^(1/2)) => Space-Time and Energy-Mass are Equivalent Entities. Square/Square Root function implies that Energy-Mass is an Integrated Representation of Space-Time. ii. E= (m\u00d7(dx/dt)^2) & m=(E\u00d7(dt/dx)^2) =>Mass and Energy with Space-Time can be used to define each other, even though considering Mass as representation of Cumulative Potential Energy might be more apt. iii. dt=(dx\u00d7((E/m)^(1/2))) => Time can be represented as an outcome of Space-Energy-Mass interactions/Interconversions.After integration of equation, Space-Mass-Energy can expressions of Cumulative Time Content. Or in short, E=m\u00d7c^2 =>dx/dt=((E/m)^(1/2)) => Space-Time and Energy-Mass are Equivalent Entities. Square/Square Root function implies that Energy-Mass is an Integrated Representation of Space-Time. Energy-mass represents equivalent entities. Energy can be represented as elemental form of mass interacting with Space-Time, speed of light represents that interactions. Momentum related to Energy can be represented as (m\u00d7c). Momentum related to mass can be represented as (m\u00d70). Energy is used to acclerate Mass-Energy systems. So, even with Infinite dilution of Mass-Energy system with Energy, maximum velocity that can be attained by the System would be speed of light when 100% of mass in the Mass-Energy System is replaced by Energy, i.e., 100% constituent of the system is Energy(m\u00d7c). If a system becomes Pure mass (Dark Matter) or Pure Energy, Time can represent only their interactions with Space, as they won't be any internal interactions between Mass-Energy inside the System, their internal clock might seem to be in standstill conditions. But there will always be interactions between Mass-Space and Energy-Space, even though minute compared to normally occurring Mass-Energy interactions in Mass-Energy systems. So, Time represents interactions, it can be combinations and permutations of Space-Mass-Energy(& other Expressions of Reality in Local Universe) Interactions. Depending on the types of interactions in the System, Time will be perceived differently. Unlike Dark matter, which is a state of stalemate, and represents very low energy weakly interacting states, representing almost a static equilibrium, Black Holes are very high Mass-Energy dense states and represents more of a dynamic state of equilibrium. According to my theory, Space-Mass-Energy (and other Expressions of Reality in Our Local Universe) are representations of Quantized Infinitesimal Singular Entities called Quanta/Atoms of Reality. Quanta/Atoms of Reality represents Singular Wave/Particle nature of Infinitely Infinite superimposed state of Primeval Atoms. Quanta/Atoms of Reality can also be perceived as dice or qubits that are singular representations of The primeval Atom. Space represents low densities, Mass-Energy represents higher densities of Quanta/Atoms of Reality. Due to the difference in densities, Space-Mass-Energy interacts to attain an equilibrium, which is usually dynamic in nature, i.e., Surrounding Space and Mass-Energy exchange their properties to attain equilibrium. => Space attain Massivness, Mass-Energy attains properties of Space. Blackhole matter represents momentum of (approximately(-m\u00d7c)), intense gravitation is creating a high negative sense of momentum, and these negative momentum (negative/vacuum of momentum) affects the surrounding Space to create strong gravitational fields, so black holes can absorb the momentum of entities passing in close proximity through black holes fields. After momentum is absorbed by the black hole, the system inside the field attain a state quasi-static equilibrium, internal processes in the System seems to be frozen giving a quasi feeling of Time dilation.

            "answer_text": "What I personally feel is, anything that is Practically and Potentially possible is not impossible. Now Practically possible and Potentially possible are two different things. Practically possible is something which can be done, just can be done, it doesn't matter by whom, by a country, a team, a person or a company etc. Term Potentially possible differs from person to person and their capabilities. What is potentially possible for you to do might not be possible for me to do and vice versa. If someone says - Ajay can you bowl faster than Shoaib Akhtar's best? that is around 100.2 miles per hour (161 kmph approx), that is potentially not possible for me to do, so it is impossible in one sense but a kind of potential impossibility in my opinion. But this is a thing which is Practically possible. Had Shoaib Akhtar not broken the barrier of bowling @100mph first, people would have considered bowling @100mph too as an impossible thing. So there might be someone in the world who can bowl faster than that of Akhtar's best, it's that just we haven't seen him yet. Another important factor is \"TIME\". In 18th century no one would have thought that humans can reach to moon and now humans are examining every single planet of our solar system and are researching on, if Mars is a livable planet for humans or not. So something, that was impossible in an old century is now possible. Many things are there, that're practically impossible even now i.e. Can human run at a speed of 200kmph? Today it is impossible, and if we ask anyone to do so, he will say you mad why asking such stupid question. But who knows if it becomes reality after 2-4 century from now. ",

Its never too late and nothing is impossible to do. Some may consider the hypothetical situations and can make this statement wrong. But my Dear friends that's not the tone of the writer. He Just wanted to let us know that if we decide to do anything in our life with lots of sincere efforts, dedication and consistency then we can definitely get the thing in very particular time.  Means you can be the President of United states on a very fine day. But you need to take the sincere efforts and persistence to achieve that position. Period. ",

            "answer_text": " Surely this is a MIND-BOGGLING question which has been vexing our mind since long , yet no clear consensus is reached . I would like to see it from a different perspective as such .Enough is said about the acceptance or deniel on this qestion. I intend to examine the issue from its REALISTIC ANGLES . When we say \u2018nothing is impossible, we mean it in the same sense when we say \u2018They lived happily ever'. When we say they lived happily ever, we don't mean that they were IMMORTAL and they lived FOREVER \u2019 .Ever means at all times, always. Its synonym is ETERNAL. So too, when we say nothing is impossible, we in fact we don't mean \u2018 NOTHING\u2019 IS ANYTHING and IMPOSSIBLE is UNBOUNDED or LIMITLESS specially in the context of the reality that man himself is BOUNDED BY LIMITATIONS. For, he is no God . Therefore this is a MISNOMER. We CONTRADICT ourselves between what we say and what we imply. Because when we talk of man ,we have implicitly accepted the fact that man has limitations and his ACTIONS are bound to be limited too whatever limit that might be. SO THE REALITY ABOUT THE SITUATION HAVE REVEALED THAT MAN IS ENDOWED WITH SO MUCH OF HIS POWERFUL CAPABILITIES THAT HE CAN REACH UNIMAGINABLE HEIGHT BUT NOT THE SUPREME HEIGHT TO BE SYNONYMOUS WITH ANY LIMITLESS IMPOSSIBILITY. AND HERE THIS POSITION OF THE ISSUE IS ASSESSED IN THE CONTEXT OF MAN'S POSITION TODAY I would like to cite an example to substantiate the above line of thinking Man endowed with exceptional qualities and capabilities, have made great advancements in science & technology and in other domains. But a fact that causes great astonishment for man is that man has not been able to CREATE WITH ORIGINALITY a single product or element inspite of his magnificent BRAIN POWER. Whatever he has done is TRANSFOMATION or changing the shapes, sizes and color etc Dissecting ,MIXING,twisting, gathering of originals are activities described as PROCESSING and RESEARCH . All the inventions are on pre existed matters or elements of NATURE AND THE NATURE,S LAW operates BEHIND every invention . EVEN those products like color claimed to be original are in fact are effects obtained from pre existed originals. But my citing of the above example is intended only to analyse the reality of man\u2019s position today and to look at the question from this real perspective However ,this is also not meant that there is no possibility that the above situation will change . Possibility is also a relative term and anything is possible .TODAY\u2019S IMPOSSIBLITY IS TOMORROW \u2018S POSSIBILITY.  Therefore when we say that nothing is impossible we should take it from realistic point of view. The question implies MORE ABOUT THE SPIRIT IT CARRIES FOR INSPIRING PEOPLE THAN FINDING ITS LITERAL MEANING. ***IMPORTANT FOCUS POINT : What's important is the SPIRIT IN MAN (the question indicative of it ) ; it should be the FOCUS POINT .Our analysis above is to emphasize on the REALISTIC ASPECTS of IMPOSSIBILITY in the context of man's capabilities to give us clear concept about the whole issue . Having done, we should BELIEVE that ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE TRUSTING OURSELVES AND IN OUR REALISTIC GOAL.\u2018IMPOSSIBILITY IS A WORD TO BE FOUND ONLY IN THE DICTIONARY OF FOOLS \u2018--NAPOLEON BONAPARTE : These inspiringly mind \u2018INFLAMING\u2019 words and the situation in which NAPOLEON told them , have been still inspiring millions all over the world . It has been inspiring me too since my childhood time when first it worked WONDER for me by making me write exceptionally well in my school annual exam.which I was about to stay away due to sickness. One must read about the awe inspiring story how NAPOLEON inspired his Army Generals in the face of grave dangers and turned a terrible situation to his favour. ***TAKING INSPIRATION REGULARLY FROM GREAT SUCCESS STORIES AND LIVES OF GREAT ACHIEVERS IS A MUST FOR ASPIRANTS FOR ACHIEVING SUCCESS AGAINST GOALS, (could be CATEGORISED IMPOSSIBLE. )To actualize an impossibility a few PRECONDITIONS if fulfilled nothing can hold you back .BASICALLY THREE THINGS CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE. * FIRST INFLAME YOUR MIND AND YOUR DREAM WITH THE FIRE OF STONGEST POSSIBLE WILL- POWER TO REALISE IT.** 2NDLY REALISTI C FOOLPROOF GOAL , MUST LOVE PASSIONATELY WORKS FOR ITS FULFILMENT .***Thirdly a STRONG MIND SET AND BELIEF IN ONESELF ADDED BY HARD WORK,DETERMINATION AND INDOMITABLE COURAGE should be DEVELOPED . PATIENCE AND POWER OF ENDURANCE BE RAISED TO HELP TO OVERCOME DIFFICULTIES AND NEVER TO GIVE UP UNDER ANY CONDITION.\u2018A MERE MAN MAY BE EASILY DEFEATED BUT A MAN WITH THE POWER OF GOD( power of self confidence in case of non believer) WITHIN HIM, IS INVINCIBLE.\u2019 ",

According to me, this quotation is application only, when you set your goals at the right time. The opposite is when you are too late in deciding your objective. GOALS AT THE WRONG TIME Let's say you are 60 years old, but you wish to travel at a speed of light by inventing a new plane ( Elon Musk is trying to make one such thing). It is right now impossible for you. For it, you need to research and work for many years from the age of youth. Here your target is not at the right time, that's why you cannot achieve. AIM AT THE RIGHT TIME On the other hand, suppose, your age is between 6-40 years old.And your dream is to invent a new 'lightning speed plane.' It is possible for you at this age to do such thing. Here your target is at the right time, so quotation is applicable. Therefore, it all depends on the time at which you target your goals. ADVICE If you are dying to achieve something in your life, and you think you have enough time to work out. Put all your heart, mind and soul to it. If you let the \u2018Time\u2019 skip, your dream will become impossible. Act for your goal \u2018NOW\u2019, then you will see Nothing is impossible. ",

However I find that the impossibility of occurring of an incident is relative with respect to time. 200 years ago, talking to someone 10000 miles far was quite impossible even as a thought. Still we managed to make it possible. A hypothetical thought analysis of mine tells me that if you can think of something, then one day that might actually work. Suppose you believe in science and not God. You will treat these thoughts as revving an invention or a discovery. But suppose you convince yourself that there is a god. You never know if one can actually find or create a god in future. There are a lot of possibilities, like more than the highest number we know yet. Similarly if you believe that someone is going to love you or help you or stab you in your back, you may not see it happening in just your one life. When you consider alternate realities, that might be the case in one of them. Nevertheless its very subjective, therefore I can't agree completely with it. And one of the other reason is that my hypothesis is involved which is nothing more than a piece of crazy thought for someone who doesn't believe in all this. P. S. A friendly piece of advice- being said that nothings impossible, don't start expecting too much. Without hard work, almost every thing is impossible. ",

But the more i think about it, i realize that not everything is possible. For instance, we cant change the past, we cant change things that have already happened. Even if we had the power to go back in time we couldnt change things. This is because if things are changed in the pasf then they dont happen in the future and so if they dont happen you dont change them and if you dont change them they dont happen. I know its a bit confusing, but still. We also cant take the words we have said back. As much as we want we cant do it . Life gives us oppurtunities. Once missed we cant get the same oppurtunities back in life. We need to grab these oppurtunities when we get the chance. Speaking literally you cant do everything, but you can do anything. You just have to beleive, persevere and work hard and if it is the will of god, or if it is your destiny, you can do it. ",

The only thing is that we should have confidence in us. Whenever, we do any task however difficult it is we should start with the optimistic approach. Keeping the negative approach itself moves us towards failure. We saw many things from history also which seemed to be impossible, but with the help of many scientists, things came into existence. The examples, are in front of us. The scientists like Albert Einstein etc. have proved that impossible things are also possible. So, whenever starting before any task, we should start with the optimistic approach towards it. ",

One system will say not possible as there is Energy. One system will say possible as part of the dualism (everything vs nothing). Other systems will say other things. Nothing at the end of the day cannot be proved as you need something to proove it. And also one cannot say \u201clast time I checked, there was nothing\u201d.

In his book Musicophilia, Oliver Sacks tells the story of Tony Cicoria, a 40 something year old physician who got struck by lightning. He recovered, but started showing an insatiable interest in music. He acquired a piano and started teaching himself to play. Despite not showing any prior interest in music, he was able to compose music and gave several recitals. Look up acquired savant syndrome.* My Professor in college who taught Probability Theory used to say that by the Law of Large numbers any event that has non-zero probability will happen at some point given that enough time has passed. So in an eternal Universe everything that can physically be possible happens! Would I live my life in the hopes I\u2019d be struck by lightning and acquire a skill that would make me successful? Unlikely events are an unexpected surprise, but they only enhance my life, I don\u2019t base my entire life on that chance.

And donot talk in your sleep again\u201d Sam said, \u201c It's not about just one dollar wife. I convinced that man in my dreams to give me 99 dollars and when he was almost there to give me that one last dollar you woke me up. Now I can't go back to that same dream and find that man\u201d You see. This is impossible. You can't go back to the same dream when completely awaken. You cannot simply slide back to the same sequence. You have no control over dreams. Hence it is absolutely impossible to go back to your unconsciousness once awaken. It's as impossible as going back into time. Going back to yesterday or the day before yesterday. You can simply think about it but can't go. So yep. It's not true that nothing is impossible. Heard about toothpaste theory? You cannot put it back into the tube. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes definitely it is true Once, an experiment is concduted on ten people who were punished with death sentence. All the ten were blind folded and made to sit on a chair with their hands and legs tied to it. All were said that they are going to implement their death sentence by cutting their wrist. Among ten, wrist is cut only for five people and a perfect illusion (as their wrist was cut) was created to remaining five. Scientists took all care that second batch of five people doesn't know that they were not cut. They used a dummy knife to cut and ran water over their hands in order to make them think that it was their blood. After twenty minutes all the ten found to be dead. Another example, a lady who likes German (not fluent though) went to coma after an accident. After waking up, she started taking fluent German and forgot her own mother tongue. Our brain has unusual capacity to recreate everything in such way we want and to do anything that even a human being can't imagine. All that we have do is tune it and train it and start using it. ",

P.S. an allowance for fate and destiny if made well in advance will ensure you don't end up feeling like a failure. Because some things are just not meant to be. Like forcing the sun to rise In the west and set in the east. I've been at it for some years now, but my allowance for fate and destiny to play its part let's me brush it off and chase a mountain instead. ",

We did make it to the Moon, didn't we? Statement: Humans could go to Mars in an 18th-century chariot. (Sorry, that was the best I could come up with!) Impossible. There needs to be a certain baseline of knowledge and awareness that informs one about the improbability or implausibility of something to determine that it is indeed impossible. For instance, a nuclear or aeronautical scientist will tell that an inter-stellar or inter-planetary rocket can be propelled by ionic wind (the so-called electrohydrodynamic effect). This may seem \"impossible\" to someone in the 21st century who is, to put it more euphemistically, less aware and knowledgeable, or to someone who existed in BCE (Before Common Era). But, unlike them, the aforementioned scientists have a reasonable baseline of knowledge and awareness to hypothesize as such. Don't fool yourself by chasing something that you have determined to be implausible and improbable. You can choose to resume the chase later when you are ready or you can just let go. And who is the best person to make this determination for you? You. ",

In reality it is the combination of \u201ctwo\u201d numbers which certainly isn\u2019t \u201cnothing\u201d, it is \u201ctwo\u201d \u201csomethings\u201d. So it takes \u201ctwo somethings\u201d for there to be an apparent nothing, which doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s like asking if there was nothing before the universe, well then how can the universe come from nothing? It\u2019s impossible. It simply has always been there until conscious awareness noticed it. It is we who have labeled 0 as a number with a language that we created. It is us who has labeled everything by observation. Afterall we do exist right now at this instance do we not? Can you imagine not existing? You can\u2019t can you? Like energy, we have always been here, and always will be. ",

There are many countries in the world where the basic necessities of people are not fulfilled so expecting the government of that nation to provide good education to kids is futile. However, some individuals have the capability to do something which others consider as impossible and we are going to tell you about one such human being. We are talking about Owura Kwadwo Hottish who is from a village in Ghana and is a teacher by profession.  Recently, he took to Facebook to tell people about the method that he is using to teach his children the subject of ICT (Information and Communications Technology) and that too without a computer.  He draws a computer on the blackboard and makes students feel that he is actually looking at the computer screen.  This method has worked well with the kids and they are enjoying his classes.  Here\u2019s what Owura said, \u201cI do it to make my students understand what I\u2019m teaching. At least to give a picture of what they will see assuming they were behind a computer. I do make sure they understand everything well before they leave the class.\u201d It is rightly said, \u201cWhere there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way!\u201d Kudos to him! The world needs more such teachers. What do you say? Source:- Man Teaches Poor Kids MS Word By Drawing It On Blackboard. Where There\u2019s A Will, There\u2019s A Way ",

When the railroads were being built, medical authorities assured us that the human body couldn\u2019t handle speeds over thirty miles an hour. Lister\u2019s germ theory was ridiculed. So was Madame Curie. Newton thought the universe was infinite and eternal, and that the atom was the smallest natural building block, then relativity and quantum mechanics came along. There were those who assured us the Higgs Boson was a myth, and that Cern was just wasting money. We were assured we could never get past the Asteroid Belt to reach Mars, then we landed two probes, there. Thirty years ago, \u201ccancer\u201d was still an automatic death sentence. The list of \u201cimpossible things\u201d assured us by the \u201cbest minds\u201d could fill a house. The fact is, we have no idea what is possible or impossible. For a fallen people living on a fallen planet, we have managed to harness our brain-power to do enormous good, and our courage to take the necessary risks to make great explorations. All because we\u2019ve held, \u201cNothing is impossible\u201d as axiomatic. ",

If someone cannot make anything possible then one may say it is impossible but at the same time that thing might be possible for others.

Some times we try to make something possible for which we don't have prerequisite but at the same the same time the same thing is possible for someone who got prerequisite. This is matter of \u201cAll other things being equal\u201d Whenever one tries to make something possible and dones not care about \u201cAll other things being equal\u201d, fails but if \u201cAll other things being equal\u201d then nothing is impossible for anybody .

Now same scenario without time in hand Against ex 1: An average person who wants to become a successful sportsperson overnight, nahh not gonna happen The list is endless for both pro & against the statement. Space travel(sanatan scriptures mentions about it though), internet, telecommunication and many modern inventions and achievement of human\u2019s have shown that combination of our curiosity, hard work and learning with time has made lot of things possible which earlier generations couldn\u2019t have imagines.

            "answer_text": "Absolutely nothing is impossible. One of my teacher Renu Khublani told us about a recent study at IIT, Dr. Ray Menon placed rats in a pool of water to test how long they could tread(walk in) water. On average they'd give up and sink after 15 minutes. But right before they gave up due to exhaustion, the researchers would pluck them out, dry them off, let them rest for a few minutes - and put them back in for a second round. In this second try - how long do you think they lasted? Remember - they had just swam until failure only a few short minutes ago... How long do you think? Another 15 minutes? 10 minutes? 5 minutes? No! 60 hours! That's not an error. That's right! 60 hours of swimming. The conclusion drawn was that since the rats BELIEVED that they would eventually be rescued, they could push their bodies way past what they previously thought possible. This study give a thought of : *If hope can cause exhausted rats to swim for that long, what could a belief in yourself and your abilities, do for you?* Believe can make us do anything impossible, just like rats in this study , 60 hours of swimming means 2 and half day and that too for rats it was something above impossible but they did it because they believed in themselves . Keep working hard and believing till your last breath. NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. ",

I saw the TSR2 flying over Preston on test, escorted by two fighters. I was in the control tower at Heathrow (by coincidence) when the last Concord took off (for Bristol). I sailed on the ill fated Atlantic Conveyor in peacetime but was there in the Falklands (on a different vessel) when she was hit by an exocet and sank. RIP.

It was done within 4 hours of appeal. So I thank Quora team for acting so fast and letting the truth prevail and leaving the haters red faced.
