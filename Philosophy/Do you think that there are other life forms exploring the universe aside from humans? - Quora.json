            "answer_text": "QUESTION: Do you think that there are other life forms exploring the universe aside from humans? ANSWER: We can\u2019t know, until we encounter evidence that we recognize. So far, all the direct evidence is negative. No visits. No signals. (Unless you are a conspiracy theorist, in which case, don\u2019t bother reading this.) On the other hand, much of the indirect or circumstantial evidence shows that it is more and more likely that life, and very possibly intelligence, exists. The question is what does \u201cexists\u201d mean. With all the trillions of stars in all the billions of galaxies, and with observational evidence suggesting, not only that most of them have planets, but also that some large percentage is likely to have rocky planets that could be like ours when it began, there\u2019s lots of potential out there. So we are likely talking about billions of planets - maybe even billions in our own galaxy - that have what our planet has - solid surface, comet impacts to bring water ice and hydrocarbons, internal heat, possibly a magnetosphere, a nearby (but not TOO nearby) source of solar energy. Statistically speaking, it would be unlikely that there is not life elsewhere. It would necessarily evolve by natural selection. If intelligence wasn\u2019t some absolute fluke, then there are likely to be other intelligences out there, some of whom must be curious about their place in the cosmos. It\u2019s hard to imagine something truly intelligent that ISN\u2019T curious. The problem is partly WHERE they are, and WHEN they are (er\u2026 were\u2026. or are going to be). Look how long it took us to get to the point where we are capable of looking out, finding other worlds (observationally\u2026 we can\u2019t visit), and broadcasting our own presence out into the universe. Others, too, must have gone through a period when their worlds exude an expanding bubble of electromagnetic signals that could be distinguishable from non-intelligent sources. But in all the time that there has been a planet Earth (4-billion-ish years?) we\u2019ve been electromagnetically obvious for barely more than 100 years. Before Marconi and friends, we were electromagnetically non-existent to the rest of the universe. Microbes and fishlike creatures and early land-crawlers and dinosaurs and assorted mammals and lizards, and early humans all the way up through the steam age\u2026 do not produce any signal that can be detected from another star system. Even if we don\u2019t wise up and get a bit paranoid about announcing ourselves as possible prey, we are still going to become less and less visible if we survive. That\u2019s because blasting out electromagnetic broadcasts costs money. Early radio transmitters and receivers were very inefficient. Shortly after we invented them, we started refining them. The lower the power, the more refined and efficient our communications become, the less unintentional leakage there will be, into outer space. Therefore, as we use \u201cquieter\u201d more efficient, more directional, lower-powered signalling among ourselves, we will naturally become less obvious to outsiders and more difficult to detect against the cosmic background. Similarly, if we destroy ourselves, our little planet will go silent, not long after it found its voice. What does that mean in a universe as vast as this one? Consider just our own Milky Way galaxy if somebody on the farthest opposite side of our local galaxy had sent us a loud radio signal, for us to hear this week, that race of intelligent extra-terrestrials would have needed to launch their transmission 100, 000 years ago. To get a signal to us, from just the other edge of the same galaxy, they would have had to send that signal before there were humans on earth. At the speed of light, that radio transmission would be just getting to us now. Think about electromagnetic waves and the inverse-square law. How weak would it be, after expanding at the speed of light for 100,000 years. If we actually detected it, over/under the enormous radio-frequency noise that is coming from billions of stars, from the super-gigantic black hole at the galaxy\u2019s center, from pulsars and quasars and other high-energy phenomena\u2026 and if we then sent a signal back, it would be 200,000 years for them, from original sending to receiving something back. Two hundred thousand years ago, \u201cwe\u201d might not even have been quite the species that we are now. Some classifications put the speciation more like 50,000 years ago. But even so, we would have been pre-language, grunting and signing to each other and not even (yet) able to tell each other stories about the lights in the sky. What are the chances that humans will exist ten, twenty, one hundred thousand years from now? What about MUCH nearer to us in the same arm (or a a near one) of this galaxy? What if the most recent nearby civilization was a few hundred light years away? What if that civilization reached its broadcast-radio stage just around the time that Columbus was setting out for North America? They were electronically noisy for a hundred or two-hundred years, and then either annihilated themselves, got caught in an extinction event, or developed their technology to be efficient and quiet, and that brief window of \u201chey there\u2019s somebody\u201d signalling went whistling past us around the time that \u201cMurrica\u201d was having its revolution. No radios. No radio telescopes. We were still too primitive to notice the neighbors setting off fireworks. Now consider distances between galaxies. Millions and billions of light years. The distance that light can travel in a year\u2026 times a million, or times a billion, or ten billion\u2026 the numbers are so big that we can\u2019t encompass the time-spans in our minds, never mind the distances. What are the chances we\u2019d be looking in the right direction, with the right equipment, exactly five billion, six hundred million, two hundred and ninety-eight thousand, four hundred and eleven years after somebody \u201cover there in that galaxy\u201d sent a signal big enough and clear enough to be detected here, in 2016 (when I wrote this)? To make an artificial signal stand out from natural sources of radio noise (or gamma-ray noise or whatever frequency was selected as likely to travel furthest and penetrate intervening gas and debris and plasma and\u2026) they would need to have consumed an entire star as a power source. They would also have needed to perform that enormous engineering task (consuming the economies of perhaps hundreds of thriving worlds) that-many billions of years ago, in order for the light-speed wave-front to be arriving at our little world just as we were technologically ready to receive it, and maybe understand what we were receiving. Consider further that the universe is \u201conly\u201d about 14 billion years old, and billions of years ago it was different than it is now. Stars were an earlier generation. Not as many big ones had exploded and seeded the cosmos with heavy elements - the constituents of \u201clife as we know it\u201d or \u201clife as we can imagine it\u201d. So, if a galaxy is currently 4 billion light years away, and a star in that galaxy hosted a planet that had been through four billion years of development, as ours has to produce us, then that planet would be 8 billion years old. That\u2019s more than halfway back to the Big Bang. The dust and gasses that condensed to form that star and its planets could very well have had quite different proportions of elements heavier than the ubiquitous hydrogen. Would that planet have been as conducive to life, after it cooled, as this one was, with all its iron and aluminum and copper and other elements that our lifeforms use? Just sayin\u2019. Anyway, to sum up, my unedjumacated opinion is that there probably are/have-been/will-be many intelligent species out there, but the distances and the timespans make it very chancy that we could detect them, and impossible that we could converse with them. The best that we can do is: a) look b) when we get solidly established in space, construct and leave behind a \u201cmemorial\u201d to ourselves that some future civilization might discover. Of course, whether that would inspire awe or fear in them would be another question\u2026 after all, if they discover our monument to ourselves, that would immediately raise the question: What killed off the humans, and are we next? The facts of universe-size distance and time, and the fact that we have not detected anybody in the decades that we have been looking/listening suggest that, even if other intelligences are, or have been, \u201cout there\u201d, our chances of being in the right place at the right time and looking with the right equipment is very small indeed. And if they haven\u2019t got to our level yet, then by the time they do and start listening, we will likely be extinct or quiet for other reasons and they won\u2019t detect us. If they send out signals (intentional or not), chances are we will have run our course before that signal ever reaches our world, and the cockroaches that survive us won\u2019t notice or care. Big numbers are awe-inspiring, and they kinda suck. ",

            "answer_text": "Pedantry: all other forms of life on Earth are also exploring the universe, albeit in what we think are lesser ways. I\u2019ll assume the question relates to intelligent life outside the solar system. I think yes, but at present that cannot be more than a hunch. There are some necessary steps on the path to intelligent life like ours, about which we have no evidence at all. We now know that most stars have planets. We have no reason to think that there won\u2019t be at least millions if not billions of planets in this galaxy alone, which have liquid water on their surface. Lab experiments have shown that most mixtures of water, methane, and rock, will generate simple organic molecules under the influences of electric discharges (lightning), solar UV, and hot rock (volcanic activity - probably not essential). So the raw ingredients of life will exist elsewhere. We don\u2019t know anything at all about the transition from simple organic chemistry to life. Is it almost inevitable, a one in a billion chance, or so unlikely that in the entire universe it has happened just once? (Here). Likewise, we don\u2019t know anything about the likelyhood of transition from simple life (monocellular, or its unknown, extinct, precursors) to multi-cellular organisms. We do know that here, it took around three billion years for the latter to happen, and that is the greater part of our Sun\u2019s stable lifetime. It\u2019s also a few times longer than the earliest fossil evidence for simple life. There\u2019s \u201conly\u201d a few hundred million years left for future life on Earth (unless our descendants can fix that). Then the sun will have become hotter, enough boil or burn all life on the Earth out of existence. If the sun lasted just one day, we\u2019d have arrived on the scene at about 8pm. If we were a bit lucky getting here by now, that suddenly starts making other arrivals elsewhere before midnight look a lot less likely. (A lot of small red stars live far longer than the sun, but they are also less stable than the sun, and habitable planets would have to be closer, and would end up blasted by flares, or with one side permanently facing the sun like the moon faces the Earth \u2026 more unknowns.) We have simply no evidence of life anywhere except here, and one can draw no conclusions at all about the likelyhood of life elsewhere from just one observation thereof. The observation of life elsewhere would change everything, but the observation of life on a planet outside out solar system would be extremely difficult. So it\u2019s just a hunch. Unless the evolution of multi-cellular life is almost inevitable given a planet with surface water and a star that will be stable for a few billion years, we probably never will detect even simple life anywhere else (which tells us nothing). The speed of light is too slow, the distances are too vast. We could be alone in our whole galaxy, and there could still be billions of other intelligences out there, with a small fractional chance of any one galaxy containing just one of them. They\u2019ll all be wondering, as we are, \u201care we the only intelligent beings in the universe, and can we ever know for sure? \u201c There\u2019s a reason I think intelligent life is not nearly inevitable on a wet planet, or in pessimistic moments, that intelligent life usually destroys itself. Where are the robot Von Neumann exploration probes? I think it\u2019s probable that organic life cannot ever cross interstellar space. It\u2019s possible to argue against strong AIs or humans uploaded into robot bodies doing so. But if we last as a technological civilisation for more than a few thousand years, surely we\u2019ll work out how to construct a probe that can construct copies of itself out of barren asteroids when it arrives at a nearby star system, some to explore outwards and some to return the observations to us and some to simply remain, saying \u201cwe exist\u201d? A simple program, maybe less than that which drives a bacterium, and definitely designed not to mutate. Even if we then went extinct, they\u2019d carry on exploring and leaving that message. They could reach every star in the galaxy in a \u201cmere\u201d few hundred million years. If we aren\u2019t the first in our galaxy, where are the others\u2019 robot exploration missions? This argument could yet change. We\u2019ve not yet explored the Moon and the other rocks without destructive atmospheres and tectonics in enough detail to know that there isn\u2019t a message from the others within our reach. ",

            "answer_text": "The universe is a \u00ab very \u00bb big place. As for what we call life, since we only do know of the phenomenon of self-replicating and growing matter from immediately around us, it is a statistical probability some comparable phenomenons may exist somewhere else around the bazillions of stars we know of. But the universe being so vast, many of the stars we know of are actually dead already, and the means to physically explore the vast emptiness of space are staggeringly challenging. Might there be some other life forms based on silicium instead of carbon ? Or gaseous ? Well, Perhaps. Within the realm of what we know ; we\u2019ve got to acknowledge we know little. Yet one thing we do know : The traveling times between solar systems would be absurdly long within the physics as we know them, and everything else is just pure fantasy. So many forms of \u00ab life \u00bb may have happened or not in many corners of the observable universe ; but is it VERY unlikely any of them would make it to another one. It\u2019s more likely many of them were exctinct already by the time there were microbian life right here. As for the probability any of us would get to some first contact with even some alien microbian life, again, the odds are terrifyingly short. And in the end ; would we even be able to acknowledge or recognize another form of life as such ? We tend to form categories with what we know already. It\u2019s hard enough to get a clean cut answer whether plants are \u00ab sentient \u00bb or not ; so would we have any chance at acknowledging the status on some gas-based life at all ? In fine, odds of finding life-forms roughly based on carbon like we are ; that\u2019s almost plausible. That it could have evolved towards something roughly related to animal life as we know it is shaky at best. We\u2019re already very weirded out by many things we discover in the deep oceans.Things that evolved on an altogether different planet would probably be very hard on our little brains. And if they could achieve means of intergalactic travel ? Well we\u2019d probably be unable to fathom the idea much like a bacteria can\u2019t handle the idea of a human being. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a virtual impossibility that there is no other life outside of earth. If there is intelligent, sentient life on the level of humanity or higher is a totally different question. The chances for that seem to be good, however the problem is that we\u2019re dealing with a sample size of one (earth) and we don\u2019t even exactly know how life arose here. I think once we can replicate the conditions and successfully create cellular organisms spontaneously we will then be able to come up with a pretty reliable answer as to how abundant life is in the universe. There\u2019s lot of theories and many attempts to test them however none have ever had any success. Current estimates put the rate of sentient life in the universe at about one per galaxy. Again, that\u2019s made with lots of assumptions that will no doubt change over time. But it sounds like a decent guess to me. I think we would have been visited by aliens already if there were another in our galaxy. With the current age of the universe there could be a civilization about 600 million years older than us right now (we\u2019re at a paltry 250k years), so if intelligent life was extremely abundant then the galaxy sound be teeming with it and we should know of it\u2019s existence. Where will humanity be in 600 million years? It\u2019s doubtful we\u2019d even recognize ourselves physically, let alone mentally and technologically. Of course there\u2019s the possibility that aliens are not contacting us out of some desire to let us grow on our own or that maybe we\u2019re being studied like creatures in a zoo or maybe they\u2019re waiting for us to cross some technological threshold before revealing themselves. Those things seem unlikely to me however since it would only take one rogue alien to screw things up and humanity is getting to the point where we should be able to detect intelligent life, or any life at all, on planets in our galaxy.

Mind: Fuck u dude.. you have no idea about the difference between believing and just thinking whatever u want to. Actually I'm sorry.. just because u can't properly think that's why I had to exist. And about the other life forms, we don't literally have positive proofs. Everything some person says about UFOs has no real proof and might just turn out to be a conspiracy theory. Heart: But, people say something because they saw something. Mind: Oh \u2026. U foolish bloody organ.. you don't know the types of people and their different tactics of gaining publicity. And even if someone saw some UFO really, then why did it disappear and didn't let others see it. Heart: Why can't you learn to respect people and believe in what they say ?

Heart: But, those movies \u2026 they also get their ideas from somewhere \u2026 do you ever give a thought on that ..? Mind: Look who is talking to whom about giving thoughts. Yes the movies get their ideas from somewhere and that somewhere is imagination. I'm very strong and that's why I can take our master to different thoughts with my imagination power.

Why can't they just look like us, or be black and white without large spiky ears and why can't they be technologically backward?

            "answer_text": "Astronomers have been searching out extraterrestrial planets using a variety of telescopes and detection instruments since the late 1990s and now have found thousands with the Kepler space telescope finding about 250 new planets a year for the last 4 years. Most of those discovered so far could not possibly support any kind of life we can imagine but NASA says 7 \u2018earth-like\u2019 planets have been found. But we also know that nothing human-like will ever exist on those worlds because \u2018earth-like\u2019 is not the \u2018like Earth\u201d we have in mind. All we are finding out is that the estimates for the number of planets in our galaxy are probably good estimates which means millions of planets in our own galaxy with billions of galaxies in the visible Universe. So far, the results of the search indicates that maybe one in several thousand planets may be enough like Earth to support at least simple multi-celled creatures. We can therefore confidently say that our galaxy is not teeming with advanced civilizations but may have a few hundred scattered randomly around our galaxy which is 100,000 light years in diameter. None of the \u2018nearby\u2019 stars has earth-like planets, either. Which brings up the fact that we and any extraterrestrial civilization live under the same laws of physics. So far, our fastest space craft are unmanned and have only managed to get beyond the orbit of Pluto and into interstellar space after 38 years of constant travel. Getting a space craft directly to Pluto took 10 years, it takes our missions to Mars about 2 years to go that distance. The same approximate ability may be in use by other intelligent beings on other worlds which of course means we won\u2019t be shaking hands with extra terrestrial beings soon or maybe ever. So whatever those unidentified flying objects are, they are not operated by advanced beings touring Earth on vacation. ",

            "answer_text": "A new study suggests that there are around 700 quintillion planets in the universe, but only one like Earth. Astrophysicist Erik Zackrisson from Uppsala University in Sweden arrived at this staggering figure \u2014 a 7 followed by 20 zeros \u2014 with the aid of a computer model that simulated the universe\u2019s evolution following the Big Bang. Zackrisson\u2019s model combined information about known exoplanets with our understanding of the early universe and the laws of physics to recreate the past 13.8 billion years. Zackrisson found that Earth appears to have been dealt a fairly lucky hand. In a galaxy like the Milky Way, for example, most of the planets Zackrisson\u2019s model generated looked very different than Earth \u2014 they were larger, older and very unlikely to support life. Zackrisson\u2019s work suggests an alternative to the commonly held assumption that planets similar to Earth must exist, based on the sheer number of planets out there. Astronomers have, to this point, discovered around 30 exoplanets in the habitable zones of stars. Simply extrapolating that figure based on the known number of stars suggests that there should be about 50 billion such planets in the Milky Way alone. Probability seems to dictate that Earth-twins are out there somewhere. But according to Zackrisson, most planets in the universe shouldn\u2019t look like Earth. His model indicates that Earth\u2019s existence presents a mild statistical anomaly in the multiplicity of planets. Most of the worlds predicted by his model exist in galaxies larger than the Milky Way and orbit stars with different compositions \u2014 an important factor in determining a planet\u2019s characteristics. His research indicates that, from a purely statistical standpoint, Earth perhaps shouldn\u2019t exist. Source: Earth May Be a 1-in-700-Quintillion Kind of Place - D-brief ",

Imagine, a 3rd of them have life. Now say a fraction of them have a race of beings that have moved past the planet and started exploring space. Lets say a 6th of all the planets with life. That\u2019s still 1,800,000,000,000,000,000,000 planets that could potentially be exploring space. And this is theorized from what we know that exists now. I would say, without a doubt, that there is something somewhere searching and exploring space right now. I cannot tell you where or how far away they are from us, but they\u2019re there. ",

It took more than 13 Billion years and a billion different species that have come and gone on Earth to finally have ONE species with the ability to explore the Universe. So it takes a helluva long time to cook up life forms with exploring capabilities. And humans nearly didn't make it. We were nearly entirely wiped out by the Toba volcano extinction event. But 13+ billion years for the universe is way way way way too early to start bumping into other planetary civilizations. See the Universe is expected to last about a googol of years. Thats almost like infinity from human time scales. It's more likely we would have advanced across several levels on the Kardashev scale and already populated several planets across our Milky Way or even across nearby galaxies that we might bump into Aliens. But note that most likely, the aliens we meet before that would actually be ourselves. Humans that colonize Mars would become Martians. They would be taller and thinner than earthlings. They need less oxygen and would not survive on Earth without life support. The Earth gravity would incapacitate them too. Every planet or moon colony would evolve to suit that environment, which would have been terraformed but never equal to Earth. That's impossible to ever achieve, an exact environment of Earth.  ",

            "answer_text": "There are many, many more planets in the universe that have evolved higher forms of life than our people in the testing school of Earth. Many of these beings coming from the constellation called Betelgeuse. These beings are pure energy. They can travel to our planet in a spirit form, but when they come toward the Earth atmosphere, they have to incarnate in a vehicle because Earth has different density and vibratory nature from their own planet. They can put on any form they wish. Most of the spirits on these other planets are of a higher vibrational rate than us on earth. It\u2019s painful for them to come to earth in a spirit form because they have to lower their vibration. It\u2019s like trying to condense a tornado into a glass. Many other entities are coming from Aldebaran and Sirius. These beings belong to the federation of 36 planets. Many beings have gathered from all over the universe to see the upcoming events and changes on Earth observing and monitoring different forms of life that exists in the ocean, our communications, our electronic capacity and our nuclear power. They also observe the evolutionary rate of our planet and to see if we will evolve to a higher degree, in order to take its place within the galactic federation. This is a spiritual confederation of advanced beings centered in light and love. One group of these beings are called the Watchers. The watchers helped form man on Earth. They were the ones who were involved in the seeding of man on Earth in the past. The Watchers have come to help in the evolution of man from his barbaric level into a high vibratory level. The Watchers have constant communications with their home planet and with all other planets.They have perfect knowledge of time and space and what is happening at all times. They use telepathy to interact with each other and with other beings. They are very advanced and they can send energies over great distances, or periods of time and space. They can travel faster than the speed of light through wraps of time. ",

Firstly, anyone with a decent understanding of biology will testify to the fact that life as we know it is almost unimaginably complex. My personal view is that life as we know it is so improbable that Earth could actually be the only planet in the Universe where there is any life at all; certainly complex life. Then there is the \u2018distance problem\u2019. Distances between stars are staggeringly large - even our fastest spacecraft which are leaving the solar system now will take something like seventy thousand years to reach the nearest star; homo sapiens has only existed for about fifty thousand years. At the time of writing, I am not aware that anyone has the foggiest idea how we could realistically undertake journeys to the stars, let alone other galaxies. Best advice is to assume that we are alone, and always will be, and that we won\u2019t be going anywhere soon. ",

If only 1% of them are in the Goldilocks zone then that\u2019s billions of possible planets for life to happen on. You can get simple life by just mixing the right chemicals for the right amount of time, under the right conditions. Admittedly they\u2019ve only managed to make very simple single-celled life in a lab, but it can be done. Even if only 1% of the 1% have life then the odds of things that can see the sky existing elsewhere is pretty good. Just don\u2019t expect them to be looking through telescopes :) ",

Here I am on the fence, there might be and there might not be. Looking at how long it took for us to be where we are and the conditions that allowed for us to idle around the milky way I must say that I believe that intelligent life form might be rare in our observable universe. Other people have came up with theories suggesting that there might be silicon based intelligent life form, again I am on the fence here. What I strongly believe in is that there is some other life form, basics life form, in this universe. There are speculations that there are microbes deep inside the ice of Jupiter's icey moon. ",

Our sample size is admittedly small ( \u201cOne\u201d is not a good sample to draw conclusions from) , but we now have detected that many of the stars we see have planets around them. That sampling is evidence of an astronomical (sorry) number of planets where some similar arrangement of circumstances can generate life. That is not necessarily the same as \u201cintelligent\u201d life, but there are again, no rules that say no. So I \u201cbelieve\u201d that there are other life forms. I suspect there may be others that exist in anoxic environments (because we have some that handle that near the sub-sea vents), there may well be methane breathers out there. We just don\u2019t know because we can\u2019t go look. Yet. ",

There have been recent discoveries of stars with planetary systems like ours. Even with planets we like to categorize as in the goldilocks zone. This means we are looking for recognizable life in those planets so we can somehow relate and possibly colonize. Climate change will be the least of the worries there i guess. Looking for signs of life as we know it may be a handicap. What if alien lifeform is unrecognizable? If those happen to be beyond our visual or auditory wavelength that our instruments can detect, then they would be right under our noses and we\u2019ll be clueless about it. Living organisms outside our planet will definitely be very different from what we are used to. It will not be carbon-based and definitely not like those in the movies. Then there is intelligence. What if this is a very unique trait? ",

However, I contend that our (dual) universe is one of a near infinite number expanding, impinging and coalescing making unimaginably old and huge universes in which the chances of life emerging tantamount to certainty. All these universes obey the same laws of physics but evolutionary constraints might result in different life forms emerging although conscious life will emerge.
