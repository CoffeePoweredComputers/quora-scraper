            "answer_text": "Contrary to widespread perception, science can only address relatively simple questions, essentially relative to narrow and basic physical phenomena. You could call that ground-level investigation. That leaves everything else to philosophy. Among that are many questions relative to science itself as an object of investigation. Whether philosophical ideas are useful is a loaded question. How do you measure usefulness in this instance? Philosophy is one of the way human beings try to make sense of the world, and I don\u2019t think we would want to deprive ourselves of this resource, particularly as we are getting into a phase of humanity where the problem becomes increasingly humanity itself.

            "answer_text": "Philosophy has a lot to advise science. Philosophy must remind science to get back to where it started from. Plato shared the \u201cAllegory of the Cave.\u201d The story can be used in many ways, but it points to a transcendental reality that people readily deny, including scientists. Also it describes two paths to truth: the ascending path (induction) and the descending path (deduction). Contemporary science is long on experimental data and short on theory. Many scientific descriptions of reality, its relations and mechanics are empirical or statistical in nature. These two approaches need to be balanced. We need a clear working model for what is happening under the surface of the quantum realm. A good course on science should begin with the philosophy of science. Without inner wisdom and scientific intuition, we may be like bad students who see things outwardly but lack inward insight. ",

After we know what \u2018is,\u2019 we want to know what it \u2018means.\u2019 To understand what \u2018it\u2019 \u2018means\u2019 is to apply creative, intelligent thought and imagination. The more intelligent, the more knowledgeable the mind, the more creative the mind that looks at meaning, the more we find the \u2018is\u2019 connected to human life, embedded in the human experience and able to tease out the good and the beautiful, and for that we are all enriched and better off.

            "answer_text": "This question and variations of it keep showing up on Quora. Science does not explain itself. Science is just applied Common Sense with a lot of experiments. What every you conclude from the data you accept has to have statistics applied to it, so the data does not speak directly to you. The data you have gathered is dependent upon being observed via your senses or machines that extend your senses, there could be all sorts of things going on that we have no notion of their existences. Why do you think the neurons in your brain, my brain and everyone else\u2019s brains are sufficient to understand the \u201ctruths\u201d of the Universe, why should that be the case ? So yes, Philosophy is quite beneficial to Science. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, plenty. For instance, questions about what to do with the findings of science fall under ethical philosophy. So do questions about how to do science ethically, e.g. with testing on human subjects or animal subjects, and which animal subjects. Then there are situations like the current fashion for multiverses. In many cases, the alternate universes are taken to be forever unobservable. In that case, can they properly be part of a scientific theory? Whichever answer you give, the question is one of philosophy of science. Also, the multiverses are, in some cases, proposed a the obvious and economical solutions to one problem or another. But are vast or infinite arrays of (unobservable) universe \u201ceconomical\u201d? Another philosophical question. And so on. ",

            "answer_text": "My experience with philosophy has largely been in taking classes in metaphysics / philosophy of the mind, so I only have a partial perspective on this. But I\u2019d say that there are major implications of this field in neuroscience. Specifically, insights from philosophy are being used to inform neuroscience research on things like free will, the nature of consciousness, and emotions. I\u2019m overly simplifying this a bit, but essentially, armchair philosophers create the hypotheses which scientists can then empirically test. This has led to the emergence of new interdisciplinary fields such as the Philosophy of Neuroscience, Neurophilosophy, and Neuroethics. There is also an increasing number of philosophers and psychologists working side-by-side in academia to better understand human behavior and motivations. You can find a larger discussion here: The Philosophy of Neuroscience ",
