            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know about information-sharing, but this video purports to show how group meditation can enhance the meditation practice of each participant: It seems to me that this would be required for telepathy to be real, but I am not convinced that the phenomenon being demonstrated is real. If THAT isn\u2019t real, I see no possible way that telepathy can be real. Even if the group meditation is real, that\u2019s still not telepathy but it seems that you can\u2019t have one without the other.  ",
