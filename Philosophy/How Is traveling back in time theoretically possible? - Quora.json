            "answer_text": "The first step to answering the question is understanding the concept of a wormhole (also known as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge). Wormholes, which can be thought of as shortcuts to arbitrarily far away points in space, are described by a solution to the Einstein field equations. This does introduce a problem, because according to general relativity, the only way to keep a wormhole stable is with the use of exotic matter. This complicates things because scientists have only managed to create a tiny amount of exotic matter, much less than what\u2019s required for a traversable wormhole. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that a wormhole is impossible, it just means that we are unable to create one with our current resources. OK, so you\u2019re probably wondering why this has anything to do with travelling backward in time, but that\u2019s where Einstein\u2019s Theory of Special Relativity comes in. Consider two wormholes, which will be denoted WH1, and WH2 , connecting two points in space. Now imagine launching WH1 to the nearest star system and back at a rate very close to the speed of light. According to Special Relativity, WH1 will have experienced much less time than WH2 after the journey, meaning WH1 is literally younger than WH2 despite the fact that they were both created at the same time. So what would happen if you entered WH2? Well, since time works differently inside a wormhole than to an outside observer, travelling through WH2 (the one that stayed at rest in your frame) would cause you to emerge from WH1 at the point in time when WH1 and WH2 were the same age, which would have to be right before WH1 accelerated off into space. So time travel to the past is most definitely theoretically possible, but because of the negative energy requirements, it still remains in the realm of science fiction for now. ",

            "answer_text": "A process that occurs around rapidly spinning massive objects called frame dragging rotates the space time coordinates along the plane defined by the time axis and one of the space axes. This is generally perpendicular to spin tangent. Speeding something up collapses the space and time axis like an egg crate along the direction of motion. Frame dragging rotates space time around a plane so movement in space at that point moves you through time relative to the outside universe. Some directions of movement allow you to exit the orbit before you arrived but travelling forward in time. This is the popular conception of a Tipler time cylinder. Other paths cause you to exit the orbit still travelling backward in time. This is virwed by others in the cosmos as anti matter. A useful process if you wish to convert lots of matter to energy. Also useful going back in time to a point before the time machine was made. The only problem is avoiding contact with the rest of the cosmos and changing directions in time. If a portable massive spinning object is sent along with you along your backward time trajectory you can use it to reverse direction in time to forward again at your desired destination in time. Arranging to build a time cylinder in that eralier time will then afford you travel forward and backward in time (and convert bulk matter to bulk antimatter) at any point forward - which is useful for travel and communications instantly through spacetime ",

            "answer_text": "Anyone who conclusively says time travel is theoretically possible at this point is engaging in some serious hyperbole. There are some mathematical interpretations of the universe that suggest that it might be possible - but these are so abstract and removed from any currently applied theories of physics that they\u2019re really just mathematical thought experiments, and tenuous ones at that. The proof is more in the pudding. If time travel were possible - at ANY point in the future of the universe, then it would effectively be possible at EVERY point in the entire timeline of the universe - we\u2019d have jackasses who\u2019d gone back to ride dinosaurs long before our species ever existed and the causality of human history would be an unrecognizably bizarre mess. Frankly it\u2019s extremely difficult to posit a remotely stable existence in which time travel is possible. In any case, we already know that no-one went back in time to ride the dinosaurs or kill Hitler, because it didn\u2019t happen, which is a fairly strong proof that it never does happen, because when you are talking about time travel, future/past tenses don\u2019t really make sense. ;) ",

            "answer_text": "TIME BENDING According to this, time bends or slows down around high-density objects. Which means the observer can see his surroundings move a little bit faster. This can be merely experienced when we sit beside a pyramid or sit on a mountain. But its extent can be increased by increasing the extent of the high-density objects from mountains or pyramids to black holes or stars. This is acceptable one as it doesn\u2019t have any objections from physical laws. TIME DILATION This technique explains about how an object experiences abnormal behavior of relative time when the object travel with high speed. This dilation can be expressed as an equation which is given below: t\u2019=t*root(1-(v^2/c^2)) t\u2019=dilated time t=actual time v=velocity of the object c=speed of the light According to this, the related time purely depends upon speed of the object. If the object\u2019s speed is very much less than the speed of light, then it can\u2019t experience any difference in relative time. When the object is approaching the speed of light, it starts to experience its relative time getting slowed down. This is accepted by theory of relativity. But when it is taken to extremities, when the object reaches speed of light (3*10^8 m/s), the time related to it stops. But what happens if the object reaches more than the speed of light, the time may get reversed. these are some of the chance to travel through time theoretically ",
