For example, \u201cthe sky is blue\u201d is an objective truth, or \u201cthe Earth is round\u201d is an objective truth. Second, is taking ownership of the consequences for how you live in objective truth. It isn\u2019t enough to live in the same reality that everyone else lives in, you have to accept the consequences for how you live in that reality. If you don\u2019t do these two things, you\u2019re an objectively bad person. If you\u2019re incapable of doing these two things, you\u2019re probably a psychopath and should seek professional help.
