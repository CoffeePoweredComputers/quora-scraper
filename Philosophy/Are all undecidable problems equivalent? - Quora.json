            "answer_text": "No, it is not the case that all undecidable problems are equivalent.  The study of degrees of unsolvability is precisely that of classifying decision problems according to their relative hardness, and it is a central area of recursion theory. See the Wikipedia article on the notion of  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_degree for more. ",
