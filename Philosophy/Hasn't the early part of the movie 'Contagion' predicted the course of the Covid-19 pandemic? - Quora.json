            "answer_text": "Some of it. This was an educated prediction based on known facts. The threat was based on the sources of viruses coming from bats in China. Chinese bats were already being studied for viruses before coronavirus. The scene with the bats was shown at the end of the movie. Other movies have been made about Ebola type viruses coming from Africa. Another movie showed a virus escaping from a US laboratory. These scenarios are quite possible. The movies about Planet of the Apes involved viruses being tested on primates. So it is not unusual for such a prediction to be made. It is based on knowledge that we have. Eventually, some predictions will come true. I believe that Next Generation, Generation 4, nuclear reactors will be a vital source of cheap, safe and clean low carbon energy. This is a prediction-based on known facts that are easily available. Though most people would not want to believe it is possible. Most people want to develop renewable energy to supply our energy needs. Despite the available information that shows that renewable energy will not replace fossil fuels effectively. Partly because people do not understand the scale of the problem. When I try to explain the facts most people are uninterested. So predictions are not difficult. And the movie was not a direct prediction with detailed events and times. ",
