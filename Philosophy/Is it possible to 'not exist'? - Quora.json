            "answer_text": "To answer whether it is possible \u201cto not exist,\u201d we need to first explore what it means to \u201cexist.\u201d The following are quotes from an Anonymous source about the possibilities of the reality and purpose of our existence (sans bold and italics, with some editinfollog for flow, including some rearranging of order of the Anonymous quotes): The real truth is that there is no true human reality in any belief system invented by humankind\u2014not even one! There is no such thing as the \u201csupernatural\u201d or the \u201cparanormal,\u201d or any other mysterious occurrence that cannot immediately be understood by the human mind, if the correct explanation is given. \u201cMystery\u201d and \u201cphenomena\u201d are simply acknowledgements that we can\u2019t understand something about our reality. As disquieting as this proclamation might be for most, \u2026 its substance and veracity can unequivocally be proven . \u2026 Concerning those things which are currently accepted as \u201cmysterious\u201d and \u201cphenomenal,\u201d [if one has a sincere desire to understand more about his or her existence than he or she can honestly admit that he or she presently knows, then [one] will be astonished at how much emotional peace and security he or she will find by having all the mysteries of life explained in plainness. The true reality will surely set one free! In the realm of true \u201cHuman Reality,\u201d a human birth has the same significance as creating a whole new Universe. Without the human being and its ability to consider the implication of its own existence, what meaning or significance would a Universe have? No other life form is cognizant of the concept of a \u201cUniverse\u201d except for the human being. When a new human life is created, it has the free will and capacity to comprehend and react to its surroundings according to its own unique perception; therefore, a completely new Universe is formed. Only humans seek a meaning for their existence. As humans, we have the opportunity and choice to question our existence and to act upon the conclusions we accept as the answers (unlike other life forms that don\u2019t have the ability to worry about their existence). Because of this, we are constantly striving to give meaning to our own lives and the lives of all other life forms. We continually seek development and improvement, focusing our human nature on whatever provides for and benefits our unique \u201cself.\u201d Our incredible minds have placed us within our own individual \u201cUniverse,\u201d set apart from everything and everyone else around us. Instead of our environment mandating what we can and cannot do, we use our intelligence to subdue everything that surrounds us, attempting to have complete dominion over it. Sometimes our desire to control our environment benefits us and sometimes it acts as a detriment to our existence. Even now, the earth is jeopardized by our unique desire to control everything about our world. The earth in all of its beauty, strength, and greatness is no match for human free will. \u2026 Regardless of how we use our intelligence to subdue the environment in which we find ourselves, the fact still remains that we can. As humans, we have the opportunity and choice to question our existence and to act upon the conclusions we accept as the answers (unlike other life forms that don\u2019t have the ability to worry about their existence). Because of this, we are constantly striving to give meaning to our own lives and the lives of all other life forms. We continually seek development and improvement, focusing our human nature on whatever provides for and benefits our unique \u201cself.\u201d Our incredible minds have placed us within our own individual \u201cUniverse,\u201d set apart fromeverything and everyone else around us. Sure, by brute strength and threats, free-willed individuals can be subdued and forced into submission to any rule or law. But exactly to what do our leaders expect us to submit? What kind of \u201corder\u201d is found in knowing that there exists the capability and availability of thousands of nuclear weapons, and that just one could destroy an entire culture of people? What kind of \u201corder\u201d is there found in the plight of the hungry, the homeless, the naked, the sick, and the impoverished\u2014the state of existence of the majority of the human race? What kind of \u201corder\u201d is there in the racial and cultural separations and prejudices that cause one, supposedly \u201cequal\u201d human being, to hate or disparage another? The very standards, laws, and rules that are restricting our personal freedoms, and are being forced upon us to maintain this \u201corder,\u201d are having the opposite effect on our individual peace and happiness. The world leaders are steering humanity into chaos and anarchy; and if they remain unchallenged, we could ultimately be led to our own destruction. But long before we are physically destroyed from without, we will be emotionally destroyed from within, stemming from our inability to find our own individuality and fulfill our individual needs. The kind of \u201corder\u201d that was established for us and not by us has created hopelessness andinequality that are a far cry from the happiness that is supposed to be the purpose for why we exist. No matter in what stage of development human beings are found throughout the Universe, all humans have the same equal opportunities, advantages, and abilities to reach the fullest potential of the most advanced human beings. The most advanced human beings live in an existence of perpetual happiness. They are fulfilling the purpose of their creation in all aspects of their personal self-fulfillment. We have continually searched for a reasonable conclusion about how we came into existence since the time we were old enough to consider our individual existence apart from everyone else. We search out any explanation that gives us some semblance of assurance that our life has a valid meaning. This search has led to a wide variety of different speculations. But with each new theory, more questions arise; and in an attempt to answer each new question, another theory is proposed. In order to come to a complete understanding of who we are and why we exist, we must be willing to accept the following: First: Human beings are the greatest and most significant life form (or any other compilation of matter) in the Universe. Second: All human beings, no matter in what stage of their development they are found throughout the Universe, are indisputably equal in their potential to optimize their existence as free-willed life forms. It is a false idea that higher forms of intelligent life above humans exist in the Universe. Ideas such as \u201caliens,\u201d science-fiction \u201ccreatures,\u201d or non-human monsters or machines will be expelled from our thinking once we learn more about how our creative thinking process and imagination work. For now, we must consider what we know to be the real truth by being honest about what is happening upon this earth: humans are indeed the most intelligent and complicated life form in existence here. There are no other forms of life that are comparably close in intelligence, or better, that have the same potential to optimize their existence, as human beings. If humans have always existed, it would logically follow that advanced societies of human beings also exist and can be found throughout the Universe in infinite numbers. How far do human beings need to advance until they know all that there is to know? How long before we know about every atom that makes up every element that makes up every molecule that makes up every cell that makes up every part of every living and non-living particle of matter that exists and has always existed in the Universe? Regardless of how long we think it would take, only human beings (and no other life forms) will ever attain a complete knowledge of the source of all matter. Furthermore, human beings are the only life form that seems to care about attaining this knowledge. There are human beings who have this knowledge and understand it as a real truth. Along with this knowledge, they have the capability (the power and ability) of using it to do whatever they desire. Consequently, HUMAN BEINGS CONTROL EVERY ASPECT OF THE UNIVERSE. THE UNIVERSE EXISTS EXCLUSIVELY FOR HUMAN BEINGS AND SUPPORTS THE DESIRE OF HUMAN BEINGS TO OPTIMIZE (make the best of) THEIR EXISTENCE. --ANONYMOUS ",

            "answer_text": "I assume you mean, is it possible for you or I to not exist. Some clear definitions of what you are is required. If you consider a material approach then certainly the arrangement of matter that make up you will possibly cease to form that structure at some point in the future, and its pretty certain it did not exist before you were born. It is arguable that this happens all the time and the you tomorrow is not the same you, and thus the you yesterday has ceased to exist. But, this is temporal non-existence - just meaning that there are moments in time in which you do not exist. It is possible (depending on the scope of possible future/past/present realities) that the physical arrangement of you will exist at other times. Similarly to times in which you do not exist there are also places in which you do not exist. In your own perception however I would argue that you cannot \u201cnot exist\u201d since this is not a perception that you can have. Instead you would perceive only those moments in which you exist. Also once we start talking about your perception we are considering a part of you that expects a linear continuation through time - which starts to get onto other definitions of you. We find it very hard to think outside of a linear uninterrupted progression of time. But should an arrangement of atoms of you at this moment exist anywhere in space or time, or in any future or even past Universes that could come into existence, then in your own perception it may just appear to you that you have teleported there. If this seems unfeasible then we need to change the definition of you to include some form of self which is outside of the physical and cannot be simply reproduced by an arrangement of matter. Non-dualism would break this down further to the very awareness of existence which all conscious entities appear to have. Since there is no characteristic difference between one version of this awareness and any other (all personality and physical characteristics being something that this awareness observes rather than being any property of this awareness), then this awareness exists so long as anything conscious exists, and also can never be aware of any time that no instance of it exists. There are other non-physical definitions of you (apart from considering these as processes of the brain), such as the concept of your ego, or train of thought. But these also can follow the same argument as the material one above, in that the ego just has times/places in which it does not exist but that it cannot experience that. So I guess the answer is, to an objective observer - yes it is possible for you to not exist for specific sets of space/time locations since you are not omnipresent. Unless you consider yourself to be the \u201cI am\u201d awareness behind everything. In which case if there is an objective observer then you do exist in them. Or if you consider that the \u201cyou\u201d now is the exact representation of you right at this instant, then the instant is an infinitesimally small slice of time, and so effectively you do not exist at all.
