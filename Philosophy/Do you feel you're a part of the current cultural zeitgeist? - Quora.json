            "answer_text": "In some ways more than in others. I live in a relatively liberal country. Feminism has shaped our society thoroughly, which has led to fairly good equality. As to the LGBTIQ rights, our legislation is not yet perfect, but there has been considerable progress during the past decades. I firmly support equality, and seeing how the world changes towards a more human one is a great joy. But at the same time I feel in many ways as if I had been transferred to our time from an era that was less hectic, less noisy, less patchy, less hasty, and less nomadic than ours. I have trouble adjusting myself to constant change, to the idea that identity itself is a process rather than something stable and permanent. Above all, I don\u2019t want to be the result of my choices as a consumer, to let the market forces define my true self. All this identity building that seems to proceed from the outside towards the inside, often hand in hand with materialism, seems artificial and thin. I feel that we have lost a great deal of our capacity to be moved by the miracles around us \u2014 our ability to feel a connection with nature and to appreciate what\u2019s slow, laborious, and difficult to grasp. We have sacrificed what\u2019s essential for what\u2019s entertaining. Who are we in the middle of all this? Aren\u2019t we just nomads jumping from impression to impression, outsourcing the task of defining our true identity, not really taking the time to ask who we are in our heart of hearts? In that sense, I definitely don\u2019t feel I would be part of the current cultural zeitgeist. Instead, I sigh with Luis Eduardo Aute: In the past they used to be prophetsAnd now success is their only goalMerchants, dealersCreate a feeling of sadness more than nauseaNot even for a moment did they touchBeauty Antes iban de profetasY ahora el \u00e9xito es su metaMercaderes, traficantesMas que nausea dan tristezaNo rozaron ni un instanteLa belleza We know enough to save the planet from the destruction we keep busy causing. And yet we numb ourselves so that we can ignore the clear signs of danger and go on like before, anaesthetized by consumption, laughing only to not need to cry. That\u2019s something I don\u2019t recognize as mine, although I\u2019m not immune to that siren call. And whenever I feel awakened, I escape to the forest, to feel the immemorial consolation of the miracle that is nature. ",
