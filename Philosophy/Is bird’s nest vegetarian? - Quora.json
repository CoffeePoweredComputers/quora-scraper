            "answer_text": "No it is absolutely not. It is built with the saliva of birds and at times these birds with a certain type of ailment have blood in the saliva which makes the nest discoloured carrying higher value. To me this is pure ill-treatment of innocent lovely birds for something that hasn't been proven beneficial at all. I am highly critical of some of these traditional Chinese medical stuff which include tiger testifies, alligator meat, rhino horned, etc which have caused depletion of wildlife unnecessarily! This birds nest is another of those superstitious and un-proven belief of millions who pay for something which is totally rubbish. As for vegans and vegetarians this is an emphatic no no all the way!
