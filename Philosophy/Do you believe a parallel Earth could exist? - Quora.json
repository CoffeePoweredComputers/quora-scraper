Which somehow I remember downloaded an anime and completely watched it for the first, and when I reached the ending it somehow fascinating and when I decided to rewatch it again it wasn't there anymore the ending was gone and I got confuse by how? And hey I downloaded the video and I didn't watched it on the internet. Not only that I remember what I was like sitting on a bed from the left side on the wall, and when I fell asleep and wake up I suddenly remember I was sleeping on the right side on the whole. And yeah something like that happen or is it just me for somehow. There's some people also like they've watch a downloaded movie and when they finished the movie they decided to rewatch it again but the lines or some scenes are not there anymore or it changes by itself which is so weird.

            "answer_text": "Parallel Worlds, there are many of them. Sure, I believe in them and in past life regression we occasionally have clients who go into parallel reality instead of a past life. I am talking about ANOTHER YOU, who looks like you, has parents who look like your parents, but lives a different life - has a different occupation, has moved to another city or country, met a different mate etc. Are we seeing a different parallel world - or a variation of your current life when different choices were made? Dolores Cannon talks in one of her books and lectures about reality splitting into different timelines, every time we make a decision\u2026Have you seen movie \u2018Mr.Nobody\u201d on Netflix? In this movie the character lives several parallel lives at the same time, as he is aware of each timeline when decisions were made\u2026In future life progression we take clients into different versions of the future, and they can see how their life will shape when they make this or that choice. What are the reasons these parallel realities exist? There is \u2018Many Worlds\u201d theory explaining how it is possible from Quantum mechanics perspective Many-worlds interpretation - Wikipedia. There is also a theory that we live in a computer simulation, so every possible version of each game exist at the same time, like a code of a computer game, where every combination of every step is possible. We are actually living multiple parallel lives at the same time, like a simultaneous \u2018Groundhog Day\u201d playing every possible version of our current life, and after we die - all these multiple versions of you will unite into one Higher Self\u2026 Whatever the truth is - it is a mind blowing idea to meditate upon, and by accessing these parallel selves we can attract skills, and character traits we might want to have\u2026you can find confident you, extrovertive you, a musician you, an artist you etc. These meditations can be quite useful, and you can take Burt Goldman class or get his CDs which promise to put you in touch with all these \u2018parallel yous\u201d - here is a short free meditation  ",

I\u2019d not expect to find parallel Earths if I could go to them unless the universes where infinite in size and have the same exact physics as our universe. But then if our universe was infinite we wouldn\u2019t need to think about other universes to find another Earth as any finite volume within an infinite universe where the laws of nature are consistent will eventuate with duplicate regions of any finite volume since for any finite volume there are only a finite number of configurations is could have.

            "answer_text": "Q: Are you a strong believer of the parallel world theory? If yes, then why? A: Which one? There are between 4 and 9 different classes of parallel world hypotheses (not theories) \u2013 each with a lot of variants. Some are pretty much likely to be true, others are more out of this world. Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics: the idea is that when a quantum event can happen, the idea is that all possible outcomes does happen. The regular Copenhagen interpretation is that these possible outcomes could be seen as a probability wave package of all superpositioned possible events, which collapses to one outcome when the event is observed. The many-worlds interpretation is that all outcomes happen, and each form a separate timeline of its own.Remember Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, a thought experiment where you put a cat in a box together with some means of killing it and a \u201cquantum event trigger\u201d \u2013 for instance a radioactive element which may or may not decay and send out radiation. In the Copenhagen interpretation, the cat would be dead and alive at the same time, until you open the box and observe the cat. Only then would you have a dead cat or a living cat.In the many-worlds interpretation, the timeline instead splits into two: one where the quantum event happened and the cat died, and one where it didn\u2019t and the cat lives.Weirdly enough, there are some experimental support for both of these interpretations.Hubble volumes: The universe is big. Really big. And it probably doesn\u2019t stop at the cosmic horizon of the visible universe, but continues beyond that. We just can\u2019t see it, because there has not been enough time for light from beyond to reach us. Each such volume could be seen as a separate universe (called Hubble volume) since it cannot affect us anymore, and we cannot affect them.Hubble volumes almost certainly exist.And not only that: physicist Max Tegmark argues that there is a finite way that you can arrange particles in a finite volume, so within 101010155101010155metres, there ought to be a Hubble volume which is identical to ours with a copy of you. Somewhat closer, there may be a Hubble volume that is identical to ours, with the exception that you are of the other sex.String landscape: In string theory, you need a lot of extra dimensions (like height, width, depth dimensions, not alternate universe dimensions) \u2013 up to 11 is the most cited number, in which strings exist and vibrate. How they vibrate and thus form particles is not the thing here, but what to do with the other dimensions that we can\u2019t see.String theory argues that most of those dimensions are compactified, so that only height-width-depth-time remains \u2013 the dimensions we are used to. The other 7 dimensions are folded in on themselves so tight that our particles misses them, and thus we can\u2019t see or interact with those dimensions.Then, the hypothesis goes, there are many ways of compactifying the extra dimensions needed, each leading to their own set of space dimensions + time (presumably). Each of these possible ways could comprise its own universe.The idea is that all possible ways of folding dimensions exist as its own universe, or that random universe configurations pop up all the time like bubbles in the foam in the crown of a beer, and some of those may expand to a universe in which people can live.This is almost entirely hypothetical \u2013 the idea in itself seems sound, but is untestable at the moment.Eternal inflation: One idea in cosmology is that there is an eternal inflation going on. This is expanded from the Big Bang theory\u2019s (not the TV show) idea of inflation, the very rapid expansion of space for the first 10\u22123210\u221232 seconds or thereabouts. Big Bang inflation is one possible explanation for the way that the Cosmic Microwave Background appears the way it do.The eternal inflation idea takes the Big Bang inflation, but makes it eternal and exponential instead. Then, the hypothesis argues that random quantum fluctuations in the inflation field leads to a volume within the eternal inflation field to slow down and become a universe of its own. This means that there is this expanding inflation field in which there are bubbles of universes.Although based on the Big Bang inflation theory, which has some support in cosmology, it goes way beyond it and is untestable at the moment. And it is completely hypothetical.Multiple simulations: There is this idea floating around that the universe is merely a simulation in an ancestor computer. In that case, what stops the ancestors from running several simulations? Each such simulation would then be its own universe, possibly with different natural laws depending on what parameters are programmed into the simulation. This would be a bit like running World of Warcraft and Minecraft at the same time.There is practically no support for this idea and is practically dismissed in cosmology, but it has some popularity among conspiracy theorists.",

Mind you, my knowledge of physics is very limited so if there are any articles or journals which contradict my beliefs I would be grateful if you could point them out.

A \u201cparticle\u201d travels as a probability wave function until it needs to act as a particle for an observed interaction and the wave function collapses. All of the other wave probabilities still exist sideways in time in parallel timelines (worlds) that are not part of the observed/experienced one. This duality is also a part of our macro/physical experience. Think of yourself as a particle. Your future exists as a probability wave function. With each moment your consciousness causes the wave function to collapse as you observe/experience each physical moment. Here too, all of the other probabilities still exist sideways in time in parallel timelines/worlds. These are branching off all the time. In the bigger picture, through all of time parallels are being created. On a personal level most differences are only minor. But, looking at the universe as a whole, some parallel realities/worlds could be very different. ",

A Parallel Earth would mean that MWI Theory is correct and everything we do or don\u2019t do really does create split realities where we did something different. Hubble Volumes are areas of space we can currently view but cannot see past because of the vast distance that light needs to travel. A theory states that past our Hubble Volume is a possibly infinite number of Volumes, some which could have their own physics. Inflation theory, that the universe is expanding, could cause portions of our universe to expand slower in certain areas, causing it to collapse into bubbles that are basically mini-verses. There are a few more theories, but these are some of the ones that are more popular. Personally, I believe in the Ultra-verse theory. The idea that an infinite number of universes, each one independent of the other, all exist at the same time in a region I would call \u201cThe Void\u201d. Each universe is distinct and can have its own physical rules. Possibly each universe can form its own set of micro-verses from MWI or Inflation theory. ",

Of course even if QM is correct, it may not mean those many worlds are real. Lots of interpretations of quantum mechanics exist.  Do you mean it in the whole multiverse way? Well IF it exists and IF there are an infinite number of them, then I guess it must do. However that is a few IFs....  Do I believe in it? No, do I believe its not impossible given what we know, well yeah. But it is quite a jump and at best I think it is uncertain so far. You've also got to define existence as at the minute, all that exists must be in this universe. I think philosophy and physics have a way to go on this one. ",
