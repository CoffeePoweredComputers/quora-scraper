            "answer_text": "Ego is the \u201cpathless\u201d path\u2026home\u2026to our true nature. Without the ego there would be no need to change because we would have never left home (enlightenment) to begin with. Ego needs to be seen for what it is: an artificial version of us that thought itself into being believing it was us and we (as ego) believed it to be us\u2026until we don\u2019t. Ego relies on our belief in it\u2019s creation. Without our belief ego doesn\u2019t exist. Live Now makes use of the intuition of our true nature to be who we really are and observe the ego each time it \u201clives us\u201d to see that we no longer believe it to be us. Live Now was discovered by Al Mejia in the early 70\u2032s when Al walked away from his last DUI car wreck that should have killed him. At that point he felt something was keeping him around for a reason so decided to \u201cwork\u201d on himself. He went to AA which took care of the alcoholism, but he had trouble just getting to work everyday. His \u201cbrain\u201d just was nuts. He made a lot of mistakes. He couldn\u2019t focus. Thoughts were racing telling him to do crazy things and then they would obsess about one thing so he couldn\u2019t move. Al eventually discovered that something inside of him just \u201cknew\u201d what to do no matter what the thoughts said. He found if he followed that inner knowing rather than the thoughts he would not make mistakes. He started asking himself OUT LOUD \u201cwhat do I need to do now?\u201d and waited for the inner knowing to answer or know what to do and he would just do that one thing and it would be fine. When he finished doing that thing he asked again OUT LOUD \u201cwhat do I need to do now?\u201d and again would listen for the inner knowing to answer and he would do that next thing and it would be fine. Al discovered that he could successfully get through each day this way and things would fall into place without relying on thought at all. This didn\u2019t mean that the thoughts stopped raging though. Soon, Al discovered that if he talked OUT LOUD to them and they would be shocked and would stop and listen. He would tell them : \u201cyou\u2019re not me\u201d, \u201cyou don\u2019t go to work, I do\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re the one having difficulty, not me\u201d. Al found it even more effective to give the thoughts a name. He called them \u201cbrain\u201d and talked to them like: \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having such a difficult life \u201cbrain\u201d, but that\u2019s not my problem; it\u2019s yours.\u201d Talking OUT LOUD to the thoughts came from the inner knowing and prevented the thoughts from doing it. Al began to see that the thoughts that he thought were him; weren\u2019t. The knowing that \u201calways knew\u201d was more him than the thoughts were. He kept observing as he did what he needed to do every day and kept talking OUT LOUD to the thoughts and his life began to change dramatically. Life seemed to start \u201cliving him\u201d clearly and effortlessly. Living became magnificent so he started telling others about his experience. They were able to have the same experience that he did. What started as a broken life of the ego lead to a wonderful life as the \u201creal\u201d Al. We are always \u201creal\u201d beings at our essence. The ego moves the \u201cfocus\u201d to itself and away from essence. Seeing the truth leads to complete disbelief in the imaginary ego and all it\u2019s thoughts and it falls away because it never \u201cwas\u201d real in the first place. ",

            "answer_text": "The ego is a magnificent no-thing. Some call it the enemy, some say it doesn\u2019t exist, some say it needs to be extinguished\u2026all of these have truth, but without understanding what the ego is, they will likely confuse. The ego does not exist of its own accord, but rather as an artifice, a function of something else. It is similar to a whirlpool. A whirlpool exits only due to the draining of water. Without the water draining, there is no whirlpool. The ego exists where we create separation. It is a mechanism of individualized consciousness. When I say \u201cI,\u201d I separate me from all else (and my potential). My ego maintains the separation of me from all else so that I can experience myself separate. The more separations I create, the more ego is required to maintain that separation and the more removed I become from my potential. This is why ego and identity are so closely related. As children, we naturally develop a self separate from our potential. We say, \u201cI am this,\u201d and, \u201cI like that.\u201d Each of these defines an identity that the ego then begins to filter our reality to create the experience of that individualized reality. Also, the more egoic I become, the more resources are occupied by it because I am furthering the separation of my perception of reality from reality itself or my identity from my potential. These resources now are now not available to my consciousness. I become more fragmented and less whole. This can become so pronounced in some people that they make a psychotic break with reality. Cognitive dissonance is a softer form of this break. When masters speak of, \u201cbeing in the present moment\u201d it is because in the present moment, there is no division. No past, no future, no self, no projection, and therefore, no ego. There is nothing to separate reality in the present moment. This allows consciousness to align with reality and in doing so, is the ego not present. We experience reality directly for what it is and not our filtered perception of what it is. So, if you want to stop a whirlpool, the only sense in saying it is the enemy, that it doesn\u2019t exist, or that that it needs to be extinguished is so that you can act. So how do you stop a whirlpool? Plug the drain. And if you want to stop the ego, be present. Accept all things as they are and the ego will naturally dissolve and you will experience profound liberation as you regain all the resources that were being occupied. ",

            "answer_text": "A story from Yoga Vasishta - A demon called Sambara was causing a lot of misery to the Gods of Swarga (heaven) and the latter also equally reciprocated it. Ultimately, Sambara created three robots-like demons programmed to go fearlessly and demolish the army of the gods. As these robots were not afraid of death, the gods became panicky and approached Brahma, the creator. Brahma told them - \u201cThese robots, newly created, have no conditioning of fear. They have no ego of their own and simply follow the programme. For some time, you fight with them and run away. By going on doing like this, this experience will begin to leave impressions and when they see that they are able to strike terror among you and make you flee, slowly their ego will begin to grow and impressions of fear will be built up. Then, when once the ego and fear are built up, even a child can knock them down\u201d. The gods followed this advice and became victorious. The ego is the \u201cI\u201d sense which identifies itself with the body-mind complex. This impostor of an \u201cI\u201d is sustained solely because we always consider ourselves as the doers of various actions and as the ones who experience the fruits of such good or bad actions resulting in joy or sorrow. Righteousness and sin, pleasure and pain are all imaginations of the mind and are not real. Actually, there is no individual personality at all as all actions including breathing, thinking, eating, talking, walking, etc. are done by the Totality (i.e. the all-pervasive cosmic Consciousness using each human body as an instrument). So we are not the doers at all. The Consciousness, after assuming a body, has forgotten its integral link with the Totality and instead identifies itself with the body with all its limitations. So a false \u201cI\u201d is created which thinks I am breathing, I think, I eat, I talk, I walk, etc. The moment you cease to consider yourself to be the doer or enjoyer, you will recognise yourself to be ever liberated. - (\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0905\u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u094c \u0938\u0941\u0916\u0902 \u0926\u0941\u0903\u0916\u0902, \u092e\u093e\u0928\u0938\u093e\u0928\u093f \u0928 \u0924\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u092d\u094b \u0964 \u0928 \u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0938\u093f \u0928 \u092d\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0903 \u0905\u0938\u093f, \u092e\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924 \u090f\u0935\u093e\u0938\u093f \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0926\u093e \u0964\u0964 Ashtavakra Gita I - 6) ",

            "answer_text": "Ego is the most important thing in your way. We become egotistical, because of desires, which bring stimulus searched out for us by our five senses, from the world in which we live. They are then brought to the mind and contemplated on by us, as to whether we like or dislike how it fits the personality we see ourselves as being or becoming. This is based on our world or environment. Desire must be fought by willpower. Will power is built within each of us by reviewing or contemplating our daily actions. By contemplating what took place during our day, you will have a inner conversation to work out the the right and wrong of our actions. Their you will find that those actions are guided by ego or selfish decisions. This must be done honestly within your own mind, as your ego will be right there to jump in and try to keep you from making the right changes. Don\u2019t worry, your inner self knows right from wrong. It is just, that it is up to your own honesty to own your actions and change them for the good. Then you are on the path to awareness that leads to enlightenment. NOTE; This contemplation must include forgiveness, by leaving doors open for people that you feel did you wrong \u2014 just encase those people come to their own sense of right and want forgiveness. Also doing for others helps this process too. In doing things like volunteering, you must not do the service to others while holding the concept of reward for yourself in your heart. Doing so voids the full benefit of your work. Instead always do good for the sake of doing good alone \u2014 take nothing for yourself. Why is this the case? This is true because all you have and get in life comes down from above for your benefit. Whether it be for enjoyment or learning, nothing is of your doing. This is a perfect system we live in. That being creation itself. This is why we don\u2019t need to force our lives. Finally\u2026 Enlightenment is an endless journey as enlightenment is knowledge/ wisdom \u2014 which is infinite, because it is God Consciousness you are filling yourself with. ",

            "answer_text": "The ego is the number one enemy of the mystic. On the mystical path, the ego must be completely deleted and annihilated. Burned with fire (arabic tarbiyah) until there is no sense of self left. When there is no self left (la ilaha), only God is what\u2019s left (illa Allah). The Buddhist call the ego a \u201cwrong view\u201d, and that\u2019s true because there is no ego. The Hindus call it maya (\u201cillusion\u201d) and that\u2019s also true because the ego is a false reality. The Sufis have endless teachings on the ego, some Sufis say \u201cwhen I am here, God is absent, when I am gone, God is present\u201d. Other Sufis say \u201cthe ego is the worst creation in the universe\u201d. Ego-consciousness is the ultimate form of idol worship (arabic shirk). Ego-consciousness is a false deity (ilah) that we identify with, we think we are it. But you are not your ego. Your true self is the spirit (arabic ruh) which is the spirit of God. You cannot experience yourself as the spirit of God, which is the end goal of all mystical traditions, as long as you have a sense of self (\u201cego\u201d, I, me, my, mine). There are many levels to ego-annihilation. One of the most ancient ways to annihilate the ego, is to pray to God by bowing your forehead to the ground (arabic sajda). The ego does not like to bow down to God, so when you bow down, you are putting your ego on fire. The muslim prayer still has retained the sajda (bowing down), one of the great miracles of Prophet Muhammad [saw] if you ask me. ",

You can\u2019t actually get rid of your ego, but you can know it well for what it really is. Just a small part of the picture, a very limited part of the consciousness you really are. And it can be fun at times, i kind of think of mine like a child that constantly wants my attention, sometimes i enjoy playing with it, but i\u2019m always aware it\u2019s just a game, all make-believe, nothing real about it. Sometimes it\u2019s like a troublesome teenager that tries to get me into trouble with the neighbours, or wants to borrow the keys to the car, but i never let it in the drivers seat anymore. ",

The Ego claims to be the body-mind and it creates the Duality. Now, through the process of Shravana-Manana-Nidhidhyasa (Listening from Enlightened Guru- Contemplatiion and staying established as Brahman), Ego understands it's true nature and dissolves. You become eternally blissful and peaceful. If you go to a slightly higher level, you will also understand that Ego is just an \u201cI-Thought\u201d which forms the basis for all other thoughts.
