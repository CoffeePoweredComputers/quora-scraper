            "answer_text": "For me, \u201cmathematics\u201d, \u201cscience\u201d, \u201creligion\u201d and \u201ctheology\u201d are the topmost epistemologies. Perhaps this diagram says it clearer.  To start with, you must be able to look into a deeper definition, or a more profound meaning of the idea of \u201cGod\u201d. It is a realm (or dimension) of \u201cGodness\u201d, or Godhood, and not God as a kind of personification or \u201cextension\u201d of our own \u201chuman-ness\u201d, ideas, and conceptions. This domain of Godness is in fact not that of the everyday notion of a larger \u201cheavenly entity\u201d, or \u201cpowerhouse\u201d, or supernatural force, or Being that controls and rules the heavens and the universe. (which are images and metaphors we have been imprinted with since childhood) If you\u2019re ready to understand the existence of Godness beyond all the objectified metaphorical images that have been mentally inputted in our lives so far, then you will find the following discussion useful. And secondly, have we stood back far enough to take a deeper look at some profound perspectives on the hidden ways which religion has long evolved through personifying and objectifying non-explainable and non-tangible \u201cfundamental reality\u201d through descriptions and the languaging of human socio-cultural events, stories, metaphors, and symbolisms ? Thus, elusively making us believe that the description process, or the representation of fundamental reality, is actually the reality itself. We have been wrongly conditioned to believe that a map is actually the territory being mapped. Whereas a map cannot be the territory it maps. It only depicts the territory. In other words, epistemology is never the ontology. I have recently written two essays on this. You may like to go here for the first piece .... http://qr.ae/TUpqMa ",

            "answer_text": "Epistemology is the philosophical study of knowledge. That is, it asks how do we know things? How do we know what's real? How can we arrive at assertions about the world that we can rely on? Can we have knowledge of the past? For those who haven't thought about it much, such questions might seem silly.  But imagine a philosopher talking to a layman. P: How do you know anything about the room you are in right now?L:That's easy. I simply look around and see what's here.P: Ah, but how can you be certain? Isn't it possible that you're dreaming?L: I guess, but I don't think I am.P: But you're not certain. Haven't you ever had a dream that at the time you thought was real but turned out to be a dream nevertheless?L: Yes I have. So, yes, I guess this could be a dream.P: Or you could have taken drugs a little while ago and are now hallucinating.L: I guess that's possible.P: For all we really know, we might have been kidnapped by aliens and even now are in their ship while their sophisticated tech feeds all these sensations into our brains. Or, perhaps, we are all part of a grand computer simulation built by some advanced society.L: I don't like this conversation anymore. Various attempts have been made to deal with problems like these. Most famously Descartes sought to prove that at the very least, we could always be certain that the statement \"I am\" is true whenever one thinks it. After all, if you think you exist, you must exist, otherwise you couldn't think it. From there, Descartes attempts to build a system of thought that allows for us to trust our sense impressions to some extent. Descartes may be right on the first point. He gets iffy after that. ",
