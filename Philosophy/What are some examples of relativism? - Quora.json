            "answer_text": "Relativism is the belief that something might be right for you but wrong for me. Basically it means that each person becomes his or her own god, deciding what is right and good. Some real life examples would be if someone believes stealing is ok if you are hungry, adultery is acceptable as long as you really love the other person, or it\u2019s fine to lie as long as you are helping someone. The problem, of course, is that it changes from person to person and situation to situation. What if you were the one being stolen from? Or the spouse being cheated on? What if the lie someone told helped someone, but caused harm to you? In the end, you can basically substitute the word \u201cselfish\u201d in for relativism, because it is only concerned with ones own thoughts and desires. ",

            "answer_text": "relativism - the doctrine that knowledge, truth, and morality exist in relation to culture, society, or historical context, and are not absolute. Moral Relativism Moral relativism is the idea that there is no universal or absolute set of moral principles. It\u2019s a version of morality that advocates \u201cto each her own,\u201d and those who follow it say, \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d Moral relativism can be understood in several ways. Descriptive moral relativism, also known as cultural relativism, says that moral standards are culturally defined, which is generally true. Indeed, there may be a few values that seem nearly universal, such as honesty and respect, but many differences appear across cultures when people evaluate moral standards around the world. Meta-ethical moral relativism states that there are no objective grounds for preferring the moral values of one culture over another. Societies make their moral choices based on their unique beliefs, customs, and practices. And, in fact, people tend to believe that the \u201cright\u201d moral values are the values that exist in their own culture. Normative moral relativism is the idea that all societies should accept each other\u2019s differing moral values, given that there are no universal moral principles. Most philosophers disagree however. For example, just because bribery is okay in some cultures doesn't mean that other cultures cannot rightfully condemn it. Moral relativism is on the opposite end of the continuum from moral absolutism, which says that there is always one right answer to any ethical question. Indeed, those who adhere to moral relativism would say, \u201cWhen in Rome, do as the Romans do.\u201d ",
