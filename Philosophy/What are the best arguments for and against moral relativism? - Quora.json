            "answer_text": "There is no good argument for moral relativism. An individual seeks it because they view it as freedom to do whatever they please and to fulfill self-interests. But sooner or later the piper needs paid. The cost for such pursuit is a loss of freedom. In other words, bondage. The alternative to moral relativism is objective morality. Moral relativism is the result of seeking self interests. Take out the \u201cself\u201d aspect and then it can be objective. So in order to be objective then it must be equitable for all. The moral framework that fits that requirement is provided in the Golden Rule. There are many good arguments that can be made for the Golden Rule, including that it is the only way that world peace can be had. ",
