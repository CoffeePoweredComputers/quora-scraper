            "answer_text": "I think the answer to that depends on how much background you have in philosophy. If you have a limited background in philosophy, I\u2019m inclined to recommend starting with his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion). That book is fairly short and is quite readable in my opinion. And the subject matter, the soundness (or lack thereof) of the main arguments for the existence of God. is something that philosophers and theologians continue to debate today. After that, feel free to read Hume\u2019s An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (Hume, David. 1909-14. An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. Vol. 37, Part 3. The Harvard Classics). ",

            "answer_text": "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding. I think this is more distinctively Hume\u2019s contribution to Western, and particularly Anglo-American thought, the foundation of the empirical, pragmatic tradition. The Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion is an important and delightful work. Don\u2019t overlook it. But the question of natural religion does not occupy mainstream philosophy nowadays the way the issues in Enquiry do. ",
