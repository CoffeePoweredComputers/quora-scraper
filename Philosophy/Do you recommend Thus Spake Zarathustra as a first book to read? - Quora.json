            "answer_text": "NO. It's not a good idea.   Zarathustra should neither be a first or last book, that is, if you're reading Nietzsche or philosophy in general. It's very poetic, and quite full of parables and aphorisms. Of which, without a foreground on Nietzsche thoughts, it is almost an impossible read.  Neither is it a compedinum of Nietzsche's ideas. It's definitely his most popular work perhaps because of its prose style. Nietzsche himself lauded it as his most literal work. No doubt a great read. Nevertheless, if you're looking or a comprehensive work on Nietzsche thoughts and ideas, then you should read Beyond Good And Evil. In my opinion, this is Nietzsche at his most profound state. It tells you all about his thoughts. If you had to read only one of Nietzsche works, it should be this. Definitely a more comprehensive book than Zarathustra.   ",
