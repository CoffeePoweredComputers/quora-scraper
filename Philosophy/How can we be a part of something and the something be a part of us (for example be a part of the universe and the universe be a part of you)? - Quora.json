            "answer_text": "Visually, it would depend on your microscope to show you that there is no border between what we think of as ourselves, and the rest of nature / reality / universe / existence. This idea of inside / outside is just that, a thought in our heads, not real. Even one second of complete isolation from what we think of as outside ourselves, and we would die instantly. We are made of stardust powered by sunlight in the food we eat, also stardust. But I really like your question, it is an excellent representative for the feeling in us that we are separate from everything else. That feeling of being separate is an illusion but a very necessary illusion; it is the basis for the body\u2019s navigational system. It is also the basis for what we call \u201cI\u201d (same thing, the \u201cI\u201d of the body is its navigator). In order to be able to navigate, steer and guide the body in its quest for food, water, shelter, mates, companions and safety, the body\u2019s navigator - the \u201cI\u201d of the body - must feel it is separate. This illusory feeling of separateness enables perception to occur. I have a feeling you have felt the illusory nature of perception and our sense of separateness. ",

            "answer_text": "Q. How can we be a part of something and the something be a part of us (for example be a part of the universe and the universe be a part of you)? I would only refer you to the taijitu, the Daoist symbol of yin and yang which gives a depiction of the question you pose.  I suggest that this ancient symbol depicts our dual universe, a part in which we exist and another, described by Kant as transcendental, we cannot perceive. Some of our \u2018sister\u2019 universe is present in our part as shown by the spot and I suggest is composed of the dark energy/ matter which scientists tell us is there but never sensed. ",
