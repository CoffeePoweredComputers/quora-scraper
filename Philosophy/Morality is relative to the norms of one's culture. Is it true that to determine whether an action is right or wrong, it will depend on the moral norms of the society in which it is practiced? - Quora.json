            "answer_text": "No. This is a common misunderstanding of moral and cultural relativism. If the moral rightness or wrongness of an action was determined by the norms of the society in which it was practiced, this would lead to all sorts of absurd conclusions and would contradict how morality actually functions in the world. For example, the violent persecution of Jews was a norm in Nazi Germany. Does that make it right? No, of course not. We don\u2019t judge its rightness relative to the norms of Nazi Germany - we judge it relative to our own moral norms. If morality is relative to culture then there is no determining \u2018whether an action is right or wrong\u2019 in an objective, absolute sense - only relative to some particular set of values and principles. And the rightness or wrongness of an action may be (simultaneously) determined quite differently by different cultures and ideologies. There is no \u2018true answer\u2019, or at least none that we have any objective means to determine. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cMorality is relative to the norms of one's culture. Is it true that to determine whether an action is right or wrong, it will depend on the moral norms of the society in which it is practiced?\u201d Understandable error in your premise: the idea that morality is entirely driven by \u201ccultural norms\u201d is only ONE of the common viewpoints, and from my studies and observations, it\u2019s at MOST only partly true. Having studied a LOT of history, psychology, sociology and even more direct observation of humans and non-humans, I have recognized that beneath EVERYTHING that living creatures do, is physiology. That does NOT mean that everything is directly controlled by DNA, it just means that if you do feel good or bad about events, there is a biological component. Now. Societies ARE collections of individual entities. What we refer to as \u201ccultural norms,\u201d do NOT spring up out of nowhere, as the \u201cmorality is entirely cultural\u201d necessarily assumes. \u201cCultural norms\u201d are the result of the not altogether calm and understanding interaction of all the INDIVIDUALS in the society, trying to survive EACH OTHER\u2019S morality. So where does INDIVIDUAL morality come from? Is that really all due to your parents and local culture? Nope. Obviously not, or no individual would EVER pop up inside an established \u201cculture\u201d and take a different moral path. We would especially never see two children from the same family, behaving differently from each other. Because your premise was (understandably) wrong, you\u2019ve gone on to make another common mistake: deducing that right and wrong, as concepts and as real things (if they are real) are therefore entirely culturally determined. If that were true, no culture would ever change what they think of as right and wrong, but they do, so that is also obviously false. Big fundamental: what does \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d really mean? Most people don\u2019t even notice that in their own minds, they have \u201csmudged\u201d the meaning of right and wrong, trying to mach together the vague sense that right and wrong are independent truths, not subject to opinion or \u201cculture,\u201d and the opposite idea that they are entirely imaginary concepts, with no independent existence. Think about it: if \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d really ARE entirely determined by societal context, then that means that there IS no such thing as actual \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong.\u201d There\u2019s just \u201capproved\u201d and \u201cdisliked.\u201d And only on a local level, at that. And if you go down THAT logical path, what do you then DO when you find that the culture you are living amongst, thinks that some activity or other is acceptable, while you find it to be disturbing and destructive? Do you sit back, and allow yourself and your loved ones to be abused by the society, because \u201cthat\u2019s the norm?\u201d And on a detailed level, if the entire culture DOES officially accept something, but almost everyone who is subject to whatever it is, doesn\u2019t like it, then what? Are all the people who are being abused, to be declared mentally disabled, because they think something that their culture says is right, is actually wrong? \u201cRelative morality,\u201d the idea that morality is culturally or environmentally determined, doesn\u2019t lead to any resolution of anything. It doesn\u2019t give useful answers to questions like yours. But morality independent of a living creature, doesn\u2019t seem to exist either. At least not in much more than a vague, occasionally partly shared way. MOST people don\u2019t care for having thing that they managed to have by their own work, stolen from them. But most people also like very much, getting something for \u201cfree.\u201d We have some very complicated economic and legal structures built around trying to figure out when it\u2019s okay to steal things, and when it isn\u2019t. And it\u2019s constantly shifting. So IS there a straightforward answer? In my sixty five year study, I would say no. The only thing left to try, is to accept that morality isn\u2019t actually a thing, in and of itself. It\u2019s more of a dynamic result, something that we can see after the fact, but that doesn\u2019t exist unless there are people actively wrestling with it. And since giving up on it entirely is ALSO an arbitrary MORAL choice, we can\u2019t just dust off our hands and walk away. Sorry I can\u2019t give you more than that. ",
