            "answer_text": "Quran is not a book of science, its a book of signs. Science has constantly been changing since ever. For centuries we believed that earth is flat, for centuries we believed sun n moon revolve around the earth. And, in this age the changes n advances in any branch of science are so rapid that one single person can\u2019t even comprehend what\u2019s being done in one major field of science, let alone the entire subject. How csn something as volatile as science can be a measure for something as constant as Quran ? There\u2019s been no change in it, even for a single word, for last 1400 years. Yet there hasn\u2019t been found any obvious flaws in Quran, lets spare the ones on which there can be interpretations, for subjectivity of opinions on both sides. In fact there are many wonders in Quran. Like find about kieth moor\u2019s findings on anatomical stages of embryo, water cycle, revolving stars n planets in orbits etc etc. Truth is, Quran is not meant for teaching us science. And, nothing valuable in life comes for free. I do not expect you to make up your mind just by reading this answer or hearing your friend\u2019s comments. If you\u2019re really looking for truth deep in your heart you must invest your time in the research. May God help you find your answers. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of statements in the Qur\u2019an that have been proven false such as the sun sets in muddy waters at sunset which Muhammad specifically stated was the true interpretation according to the Hadiths. The problem is that according to Muhammad, the Quran existed before time began in Arabic and is the exact word of Allah unchanged (which is why Muslims recite the Quran in Arabic as they believe it is Allah\u2019s word). As such for Muslims to believe that this is true, they have to continuously reinterpret what is written and make evermore convoluted explanations to fit what is written in the Quran to fit what is scientifically known. As science redefines it's understanding so do the interpretations of the Quran change. ",
