            "answer_text": "Only a bigot would ask a question like this. You are not welcome here. Please don\u2019t come back on this site. We don\u2019t want you here. There! How did that feel? Did it feel alright to be judged as a bigot and be treated as such? Never mind the first paragraph. I was only trying to make a particular point. It seems that people confuse being able or willing to make or pass a judgement (which is normal, human, and not necessarily a good or a bad thing), and being judgemental. Being judgemental is taking your judgement into a domain that is not your business to be in. It\u2019s not a feeling or a thought. It\u2019s action or lack of action that results into hurting the wellbeing of someone else based on that judgement. Even as a feeling alone is bad enough. Let me tell you this story that someone told me almost 25 years ago and I never forgot it: We were on the train. A man with dishevelled appearance was sitting beside us. His three kids were being very rude, noisy, and misbehaving disturbing everyone on the train, using foul language and one of them was trying to poke a hole in the leather of the seat. He didn\u2019t bother saying anything to them. My aunt whispered \u201csome people should not have kids. those little hooligans.\u201d All of us joined in the judgemental conversation and spared no sentiment. When she finally had enough she called the man and said \u201cDo you mind asking your kids to be a little bit quiet please?\u201d. The man said \u201cI am sorry. They have just seen their mother die in hospital. I don\u2019t know what to do\u201d. We were hanging our heads in shame. We literally could not look each other in the eye for the rest of the journey. Before you become judgemental towards someone, remember two things; You haven\u2019t bothered knowing their story.You are not gem yourself.",

            "answer_text": "If an action has no consequence there is no need to judge it. As soon as an action has consequence, then it can be looked at from the perspective of law, political correctness and any other perspective. All objective and absolute morals are external to the moral system of the perpetrator of the act. When external morals are applied we call this judgement Moral relativism begins and ends with the proposition that it is wrong to be judgemental. MR begins with a review of competing moral systems and concludes that they are all worthless. MR is a self refuting concept because it judges other moral systems at the same time holding MR above judgement. Get it?  Other moral systems are wrong because they judge other moral systems. But not MR! The truth is every moral system has positives and negatives. They are clearly not all  frivolous. They cannot all be heaped in the same trash bin as useless. Making a moral equivalence of cannibalism and a Christian religion for instance requires a person to reduce christianity to something it is not. Comparing the Holocaust to ordinary political situations takes an equally ludicrous morphing of facts to arrive at such a conclusion. How do we make moral judgements?. We use differing moral scales to shape our decisions. Moral scales are enormously useful in guiding our lives. So back to the question which presumes it is wrong to be judgemental.  It is only wrong to be judgemental in a politically correct and morally relativistic mindset. For everybody else, it is the natural state of mind and the way we make decisions.We make judgements, and we are subject to judgements from others in our daily lives. ",
