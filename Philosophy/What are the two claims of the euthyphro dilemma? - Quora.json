            "answer_text": "I am unsure that there are two specific claims the Euthyphro dilemma makes. The main claim, however, is that any attempt at linking morality to God causes metaphysical issues. Euthyphro dilemma proponents do this by asking \u201cIs something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it is good?\u201d There are, however, two ways that the proponents generally expect the listeners to respond. If one replies \u201cGod commands something because it is good\u201d then proponents claim this negates claims that God is sovereign over everything, including morality. God, in this case, is subject to an even higher law than himself, which he merely passes on to his rational creatures. A listener might, on the other hand, reply \u201cSomething is good because God commands it.\u201d In this case, the proponent would declare that morality itself becomes arbitrary, since nothing prevents God from declaring murder, theft, etc. to be good or charity, integrity, etc. to be bad.
