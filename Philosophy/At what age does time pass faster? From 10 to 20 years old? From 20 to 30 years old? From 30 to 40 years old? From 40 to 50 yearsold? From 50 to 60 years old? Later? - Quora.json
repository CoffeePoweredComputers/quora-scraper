Then the long school days that dragged on when I was bored. Twenty to thirty the time went fast because I tried to cram so much in. Go to a club and out to eat, but still have to go to work. Then there came raising a family and still trying to take care of a household and balance social activities with obligations. But, I have retired and I am now 68. I get up and start a project and before I know it the time is close to supper and I have to get it prepared. Throw a couple doctor appointments, lunch with a friend, a family outing, daily activities and it seems there just isn\u2019t enough time in the day. Perhaps I have too many responsibilities? But, my other friends complain of the same thing. Of course, energy levels are lower and things take more effort. I used to fit everything in plus had a full time job and I wonder how I did it. I retired last December! Time definitely goes faster when you get older, or maybe we just appreciate that our days are waning. ",

            "answer_text": "In my experience, the seeming fast passage of time begins at a fairly early age. There are several neurological reasons behind this. For a 10 year old, 10 years is 100% of their life. For me, it's only about 12% of mine. As I understand it, our brains deal with life more experientially than temporally. So the 10 year old experiences the world as new a great deal of the time. I don't. There is little new under the sun to me. Why an I not bored? Because I choose to go in depth, which is rich, but doesn't take time. ",

At 5 years old, it seems to take forever for a year to pass, because a year is 1/5 of your entire life. At age 60, a year is only 1/60 of your life. Time is always passing at the same speed, it is just your perspective that seems to make it speed up. The only exception to this is depending on speed. If you go fast enough, time will actually slow down. That\u2019s physics. ",
