            "answer_text": "In a metabolic sense the body is aware of it\u2019s functional extensions of mind through Mind to biological and biological to mind relations, in an embodiment of a force that organizes matter into a self. The physical realm is a byproduct of experiment and the exploitation of random forces becoming stochatic awarenes of a relationally ordered force. For this there is a pacing mechanism within manifest transitions of material energies into causally material functions that inhabit a consciousness and direct it through functions that are part of the self imputed construct of a self organzing being, through biomaterial agencies. I think I calculated somewhere that if you were to count all the cells in your body at one second a number, it would take about 3.170 Million years, and of that 90 percent is parasites, microbes, and unicelluar life that is it\u2019s own consciousness but which is part of the ecology of mind that forms and contributes to a state of inheritence of a mind, so we can call that an ecomimeral relation, let\u2019s call it that it\u2019s the manifest property of an ecomimera where consciousness is the inhering force, the collective zeitgeist that structures life as an envelope for lifeforms so to speak, we may one day find life forms at the quantum level far more technically advanced than we are, and who manifest into the plateaus of energy that instantiate both our consciousness and some of the content of our \u201cinter-unconscious\u201d minds let\u2019s call it. We must ask what awareness is. If it\u2019s merely the power to be organized then everything is alive. If it\u2019s however more robustly the power to organize then higher order things like plants and animals are living, if it\u2019s however further than this, the power to facilitate life, then we can see why Ancients thought of things like the Sun as a personification of LIVING Gods. If you listen with an open heart, everything is alive and everything is aware of being, but not of significance as a cognitive reflection which changes the conceptual content of a form of interrelations that inhabitate shared mindstates\u2026 perhaps for this we have processes that are primarily biological\u2026and so in that sense, the brain facilitates awareness of its significance in things like reflexes, we fall and our arms dart up to protect our head from harm. Mind is expressed as subfunctions in the sense that I am using this notion it is awareness within the reticulated complex systems of organs and tissues and processing mechanisms like organels, which together work as a product and byproduct of conditioning forces within and indeed even beyond the body or mind but which may be said to effect or affect it\u2019s experience and mental contents. Now as a Panpshycic Hylozoist these are the things I personally consider and assume about existence: Existence intermingles with essence and essence intermingles with existence through material causal forces and through noumenal forces which are one and the same in emergent domains of simultaneously emergent co-depending realms of instantiation.Forms of life contain forms of evolution patterns for forms of life from within the stochastic.Evolution inheres in exchange, and a psychomorphology of chance, from random force into organized forces.The material that does not seem to evolve is different in frequency and aggregate, but is possibly organizing in dimensions of energy we cannot realize affecting the formats of information that we have access to through study and inquiry.Aggregate forms distill into aggregate functions and emergent unified functions. In the face of this, everything has a will, but it\u2019s the question of what time is in relation to change that creates consciousness\u2026for consciousness is an analogue and inheritor of time and transformation at one level or another.Self organizing principles are dependent on the arrangement of the ecomimera and the territory of the reticulatory in which the ecomimera has a sense of itself, it\u2019s the substrait that is just as living, as the self organizing, the matrix of consciousness is the immaterial and material forms in different densities creating different material possibilities for the evolutions of types of life which each give birth not just to entities but to whole species of possibilities for material organization.All ecomimera are alive in virtue of the seemingly non living, affecting the aggregate through the intermingling of extensional and non obvious functions.That which seems to be non-living is facilitative of life and is in a functional sense a living analog of consciousness in the property of it\u2019s being self organizing and self evolving.Freedom must first be inherited into consciousness for awareness to be restricted by intentions qua intenSional content or it\u2019s equivalent as a set of reflexes at the level of the functions of a biological entity whether cellular, subcelluar or multicellular.Not all matter exhibits intentions but that does not mean it does not have consciousness in it, it is merely non resonant at that stage of it\u2019s manifest inheritance of properties based on it\u2019s aggregative capacities.Not all of the Universe is innately teleofunctional, and all of the universe is not intrinsically conscious on it\u2019s own, however, to what extent it\u2019s living it depends on what we mean by awareness, if we mean that it has a sense of us, then yes, matter knows what our bodies are as our bodies radiate energy and represent transitions that affect its material form based in proximality. Put simply The Teleostructure of change, in which material energies manifest, inheres in that which is in a noumenological field, meaning a field made of a fusion of chance, chaos, intention, and order.Since the brain computes between aspects of chance, chaos intention and order, and selects from these filters agency, the brain is aware of it\u2019s at least role. I have suggested that all of matter has a role in life, and this is tantamount to an aware thing, but that it\u2019s of a frequency and that high end processes create high end consciousness of the order we are familiar with however that other orders may exist at other emergent or supervening levels where transfers of information constitute and structure the valency of the manifest property and it\u2019s relation to other aggregate properties in drawing in new information to refine new understandings of the relationships between material bodies, and psychological forces within those bodies that are either generative, progenerative or protogenerative of new biological and psychological processes. Since the brain organizes matter, it is conscious, however it\u2019s conscious of something in process. For example let\u2019s say I throw a ball to you on a baseball diamond, now let\u2019s say I am throwing that ball for fun, there are different processes I am using to do that, now let\u2019s say instead of a pitcher\u2019s mit, you are wearing a glove and we are practicing and I throw you a fastball, well then now we are part of a different function, the brain knows by it\u2019s receptors and neurochemistry what is in process and how to dynamically change that process according to certain expectations in the role of the material transactions, but the MIND, that\u2019s not the thing doing the choosing, the mind is better understood as dynamicity and fluidity of form\u2026in that sense everything has mind, even atoms, with their brownian motion, this is not simply facilitative, it creates envelopes of relation. The more we know about these envelopes, the more we can be said to be envelopopulate, or robustly aware. The Brain cannot be this unless it\u2019s robustly aware of change, this is why Buddhists do mind meditations that are act meditations and we correlate systems of awareness to systems of refined processes, it\u2019s a discipline of control to showcase the mind in the minutia of functions and this analogously translates to new kinds of awareness. Look up Ontovedics and Zenetics if you are interested in the emerging new Tao, which rather than being interested merely in transition, is interested in pacings and aggregate combinations that form the complex and simple dichotomies that establish life as a force of interawareness in the pararegional possibilities of contact with higher forms of consciousness through meditation. CETEGORONICS AND THE ENVELOPOPULATE MINDMELD Melee: NUTRIONICS AND NOVELTY I knew I was a Hylozoist when I saw an image by one of my Professors from the Ontario College of Art (Now OCADU) Nuobo Kubota with headphones and a mic listening to a rock back in 1995 or so? ARTSask - Nobuo Kubota - Roctoc I just got it right away, there are hidden parts of nature and we must try to understand it not just as a material resource but as a resource of our domain of our understanding to expand our functional awareness. I understood in a way that would take years to unravel that image and it all resonated with me, if you pardon the pun. Rock the mic.  ",

            "answer_text": "When ashoka attack on kalinga then he feel sad when his eyes see 100000 lakh dead body then he realize that , while he is doing attack on the age of 20 years ,realization is a work of our soul (concentration) and brain (antahkaran) then he joined jain dhram . You can say deep subconscious mind to brain . Our mind is just a chemical and part of conscious mind and subconscious mind which give force to our concentration , other wise no work is possible because our body is just a machine except your concentration (soul). Same incident happened when sikander was near to death ,his thought was that this was my big mistake to win the world. Basically our brain and concentration works when we get deep sad ness it comes when we get nothing and when we get everything , then our concentration and brain handle the position to maintain body.
