            "answer_text": "This question always REALLY bothers me because it\u2019s been distorted WAY beyond the original meaning and context ! In the first place, this biblical reference applies in one very specific case and that case alone. It is when two or more men get into a violent argument and, as a result of that, a pregnant woman is injured, then whatever injuries she suffers are meted out to the men responsible for her injuries : Exodus 21: 22\u201325 \u201c If, when men come to blows, they hurt a woman who is pregnant and she suffers a miscarriage, though she does not die from it, the man responsible must pay the compensation demanded of him by her husband/master; he shall hand it over after arbitration. But should she die, you shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stroke for stroke.\u201d In Judaism, \u201c eye for an eye\u201d is not, and has never been, an excuse for general vengeance as both Christianity and Islam have interpreted it.

            "answer_text": "\u201cAn eye for an eye\u201d is a shorthand phrase for restitutive justice and should not be taken absolutely literally In ancient (judaic) law, if a man caused irreperable damage to another\u2019s eye, then he should lose the sight of his own eye. BUT, if the perpetrator was already blind in one eye then he would not lose the sight of his remaining eye as that would render him blind whilst his victim still had sight in one eye. The principle is that punishment should fit the crime such that the victim felt satisfied that he had received adequate recompense ",
