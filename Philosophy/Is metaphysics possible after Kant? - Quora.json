            "answer_text": "There has been many confusion over what Kant had in mind for metaphysics. To my reading, his project in this aspect had a constant goal \u2014 to vindicate metaphysics as a legitimate, scientific field of study. Kant\u2019s novelty came from a rejection of the Leibnizian-Wolffian paradigm. Up to his time, at least for Kant, metaphysics was plagued by the need to be an analytic science, and was placed in a higher prestige as compared to logic and mathematics (well, in the sense of finding out what is \u201creally true\u201d). If you\u2019re familiar with the history of metaphysics, you\u2019d realise that this tendency came straight from Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, which heavily inspired the Arabs (who made the most progress in the medieval era) in coming out with highly rigorous and systematic proofs of God, universals, the univocality of being, etc. Kant thought that underlying this tendency was an immanent assumption that concepts can be mapped according to a pyramidal hierarchy, with the higher concepts being more general, and the lower-level concepts being less general. However, there are few fatal issues with this Wolffian model: 1. Unlike Leibniz, Wolff had dismissed the possibility of infinitely specifying a concept until its very core. While this avoids infinite regress, it denies a given concept from further development when novel information is presented. 2. Wolff had meant for the hierarchy of concepts to be finite, which means that the division ultimately ends at certain basic, foundational concepts that were known to be a priori. If these basic concepts are supposed to be the basis, then we must all be familiar with. The brute fact is that we don\u2019t. 3. Establishing the relation between general concepts and the more particular ones is not sufficient to provide the diversity of knowledge we have obtained throughout history. Some mathematical concepts are, very evidently, not provided by mere analytic methods.  Why did Kant manage to see this flaw within the entire history of metaphysics, while the numerous great metaphysicians before his time didn\u2019t? The main reason, Kant ventures, is that the analytic methods previous metaphysicians relied upon gave a false optimism about the capability of human reason. And it wasn\u2019t entirely their fault \u2014 Reason, while being the supreme function of the human race, was a limited unit of knowledge by design, and can easily lead itself into epistemic traps (cf. Antinomies) if it does not admit to its own limits. This false optimism, as you might expect, led metaphysicians to attempt to prove the God, the existence of the whole universe, and freedom according to their limited repertoire of concepts (cf. the Table(s) of Categories). The lack of awareness of the limitations of reason is due to the failure to acknowledge that all forms of empirical intuition is structured by those a priori concepts, thus limiting our intake of information by default. If this lack is not recognised by the metaphysician, metaphysics will continue be engage in a fruitless endeavour headed in the wrong direction. While this seemed like a full-on onslaught of traditional metaphysics, what Kant really did was to point out the glaring mistake that it had caught up itself within without knowing, drawing upon the field of mathematics for plausible solutions. You could say that Kant\u2019s aim for metaphysics was to redirect our efforts to what is genuinely within our reach.  With that said, metaphysics is possible after Kant. But not for the reason that you are expecting. The purpose of the entire chunk above is to correct some misconceptions that readers tend to have when engaging Kant for the first few times. You see, philosophy is never defined by someone\u2019s saying at some particular point of time. While Hume might have doomed induction in the 17th century, it doesn\u2019t mean we should all throw our hands up and end all scientific endeavours for good. I mean, look at what we have now since Hume\u2019s time! Human thought has the unique ability to progress beyond itself, and that is the reason why each generation always seems to be better than the previous. Whether Kant had doomed metaphysics as much as Hume doomed induction doesn\u2019t really matter. Metaphysics is still done. Science is still done. While they might be right at some point, they were wrong at others. Even if they were absolutely right, someone is going to find some way to get pass the impasse they imposed. And oh yes, there was a lot of metaphysics going on in the past century\u2026wasn\u2019t it? ",

            "answer_text": "According to Kantians, metaphysics is impossible after Kant (ca. 1780). Kant argued that all questions of metaphysics (God, Immorality, Cosmos) always end in Antinomy, that is, logical contradiction with no solution. For this reason, he concluded, the human mind is incapable of knowing the Thing-in-itself \u2014 the Objective Truth. The most we can know, he argued, is what our biological limitations will convey to us from our merely five senses, along with our built-in structure of logic given in a Table of 12 Judgments and a Table of 12 Categories. Thus, we are locked into this subjective biology, and can never escape it. Kant tackled the Three Classic Proofs of the Existence of God, namely, the Cosmological, the Teleological and the Ontological Proofs. Kant concluded that they all fail in their logical argumentation. Kant further concluded that all \u201cSpeculative\u201d (i.e. metaphysical) Philosophy was \u201cimpossible\u201d. The only modern question is whether Kant has the final word. GWF Hegel, on the other hand, argued persuasively to many in the 1810\u2019s and 1820\u2019s, that Kant was dead wrong. Hegel\u2019s philosophy has not been widely disseminated \u2014 almost nothing compared with Kant\u2019s philosophy. Hegel\u2019s argument has been lost in obscurity, although to defend Kant properly, one must answer the challenges of Hegel. ",
