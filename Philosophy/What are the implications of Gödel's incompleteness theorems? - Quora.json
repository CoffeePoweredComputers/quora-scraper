            "answer_text": "What are the implications of Godel\u2019s theorems? This question has become remarkably controversial, especially in decent decades. So let me answer by first stating what every person who understands the theorems seems to agree on. It\u2019s mainly this: For any given system of definitions and axioms, powerful enough to express number theory, there will be some propositions that can be neither proved nor disproved. That much, I believe, is not controversial. But what does it mean in practical terms? Does it mean that mathematicians have to give up their work? No. Because periodically, mathematicians come up with new branches of math, or new axioms, or new ways to make connections between the different branches. (That\u2019s how Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem was proved.) So it doesn\u2019t stop the work of mathematicians at all. Math goes on as before. To many people, therefore, Godel\u2019s Theorems stand as a kind of Humble Pie, showing limitations to our understanding, but not ending the work of mathematicians, scientists, or philosophers. Now, here comes a slightly more controversial part. Russell & Whitehead, in Principia Mathematica, tried to suggest that all the truths of math follow by definition\u2026 that is, if you simply defined every mathematical term with sufficient clarity, then 1 + 1 = 2 would follow by definition. But so, in theory, would every true mathematical proposition. Even very complex and challenging ones. I would argue that Godel spelled the doom of that project. Before anyone protests too loudly, I will one last time summarize my argument: If all the truths of math followed by definition, then someone would in theory be able to come up with a perfect set of definitions.That set of definitions would create a system S, of definitions and/or axioms. (Because according to Russell & Whitehead, all we ultimately need are definitions, in combination with deductive logic. Or we can think of an axiom as a kind of definition.)However, Godel showed that given any system S, we can find a proposition G that cannot be proved but must be true if S is consistent. (And if S is inconsistent it must be thrown out anyway.)Step (3) above contradicts the assumption that we could prove all true mathematical propositions by just having sufficiently good definitions.Given that our assumption in step (1) results in a contradiction, it must therefore be false.Look at it this way. I don\u2019t have to prove anything at all by my argument, except one thing: Starting with the assumption that we CAN prove all true propositions of math by definition, then, following Godel\u2019s reasoning, we reach a contradiction. Therefore, it cannot be said that all true propositions of math follow by definition. And if that\u2019s true (as I would argue it is), then I would further conclude that math is synthetic\u2026 that is to say, the propositions of math do not have the character \u201cAll bachelors [in the ordinary sense of the word] are unmarried.\u201d This \u201cbachelor\u201d proposition is analytic, not synthetic, because the truth follows directly from the words themselves. Synthetic knowledge, according to most philosophers, especially empiricists, is not \u201creal knowledge.\u201d Now, there is a counter-argument, of sorts, to this, and it goes as follows: It is not meaningful, ultimately, to speak of \u201cmathematical truth,\u201d because there are different maths, or different \u201cworlds,\u201d depending on which axioms you initially choose to accept. Such as: do you accept the Parallel Postulate in geometry, or do you accept the Axiom of Choice? I concede that there are \u201cfuzzy\u201d areas like this at the frontiers of math. There are more than one geometries, for example; and there do seem to be more than one \u201cmath,\u201d in how one chooses to approach infinity as a concept. However, my argument earlier still stands, I believe. Given any system of math, in any \u201cworld,\u201d powerful enough to express numbers, you will find that it is incorrect to ever say, \u201cAll true propositions in this area follow by definition.\u201d Because of my reductio ad absurdum. And that\u2019s huge. If you cannot say that for any system, powerful enough to express numbers, then we conclude: All true propositions do NOT follow by definition. Furthermore, I would argue that this makes math analytic. It is not just trivial knowledge, as Russell asserted. That\u2019s a big word, but if I am correct (and there is still some controversy) it means that math is not simply a branch of logic. And that means that Godel settled a rather old argument!! ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A. I hope to clear up some misconceptions about the implications of G\u00f6del's theorems by providing a quick informal walkthrough of his first incompleteness theorem, along with some commentary that should make it clear that the consequences of the theorem only directly pertain to a very particular sort of simulation game, and have no necessary \u201creal world,\u201d i.e. metaphysical, epistemological or ethical, implications for things that are not \u201cactually encompassed\u201d (whatever that means) by the simulation game in question without additional and most often entirely unjustifiable philosophical assumptions or paradigms, which are beyond the scope of mathematical formalisms, and have nothing to do with the contents of the theorem itself. The game G\u00f6del invites us to play I will call \u201cG\u00f6del\u2019s Formal Systematization of Arithmetic and Beyond,\u201d and it is a formal syntactical simulation of the normative semantical notions we tend to have about logic, proof, and truth. But I stress the most important point about this theorem that people tend to be fooled about, not just with respect to G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems, but about mathematics in general: a simulation is in general NOT the real deal. The map is not the territory. In effect, G\u00f6del's theorems are demonstrative of the limitations that simulations can have that the \u201creal deal\u201d does not necessarily have.  The Rules of G\u00f6del's Game Consider a finite collection of symbols, whose name is [math]F[/math]. Such a collection is called an alphabet. We can string these symbols together into finite lines of symbols, appropriately called finite strings. I will write these strings with single quotes around them. For example, if our alphabet is just [math]A[/math], [math]B[/math], and [math]C[/math], some finite strings over this alphabet are the string with no symbols \u2018\u2019 (whose name is typically [math]\\epsilon[/math]), \u2018[math]AABCCAB[/math]\u2019, \u2018[math]BCABC[/math]\u2019, \u2018[math]A[/math]\u2019 , etc. We can start by talking about what G\u00f6del calls a formal language over [math]F[/math], which is simply a set of finite strings with symbols from [math]F[/math]. Our formal language we will call [math]L(F)[/math]. The strings in [math]L(F)[/math] are called well-formed formulas. Next, we can establish a system of formal logical deduction over these well-formed formulas. The way we do this is to introduce \u201clogical connectives,\u201d and to specify which formulas can be formally deduced from others, as well as a formal \u201ctruth evaluation\u201d structure. For example, if one formula [math]Q[/math] can be deduced from another formula [math]P[/math], we will write [math](P\\implies Q)[/math]. We can denote the formal negation of [math]P[/math] by [math]\\neg(P)[/math], we can denote \u201c[math]P[/math] or [math]Q[/math]\u201d by [math](P\\vee Q)[/math], and \u201c[math]P[/math] and [math]Q[/math]\u201d by [math](P\\wedge Q)[/math]. Then, we can construct formal truth tables to establish the method of formal evaluation. For example, if [math]P[/math] is \u201ctrue\u201d and [math]Q[/math] is \u201cfalse,\u201d then the formal truth table will tell us that [math](P\\implies Q)[/math] is \u201cfalse.\u201d Of course, all of this is still formal. \u201cTrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d are formal syntactical objects here--we could just as easily call them \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cEast.\u201d It is syntax we use to attempt to formally simulate logic--it is not the \u201creal deal\u201d itself. Afterall, in effect, it\u2019s only symbols on paper. With this formal system of deduction in place, we have what G\u00f6del calls a formal system. In effect, we have constructed a particular formal simulator for propositions and logic over those propositions. All's well and good so far I hope. But we aren't done yet. Remember the name of the game--we are trying to systematize arithmetic.  Formally Systematizing Arithmetic In our alphabet, we will be sure to include the symbols necessary to simulate arithmetic on natural numbers using the Peano arithmetic simulator. This means that we will have a symbol [math]0[/math] that we will use to denote zero, as well as a symbol [math]S[/math] that we will use to denote succession. For example, [math]S0[/math] is one, [math]SS0[/math] is two, etc. We will also use the operator symbols such as parentheses, the plus sign, the equals sign, existential quantifiers, the cross for multiplication, and all the other fixings we use to simulate such arithmetic as usual. But we will also introduce a symbol that introduces new symbols. For example, [math]x[/math] is some base symbol we can introduce, and [math]x*[/math] is a new symbol, and [math]x**[/math] is a third symbol, etc. We can name these symbols how we like, understanding that they can be tabulated and converted into the formal symbolism of our language. And in the end, we make sure still to have only countably many symbols.  G\u00f6del Numbering This is where things get interesting. Since our language simulates arithmetic, we can use it to try to talk about natural numbers. We can make statements about them, for example \u2018[math]SS0+S0=SSS0[/math]\u2019 is a \u201ctrue\u201d well-formed formula. It amounts to saying [math]2+1=3[/math]. We also have \u201cfalse\u201d formulas, like \u2018[math]S0=0[/math]\u2019 And so on. Notice that there are rules for being well-formed, and separate rules for being either \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cfalse\u201d--there are statements we take to be formally true in an explicit manner, called axioms, and there are other statements that are formally true in an implicit manner, by virtue of the formal truth evaluation structure and formal logical deduction mechanisms inherent to our formal system, called theorems. Now keep in mind, we have countably many symbols. What this means is that we can associate each symbol to a number, just by listing them. For example, we might associate [math]0[/math] with [math]1[/math], [math]S[/math] with [math]2[/math], [math]+[/math] with [math]3[/math], [math]=[/math] with [math]4[/math], [math]\u00d7[/math] with [math]5[/math], etc. This association is given by [math]G[/math], so that [math]G(0)=1[/math], [math]G(+)=3[/math], etc. These are called G\u00f6del numbers. And since our well-formed formulas are finite strings, we can also associate each well-formed formula to a unique number, using the unique factorization of integers into primes. For example, we can make associations as follows: [math]G([/math]\u2018[math]0+S0=S0[/math]\u2019[math])=2^1 3^3 5^2 7^1 11^4 13^2 17^1[/math] The exponents on successive primes tell us which symbol is found in which position of the well-formed formula. Take a second to absorb that. It is a large number, but it is still a number. And notice, if we were given any G\u00f6del number, we could factor it into primes, and construct its corresponding string of symbols from our alphabet. So this process is reversible, and we also have G\u00f6del numbers for well-formed formulas. We can also create G\u00f6del numbers for finite sequences of well-formed formulas. What we can do is skip a prime between the formulas, and use the same exponential sequence, just on larger successive primes. And hence, since formal proofs are nothing more than finite sequences of well-formed formulas that follow our formal laws of deduction, we can establish G\u00f6del numbers for proofs of well-formed formulas.  The G\u00f6del Sentence We have created a system of symbols that talks about numbers, and also a system of numbers that talks about symbols. So we can use these systems together to let the system of symbols talk about itself. Now we can introduce a symbol [math]P(x,y)[/math], which can be interpreted as \u201c[math]x[/math] is the G\u00f6del number of a proof of the statement encoded by the G\u00f6del number [math]y[/math].\u201d So using the existential quantifier, if [math]Z[/math] is a well-formed formula, we can make the statement \u2018[math]\\exists x:P(x,G(Z))[/math]\u2019 Which says, \u201cThere exists a formal proof of [math]Z[/math].\u201d Similarly, we can write \u2018[math]\\neg(\\exists x:P(x,G(Z))[/math]\u2019 Which says, \u201cThere does not exist a formal proof of [math]Z[/math].\u201d Call this last well-formed formula [math]W(Z)[/math], or [math]W[/math] for short. Well, what about [math]W(W)[/math]? What does this statement say? Think about it. It says \u201cThere does not exist a formal proof of this very statement.\u201d Well, if [math]W(W)[/math] is false, then we have a formal proof of [math]W(W)[/math], which means our formal system is not consistent--it proves something that is logically false. Otherwise, [math]W(W)[/math] is true, and hence there is no formal proof of [math]W(W)[/math]. But this means that there is a true statement about our system that cannot be proven within the system itself, and hence that in this kind of simulation game, \u201ctruth is strictly stronger than proof.\u201d Such a statement is called a G\u00f6del sentence, and G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem amounts to the existence of at least one such sentence, while its formal proof is by direct construction. Of course, this only pertains to the simulation game. It does not necessarily apply to the \u201creal deal,\u201d but it certainly limits our ability to formalize useful deductive systems about arithmetic, and in this sense its \u201creal world\u201d (i.e. nonmathematical) implications are mostly contained to theoretical computer science. That is G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem in an informal nutshell. I hope that made enough sense, and I encourage you to read a formal proof--this was not one. Thanks for reading! ",
