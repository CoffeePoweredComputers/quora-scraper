            "answer_text": "There has been a lot of flimsy philosophical claims made supposedly based on G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems, so one wants to be a little wary when discussing what it implies, when the conclusion goes outside of pure mathematics. I think there are two main contributions that it has made to epistemology. The first and most famous one is that it killed the original \u201cHilbert program\u201d. If one proved the consistency of a formal system for set theory in a subsystem of itself, it would demonstrate that one\u2019s system was inconsistent. The second is that it blocks a certain naive over-reliance on axiom systems. Perhaps you have heard of ZFC, the famous axiom system for set theory. Not all mathematicians believe that all the theorems of ZFC are true. Mathematicians who do, though, and understand by the consistency of ZFC what most of us mean by it, also believe that ZFC is consistent, which is not a theorem of ZFC. I\u2019m unsure whether there is anyone who tries to adopt the position that they believe all the theorems of ZFC and only them, but ever since G\u00f6del proved his incompleteness theorems, it has required some kind of odd modification to one\u2019s concepts. We can imagine, for example, that a formalist could try simply to define truth as provability in ZFC. But one can prove \u201cZFC is consistent\u201d in ZFC just exactly under the circumstances in which most of us would say that an inconsistency had been found in it. As I said, I don\u2019t know that anybody adheres to this type of formalism. ",
