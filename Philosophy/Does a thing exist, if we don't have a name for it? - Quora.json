            "answer_text": "Ah, Does a thing exist if we don\u2019t have a name for it? Quite wierdly, there are many solutions to this because, unfortunately, the question s actually not specific enough. Now, here are the three ways I interpreted your question: Does a physical thing that hasn\u2019t been discovered yet exist if we haven\u2019t assigned it an identifying name? Yes, it does physically exist, it just is not able to be understood through thought, just like wave compressions of when a tree falls in the forest, the sound exists, but it is never interpreted into the proper sound by a human.Does a thing exist if we are not able to interact with it and put a relativistic understanding on it? Depending on which great philosopher you look to, the majority will say no. Descartes would say you cannot be sure it exists and people who study relativistic understanding would also say no, due to the not being able to interact with the thing to put a definition on it.Does something, that does not have any matter or thought pertaining to it physically or metaphysically, have an identifier by which we can understand said, thing? If this was your question, than the answer is no. It goes back to the whole question of existence. Their can be something that exists (finite and existing), something that does not exist (finite and non existing, but still can possibly exist if the correct combination happens), never not existing (infinite and existing, think the Catholic God) and finally the never existing (infinite and non existent, this idea or thing shall never exist no matter how many combinations of time space shall exist, not physically or metaphysically). The thing with no identifier falls into the last category.Now, hope you find this information useful and good luck on finding your answer. It is questions like these that make me realize that we take for granted the fact that we can just accept existence. ",

            "answer_text": "We can still theorize about some things that don\u2019t have names yet. For example, if there is an unknown element in the Periodic Table it can be given a number. Scientists often have reasons to guess about new elements, based on the properties that have been observed in nature, and the number of possible protons and electrons, etc. If there is no evidence that can be used to predict whether something can exist or not, then it becomes hard to think about, and is often considered unreal. Humans can sometimes use multiple types of evidence to predict that something as complex as evolution or planetary rotation, for example, occur. Many things are covered by large categories like \u2018the imaginary\u2019, \u2018the physical\u2019, \u2018the scientific\u2019, and traditions like philosophy. Science fiction writers sometimes write about what categories like these would look like to an alien species. Many of the categories end up looking imaginary and absurd, and also hard to think about. However, so far as sophisticated human creations like logic or novels, in some way you\u2019re right, because unless we already know its name and some of what the name means, it is unlikely to have any relevance to us. As humans, we try to take advantage of the available tools, rather than things that are deemed distant, incomprehensible, or imaginary. Some of the limits on imagination are simply norms of language and intelligence, and the sophistication of science and philosophy, or other categories. Sometimes there may even be an entire discipline that we would consider imaginary, that on another planet would be considered hard science. It may depend on our assumptions, and the types of abilities people have, including their mental powers and physical powers (or some other power). ",

            "answer_text": "Great question! There are some who believe that the world as we know it is entirely, or almost entirely, of our own making. In a universe that consists of continua (fields) and nothing else, in which everything is connected, everything is one, it can be accurately said that any thing (apart from the thing that is the universe or, if you prefer, the Tao) exists only in our mental acknowledgement of the thing. It has further been said (eg by G. Spencer-Brown) that the act of naming something creates an artificial distinction, separating the part of the universe to which the name applies from the rest to which the name does not apply. Names create things that aren't otherwise there. I differ from that opinion only a little. There was a time in my life before I knew any words. Yet I made distinctions and saw things. I began to manipulate my environment before I had learned any words. Probably I formed mental symbols by which I identified things. Probably the earliest form of each symbol was its appearance, or taste. Perhaps over time each symbol evolved into an amalgam of associations, which eventually included words. I do think that our minds have a huge influence on the appearance of the world. But I think it would be too simple to blame it all on language. ",

            "answer_text": "I take your question literally: if you mention the possibility of giving a name to this thing, you already have the start of a representation for it. A considerable percentage of our mental representations have no name. Take, for example, the reflex of blinking under the effect of bright light. This reflex exists, is owner, and yet, by default, is not named by you. There, suddenly, you may be tempted to call it \"My-reflex-of-blink-in-full-light,\" but beforehand it led its little fellow way of reflex without possessing any name. And it is the case of an immense majority of our mental representations, whatever they correspond to real things or abstractions. The name is above all a medium of communication. It is necessary to share the existence of things, not to create it. This sharing reinforces the presence of the thing with the name. Mental / environmental exchanges are always bi-directional. However the thing exists in your mind before being named, and if you are a wild child or live alone you do not really need to baptize your concepts so that they are acting. ",

            "answer_text": "Existence is not determined by language. Language does not determine existence. An example of this is the concept of untranslatable words. What has a name in one language may not have a name in another. The English language has one name for \u201csnow\u201d while some Inuit dialects have over twenty different names for it showing that this phenomenon is important to their culture. This does not mean that more types of snow exist where they live but reflects the variations of snow that the observing culture notices. \u201cMokita\u201d is a word in the Kivila language spoken on the Papua New Guinean island of Kiriwina. Loosely translated it means \u201cthe truth we all know but agree not to talk about\u201d. In English we don\u2019t have a name for this but we still know or are aware it still exists. For example one might say \u201clet\u2019s not talk about the elephant in the room\u201d. Another abstract concept which exists across the whole humanity but which doesn\u2019t have a name in most languages is that feeling when you exchange a meaningful look with another person who you want to kiss but you\u2019re both worried about being rebuffed. This exchanged look is called \u201cMamihlapinatapei\u201d by the Yag\u00e1n people of Tierra del Fuego. While these are abstract and not concrete examples the underlying argument stands that language does not create that which it describes.

This third view is controversial because of many different studies that have been done in the area of Cognitive Linguistics. Things might not exists for us (in our mind) if we have no word for them. For example, if a community does not have a word for God, the concept of God is completely absent in their understanding of things that exist. Things might exists for us (in our mind) even if we have no word for them. For example, numbers. We don\u2019t need to name numbers to have the concept of two things. ",

Identities which exist, do so at least in some knowledge context. Even a  fictional identity can be referred to as something that exists in a fictional context.  A character in a fictional book for example, can be indicated as an identity that exists as the character in a fiction. ",
