But young people will find out what happens next, and some of them may even help determine what happens next. For awhile. So much bad I see seems destined to devolve into far, far worse. The resolution? Older generations will soon no longer be around to ask what happens next. I don\u2019t wonder about the next after next, a sadly childish question. ",
