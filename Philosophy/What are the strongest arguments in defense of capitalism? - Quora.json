            "answer_text": "Exactly what James said. True Capitalism is the only moral system because it\u2019s predicated on voluntary exchange. Meaning, if you\u2019ve created something I value, I'll willingly pay you for it. If you don't create something I value, I won't pay you. If you create a company and offer me a job, you're willing to trade that portion of your profits to me, in exchange for my work. If I don't think the salary is worth it, I\u2019ll look for another job that is. If you don't value the work I've done for the amount you've paid me, you\u2019re free to lower my pay, or let me go on my merry way. Capitalism drives (and rewards) innovation because companies strive to provide the most value to customers, in order to increase profits. This translates to better, cheaper products and a higher standard of living for everyone. Sexism, racism, and all the other isms are inconsistent, and ridiculous, in a capitalist system . As a business owner, not hiring the best candidate based on group bias would be antithetical to growing their business. A business owner will want to find the absolute best talent their money can buy no matter where they come from or what they look like. Also because the market is fast moving and unforgiving, if a business owner or employee loses their reputation, they lose everything. If they're lying, cheating, stealing, polluting, or even just providing substandard service, the market will punish them. Customers aren't going to rush to a new restaurant with their wallets open if all the yelp reviews said poor quality. The market works both ways, it rewards the businesses, employees, or individuals that create value (the product/service/work/effort they're trading) and doesn't reward those that do not.

            "answer_text": "I will answer from the book, Philosophy of Right (1821) by GWF Hegel. It is strictly impossible to have Law without Private Property, which is its fundamental basis. Family Law, Civil Law, Criminal Law, Constitutional Law and International Law all presume the institution of Private Property. The basis of all Private Property is first of all \u2014 the Self-ownership of one\u2019s own body. Freedom itself is based on the honoring of Self-ownership. (Thus, chattel Slavery must be banned worldwide, wrote Hegel. He was disturbed in 1821 that the USA had failed to conform to the new European standards of Self-ownership). Thousands of years of battles for Self-ownership (the wars for Recognition) finally bore fruit with the first Republics and Constitutional Monarchies. The second Private Property that anybody knows is his or her Family. The Family must exist somewhere. Thus the long struggle for homeland. Family Law emerged within the first prehistoric tribes \u2014 perhaps from the ancient Judges of Sumer. Marriage Contracts were among the first problems to solve \u2014 e.g. responsibility for children. We all learned these Laws tacitly as children. The third Private Property that anybody knows is that of Civil Society \u2014 the world of Business \u2014 trading, shopping, commerce in general. This includes Work and Wages, which is based on a Labor Contract (even if it is just with one worker). To keep a Contract is Right. To break a Contract is a Wrong. Thus, there is a Civil Court to bring remedy to those who have suffered a Broken Contract. Civil Court is entirely concerned with Private Property Rights. The greatest problem for Civil Society is willful Crime. Crime is the violation of Private Property, not only by theft (embezzlement, shoplifting, fraud, robbery), but also by violation of the First Property, my own body. This always involves violence, such as rape, assault and battery, and murder. Thus there is a Criminal Court to assess the damage done, and establish a just recompense., The fourth Private Property that we know is our Nation. Our Nation provides all of the Freedoms that make us who we are today \u2014 so we owe everything to our Nation, including our Language, our rights to Commerce, and even our very lives. For this reason, every Nation has the right to demand military service from its citizens when invaded by an enemy Nation. There has never been any epoch in written history that lacked Nations, enemy Nations, invasions and Wars. National Defense has been the solemn Duty of every citizen in history. It remains so today. There are dreams and Utopias that wish for an International Unity of Nations \u2014 for many centuries \u2014 but so far these efforts have consistently failed. That much is from Hegel. What follows is from myself. There is hope \u2014 the emergence and the prosperity of Capitalism. Today, after the fall of the USSR in 1991, and after the USA made a sweetheart Trade Deal with Red China (ca. 1992), there has been no serious competitor to Capitalism. The twin curses of Capitalism still persist (e.g. massive Unemployment and Poverty) but no other system in history has been able to consistently solve this problem, either. (Perhaps adapting the Public School Curriculum to the new Global Market is the solution to this ancient problem.) Hegel envisioned the best hope for World Peace was something on the order of Global Supply Chains, which obliged Nations to recognize the benefits of Global Cooperation. This seems to be making some progress in the 21st century \u2014 although there are still threats of War worldwide to this very day. ",
