            "answer_text": "Well, of course critical theory is testable within its context, but as we have discovered over the last couple of decades someone who does not want to follow the logic of analysis is not going to be convinced by anything. Odd as it may sound, all scientific and academic efforts require an initial suspension of disbelief. I mean this exactly the way they mean it in the theater. When we see the play Hamlet we know that the guy up there on stage in the tights and holding the skull is not actually the 14th century Prince of Denmark \u2014 he\u2019s probably a 20-something baristo trying to be a \u2018serious\u2019 artist \u2014 but we set that disbelief aside so that we can enjoy the play. They better an actor that guy is, the easier it is for us to suspend disbelief, and the more we enjoy the play. In that same sense, whenever we hear a scientific theory, we should automatically suspend disbelief. We accept the theory as true for the purposes of examining the evidence and listening to the reasoning; we let that scientific story roll over us and see how it holds together. The better the theory is, and the more the reasoning and evidence support it, the easier it is for us to suspend disbelief until we reach a point where we are no longer suspending anything: we just accept the theory as valid. Unfortunately, the more that theories impinge on politics, the more resistant and unwilling people become. There is a ton of well supported, well-reasoned research in critical race theory and queer theory and feminism, research showing broad trends of differential treatment and outright discrimination in society. Not every theory is entirely convincing, granted \u2014 welcome to science \u2014 but there are a lot of theories that are convincing to anyone willing to make that initial suspension of disbelief. But some people refuse to make that initial suspension of disbelief, and get very high-toned and aggressive with anyone who asks them to. Deniers gonna deny, that\u2019s what they do. ",

            "answer_text": "I think you need to clarify what you mean by Critical Theory. If you are referring to the methodological approach popularized by the Frankfurt school, I'm sorry to say but you have missed the boat entirely. In part, the \u201ccritical theory\u201d of the Frankfurt School (glossing over the stark differences for sake of clarity) was a reaction to the \"mechanistic\u201d versions of Marxism that led to the failed socialist revolutions. Without getting into the weeds here, these theories held Marxism to be \u201ctestable\u201d or \u201cscientific\u201d which, for Critical theory, was precisely the problem. How was it possible for the infallible to fail? To test anything requires a method of testing (rationality, say), and if the object/theory in question does not meet the subjects expectations, then the object/theory has failed the test. But this assumes that we (the thinking subject) knows everything about the object in question and that knowledge of the world is simply \u201cout there\u201d for us to grasp. This assumption creates a whole host of problems including not seeing the dialectical relation between subject and object, individual and society, thought and being, etc., and therefore experiencing the world as a collection of isolated \u201cparts\u201d or \u201cthings\u201d which are only valuable to the extent that they can be extracted and manipulated to serve the purposes of their user. This leads to the \u201cdomination of nature\u201d to which these thinkers were vehemently opposed to. Furthermore, to test something is to discover \u201cfacts\u201d which for Critical Theory are by definition \u201cuncritical\u201d because they merely describe the world in quantitative terms and excludes any notions of quality or inherent potentialities (classical fact/value divide). This is the basic critique of positivism (and positivistic social science) strewn throughout critical theory and especially the FS. So your idea that if a hypothesis can't be tested, you can't tell if it's right or wrong is precisely the kind of ideological barrier critical theory was reacting against. If you were referring to Critical Theory in the broader sense I apologize, but hope this helps. Cheers. ",
