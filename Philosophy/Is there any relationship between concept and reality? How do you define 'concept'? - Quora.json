            "answer_text": "A2A Are you familiar with the way that internet browsers work? You type in a web address and your browser finds the website and displays it on your monitor. The next time you go to that website the browser does not go and find the website again - the browser retrieves a memory of the website it stored. Your browser stores the memory of the website and shows you that memory instead of logging into the original site every time you visit it. The mind works the same way. It perceives reality and then it creates an image of what it perceives. This image is a concept. The next time the mind experiences the same thing it no longer pays attention to what it experiences, it just pulls out the concept and relates to the concept. When the mind encounters something new it hasn\u2019t experienced before, it reaches for all the relevant existing concepts in order to make up a new concept that explains the new experience in a way that fits existing concepts. In this way the mind tends to get more and more involved with concepts, and less and less aware of the actual experience. The web browsers do \u201ccheck in\u201d with the actual websites to update their memories periodically, so that the memories that are displayed are always more or less up to date and reflect the reality of a website more or less accurately. The mind is periodically forced to \u201ccheck in\u201d with reality to update it\u2019s concepts, though the mind is usually reluctant to do so. For the most part the mind tends to stick to concepts as they are. It gives it a sense of knowing, of stability, security that humans quite enjoy. Usually a concept is updated when reality intrudes and contradicts the old concept in ways that can\u2019t be ignored, or else when one is intentionally examining one\u2019s concepts. Reality will force one to keep the concepts more or less aligned with it. If there is no pressure to update concepts though, they can stay what they are throughout the human\u2019s entire lifetime and they will become progressively more and more distant from reality. Also when one chooses to stick to one\u2019s concepts and ignore reality that contradicts them, the concepts will become farther and farther removed from reality. It is the nature of reality to change. It is the nature of concepts to remain unchanged. This disparity causes the miss-alignment between concepts and reality. ",

            "answer_text": "Consider 2 definitions or uses of \u201cconcept\u201d: For Plato, \u201cconcept\u201d might at its best be construed as the eidos \u2014 the eternal Ideas, ideals, \u201cforms,\u201d or we might call them something like concept designs, blueprints or templates in today\u2019s language. The highest of the eidos are the Good, the True, and the Beautiful, with all other ideas and ideals deriving in some way from those. In some Buddhist inspired traditions, concept might be construed as \u201cadded-on meaning,\u201d attributed meaning, or significance placed on top of \u201cwhat-is,\u201d distracting us from seeing things simply, as they are. So in the first case, we have concept as eternal Ideas that are in many ways more \u201creal\u201d than impermanent objects in the physical world. And in the second case, we have many or most concepts devalued as superfluous and distracting. ",
