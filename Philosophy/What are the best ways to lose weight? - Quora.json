            "answer_text": "Losing weight is not a very difficult thing, if one regularly follows a routine, a proper diet chart; and does exercises. If you think that you need to lose weight, first, you have to change your food habits. For that, it is better to consult a dietician, who can provide you a proper diet chart, which you should follow every day. Try to eat healthy food, such as green vegetables, fresh fruits, fruit juices, cereals,oats, skimmed milk, etc. Avoid sugar, oily and spicy foods, junk food, and other high-calorie diet, as these give rise to obesity, and are not good for health. For more suggestions, consult an expert in this field. ",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, I assume this question is about losing body fat. Your \u201cweight\u201d includes many elements of which body fat is one. Your percentage body fat will be determined by your past diet, activity levels and your muscle mass. Losing body fat is about creating a calorific deficit. Using more calories than you ingest. This should be done via managing your diet, being active and building muscle mass. In general, a person with a greater muscle mass will have a higher basal metabolic rate, so will burn more calories at rest. Having greater muscle mass is one determinant in controlling your body fat as the greater the muscle mass, the greater the calories required to maintain and service that muscle. Muscle mass is developed via exercise and specifically resistance training. Your activity levels will also affect how many calories you burn as calories fuel the body to perform the activity, so obviously the more active you are, the more calories your body will use. Activity can include any form of movement, from walking, gardening or more formal exercise such as running, sport or going to the gym. The main point is to keep your body moving as much and often as possible. Finally, the most important component of the calorific equation is ensuring you have a balanced diet, that provides the nutrients your body requires while not providing excess calories. It is said that your diet controls up to 80% of your body fat. So get your diet right and 80% of the issue is dealt with. As a general rule, opting for foods that are high in nutrients and lower in calories (energy) will assist in fat loss. What is a balanced diet? Well just that, a balance. Plenty of vegetables, nuts/seeds, fruits and grains, some proteins and fats and less of the bad stuff ie processed foods and sugar. The most important thing about a diet is that it should not be a \u201cdiet\u201d, it should simply be about food balance, making good decisions and taking a lifelong approach. Forget the diets and fads, eat a balanced diet, stay active and do some resistance training and your body fat (and your health) will take care of itself. The main message is take a lifelong, balanced approach to your health and you will not go wrong. In summary, eat well, keep moving and do some exercise that will maintain or build muscle. ",
