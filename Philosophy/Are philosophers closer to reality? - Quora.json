Practical knowledge is left to servants and tradesmen. This difference leads to sharp distinctions in schooling methods. Lower classes have always been educated to perform a job. That system produces servants, technicians, and soldiers. Upper classes have always had a very different education in a system that produces generals, philosophers, and entrepreneurs.

            "answer_text": "Mr. Schall, with due respect, you must FIRST define what you mean by \u2018reality\u2019 and THEN, describe the parameters that recognize who comes the closest to satisfying these parameters. There are a plethora of \u2018realities\u2019 - physical, mental, spiritual, emotional, and there is a professional out there who is practicing defining more precisely these realities as expressions of our diversity as a species of living beings. The quantum physicists, to date, do NOT admit that there is a non-material component to the wave/particle duality found in light, and the probabilities involved in a particle \u2018being\u2019 - and NOT being, at the SAME time. How can a particle be a mass, and a force of energy, SIMULTANEOUSLY???? Because their thinking is unfortunately embedded in materialism, they cannot step outside to see the forest for the trees. They need to have a visible object to measure in order for them to say \u2018 this is \u2018real\u2019 thing. Philosophers, theologians, social professionals, they are accustomed to dealing in non-tangible entities - namely WORDS that describe intelligible concepts which we us to describe \u2018reality.\u2019 AND to determine if that reality has to be \u2018adjusted\u2019 to suit current demands and needs. \u2019 You can obviously see a vast gap between the physical and the \u2018spiritual\u2019 here, and I DON\u2019T mean religious. It is the philosophers and theologians who WILL explain the complexities of reality, because they are using a vocabulary we can comprehend, and it is only when that comprehension becomes more credible and acceptable than the scientists equations, formulas and theories, that it is advisable the scientists start looking for other occupations.

            "answer_text": "Philosophy people can be normal enough to talk in common parlance and ordinary words of conversation. Their subject matter already deals with reality as a term in metaphysics, which is the study of reality in the nature or structure of reality. How much that study is applicable, relevant, or true to the common lives of people as citizens in public and society, is a different issue that is about academic or scholarship transfer to ordinary living. Though in another sense, philosophy people study what the structure and nature of society, social groups and contracts, and political systems are as well in social and political philosophy. That branch again, is subject to how applicable and realistic to the world of people and common dialogue. ",
