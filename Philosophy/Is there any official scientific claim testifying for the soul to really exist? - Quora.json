            "answer_text": "Not to my knowledge, but it is generally up to people who make a claim to prove it, both with gods and things like the soul. From my point of view, a brain is like a computer, a very complex one, programmed through environment over the life of the individual, an organic computer which operates in a body which has developed to be in tune with the computer. It still operates via electric pulses, regardless of the complexity, so I do not see anything supernatural about it - the pulses can be measured and monitored, and even in some ways substituted artificially. We also need our electrolytes in order to operate correctly. When the person dies, the electric pulses cease, and as far as I am aware, there is no evidence of any vaprous emanation at the moment of death which might be regarded as a soul. Not a very romantic view, but I would definitely want to have evidence for anything such as a soul or spirit. ",

            "answer_text": "Mr. Foscili, YES, I have answered this question before, but it certainly bears repetition. Treatises on, essays written, poetry and verses, in the billions of words, that grace all the ancient scriptures of most of the religious beliefs of the worlds\u2019 cultures - ALL of these are the precursors to our knowledge of the soul. The ancient Egyptians were the first to clearly identify the \u2018KA\u2019 the spirit, or soul, of the person that it inhabited during that person\u2019s earthly life. This was also the first intelligible concept that human beings are composed of a material and a spiritual entity. On passing from this life, the KA was weighed on the balance scale presided over by Anubis and Thoth - the soul or KA on one side, the feather of MAAT on the other side. If the KA was heavier than the feather, the soul was judged \u2018heavy\u2019 with sin, fault, bad deeds, and was devoured by a crocodile. This annihilation of the soul was considered the Second Death. (*) If the KA was EQUAL in weight, or even lighter than the feather(!!!) it was granted immortality and ascended to the throne of Osiris, Lord of the Two Realms. It is critical today, with the rise of scientific atheism, and the blatant denial of spiritual realities, to further discuss and research how the soul is the very seat of consciousness, if not the very life force itself. In his paradigm shifting book, Fred Alan Wolf, Ph.D, theoretical physics, UCLA, \u201cThe Spiritual Universe: How Quantum Physics proves the Existence of the Soul,\u201d Dr. Wolf uses his skill at uncovering difficult scientific research to explain how the key to the soul can be found in the deep connection between the observer and the observed. This interaction, at the quantum level [we are ALL quantum systems] helps explain how the soul connects to what we perceive as \u2018matter.\u2019 Whether you are a pure materialist, or a pure spiritualist, there is more than enough to digest in this brilliantly written treatise.
