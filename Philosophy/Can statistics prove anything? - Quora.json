            "answer_text": "People give statistics a hard time. When going through the usual social rites of life, they are using the statistics of grades and averages to graduate, apply for graduate school, or represent their grade quality. The same applies to standard tests that are normalized for examinees, on the statistic of their section scores and distribution of scores. I would say more, but it is getting obvious that statistics are used so heavily in our research of most fields that apply data analyses, that there aren\u2019t more points to prove. If you aren\u2019t applying statistics and mathematical properties into your studies, you are most likely in the arts such as performing, visual, or musical, or you are using words or mostly phonetic units in your work.
