            "answer_text": "One question is: how high-flying a bird do you want to be? If you have the interest, the energy, and the patience to read all 9 volumes of Copleston, then I\u2019d say, go for it! I\u2019ve read about 4 volumes of the series, and I loved it. I read slowly, taking notes. If you read all 9 volumes with reasonable care, you will have a very good grounding in Western philosophy, I would say. You\u2019d be a fairly low-flying bird, seeing a lot of detail. I think there are certain advantages to reading a history rather than just reading one particular philosopher. While Plato, for example, was a great philosopher, perhaps the greatest, he is still only one among many, and there are great thinkers who do not share his viewpoint. A good historian, which I think Copleston is, is aware of this and is able to set out the various points of view, while also keeping his own views in perspective. You can\u2019t do a major history such as Copleston\u2019s without loving philosophy\u2014all of it. I think reading Copleston\u2019s history is a wonderful project. I haven\u2019t finished it myself yet, but I would love to do so. And even if you only get part way through volume 1, hey, you\u2019re still ahead of the game. ",

            "answer_text": "It might do that, but it is quite long. Start with Bertrand Russell\u2019s History of Western Philosophy. It is certainly Russell\u2019s view and not in any way objective, but Coplestone\u2019s in not objective either; it is Thomist in outlook. Alfred North Whitehead wrote, \u201cThe safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.\u201d That is an exaggeration, of course, but if there is anything in it, one might get a bird\u2019s-eye view by giving a thorough reading to Plato\u2019s Republic. In My view, the real bailiwick of philosophy is epistemology, and one might get a fairly complete view of that inquiry by reading Plato\u2019s Theaetetus, Decartes\u2019 Meditations on First Philosophy, Hume\u2019s An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason (big job), and, perhaps, Karl Popper\u2019s Objective Knowledge.
