            "answer_text": "You might be going crazy, but seeing shadows in your peripheral vision is not an indication of that. It isn\u2019t unusual to see such things. Any perceived movement seen \u201cout of the corner of your eye\u201d cries out for identification. It could just be an artifact of the eye itself, but it is probably just some inconsequential thing that your mind INTERPRETS as movement of an actual object. Our brains evolved in an environment where the ability to analyze our sensory input and produce decisions to aid our survival was a big plus - and still is. A small movement off to the side might mean nothing, in which case we can ignore it, or it might mean a predator creeping up on us, in which case ignoring it means we are going to be lunch - better safe than sorry. He who runs from nothing survives to have offspring. He who doesn\u2019t, doesn\u2019t. When you perceive something moving in your vicinity, your brain shifts from analysis to prediction and extrapolates that barely-seen movement into \u201cwind in the grass\u201d or \u201cleopard creeping up on me.\u201d One means, \u201cah, cool breeze,\u201d and the other means \u201crun like hell.\u201d On a street corner, our \u201ccivilized\u201d context has provided other threats which we can extrapolate from those barely-seen movements. Such a perceived motion might mean \u201cpanhandler approaching\u201d or \u201cmugger approaching,\u201d each requiring different responses. I see things out of the corner of my eye all the time; I rather enjoy it. ",

            "answer_text": "No, absolutely not. You may have a condition called Centrous Serum Retinopathy, CSR. Calm down. This is not cancer, this is not fatal, this is pretty much just annoying. Not much is known about CSR, but it is thought to be caused by elevated cortisol, most likely brought on by stress. Go to your opthamologist. Not an optometrist. Your opthamologist may suggest seeing a retinologist, which includes a day of super-neat testing (seriously!). CSR is where a wee bit of fluid makes a dip in your retina. That gives the side shadow effect. Sometimes, when you lay down, you will notice a tiny blip of light for a fraction of a second. Now it also could be retinal detachment. Take a look at that too. If you end up at Wills, message me and I'll go with, ditto Dr Regillo. If you must Google, google Dr Carl Regillo at Mid-Atlantic Eye and CSR on the Wills Eye Hospital site. There is interesting info on Wiki too. Stick to those sites. If you drag around too much, you will certainly find the horror story you are looking for. You won't find it. If CSR becomes really problematic, it is fixed, literally, in the blink of the eye. Got it, was scared, still have it, not worried. ",
