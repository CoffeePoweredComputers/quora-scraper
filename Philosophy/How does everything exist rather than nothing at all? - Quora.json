            "answer_text": "Those two questions need separate responses; perhaps they are connected together somehow, but first let\u2019s take each one as if they stand alone. That question can only be answered after we are both satisfied that we understand what existence is. That alone will address the question, or at least give us a basis to consider why. What is existence? It is motion. It is energy. We can observe motion and we can observer the changes in states of energy (it got hotter, it got cooler). On Earth, motion can be up and down which is the realm of gravity, and it can be side to side which is momentum. In space, motion is mainly orbits. We can emulate orbits by swinging a weight on a rope. When we observe using modern tools of observation like super powerful microscopes and powerful telescopes we observe motion and changes of state which are just scaled up or scaled down version of what we observe without those tools. The greater the scaling up and scaling down, the more it is beginning to look like motion and changes of states of energy are one and the same thing, governed by the same rules. So much so that we suspect there may be one rule, or one law that governs all the variety, all the diversity. That leads us to be more and more convinced that All is One, a simple formulation that connects all the diversity we observe together into a coherent unity. One law of nature stands out to guide our thinking in this realm, the 1st law of TD: energy cannot be created. This fits neatly into the Unity concept. Since it appears that motion (energy) is the one feature of existence that is ubiquitous, and we know energy cannot be created, we can conclude that existence is, like energy, not a creation, and it therefore timeless. There is likely to be some resistance to this concept because we have never seen anything that does not have a beginning or an end. And that is true; the forms that energy takes (matter, EM radiation) have duration, they are not timeless. Energy is all the time changing in form. It is energy (motion) which is timeless, and existence is made of energy. The essence of existence is motion and it is timeless. Now, Unity means there is no cause. Once causality is introduced, we have duality: cause and the caused. But, there is no end to causality: something caused the Cause, and so on forever. That concept has no utility. It violates the 1st law of TD: energy cannot be created. Energy has no cause, it is a manifestation of Unity. The forms that energy takes are manifestations of Diversity which is different from the duality of causation. Now we are getting closer, conceptually, to what existence is, and we stand a better chance of grasping why existence exists and why it is the way it is an not otherwise. If you are still with me, following this line of thinking on the way to addressing your questions, now that we have, using simple logic and that basic law of nature, a better conceptual grasp on what existence is. Now is the time to make the distinction between existence and the universe. It may be that ours is the only one in existence, but logic tells us that is probably not the case. Existence shouldn\u2019t be limited to only one universe, the one we occupy; it is more logical that there are others, probably an endless number of universes. I personally favor the nested universe model, one contained inside another. For example, our universe \u201cis\u201d (contingently) a quantum (unit of energy) in the next universe \u201cup\u201d in scale as every quantum in our universe is a universe just like ours, and so on forever in both \u201cdirections\u201d of scale. That\u2019s quite a picture of infinity, don\u2019t you agree? So, existence is eternal and infinite, and our universe is an integral part of that endlessness. If your head doesn\u2019t hurt too much, let\u2019s put it all together and say, Unity is expressed in diversity and diversity is what makes Unity be. They are both endless and represent two sides of one \u201ccoin\u201d which is Being. Rather than be just mystified by that formulation, we can say we understand how Unity and Diversity work together, through motion (energy) to present itself to us mobile perceivers, exactly what we observe at every scale of observation: endless motion with no outside source of power. How could existence not be? How could it be otherwise? Are you getting close to the answer to your question? I can use other examples if you wish. ",

            "answer_text": "Nobody knows the answer to that yet. Not scientists and not religion. Religious cults will tell you that the sky god did it, but this is the same thing religion told us about lightning, about famine, about disease - and we subsequently found scientific answers for all of those. So we have to admit, that we don\u2019t know why or how matter, energy and so on comes to exist. Until we have an answer one interesting way to look at it, is that perhaps when totalled all together, it doesn\u2019t. If you have +$1 and I have -1$ then in total between us, there is no money. However separately we would swear blind that I had money and you owed money. That could be the essence of everything, that in total, matter and anti-matter are just a zero distributed unevenly. ",

Does the question remain invariant with respect to the existence of Russel's teapot? Anyway, I assume you're asking how do things exist? That's a tough one of answer, but then again, it might not have been asked if nothing existed. Sorry. I'm still not answering the question. I guess, if nothing existed then\u2026 nothing would happen? Nothing at all? Because action required an object. Well\u2026 I'd just say it's a property of the universe that matter exists, I guess. My question is, does it matter why existence is a thing? Because my actions aren't dependent on the answer to this question\u2026 although it is something interesting to think about. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing can come from nothing. If something came from nothing then the nothing has the property of being able to produce something and so the \"nothing\" is something, a \"thing\" that can produce what we have today. The universe is eternal, always was and always will be. It was not created, it just is. We need to discover, scientifically, the facts. To say before the \"big bang\" there was nothing is nonsense. Before the \"big bang\" (whatever that was) there was something that gave rise to the \"big bang\" and we are ignorant of what that was. We need a theory of what gave rise to what we call \u201cthe Big Bang\u201d, one that doesn\u2019t assume nothing produced something. But never forget we must start somewhere and that somewhere is that existence exists (Read Ayn Rand and Leonard Peikoff, especially Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand, for more details.) To put it another way; asking why the universe exists is an invalid question because you first need a universe in order to ask the question! ",

However we have created some things which do not exist in nature, and probably will continue to do so. There always had to be something in existence for the universe to be created, even if it was pure energy of some form or the other. I think that nothing can only produce nothing. ",
