            "answer_text": "Yes. But the problem is Christians laid a Neoplatonic schema on top of the Bible so most Theologians nowadays deny that God has emotions because that would imply change and would deny transcendence. This is why I had to leave the Church for Messianic Judaism. Gen. 6:5 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6 And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 7 And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.

            "answer_text": "We can cite numerous passages of Scripture that speak to God\u2019s emotions. For example, God demonstrated the following:  \u2022 Anger \u2013 Psalm 7:11; Deuteronomy 9:22; Romans 1:18\u2022 Laughter \u2013 Psalm 37:13; Psalm 2:4; Proverbs 1:26\u2022 Compassion \u2013 Psalm 135:14; Judges 2:18; Deuteronomy 32:36\u2022 Grief \u2013 Genesis 6:6; Psalm 78:40; Isaiah 68:10\u2022 Love \u2013 1 John 4:8; John 3:16; Jeremiah 31:3\u2022 Hate \u2013 Proverbs 6:16; Psalm 5:5; Psalm 11:5\u2022 Jealousy \u2013 Exodus 20:5; Exodus 34:14; Joshua 24:19\u2022 Joy \u2013 Zephaniah 3:17; Isaiah 62:5; Jeremiah 32:41 However, are God\u2019s emotions the same kind of emotions we humans exhibit?  Is it right to think of Him as \u201cemotional\u201d (does He have mood swings)?  In theological circles, personhood is often defined as \u201cthe state  of being an individual with intellect, emotion, and volition.\u201d God,  then, is a \u201cperson\u201d in that He is a personal God with a mind, emotions,  and a will of His own. To deny God\u2019s emotions is to deny that He  possesses personality. Humans respond to things in this world physically, of course, but we also respond spiritually\u2014our souls react, and this is what we call \u201cemotion.\u201d The fact of human emotion is  one proof that God has emotions, as well, for He created us in His  image (Genesis 1:27).  Another proof is the Incarnation. As the Son of God in this world,  Jesus was not an emotionless automaton. He felt what we feel, weeping  with those who wept (John 11:35), feeling compassion for the multitudes (Mark 6:34), and being overcome with sorrow (Matthew 26:38). Through it all, He revealed the Father to us (John 14:9). Though God is transcendent, we\u2019ve come know Him as a personal, living God who engages intimately with His creation. He loves us in ways we cannot fathom (Jeremiah 31:3; Romans 5:38; 8:35, 38\u201339), and He is immeasurably pained by our sin and rebellion against Him (Psalm 1:5; 5:4\u20135; Proverbs 6:16\u201319). We recognize that the demonstration of emotions does not alter the  immutability or permanence of God\u2019s will or His promises. In other  words, God does not change (Malachi 3:6; Numbers 23:19; 1 Samuel 15:29);  He has no mood swings. God\u2019s feelings and actions toward His creation,  His judgment and forgiveness, His justice and grace, are all consistent  with who He is (James 1:17).  God\u2019s responses to good and evil come from His same immutable will. God  wills to judge and punish the sinner in order to bring about justice  and, correspondingly, to bring the sinner to repentance because He  desires that all men be saved (1 Timothy 2:4).  We\u2019ve come to know and relate to God as a feeling Person, one who loves  and hates, grieves and laughs, feels anger and compassion. He loves the  righteous and hates the wicked (Psalm 11:5\u20137; 5:4\u20135; 21:8). This isn\u2019t to say that our emotions and those of God are exactly the  same. We sometimes speak of our emotions \u201cclouding our judgment\u201d because  our sinful nature has corrupted our emotions.  But God has no sin, and  His emotions are incorruptible. For example, there is a vast difference  between human anger and divine anger. Man\u2019s anger is volatile, subjective, and too often out of control (Proverbs 14:29; 15:18; James 1:20).  God\u2019s anger is rooted in divine justice. God\u2019s anger is perfectly  righteous and predictable, never capricious or malicious. In His anger,  He never sins. All of God\u2019s emotions are rooted in His holy nature and are always  expressed sinlessly. God\u2019s compassion, sorrow, and joy are all perfect  expressions of the Perfect Being. Jesus\u2019 anger at the synagogue leaders  in Mark 3:5 and His love for the rich young ruler in Mark 10:21 were perfectly motivated responses of His divine nature. God\u2019s ways have been recorded for us in terms that we can understand and relate to. God\u2019s wrath and anger against sin are real (Proverbs 8:13; 15:9). And His compassion for sinners is steadfast and genuine (2 Peter 3:9; Ecclesiastes 8:11; Isaiah 30:18). His works reveal His mercy and unending grace. But most of all, His love for His children is endless (Jeremiah 31:3) and unshakable (Romans 8:35, 38\u201339).  God not only has thoughts and plans; He has feelings and desires, too.  In contrast to the unreliability and instability of man\u2019s sin-tainted  emotions, God\u2019s emotions are as completely dependable and immutable as  He. There are two wonderful things concerning God and emotions: first, He  understands our emotions (since He created us with the capacity to feel  them), and, second, His own emotions continually flow from His  perfection. God will never have a bad day; He will never change His  feelings toward His redeemed. Read more:  Page on gotquestions.org ",
