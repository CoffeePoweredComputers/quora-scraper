            "answer_text": "There are some far out examples... A paradox, what could happen is that some bizarre quantum experiment could somehow affect the past from the future where an artificial particle was created so that it's effects could be better detected. By some crazy mechanisms, the particle which was created in the future, traversed space-time and ended up in the past. So our future is unknown to us, but, possibly could exist and have existed. What would happen if a group of scientists shot a particle gun into their space in an effort to determine where the true barrier of their universe was and by the force of quantum tunneling, deposited a particle into the timeless void outside of their own universe. If the particle caused enough vibration in the other's barrier, on the outside of the barrier there would be ripples with peaks and valleys. The rippling would create dark energy and dark matter. Stephen Hawking theorizes this  may have happened. Quantum fluctuations in vacuum or other state of non-existence create virtual subatomic particles that are partially real part of the time. This particular phenomenon has been observed with regard to electrons and what-not in high-energy physics experiments: if you collide a proton and an antiproton at high speeds in a particle accelerator, you will get all kinds of stuff that aren't parts of a proton or an antiproton, including things like electrons and positrons (and, of course, gamma rays, lots of them). If there is such a thing as quantum gravity, then vacuum should also contain virtual gravitational particles, and these particles may have been what drove the universe apart during the Big Bang. In conclusion, the unknown has to exist for the known to exist. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Can the unknown exist? Details to original question: Just to refine things, The Unknown:Things we cannot see, cannot touch cannot have proof of as we do not yet know of their existance from one moment but recognize it is possible in the future. This could be in science, astronomy, extra-terrestrial life or a religious diety as they all at some point fall into the same category. Answer: Yes, it has happened. Electrons were at one time unknown, but they exist. Positrons were unknown but they exist. Muons were unknown but they exist, and so on. This could be in science, astronomy, extra-terrestrial life or a religious diety as they all at some point fall into the same category. Now here I will differ with you: a religious deity does not fall into the same category, since it is supernatural. Everything else in your list is not supernatural. Deities are in a class by themselves. And very few who believe in them say that they are completely unknown. They say that they believe in them and that they have certain characteristics. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely. Things that are beyond our past or future light cones are necessarily and completely unknown to us. It also implies that any events external to our light cones cannot establish a causal relationship with us, so they're not only directly unknown but indirectly unknown as well. Conversely, events inside our light cones might be known or unknown to us. The precise visual apparence of dinosaurs is unknown to us, and the information is not available to us. It's irreversibly gone. However, it's not completely unknown since the events happened within out past light cone and it established causal relationships with things that exist today, e.g. fossil records. ",

Why not work them out? Oh, wait again, if you haven't worked them out they don't exist yet. Frustrating........... Looks like you have opened a portal into a universe of logical problems. So at least you have proved that other universes exist. Good work! ",
