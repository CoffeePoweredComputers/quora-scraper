            "answer_text": "I find 4 incorrect (wrong) ways and 4 correct (Right) ways in selecting the best optional subject for UPSC Civil Service Exam.Firstly, 4 INCORRECT (WRONG) ways to select the optional: 1)POPULAR OPTIONAL: Many teacher advice aspirants to choose those optional with which many candidates cleared the exam in recent years. But remember, UPSC never favours one optional over the other. Moreover, the trend changes every year. At the end it all boils down to one\u2019s hard work. The other fact you are not considering here is that you can wear someone else\u2019s shoes, but would it fit you? You need your own shoes to walk and to run. You know how many students who opted for a subject got selected; but do you know the number of people who didn\u2019t? I do not mean to say that you should shy away from choosing popular subjects. If you feel comfortable with the subject, there is no need to doubt whether you should take it or not.On the other hand, Students get confused between scoring subjects and popular subjects. Most beginners choose an optional subject simply because it is considered \u2018popular\u2019. Popularity has actually got nothing to do with the scoring potential of an optional. It has been observed that every year the paper of one subject or the other is very tough. This results in a bad score and the subject gets a bad reputation. And thus Popularity changes. So choosing an optional based on the popularity criteria is not correct. 2)SYLLABUS OVERLAP WITH GENERAL STUDIES: Never select the optional subjects just because the syllabus overlaps with GS papers. Though, such a strategic decision helps save on energy and time but actually every optional in some way or the other contributes towards the GS or Essay preparation only in a limited way. For ex.- Pub Ad. covers polity and governance part, History covers the history part and so on. But the question papers and syllabus is designed by UPSC in such a way that your optional doesn\u2019t favour you in any GS papers and nor even in Prelims exam. 3)SMALL SYLLABUS: Many aspirants get trapped into this \u2018Small Syllabus\u2019 allurement or attractiveness. The first and foremost step is to read the detailed syllabus of optional subject. Students, while opting for the optional subject, should look for subjects that have a specific curriculum for the UPSC Examination. For Example- Anthropology has a smaller syllabus compared to other optionals like Commerce, Economics, Sociology, Political Science etc. Though, you can cover the syllabus in short timeframe, BUT IT IS NOT OF MUCH USE because you have to study the optional subject in depth. Believe me, UPSC never discriminate between optional subjects. You have to do the same amount of hardwork for any optional subject. 4)GRADUATION SUBJECT: Academic background plays an important role in optional selection. By taking the same optional subject that you have studied in your graduation, you can save a lot of time and energy. But never choose the optional subject only because you did it in graduation. Never get EMOTIONAL with it. Another thing is that, though the syllabus might be the same but the question asked by UPSC is different. More important is the answer demanded by UPSC from you is of much higher quality. And such quality is possible only if you are interested about the subject. Just because one is graduate in civil engineering doesn\u2019t mean he/she has interest in that subject or has attained perfection.People who have opted for the most obscure subjects like Literature, Veterinary Science, Mathematics have scored heavily in the Mains simply because they were so much in love with their optional. However, aspirants should not choose the optional for Main exam solely on the basis of the academic background. Now, 4 CORRECT (RIGHT) ways: 1)EXCITE\u2019S YOU: This is the most important thing which you should consider to select the optional. Subject will excite you only when the subject is based on your interest areas. By choosing the subjects of your interest, you can complete the studies at a faster pace with passion and dedication. When you start being analytical about a subject, you gain a deep knowledge of it and start developing your thoughts accordingly. It makes you think out of the box and thus you can score good marks.The fact that you find the optional interesting is half the battle won. Ultimately, the subject is not important; your knowledge of the subject is what matters. 2)SCORING OPTIONAL: This point is little controversial because some find it just a myth. They believe that every subject can be scoring. But according to me, the technical subjects are more scoring. Every optional is equally scoring provided you have mastered the subject and the answer writing aspect. But practically this is not possible. Therefore, students should always consider a subject that is scoring in nature.Subjects like Anthropology and Mathematics are popularly known as high scoring subjects and the success rate also seem to support their fame. Past year\u2019s results depict that the average marks scored by candidates with Anthropology and Mathematics is quite high compared to other optional subjects. Albeit this fact, it should not be the sole criteria for choosing the optional subject. 3)GUIDANCE/BOOKS: Finally, even if an optional is of your interest and also performing well in recent years, you should check the availability of guidance before arriving at the final decision. Availability of study material and access to selected candidates with same optional and affordability of coaching should be taken into consideration before choosing the optional. Remember, preparation can\u2019t be done in isolation and one must have a supporting environment to sail through the exam successfully.However, it is not an easy task to find out a perfect series of study material amidst this colossal sea of training institutions in the country. Availability of Good teachers, materials, guidance/ peer group, tests etc. is very important. Try hard to get these. 4)TECHNICAL SUBJECTS: Choosing technical subjects like Engineering as the optional is a correct way to select optional because it can fetch you good marks. If you are choosing these technical subjects as your optional, then you have to make sure that you are very thorough and good with the subject. If you are good with the subject, then this optional can make you IAS for sure. You can score exceptional marks in such optional. But in these technical subjects, there is no scope for subjectivity and it can either save you or drown you. So if you are very confident and are very good with the subject, then you can opt for it. The technical subjects can prove game changer for you. Again, I request you to choose the subject that fits within your interest zone and you are passionate to learn more about it.If you are not feeling confident about the subject, you should not take too long to change it. Even if you have wasted a year on that subject, it is better not to waste five more years over it.If you still have further queries, I will be glad to help you. Thank You! All the best! ",

            "answer_text": "Public Administration or Management as optional subject in Civil Services?I have done B.E and MBA (m not an IIT, IIM guy). I am really torn apart between these 2 optionl\u2019s and thinking long and hard on what optional to choose since quite some time. I have gone through syllabus and previous questions papers of both optionals. I have figured out the following pros and cons of each.Pub Ad:Pro:1. Compact Syllabus.2. Lot of study material available.3. Lot of people to guide.4. Relatively limited no of books to be read.Con:1. Popular subject, a lot of people opt for it. Therefore, cut throat competition. How much ever you prepare, things are very uncertain.Management:Pros:1. Studied in Post Graduation.2. Chapters in Paper 2 especially Operations Research, Stastics, Production and operations management very interesting to me. Enjoyed them thoroughly when I was studying during PG.3. In Paper2 lots of numerical problems (on the face of it-MBA level, didn\u2019t find them very difficult) are asked. If problems are solved correctly-one can get full marks. So, potentially scoring subject.Cons:1. Huge syllabus- It includes everything I studied during my 2 years of MBA.2. Topic mentioned in the syllabus looks vague. Not sure how much to study in those topics. Ex. In paper1, chapter3, there is a topic called \u201cStrategic management of human resources\u201d. Now, in MBA we studied entire subject and a voluminous book on \u201cStratergic human resource management\u201d. So what do I read out of such book and how much do I read? Such examples galore in the syllabus. I also went through previous year questions papers to see what kind of questions they ask but it didn\u2019t inspire much confidence in me.3. Unlike Pub Ad, management optional is not very helpful in GS.4. Less takers for this optional so availability guidance is scarce.5. I will be competing with people from IIMs and other top colleges.Answer Writing: This is something I have to do-whether I take pub ad or Management. In pub ad, there are people to help me, review my answers, improve my answers but in Management I see none. So, here I am stuck, wondering how to go about it. If I were to get somebody to guide me in Management optional, I would straight away opted for it. But since not much guidance is available I am hesitating to opt it. ",
