            "answer_text": "I think you mean something like, \"Is being good at Philosophy an inborn faculty?\"  In some sense it is (as Steve Waddington cleverly/tongue-in-cheek pointed out...all of our skills originate from inborn, human faculties), but in another plausible sense it is not. Philosophizing well is a set of skills (writing, reading, composing, and organizing thoughts) and cultivating your reasoning is a skill that is best refined in an academic setting (though it can eventually be practiced in more informal ones such as Quora).  It's similar to asking, \"Are Physicists naturally born?\" Some people do have a knack for picking up on physical principles more easily than others, but still, I contend that doing Physics is a set a set of skills that can be learned and improved upon (I'm a good example of this phenomena of improving/learning). That makes those skills not-naturally-born...so Physicists (at least the good ones who are acknowledged formally as such) are made and not born.  In the same way Philosophers are made and not born.

            "answer_text": "While there may be few rare exceptions, it does seem that philosophers are naturally born. Philosophers tend to be introverts, and that helpful quality is something that one is born with. Some people are born as extroverts and spend too much time socializing, or helping other people, rather than reading books and contemplating philosophy. Some people are born with other capabilities than philosophizing. Also, the environment is very important. If one is born in a poor country, to a poor family, and has to work 3 jobs just to stay alive, then there is not much money, time, effort, or desire to read and contemplate things. Basic factors of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs has to be sufficiently met first. While some people can definitely improve, and I think they should, some people improve better than others and some are born way ahead in capabilities. Just my opinion. ",

That is to say, philosophy is chiefly characterized by the disposition to question, wonder, and pay attention to minute detail, etc. Operari sequitur esse ",

So, depending on what you consider philosophy to be, and if you go along with the formulation that true philosophy begins with some degree of self awareness, then it may be said that a philosopher is more \"born\" than made, as not everyone equally notices they exist or experiences curiosity about that.
