            "answer_text": "Literature about human nature could give us informations we need for our learning, intellectually. It is not an experiential learning, but intellectual. Not until we face the problem ourself will we ever understand what is to be on the spot. We could give knowledge for the intellect, but not necessarily experiential. It is an intellectual experience. So, a person is considered whole when he she reached that state when her intellectual and physical experiences are merged into a 360 degrees circumference. It means a complete circumference or areas of existing. Many are still enjoying a wallowing in an emotional stage. And many experiences are always experiential, not intellectual. That is why so many questions originatng from this level were left unanswered. But it does not mean answers would be left unanswered. It will come, in time. Religious teachings are not enough to calm a restless mind.  Like a budding flower, the mind's learning processes are the same. ",

Humans have characteristics, so if humans write about humans, what they write describes a journey of someone from something to something. They describe the interactions of humans with their surroundings and their reflex reactions to these surroundings. Literature is bound to do that. No other options. ",

            "answer_text": "Not only are humans predatory animals, but we also prey on each other; and we are supremely good at it. My dog dreams (I can see it); but she could never, ever, hope to dream of being anywhere remotely near as good a predator as a human being. We are simply far too sophisticated in our predatory skills. For that reason, we also need to be even considerably more than equally good at defense. We all the time \"dream up\" new methods of attack, just so we can dream up new methods of defense. We call those dreams: Literature, Drama, Art.... ",
