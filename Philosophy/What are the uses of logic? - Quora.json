            "answer_text": "Which logic system: Boolean logic is the logic we most often use in electronic circuits that make up computersFuzzy logic is used to create artificial intelligent actors, and control various types of automationModal logic is used to deal with knowledge that is certain, and uncertain.Propositional logic is the logic we most often use for mathematical proofs and can be extended to other philosophical realmsParaconsistent logic is a logic used for some computers that don\u2019t require a clock to perform computations, and a fuzzy logic version is also vaguely used in neural networks for machine learningLinear logic is a logic that can be used for resource management in some software, or for signally between digital circuitsDeontic logic is the logic of obligation or ethics, which can be used to encode obligations and permissions when something happens (such as a way to look at law or requirements documents)Categorical logic is actually a means of studying various logics, but can be used in the analysis of sentence structureLambda Calculus is technically a logic for basic untyped mathematical construction, and is the basis for functional programmingType Theory is the logic used for the mathematical construction and the type-checking that compilers use to validate a functional programLinear Dependent Types are the objects created by a (variation of logics) for type-checking procedural programs, encode quantum computations, encode communication sessions, or encode permissions, turn-based games, security in cryptographic sessions, etc.Temporal Logics are logics used to validate that time-specific operations will act according to requirementsSuperstructral Reversible Logic might (future??) be used to flip back-and-forth between memory encoding (space/resource-based) and computational encoding (time-based) in a reversible way, leading to new simplifications of programs or hardware, etc.There are so many others, each with their own usage, which are usually dubbed \u201can interpretation\u201d of the logic.

            "answer_text": "The main one I\u2019d argue is to get the best answer to a problem presented when factoring in all the relative premises. Otherwise you are, by definition basing your decision on bad reasons. Even if your decision ends up being the right one it is a bad practice. This is because there are more bad decisions to be made than good ones in practice. So even if bad reasoning resulted in a correct answer one time the odds are in most it will bite you in the ass.
