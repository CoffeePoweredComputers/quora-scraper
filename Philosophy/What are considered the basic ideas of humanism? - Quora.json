            "answer_text": "Contemporary Humanist philosophy rose out of the ashes of WWI when intellectuals of various disciplines decided that the old ways of nationalism and territoriality were just too destructive.

The primary idea is the primacy of humanity and it\u2019s ability to manage it\u2019s own affairs and decide it\u2019s own fate. Religion does not play a part. Human rights are considered universal. The Manifesto is expressly against totalitarian and controlling governments and the inequitable treatment of people on any basis. ",
