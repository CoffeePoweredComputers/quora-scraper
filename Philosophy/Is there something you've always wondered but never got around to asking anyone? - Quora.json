I know that means technically is that I am an Atheist and that means I don't like or understand the concept that people have of the interpretation of who God, Jesus and Mary Magdalene is and the made up Bible and Koran etc. Who would be brave enough to ask someone whose views you trust, so I have not asked, but I like viewing my Horoscopes but don't live by them, my closest friend has been guided by a top Medium and most has come true, she also is a believer so I have an ally, I told her of my \u2018Out of body' experience and that of my late wifes, so I have my own proof.
