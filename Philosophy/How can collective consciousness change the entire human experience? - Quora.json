            "answer_text": "Every individual human being has their own unique consciousness. Consciousness develops with life experiences. It does not seem to develop very well when we are educated based on somebody else\u2019s consciousness. This is how our education system works. We only follow a very limited system of technology, science and medicine that gives us a feeling that we know all that there is. We still have rocket ships that work like giant firecrackers and arel using motor cars with wheels and petrol engines. If we had been allowed to develop in a natural way, from the 1960\u2019s, the world would be a very different one than what we are experiencing. Collective consciousness allows humans to collaborate and to work with each other for the good of the whole. In the system of corporations and elites that hold all the wealth and power, the collective consciousness of humans is fragmented by competition and striving to become an elite. A shift is happening around the planet where people are beginning to shift in consciousness. They are awakening to the reality of consciousness and it\u2019s sovereign nature. Planet earth and humanity are One. Where earth goes, we go and where we go [consciously] Earth goes [consciously]. ",

            "answer_text": "In which ever form one goes into for collecting the core or essence of its form of being and experience it through understanding as a human form , what it collects in self does not change anything in experience but status quo. It collects or gathers the same consciousness in that too or from that too. This is the ultimate key to the sense or experience of that consciousness in being , entire human experience since day one to present day , and till eternity in itself is nothing but collective change of that consciousness in being. To collect it or to gather it as that , i.e as an unalterable factor in experience through and through , the one and only way is to gather it in or on or with the form of self in being , for it can only be gathered when it collects its self for motion or action in being . The one word that is condemned in Hinduism , but is the one world answer is CHARVAK, CHAR - motion /behavior /conduct VAK- humming /murmuring, its through its humming motion it moves , for without making a sound nothing can move , whether one is there to hear it or not.
