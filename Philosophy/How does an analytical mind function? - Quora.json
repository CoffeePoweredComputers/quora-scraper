            "answer_text": "An analytical mind has a natural tendency to fixate on things, swiftly breaking broader ideas down into their fundamental ones, allowing one to consider how said ideas relates to other ideas, and how one idea may be influenced by another-its a mental lab, floating on some plane of consciousness, allowing you to examine the idea within a vacuum or in the presence of other variables-allowing you to pragmatically consider how the idea behaves. Its an important framework to develop, and can be developed if the right conditions are set upon its creation (the right questions). ",

They will generate two options but cannot settle on either of them. To find the reason which is not real is analysis. Staying away from such minds will give peace to one. ",
