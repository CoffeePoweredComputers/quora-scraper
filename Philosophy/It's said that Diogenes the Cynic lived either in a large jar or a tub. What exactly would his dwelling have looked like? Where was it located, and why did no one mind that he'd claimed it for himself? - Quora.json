            "answer_text": "The pithos was located in the marketplace of Athens. It was abandoned, hence why nobody objected to Diogenes claiming it for his own. As for what it looked like, it would have been plain looking. Since Diogenes gave up using a cup after seeing a boy drink out of cupped hands, Diogenes would not have seen the need to take residence in a decorated pithos. I suppose it could be the equivalent of a modern-day homeless person taking shelter in a large cardboard box. ",
