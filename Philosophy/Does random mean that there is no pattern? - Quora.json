            "answer_text": "No; in fact, the whole of probability may be described as trying to identify the underlying pattern in random values. Roughly speaking, when a mathematician says something is random, they mean that it is effectively unpredictable. Thus, whether a coin lands \u201cheads\u201d or \u201ctails\u201d is completely determined by the laws of physics\u2026but in practice, we can\u2019t measure the relevant factors accurately enough (and quickly enough) to predict the outcome. This highlights another important fact: mathematically, random does not mean reasonless. There is a reason why the coin landed heads; what makes it random is the unpredictability of how it\u2019s going to land. Now here\u2019s the punchline\u2026because random means unpredictable and not reasonless, the laws of probability apply to human behavior. Thus, the outcome of elections is random, because we cannot predict what will happen. (And think about it: There are countries where election outcomes are not random\u2026because the winner was already decided by the Central Committee. In a democracy, the outcome of an election is random, and we want it to be random) The role of probability is quantifying that randomness (it\u2019s what Nate Silver is known for doing). ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all, lots of people are precisely trying to find patterns in phenomena that are (at least partially) random.  So what is random? It means that repeating the exact same process that led to the random value/phenomenon won't always give the same answer. An example maybe? I'm taking the tramway every morning, without checking when it is supposed to come, but I know one comes every ten minutes. Let's assume I have a decent transport system and that there are no late arrivals. My waiting time will be random (because I repeat the same experiment every morning, getting to the tram stop and wait for the next one) but my waiting time varies. Does is mean that there are no patterns? Nope, there is a specific distribution here: my waiting time is limited to the [0,5] interval. You could call that a pattern. Another one with a more compelling pattern: size of people vs their weight. There is obviously a pattern here (more height on average means more weight too). But is it random? Pick a bunch of people with the same height, they won't all have the same weight, so even with the same experimental conditions (picking people with a given height), weight varies a lot. Therefore you're looking at a random phenomenon, but with a clear pattern. ",

            "answer_text": "Randomness:Lacking any definite plan or order or purpose; governed by or depending on chance But question is definite plan of what level? Order of What Degree? , Purpose of what extent? There are multiple layers of plan , predictability and purpose.Every system has some hideousnessbut we can think deep into it and we can know it. Critical Faiths say that god hides every secretes from human being and he controls universe and human should not try to understand gods rules.This is God fearing faith. There is another point of view also existing in world , that is God loving point of view.People in this group feels , god is playing chess himself and chuckling at human being and saying \"lets check your intelligence? child , lets play another round , lets check your ability to probe into the system and understand the rules there until human can find the exact rules of game , everything looks random whereas when you know the rules thing become deterministic.Now question is how much are we putting effort looking into the randomness , staring through the random behavior with probing mind , concentrating to it , enlightening the values with different point of views is the System finding within the randomness. better example can give better light on this suppose there is a series of numbers 1 3 5 7 ... you will call that these are in AP series and not random if we hide the pattern in second which looks it is random but if we see the formula behind(Simulation) then we will understand that it is a series well defined   This is the difference about Randomness and the pattern research.More you probe , more you will find that some hidden system is working inside it Hope for the best that someday we will learn everything about everything ",
