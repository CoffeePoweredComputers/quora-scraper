            "answer_text": "C'mon! Why so difficult?  You sit on the couch with your aunt and she pours some tea in a cup and passes it to you. What's your job, your task? Most likely she did not give it to look at it, didn't she?  Well, in case you did not notice, she gave it to you to drink it, to use it. And isn't that exactly the way to empty the cup?  You sit in a class with Bruce Lee as teacher and he shows you all kind of moves. You go home, you've seen them all. You know them, right? The next class he asks you to come forward: do you know the moves? Sure you do, you've seen them right? And you find yourself on the mat, time after time. So you start to make the movements. To learn them by heart, you can make them without movement. And Bruce Lee cannot floor you any more, at least not with his original movements. He pulls a trick and you are floored again. Yet now you know the movements you can detach from them, break the rules. You combine, find out other movements, different combinations. And after a while Bruce Lee cannot floor you any more. It's in this stage that we really empty the cup, we see the usefulness and lack of usefulness of what we learned. We create something new based on what we learned. We surpass what we've learned, our experience is now our main teacher. And once we understand that we learned from experience only, right from the start, we will allow experience to be our only teacher. Since experience is ever changing, our learning is ever changing, we are eternal students. Our cup will never be full nor will it ever be empty.  This in brief is the concept of Shuhari   You sit with your aunt, talking. You pick up the cup once more. Bring it to your mouth, your lips touch it and you shake, it's extremely hot. You drop the cup, it breaks. Now the cup is forever empty.  The next time your aunt brings a cup of tea you know two things: The cup will break again, we cannot prevent this from happening. And when you do not handle it with great care you can burn yourself. You then take care of the cup, knowing it's breakable nature. And you take care of yourself, knowing that hot tea will burn you. You are wise in both ways. Drink tea, don't burn yourself and don't break the cup. This is how you empty the cup. ",

            "answer_text": "Don't talk. Just listen. Don't think. Just focus. Don't respond. Just react. That's how Bruce Lee empties his cup. When we talk, or think, or attempt to thoughtfully respond, our minds are not listening, they are not focused, and they are not reacting. They are paused while generating output based on the state they are already in. Which is fine. Output is important. But pausing is suicide in martial arts. I am completely oblivious of my surroundings right now as I write this. I am defenseless. I may well be sleeping. We see people with full cups all the time. Some less full, some over-spilling, some careful, some reckless... Some will have just water, some maybe gold. But it isn't so much what's in the cup that is valuable when it comes to the aura of one's presence or the power of one's sheer existence. What determines capacity? What determines potential output?  It's the cup. We see Bruce Lee and we see a cup. Bruce does not need to show us anything or prove anything. He does not need to speak. How much time do most of us waste on these things? He need not show us what's inside his cup. In fact, if anything, at any given moment his cup is empty. And the moment anything fills it, the cup absorbs it, making it harder, better, faster, stronger. Then it's empty again. An empty cup is free, ready for anything, and spills nothing. But to others, it could contain anything. Until we know, we must assume it contains everything. That is the aura of Bruce Lee. It's what you don't know that will kill you -- and protect him. Filling cups is easy. Instead, we must work on the cup itself, and for this there truly is only one way... Practice. Don't talk, don't think, and don't respond. Disappear and practice until your bones bleed. Wait for them to heal, dress nice, then show up. The Bruce Lee's of the world just show up. They are the true forces of nature, and of humanity.  For more on how Bruce Lee practiced, here is a start. ",

            "answer_text": "To begin with a beautiful story! One day an important man, a man used to command and obedience came to visit the master. \u201cI have come today to ask you to teach me about Zen. Open my mind to enlightenment.\u201d The tone of the important man\u2019s voice was one used to getting his own way. The Zen master smiled and said that they should discuss the matter over a cup of tea. When the tea was served the master poured his visitor a cup. He poured and he poured and the tea rose to the rim and began to spill over the table and finally onto the robes of the wealthy man. Finally the visitor shouted, \u201cEnough. You are spilling the tea all over. Can\u2019t you see the cup is full?\u201d The master stopped pouring and smiled at his guest. \u201cYou are like this tea cup, so full that nothing more can be added. Come back to me when the cup is empty. Come back to me with an empty mind.\u201d  It is a great reminder that in order to learn we have to be humble, to empty our mind and make room for the new. Also that leads us to \u201cLet Go\u201d or to learn \u201cHow to let go\u201d. We are so busy brimming our lives with stuff and matter that we do not reflect back at it. We are busy chasing a dream rarely looking back to check how much we have actually progressed. Time and again we get frustrated and shred all the energy and feel hopeless and look for ways to get motivated instead of finding a \u201cWHY\u201d for our goals. Which is also why we often seek to find shortcuts. But as a rule of this world there are no shortcuts. \u201cDreams and freedom are the same. In order for them to be, they come with a price\u201d If we learn to let go of worries, grudges,hate,revenge,gossips it may do wonders to our lives. But that is the irony. We have reached to moon and back but we hardly learnt to manage our emotions. This sophisticated System of Life and emotions. Especially when counselling girls this thing often comes up. They go back to their past and its astonishing to discover that they still hold onto such demeaning and horrific memories so strongly that it alters their behavior and responses in present life(or moment). Clear examples were like #metoo where you could see emotional flooding of sadness and pains . Wounds as old as 50 years maybe.!!! We strongly know to defend our Religions, speak as if all the truth is known. Thump our chests with pride to belong to one caste ,community , religion ,sect, sub-sect and the list goes on..We blame everything on politicians. Fight for Allah-Vishnu all throughout the day. But sadly cannot spent an hour in solace. (WHY?). Our own company is not suitable for our own selves. On one hand we want peace on the other we take it away. All such things exhaust us and inhibit our growth in all the fields drastically. Hence. Let go of the Garb. Let It Go. As the question how to empty the cup? 1- Learn to spend some time in Silence Everyday. 2-Learn to meditate. 3- Learn Spiritual Techniques.Make spirituality your life. 4-Learn to Respond not React. But the best one is to stop all such things that bring crap into your life. Figure out the sources and close the. EMPTY YOUR CUP FIRST. ",

            "answer_text": "In order to learn one requires humility; because learning implies ignorance which learning seeks to dispel. But people are so full of themselves i.e. they are dogmatic, stubborn, presumptuous and immodest and unrealistic about their own abilities that they need to unlearn many things in order to learn. Learning requires receptivity - adjusting - evaluating - correcting your beliefs in light of new facts and dogmatism prevents this kind of receptivity to take root. Besides what is learned also should become part of oneself; so that it is not just theoretical knowledge but integrated with practice. Such integration also requires pliability and past habits can prevent it. Thus emptying the cup primarily signifies adaptability like water which is formless but adapts itself in accordance with the terrain. Thus one needs to get rid of any factor which prohibits this adaptability which is what is implied by emptying your cup; because only that which is empty can become full. ",

An example of this is in a zen koan (stories alluding to enlightenment in the Zen Buddhist tradition): Nan-in, a famous Japanese Zen master, received a visitor one day who claimed he was eager to learn about buddhism. The man was a professor and he seemed to be skeptical about what Zen was. Nan-In poured him a cup of tea, but he kept pouring it till it could no longer hold and was overflowing. The professor could not take it any longer and asked Nan-in, \"the cup is full why do you keep pouring it?\" To which Nan-in replied, \"like this cup, your mind is full of your own opinions and notions, if you're not to empty your cup how then can i show you Zen\"  ",

            "answer_text": "This question can be answered in a number of different ways. From the physical/martial arts level, this could be seen to correlate to what in western terms would be called Flow (psychology) . In this state, the participant is trained to let go of conscious mind to allow the subconscious to direct the activity. A scene from the movie The Last Samurai shows this type of experience.  On a more sedate level, various forms of practice can help one to empty conceptual mind of movements. Meditation, tai chi and hatha yoga provide commonly known examples. Open monitoring meditation or awareness watching awareness familiarizes one with an \"open cup\" experience. Pete Ashly's post in Petes Bookmarks  On the intellectual level, practices can help one to see the false truth of the duality of language constructs and the social construction of reality. Socrates explored this mindspace with Dialectic where no real satisfying answers were generally found, but more the substance of language mindstuff went round and round. The opposite of a profound truth is another profound truth. One might think of a goal here as to be detached from \"your truth\" to the extent you can allow for mystery to take a greater share and someone else truth to carry equal weight. Or perhaps the goal might be to rely on intuition directly. Huang Po's  Aa sudden flash which destroys conceptual mind\".  Pete Ashly's answer to Are you spiritually awakened? From the ultimate level, this corresponds to the \"big E\" of enlightenment. When the \"bottom falls out of the bucket\", likely the tea, the cup and the whole table will be emptied. One taste of that might be found here: How can I destroy my ego (self)?  Now, is this author's cup empty?  :-) ",

In accepting a spiritual teacher, you don\u2019t brag about your previous learning, you discard all that you have learned and be tabula rasa - a clean slate (mind). No preconceived notions, no speculations, no assumptions. This is called descending process of getting knowledge as opposed to ascending knowledge. You accept the spiritual knowledge (not blindly) being handed down to you. Ascending knowledge is using your imperfect and limited senses, mind and intelligence - empirical process to know the truth. Combined with that is the tendency to commit mistakes; be in illusion/delusion and cheat others and oneself. The bonafide spiritual teacher has heard his knowledge from his spiritual teacher, too, and so on and so forth, from a long line of unbroken lineage ( disciplic succession.) In descending process, speculation, opinion, ideas, assumption has no place in learning Everything is accepted and realized through practical application. ",

            "answer_text": "If you try to do it using this or that deliberate technique, you will find it difficult. But if you practice Transcendental Meditation, emptying happens automatically. TM works in two strokes that happen effortlessly, without anyone trying to make them happen. In one stroke it is automatically awakening new areas of the mind, and on the second stroke it is removing old stresses, blockages, and interferences so that one\u2019s \u201ccup\u201d gets emptied automatically. This the great joy of TM, that day after day, meditation after meditation, we are ever transcending (going beyond) the old to the new. But many people\u2019s cup is so full of other beliefs that they have no room inside themselves to hear that this is something uniquely different, not a competition per se, to anyone\u2019s philosophies and beliefs, but a tool to fulfill it. Other people are so stuck on the philosophies (the finger) that they can\u2019t see see the realities (the moon).

            "answer_text": "Most of the stuff I've read has been western, but I have a passing interest in Zen Buddhism, and koans of the sort you have mentioned are mainly from that school. As I understand Zen Buddhism, the idea is that, rather than accepting a bunch of scriptures and doctrines and stuff, you're supposed to meditate a lot with an experienced teacher, and get insight into things that way. It's sort of like learning to ride a bike: you can read all the books on bike-riding that you want, but a single hour spent trying to ride a thing with a good instructor at your side is worth a hundred hours of reading about it. For Zen Buddhists, the best way to achieve meditative attainments is to meditate, just like the best way to learn how to ride a bicycle is to go ride a damn bike. So, if I had to guess, I think that the \"empty your cup\" thing would be best interpreted as \"stop theorizing, forget everything you've 'learned,' and just do it.\" ",

            "answer_text": "It is clear that in this koan the cup is a metaphor for our minds. It is clear in Buddhist teaching that we are to empty our minds of attachments in order to deal with suffering. So far, so good. We have no problem learning what this koan is about. The hard part is how to do it. This is the method of meditation. We sit, and thoughts come into our minds. We make sure not to become attached to those thoughts, either to hold onto them or to reject them. Then they pass away and others take their place, and so on. After years of rigorous religious training, Siddhartha Gautama, the Bodhisattva, returned to the koan of suffering that he had begun with, and passed through it to become Shakyamuni Buddha, the Tathagata, in a state of nibbana/nirvana, of non-attachment, also described as Anuttara Samyak Sambodhi, Unexcelled Supreme Enlightenment. He then continued this training for the rest of his life. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to do so for the rest of your life, too. Take the Bodhisattva vow, pass on through, and keep going. ",

There is a popular idea that if we need to go to the next step, we have to first learn how to what we have learnt. If we have experience of flying a plane for example, we may laugh at the speed of bike, and ignore the potential of bike. If we get rid of this mentality, we may find something that benefits not only for biking but also flying.  ",
