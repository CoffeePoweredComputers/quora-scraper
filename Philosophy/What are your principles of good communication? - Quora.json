            "answer_text": "Approved by the National Communication Association Legislative Council, 1999 Questions of right and wrong arise whenever people communicate. Ethical communication is fundamental to responsible thinking, decision making, and the development of relationships and communities within and across contexts, cultures, channels, and media. Moreover, ethical communication enhances human worth and dignity by fostering truthfulness, fairness, responsibility, personal integrity, and respect for self and others. We believe that unethical communication threatens the quality of all communication and consequently the well-being of individuals and the society in which we live. Therefore we, the members of the National Communication Association, endorse and are committed to practising the following principles of ethical communication: We advocate truthfulness, accuracy, honesty, and reason as essential to the integrity of communication.We endorse freedom of expression, diversity of perspective, and tolerance of dissent to achieve the informed and responsible decision making fundamental to a civil society.We strive to understand and respect other communicators before evaluating and responding to their messages.We promote access to communication resources and opportunities as necessary to fulfil human potential and contribute to the well-being of families, communities, and society.We promote communication climates of caring and mutual understanding that respect the unique needs and characteristics of individual communicators.We condemn communication that degrades individuals and humanity through distortion, intimidation, coercion, and violence, and through the expression of intolerance and hatred.We are committed to the courageous expression of personal convictions in pursuit of fairness and justice.We advocate sharing information, opinions, and feelings when facing significant choices while also respecting privacy and confidentiality.We accept responsibility for the short- and long-term consequences for our own communication and expect the same of others.",

            "answer_text": "1. Clarity : Good communication never \u201chappens\u201d. It does not take place off hand or random Rather it is the result of advance thinking and careful planning. The principle of clarity, implies both clarity of thought and clarity of expressions.2. Completeness : Every communication must be complete and adequate. Incomplete message keeps the receiver guessing, create misunderstanding and delay actions. Every person should therefore, be provided with all the required facts and figures. 3. Conciseness : Brevity is the soul of good communication. Therefore, we should use only relevant details in our message. Ruskin says, \u201csay all you have to say in the fewest possible Words: 4. Consideration : In order to communicate effectively, think and look from the receiver\u2019s angle.The sender should accept a human approach and understand the emotions and sentiments of the receiver. He should understand and focus on the need of the receiver. 5. Correctness : You should not transmit any message unless you are absolutely convinced of its accuracy and authenticity. If employees forward incorrect information to managers then decisions based on such information may be wrong. Similarly, transmission of incorrect information to outsiders may spoil relations and reputation. 6. Courtesy : Courtesy means a friendly and helpful behaviour towards other. Polite manners facilitate communication. Politeness encourage participative communication. 7. Attentiveness : While sending and receiving a message, you must pay full attention. While transmitting, attention is necessary to ensure that all the relevant details are included in correct and clear manner. 8. Objectivity : The communicator should be fully impartial while sending a message. He should not allow his emotions, attitudes or bias to distort the message. He should communicate unpleasant facts in such a way that the feelings of the receiver are not hurt. 9. Use Grapevine Strategically : According to this principle, informal channels of communication should be used judiciously to supplement the official channel information communication or grapevine can be fruitfully utilised particularly. 10. Feedback : Feedback should be used carefully in planning and executing communication, Where feedback is not automatically available, the sender should ask questions, request, reply etc, 11. Careful Use of Body Language : In face-to-face oral communication, body language should be used to reinforce words. Proper posture, right eye contact and appropriate facial expressions help to make communication effective. Positive body language requires positive feelings. 12. Elimination of Noise : Noise is the greatest barrier of communication. Every possible effort must be made to eliminate noise caused by machine, equipment, communicator devices etc. BBA 2nd Semester Elements of Model Business Communication Notes ",
