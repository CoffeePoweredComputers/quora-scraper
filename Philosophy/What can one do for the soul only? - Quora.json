            "answer_text": "The only thing we\u2019ve got to do is purify it. There are many ways like serving the needy and poor et cetera. The body and the soul are intermittently connected. Some times we feel and sometimes we don\u2019t. No one knows where it comes from when we are born and where it goes when we are dead. But during the life time this soul make lives meaningful. If there is one thing that cannot be replicated with technology, it is the soul. Such is the diversity of it. It differs from every single organism with another. What a beauty! Have we understood the purpose of it? Only few really understand this before dying. Some try and fail. Most of us don\u2019t even care. I guess I personally stand in the second option. What are we doing with it in the lifetime? We try to find the meaning for it. But is it necessary to find meaning or should we just live with it? This is one tough question and very difficult to foresee and find. What can we do? We can purify. We all do good things and bad things. Good things makes the soul happy in turn the life. Bad things serve no purpose yet we can\u2019t avoid. Should we do more good things to compensate our bad deeds? Would it help cleanse our soul? That\u2019s more childish and a more inappropriate question. Purification isn\u2019t equating good and bad deeds and finding the resultant vector. It is about leaving this worldly pleasures and finding the inner peace. This process of finding inner peace can in turn help us spread love and harmony. This can dissolve hatred and anger. This sounds even more wonderful, isn\u2019t it? I guess this is what they call the purification. Hope I made some sense. Thanks. ",

            "answer_text": "The Soul is bound in a mortal cage, cosmic prison of Almighty God. Therefore all on these cosmic plane are slave or servent of God or Allah Key Bhande. To attain freedom and escape, one has to seek, surrender, serve a Knower of Truth- Satguru ( BG4.34), who does not worship God. He comes with the spiritual power- Satya Naam, that can empower the Soul to return to its eternal abode- Amarlok (BG8.20-21) . It is Indians exclusive privilege, because Satguru appears in India. ",
