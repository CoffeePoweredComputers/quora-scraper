            "answer_text": "The question doesn\u2019t make sense. Moral relativism isn\u2019t a set of values that needs to be assessed on it\u2019s merits. Moral relativism isn\u2019t another moral system. Many people misunderstand the implications of morality being relative - including a few people who call themselves moral relativists. Moral relativism is a meta-ethical theory about morality, based on two observations. There are myriad moral systems held by cultures, religions and ideologies across the world and through history. Many of them are completely contradictory to one another. Human sacrifice was at least sometimes a good thing in the Mayan civilization. It is considered abhorrent across the world in modern times. Many or even most of these moral systems are held by their adherents to be uniquely correct, sometimes seeming to give their possessors a unique position to judge or even conquer their opponents.There is no consensus about which set of morals it is that is objectively true or even a consensus about how to move towards such a conclusion. It\u2019s not possible to justify a set of morals without assuming the correctness of the values upon which it is based. There is no independent point of view outside of ideology from which to determine which moral system (if any) is the correct one. They can\u2019t all be true if they contradict one another.This leads to the theory that moral statements, like similar value judgments are not objective facts about the properties of the world but are systems of human value judgment. Moral statements can be true or false, but they can only be said to be true or false relative to a given set of values. This doesn\u2019t mean that morality is meaningless or pointless or subjective. Moral relativism doesn\u2019t tell us what to value or what to do. It does however undermine moral objectivism and moral subjectivism, and for those whose actions are based on those beliefs, relativism may modify their behaviour. ",

            "answer_text": "The biggest positive that I can think of, for moral relativism, is that morals are technically and factually relative to context. Without knowing the context in which something hapoened, there's no way to determine it's moral value. Morals are inherently measurements of relative context. Not possible to exist as absolutes. ",
