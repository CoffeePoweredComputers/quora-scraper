            "answer_text": "Some recognized conditions can impair one\u2019s ability to maintain consistent opinions about most things. People may claim to not have an opinion rather than risk being perceived as lying later when the reality is that they just don\u2019t care. Borderline personality disorder is one that can have this effect. Sufferers with BPD tend to have a core self-view that is distorted, and frequently it leads to emotional chameleon-like behaviors as well as polarized thinking. Emotional chameleon behavior would react differently depending on the environment they are in. Their stated opinions at work will be different than their opinions at home. Opinions at school, on a date, or in a room full of complete strangers are likely to also all be different. The answers in such situations are about best getting along socially with everyone and less about true feelings. This would be done from an instinctual survival motivation and would NOT be about being devious or intentionally manipulative. Polarized thinking just means that in their mind people and some entities or things (all with some level of emotional attachment) will be viewed as either \u201call good\u201d or \u201call bad\u201d. There are either few or no gray areas, unless of course the subject has no emotional attachment. This can include their self-view, so people with the disorder will often project self-confidence or be very hard on themselves without any in-between states of being. EXAMPLE: For those of us suffering with borderline personality disorder open-ended opinion questions may have no easy answers. Things like password reset questions like \u201cwhats your favorite\u2026..\u201d can be extremely frustrating for us because we know it is likely that any answer we give to such question will inevitably change. It is possible to successfully lock on to consistent feelings, but in order to do so multiple qualifiers must be used to make a question more narrowly focused (we may need a question to be \u201cmultiple choice\u201d instead of \u201cfill in the blank\u201d).

            "answer_text": "It is neither better nor worse; it is impossible. It is like asking what kind of singer one would be if that person never uttered any sound, ever. It can not be. And so we must ask ourself if it\u2019s opinions that are bad, such that their absence be the better state or our erstwhile inability to articulate them, or despite all still feel pained when our opinions are attacked. That is not to say that having opinions that defy ones ability to speak them be our command of language still nascent (it always is) or that certain opinions are of a profoundness in excess of of our ability to form them with the solidity of words. What is bad is turning against Opinion; especially when that opinionation [sic] is yours. Voice your opinion respectfully even when you risk it getting squashed; it\u2019s the only way it grows in clarity and refinement, and your ability to articulate it stronger. Be patient with others, most especially when you think every bit of you is certain that they\u2019re beyond hope. Give opinion a chance. Because if you, or someone else, doesn\u2019t and quashes their opinion it hurts you, sure, but also robs everyone else from possible engagement, and leaves the world bereft of a voice that might have been the very difference that making a difference had been awaiting. \u201cWovon Mann nicht sprechen kan, dar\u00fcber mu\u00df Mann schweigen\u201d \u201cWhereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent\u201d Tractatus Logico Philosophicus (the most beautiful book ever written, *in my opinion*, and heartbreakingly so) by L. Wittgenstein ",
