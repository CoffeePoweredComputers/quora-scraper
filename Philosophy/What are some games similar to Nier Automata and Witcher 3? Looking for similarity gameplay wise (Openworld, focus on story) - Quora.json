I haven't played all of this, but in my opinion these are them : Hellblade : Senua\u2019s sacrifice (2017 RPG adventure game)Atmostpheric, Psychological, Female Protagonist  Save 50% on Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice on Steam A psychological one, a mind blowing twist at the end, Highly recommended, but never find any review before playing it, because it really will spoil the game. Life is strange (2015 RPG game)Story rich, Choices Matter, Great Soundtrack  Life is Strange - Episode 1 on Steam A psychological drama, full of choices and consequences, proceed with cautions. The Last of Us I haven\u2019t played this one but have read a lot about it. God of War IV Surely this GOTY won for its story wasn\u2019t it ? Hope this helps \u201c[^====^]\u201d ",
