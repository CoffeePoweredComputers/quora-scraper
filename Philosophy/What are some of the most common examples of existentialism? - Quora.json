            "answer_text": "What are some of the most common examples of existentialism? I am not up-to-speed on all the varying definitions of \u2018\u2019existentialism\u2019\u2019, and I certainly don\u2019t \u2018\u2019get\u2019\u2019 the ones that seem negative. My existentialism is to strive to live in the revelatory, nirvanic, aha experience of comprehension which is a direct consequence of attempting to access the \u2018\u2019genius\u2019\u2019 capabilities of the intelligence I received at the moment of my creation, just like every man and woman on the face of the planet. Some choose to do so, and are deemed \u2018\u2019geniuses\u2019\u2019 by the cultural perception , most choose not to, and sometimes the reasons are quite bizarre, and are deemed \u2018\u2019stupid to average\u2019\u2019 by the cultural perception. Here is the main point, people who pursue their \u2018\u2019genius\u2019\u2019 capabilities are pursuing happier-ness as well. Some individuals pursue happier-ness to the point that they don\u2019t understand what is happening, they don\u2019t understand how their intelligence is processing beyond their typically \u2018\u2019genius capable\u2019\u2019 thinking, and are then deemed \u2018\u2019crazy geniuses, or just crazy\u2019\u2019 by the cultural perception.  Others, and they are a few but growing number, grasp that the experience that happens when you access \u2018\u2019beyond genius capability\u2019\u2019 intelligence sounds something like this: I had an aha experience so intense that I lost all track of the human concept of time; I was so infused with a nirvanic, revelatory feeling of bliss that I knew I could die in that moment and it would be wonderful rather than a tragedy; in that experience I knew that life is everlasting, just not this one life; in that timeless instant, I knew I was in a Now moment of timeless being as profound as any human conceptualization that has ever been verbalized or written; an experience of such incredible lucidity, such clarity, that it elucidated the Truth to me in a way that almost transcends all capabilities at explanation, but I\u2019m going to attempt to do so, anyway. I have had longer, more intense aha experiences than the one described more frequently since that first realization. Mind Orgasms, I have called them.  That day was approximately October 18, 2013. The experience was triggered when I seemingly simultaneously saw; ... that Parmenides was correct that humankind can know Truth from untruth, \u2026 that what Kant wrote regarding Enlightenment, without being guided by another, is a description of the process by which an individual accesses the Truth, ... that Einstein\u2019s cosmic religious experience is a cogent and detailed description of the cornucopia of all possibilities available when Truth is accessed, ...and my aha moment when I realized that all Truth is as accessible to any individual, any man or woman, as his or her free will ability to choose can take them, as they go seeking Truth for themselves. An eternity of the human concept of time later, (well, at least in my mind), I concluded that that was my Big Moment. Oh, so i thought i better write about it, and so i am (I looked up at the monitor and noticed all 3 lower-case i\u2019s, which one must conclude says something about me, don\u2019t you think?... but what, exactly?...) Einstein called the phenomenon the \u2018\u2019Cosmic Religious Experience\u2019\u2019, I call it the \u2018\u2019Whole Truth\u2019\u2019. He wrote: \u2018\u2019...there is found a third level of religious experience, even if it is seldom found in a pure form. I will call it the cosmic religious sense. This is hard to make clear to those who do not experience it, since it does not involve an anthropomorphic idea of god; the individual feels the vanity of human desires and aims, and the nobility and marvelous order which are revealed in nature and in the world of thought. He feels the individual destiny as an imprisonment and seeks to experience the totality of existence as a unity full of significance... The religious geniuses of all times have been distinguished by this cosmic religious sense, which recognizes neither dogmas nor god made in man's image. Consequently there cannot be a church whose chief doctrines are based on the cosmic religious experience. It comes about, therefore, that we find precisely among the heretics of all ages men who were inspired by this highest religious experience; often they appeared to their contemporaries as atheists, but sometimes also as saints...\u2019\u2019  Albert Einstein,  Religion and Science (1930)  Originally written for the New York Times Magazine (9 November 1930)  When one understands every word of this (moderately abbreviated) quote, one comes to understand the \u2018\u2019essence\u2019\u2019, the \u2018\u2019feeling\u2019\u2019, of the experience of which he speaks. The cosmic religious experience completely encompasses and expands the merely human concepts of a god or gods, spirituality, mysticism, magic, miracle, and a supernatural anything, into the Cornucopia of All Possibilities, thereby dissolving those heretofore mentioned human concepts into insignificance within the \u2018\u2019Wholistic Perspective\u2019\u2019 , within the \u2018\u2019Wholistic Feeling\u2019\u2019, gained by coming to understand the cosmic religious experience. ''It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory, [not just scientific theory] is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.''  Albert Einstein,  The Herbert Spencer Lecture, delivered at Oxford (10 June 1933) When one comes to the aha moment of understanding that the cosmic religious experience is the Einstein's Razor regarding the religio-philosophical realm, then all other human concepts, by all the \u2018\u2019wise men and women\u2019\u2019, all the \u2018\u2019sages\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019seers\u2019\u2019, throughout all of human history, become but incomplete, or misinformed, or misunderstood, attempts to elucidate the cosmic religious experience for the benefit of humankind.  ''...there are moments when one feels free from one's own identification with human limitations and inadequacies. At such moments, one imagines that one stands on some spot of a small planet, gazing in amazement at the cold yet profoundly moving beauty of the eternal, the unfathomable: life and death flow into one, and there is neither evolution nor destiny; only being.''   Albert Einstein,  Letter to Queen Mother Elisabeth of Belgium (9 January 1939) Einstein succinctly attempts to explain that the cornucopia of all possibilities accessible within the cosmic religious experience is BEING, is to BE in the NOW moment. These NOW moments are called \u2018\u2019aha experiences\u2019\u2019 of knowing, of understanding. Experience happier-ness by BEING.  Now isn't that what life is all about?. ",

            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s a story I wrote, a conversation, about a pebble that explains the difference between existentialism and conventionalism. ============================== Here's two pebbles. How are they different? (Well one is rounder, or heavier, or darker... etc.) I agree. Now tell me which one is 'pebblier' (What?) Which one is more of a pebble than the other? (?\u2026Well they're both pebbles. They can't be any more or less of a pebble!) I agree! So in some ways they're different - maybe one is rounder - and in another way they\u2019re equal \u2026 they\u2019re both 100% pebbles. They\u2019re not the same yet they\u2019re both exactly pebbles \u2026 they\u2019re not forks, they\u2019re pebbles (or stones) and can't be anything other than pebbles (or stones). (yep) I\u2019d like to reintroduce a word you already know ... \u201cconvention\u201d. A convention is quality we can measure ... how heavy, color, smoother, whatever you like. (yep) But the pebble is just a pebble ,,, unless of course we compare it to another pebble then one might be a heavier pebble, smoother pebble, etc. In other words, we can actually choose to see (that is, understand or perceive) the pebble ONLY as a pebble... because we know it's not a brick or a nail. (maybe) The pebble is a pebble. It's not a brick. (yes, duh) Another word for \"is\" (a pebble) is \"exist\". The pebble is a pebble. The pebble exists as a pebble. Those two statements mean the same thing. (So what... get to it...please!) When we measure something compared to something else it's a \u201cconventional\u201d measure. To say a pebble is rounder means comparing it to another pebble. But... everything \u201cis\u201d what it is *before* we conventionally compare it, \u2018judge\u2019 it, against other things. Something has to exist before it can be compared to something else. And that existence of the something, by itself, compared to nothing else, is it\u2019s \u201cexistential\u201d existence. When we refer to something 'existentially' ... note the 'exist' in there \u2026 we're talking about the thing itself *without* comparing it to something else. (So?!?!) So existentially \u2026 everything is exactly what it\u2019s supposed to be. A pebble is exactly a pebble. That means everything is, existentially, 'perfect\u2019. If something is exactly what it is then there\u2019s no (conventional) flaw about it. It\u2019s perfect. (That\u2019s nuts. Wouldn\u2019t you rather have a diamond than a pebble?) YEP! I\u2019d rather have a diamond than a pebble! The diamond is worth *conventionally* more. But the pebble is, existentially, as perfect as the diamond. The pebble is a perfect pebble ... 100%. The diamond is a perfect diamond... 100%. (Well I just want the diamond. I'd never existentially want the pebble.) Then here's a question. Is Magic Johnson better than you? (What do you mean better?) Well that's exactly the point. In some ways he's not better than you. You\u2019re both people and you both deserve the same respect and basic rights that everyone deserves. Existentially, you and Magic and everyone else have equal value. On the other hand he's got more money, power and even a Starbucks. Conventionally, Magic Johnson is better than you (and I) in some ways. But maybe you're conventionally better at some things. Archery? Pebble collecting? (I get it but so what.) Well there's both personal and social ramifications to deciding whether to existentially or conventionally judge the value of something. On the one hand everyone has doubts \u2026 about themselves, about situations, whatever. That\u2019s normal, people want to be better at making money, having relationships, whatever. But! \u2026 they also want to be feel accepted ... just because they are who they are. Existentially \u2026 they want to have the same respect and fair treatment they feel everyone deserves. And when they feel the world doesn't respect them they suffer ... people regularly think \"I am not good enough because the world doesn't treat me a particular way.\" A big point here is that *human suffering comes from conventional measures*. When a person thinks some version of \"I'm not good enough.\" it's a conventional measure. But if one chooses to not do that and thinks \"I am ok just because I am. I\u2019m not supposed to be anyone else. I understand I may have to take conventional actions to get what I need, but me, to me, only about me, is existentially perfect and need not suffer.\" ",
