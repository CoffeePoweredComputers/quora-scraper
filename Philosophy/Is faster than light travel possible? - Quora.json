            "answer_text": "I hope not. My reasoning is strange but compelling: if humans can travel faster than light, it will demonstrate that free will does not exist. That discovery would sadden me. The logic is described in detail in my recently published Now\u2014The Physics of Time. I explain it in a new paradox I invented called \u201cthe tachyon murder\u201d. (This is a paradox that I invented when teaching relativity theory at UC Berkeley.) Here is the section from my book in which I describe the tachyon murder: \u2014\u2014-beginning of excerpt from Now: The Physics of Time\u2014\u2014- Tachyon Murder The strange relativity result that the order of events can flip for different reference frames leads us into a new aspect of reality: the deep issues of causality and free will. These issues can be dramatized by the story of the tachyon murder. A tachyon is a hypothetical particle that travels faster than the speed of light. Remarkably, relativity does not prohibit particles from traveling that fast. It says only that massless particles must travel at lightspeed, and that particles that have a real rest mass cannot travel at that speed (since the gamma factor would be infinite, and they would have infinite energy). The equations don\u2019t prohibit faster-than-light travel per se\u2026. Yet despite the upside of [discovering a tachyon], I decided many years ago not to bother searching for a tachyon. My reason borders on the religious. I believe that I have free will, and the existence of tachyons would violate that belief. Let me explain. Imagine that Mary is standing 40 feet away from John. She has a tachyon gun that fires tachyon bullets that move at 4c, four times the speed of light. She fires. Light moves at a speed of 1 foot per nanosecond (billionth of a second), so her tachyons move at 4 feet per nanosecond. In just 10 nanoseconds, the tachyon bullet enters John\u2019s heart and kills him. Let\u2019s assume he dies instantly. Mary is brought to trial. She doesn\u2019t deny any of the facts I just described, but she insists on an unusual change of venue. She says she has a right to argue the case in whatever reference frame she chooses. They are all valid, the judge knows, so he allows her to proceed. She chooses a frame moving at half lightspeed, \u00bd c. Since that frame is moving slower than the speed of light, according to relativity it is a valid reference frame. In the Earth frame, the two events (fire gun, hit heart) are separated by +10 nanoseconds. As I show in Appendix 1, the same two events described in a reference frame moving at \u00bd c have a time separation of \u201315.5 nanoseconds. The negative sign means that the two events occur in the opposite order. The bullet enters the victim\u2019s heart before Mary fires the gun! Mary has the perfect alibi. John was already dead when she pulled the trigger. You can\u2019t murder a dead person. She expects to beat the rap. The tachyon murder example is based on the same relativity principle that caused confusion in the twin and pole-in-the-barn paradoxes. If two events are sufficiently separated in space, and not too different in time, then there will be frames in which the order of events will reverse. Such distant events are called \u201cspace-like.\u201d Two events that occur near each other but separated in time are called \u201ctime-like.\u201d The order of space-like events depends on the frame of reference; the order of time-like events does not. \u2026 I refer you to Appendix 1 [of my new book Now] for the explicit calculation. Is the tachyon murder scenario possible? How could analysis in the \u00bd c frame be valid, if it has such an absurd implication? Does this mean that tachyons don\u2019t exist, or does it mean that relativity is nonsense? What if tachyons are really found? \u2026 One possible resolution for the tachyon murder paradox is that, in this world that has tachyon guns, Mary does not have free will. Even though she pulled the trigger after John died, she had no choice but to do so, since without free will, choice is illusory. All of her actions arise from influences and forces outside of herself. John died because it was inevitable that Mary would pull the trigger; the inevitability of physics created the combined scenario of shooting and death, and the order in which they occurred is irrelevant. There is no paradox if the world is governed by causal physics equations. The scenario presents a problem only if you think people have free will, if you believe that Mary could have decided not to fire the gun. If physics rules, then she does only what the various forces and influences on her cause her to do. \u2014\u2014-end of excerpt from Now: The Physics of Time\u2014\u2014- So if any normal object, such as you, can travel faster than the speed of light, it means that free will does not exist. I consider it remarkable to realize that free will has actual consequences for physics, and that we can describe a discovery that would falsify it. I don\u2019t think this astonishing fact has been published prior to my book. On Friday September 23, 2016, at 2 pm Eastern time and 11 am Pacific, I am hosting a Quora session in which I will try to answer as many questions as I can. The topic is time, its flow, the meaning of the mysterious and ephemeral moment we call now, my new book, cosmology, and anything else of interest. I think you can get to the Quora page for this session by clicking here. ",

            "answer_text": "No, in the scenario described in the question details, the spaceship never travels faster than light, which is of course impossible. However, if I understand correctly what you mean, it is true that due to relativistic time dilation and length contraction, the travel time as experienced by the pilot of the spaceship is much shorter than that measured by an observer on Earth. Let's plug in some numbers. Say the ship travels at a constant speed of [math]v=0.9999c[/math], i.e., 99.99% of the speed of light. If the destination is 70 light-years away, it will take the ship about 70 years to get there from the point of view of an observer on Earth, as expected. However, from the point of view of the pilot, the distance to the destination is contracted by the Lorentz factor:[math]\\gamma \\equiv 1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2} \\approx 70.[/math]So the pilot sees the destination as being only 1 light-years away, and therefore she will definitely not be surprised when she arrives there only 1 year after she left. To clarify, this is not faster-than-light travel, since it still takes the spaceship 70 years to travel 70 light years. By the time the 20-year-old pilot arrives at the destination, she will be 21 years old, but her twin on Earth will be 90 years old. Now, when the pilot arrives at her destination, the planet Zebulo, if she looks back, after she slowed down and landed of course, she will see that the Earth is 70 light years away from her. For a minute she wonders: \"how did I travel 70 light years in just 1 year?!\", but then she remembers the equations of special relativity and she realizes that the journey which seemed to her to last 1 year actually lasted 70 years to anyone both on Earth and on Zebulo. In other words, she realizes that her clock ran significantly slower than all her friends' clocks due to relativistic time dilation, and this is why, in the reference frame of the ship, much less time has passed (as measured on her clock) than the amount of time that passed in her original (Earth) and final (Zebulo) reference frames. She recognizes this, not as faster-than-light travel, but as a relativistic effect caused by time dilation and length contraction. And this makes her sad, because she knows she will probably never see her twin again. True faster-than-light travel (e.g. using a wormhole or warp drive) would have allowed her to travel from Earth to Zebulo and still be same age as her twin, just like when travelling between two cities on Earth! This effect is well-known and has been used in many science-fiction works in the last 100 years. For example, I remember reading of such a scenario in the Ender's Game series by Orson Scott Card, and in some other books whose names I cannot recall right now. Bottom lineLastly, let us think what is meant by \"faster than light\". There is a very simple way to think about it: if I send a light beam from Earth to Zebulo at the same time the ship leaves, who will get there first, the light beam or the ship? Obviously, the light beam, since it travels at [math]c[/math] while the ship travels at a slower speed. Therefore, the ship literally always travels slower than light. ",
