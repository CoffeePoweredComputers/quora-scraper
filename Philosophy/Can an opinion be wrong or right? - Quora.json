            "answer_text": "An opinion can have qualified value and truth in one respect, but be false and wrong in other respects. In fact, an opinion can be false and wrong in most domains or contexts, though having some value and truth for the individual holder. My critique is that opinions are like feelings. Feelings are a key part of an individual\u2019s being. They are real\u2014even forces with a life of their own. You have to hone a fine skill of adequately tuning in to your feelings. On the one hand, you can\u2019t suppress them. On the other, you can\u2019t let them control you. As many psychologists like this one might suggest, you have to learn to acknowledge them while also seeing them in relation to the bigger picture. So, you can say feelings have value and truth for the inner world of the person having them. But the value and truth of those feelings are qualified and relational when considering that person\u2019s interconnection with the vast reality of worlds beyond themselves. In relation to the larger reality, one\u2019s feelings have more value or validity in some contexts and may lose all value and validity in others. Everyone at some point has to contain certain feelings for some other purpose, as natural signaling of those emotions might be inappropriate or even offensive to someone else. I may get a real laugh out of something that is even tragic for someone else. In most occupations, professionals have to leave many personal feelings at the door in order to do a job well. On the other hand, feelings can have a key part of a professional\u2019s job as well. .In many ways, opinions share a lot of common characteristics. One definition of opinion is \u201ca view, judgment, or appraisal formed in the mind about a particular matter.\u201d So, these sentiments or appraisals strongly imprinted in our minds have value and truth in our inner worlds. But in relation to the larger reality of worlds beyond us, they at best have qualified value and truth. Even in our own worldviews and inner lives, we must remember how other fruits born are more valuable than opinions. If we form positions having some form of direct support from our points of reference, such as experiences, reasoning, evidence, or something else, surely this is more deeply rooted than our opinions. The same for our principles, which are the guiding tenets for our thoughts, words, actions, and even opinions. An interesting feature of opinions is that they don\u2019t require direct support when strongly held or communicated. They are more in the area of what is insuperable, qualified, or relational than the area of what is verifiable and more conclusive. Often when opinions have some sort of support, that support can also be used for the opposite opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly opinions can be right or wrong. Any opinion one holds about any objectively verifiable fact will either be true or false, thus right or wrong. Other sorts of opinions are not based on objectively verifiable facts and so may not be right or wrong. \u201cI prefer strawberry ice cream\u201d may be right or wrong, but no one can verify it, so colloquially we would say that it is neither right or wrong. Certainly if I were to say that strawberry ice cream is the best ice cream flavor, well this could not be decided so is neither right or wrong, but rather just an expression of my preference. ",
