            "answer_text": "We try to establish a kind of universal ethics in the UN Declaration on Human Rights. The basic concept in that Declaration is respect, which means that all people, from the mere fact that they are all persons, have the right to be taken into account. From a pragmatic point of view, we have seen that concept to be rather effective. We can also look at the charity commandment, given in the Gospel of Matthew (23). It holds that you have to include all other people in the love that your have for yourself. That does not mean altruism, as that would exclude the love for yourself. It recognizes that it is natural to have love for yourelf, while that can only work if you do not do that at the cost of others. The principle was reworked by Kant in his Categorical Imperative, which holds that an act is good if you can will it to come from a rule that pertains to everyone else. When that is hard to understand, argue from the opposite: imagine you lived in a society that denies the Categorical Imperitive; then you would experience chaos and danger, and probably be miserable. It also concurs with the results from Prisoners Dilemma: the solution that does not victimize other people in most cases leads to the best results. An argument in favor of the Charity Commandment is that very similar commandments can be found in traditions all over the world. It seems that it makes sense everywhere. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, there are a set of moral principles that are universal, but they have perhaps not yet been laid out so plainly in the world. In general, these principles revolve around an idea of \u201cfairness\u201d and trust. There is a lot of work that has been put into researching an emergent \u201cbiological morality.\u201d This is the idea that morality is actually an evolved concept, which is evidenced by the fact that many animals appear to display some sort of moral code. Jordan Peterson discusses this in several of his lectures. Broadly speaking, the best and most universal moral code is: \u201cact in a way that is good for you now, in the future, and across time, that is also good for those around you and your enemies, both now and in the future.\u201d Why is this universal? It is the emergent ethic that has come out of just about every civilization, and throughout the animal kingdom as well, in many cases. ",

            "answer_text": "There is no such universal list of moral principles as such. However, all moral principles are derived from two basic ideas: empathy and charity. All actions originating from these ideas are morally correct, while all actions deviating from these ideas are morally incorrect. For example, counselling someone in depression is morally correct becauses it supports the idea of empathy. And stealing from others is morally incorrect because it is opposite to the idea of charity. Let us explore the reason behind these notions. Ethics are required to shape a person\u2019s behaviour. Behaviour comes into play when we are talking about a person\u2019s interaction with the people around them. After bit of connecting the dots, we can say that ethics are required to shape the society. And the ideas that will help any society grow are the ones mentioned above. Any actions deviating from those ideas benefit just an individual, and not the society as a whole. This is what makes the ideas universal: they are intended for the benefit of the society. ",

            "answer_text": "Morality is hard-wired into us. It is one of the by-products of the survival instinct. We learned, in ancient times, that our survival\u2014and the survival of our species\u2014depended on us caring for each other. This instinct, which became a part of us, has been variously described, but I think the Golden Rule is its clearest statement. The Golden Rule is at the core of all morality. It doesn\u2019t come from God or religion, at least in the way that\u2019s usually meant. It comes from inside of us. It is universal among human beings. Of course, the Golden Rule is not the only product of the survival instinct. Our urge to survive also gives birth to fear, greed, jealousy and self-doubt\u2014all of which are in conflict with the Golden Rule. Sometimes, under some circumstances, they prevail. But the existence of civilization is proof that the Golden Rule is more powerful. ",
