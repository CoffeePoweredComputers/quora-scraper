            "answer_text": "You might have a condition called vaginismus. This causes involuntary muscle spasms which can make penetration impossible or painful. It can range from being unable to have sex comfortably, to feeling excruciating pain on trying to insert even a cotton bud. There is a support group on Reddit for sufferers, vaginismus: overcoming the condition \u2022 r/vaginismus But they are likely to offer you the same advice for starting out - talk to your doctor about a referral to a pelvic floor physiotherapist of you can, this is by far the best route to recovery. Do not accept bad doctors who don't know what vaginismus is, or tell you to 'drink a glass of wine' or 'just relax'. Sadly, women's health issues are widely undertaught and misunderstood by general practitioners (and sometimes even gynecologists, unfortunately) so a pelvic floor PT is your absolute best bet. There's also a great book called 'Sex Without Pain' by Heather Jeffcoat, DPT which guides you through using vaginal dialators for at home treatment (and has advice on what kind of dialators you can buy).
