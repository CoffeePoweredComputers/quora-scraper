            "answer_text": "It depends on your belief and thinking. How you define luck defines the answer. If you assume that the ultimate in life is hapiness, then For example as a case it's said that a person's disposition to happiness is 50% genetics ie not in control Out of rest 50% 10% depends on circumstances 40% is your inner state of being or your attitude Or 40% is truly in your control \u221a In my definition anything that has 50\u201350 chances is the domain of luck. So if you're happy most of your life, then you are lucky. Now it is said that happiness is everything in life Thus luck determines everything in life Hence proven Thanks for asking \ud83d\ude18 ",
