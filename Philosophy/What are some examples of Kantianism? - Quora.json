            "answer_text": "For Kant, morality, to be genuine, must have an a priori foundation, and thus be objective and universally and necessarily valid. Morality involves unwavering adherence to the categorical imperative, i.e. the unconditional moral law that applies to all rational beings independent of personal inclinations. The good will- the only unconditional good- is that which acts from duty (i.e. the categorical imperative). Such a will is good not due to the consequences of its actions, but, rather, the volitions. I here quote one example of Kantianism (from the Groundwork) There are others which involve breaking promises, cultivating one\u2019s own talents etc \"Another finds himself forced by necessity to borrow money. He knows that he will not be able to repay it, but sees also that nothing will be lent to him unless he promises stoutly to repay it in a definite time. He desires to make this promise, but he has still so much conscience as to ask himself: 'Is it not unlawful and inconsistent with duty to get out of a difficulty in this way?' Suppose however that he resolves to do so: then the maxim of his action would be expressed thus: 'When I think myself in want of money, I will borrow money and promise to repay it, although I know that I never can do so.' Now this principle of self-love or of one's own advantage may perhaps be consistent with my whole future welfare; but the question now is, 'Is it right?' I change then the suggestion of self-love into a universal law, and state the question thus: 'How would it be if my maxim were a universal law?' Then I see at once that it could never hold as a universal law of nature, but would necessarily contradict itself. For supposing it to be a universal law that everyone when he thinks himself in a difficulty should be able to promise whatever he pleases, with the purpose of not keeping his promise, the promise itself would become impossible, as well as the end that one might have in view in it, since no one would consider that anything was promised to him, but would ridicule all such statements as vain pretences.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Kantianism is the philosophy created by the philosopher Immanuel Kant. You can read about it in detail at Kant's Moral Philosophy. But I shall also provide my own simplistic summary. Kant advocated that morality came form something called the Categorical Imperative. Basically the idea is that you need to figure out a set of rules such that if everyone in society obeyed those rules everything would work. You must then obey those rules, regardless of whether everyone else is. For example when communicating should we lie or tell the truth? If everyone lied then the very purpose of communication would be voided. But if everyone always told the truth it would not be. Thus according to Kant\u2019s philosophy you ought always tell the truth, even if other people don\u2019t. Kant\u2019s philosophy stands in contrast to consequentialist philosophies which state that the morality of actions is dependent on their consequences. For example in a consequentialist system we might say lying to Natzi\u2019s to prevent them from finding Jews is good. But lying to steal money from old people is bad. In Kant\u2019s philosophy both are bad. You are not allowed to justify breaking one of the rules derived from the categorical imperative just because it appears that in a certain circumstance it seems like would have a better outcome. ",
