            "answer_text": "No, Free Will Defence does not solve the problem of moral evil. Free Will Defence (FWD) seems to be the most popular \u201csolution\u201d to the problem of evil but this popularity is not warranted because FWD has problems. To put it shortly: there\u2019s no logical reason for why God couldn\u2019t have created the world in such a way that no one wants to do evil. The key word here is \u201clogical\u201d because God is usually understood as a being who can do anything and everything that is logically possible. God is also understood as perfectly benevolent. Therefore, if God could have created humankind in this manner, then he should have done so given that he is perfectly benevolent. But this is not the case. And it seems clear that God could have created humankind in this manner. What follows is an argument to this conclusion. There\u2019s no necessity for most of us to commit any evil deed such as murder, rape or robbery. This is an obvious empirical fact. But FWD assumes that there\u2019s a logical necessity for some people to commit these deeds. Where does this logical necessity come from? I\u2019ve never seen anyone explain this to me in a convincing manner. If some (actually most) people are capable of avoiding evil deeds, why would it be impossible for all of us to be able to avoid them? I can see no plausible reason for why some people would be forced by logical necessity to commit evil acts, but this is precisely what Free Will Defence requires to \u201csolve\u201d the problem of evil. So to summarize: the basic problem with Free Will Defence is that there\u2019s no logical reason for why God couldn\u2019t have created the world in such a way that every human being, by their own free will, wants to avoid evil deeds. Most people are capable of this so there\u2019s no obvious logical necessity for some people to commit them. Until someone can give a valid logical reason for why at least one person must commit evil deeds for free will to exist, then the Free Will Defence is not feasible and cannot be used to solve the problem of evil.

            "answer_text": "No, absolutely not. An obvious outcome is that there still exists a sub-area in theology known as theodicy that aims to solve the problem of evil. (If the problem of evil is already successfully solved, I don\u2019t see the need for such a subject to continue haunting us.) The reason why the free will defense seems to be irrefutable is that people generally have a wrong impression that if an argument has a good premise (in this case, free will), then it is a good argument, which is not true. An argument is only sound when the logic is valid and the premise is good; what theists generally fail to properly show is how this premise that people have free will leads to the conclusion that a good God can coexist with evil in the world. Firstly, the problem of evil generally is stated as: If an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God exists, then evil does not.Evil exists.Therefore, an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God does not exist.For instance, God, all-powerful and all-merciful, must have the ability and the will to stop the Holocaust from happening, yet the Holocaust happened; therefore God does not exist. The free will defense, in its commonest form, goes like: The omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God gave people free wills.Free will is a source of both good and evil.Therefore, evil can co-exist with an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God.So, to respond to the Holocaust case, theodicists will likely argue that the Holocaust was done by the free wills of mankind, which, as they think, was none of God\u2019s business. I shall let go the question of whether an omniscient God can co-exist with free will and the problem of non-human evil such as the existence of natural disasters, not really because they are not important, but because I disagree with the theodicists\u2019 logic that evils caused by free wills are compatible with an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God. The implicit assumption made in the logic above is that when the free wills of people manifest in reality, that is, when people have evil thoughts and hence conduct those thoughts as actions, God should still be silent, which is a precise re-statement of the problem of evil. Consider again the case of the Holocaust. I agree that it was a human tragedy and thus an evil from free will. However, does that mean that God couldn\u2019t do anything about it? For example, when the Nazi were about to commence a slaughter in a Jewish community, and God, through some means, transported the residents to a safer place, say the US, would anybody\u2019s free will be affected? Perhaps the evil thoughts of people were not stoppable by God for them to have free wills, but why should the evil consequences also be not stoppable by God? The premise that people have free wills cannot properly lead to the conclusion that the good God should bear with the bad actions of them. Next time, if you hear an apologist saying \u201cbecause God gave us free will\u201d, ask them to elaborate that sentence, and you\u2019ll see the problem. Note: This can actually go back to the old question of why God doesn\u2019t do miracles any more; in the Biblical stories, for example, when Moses and the Israelite faced the Red Sea, God opened the waters for them, yet in the 20th century, a similar or even more serious crisis happened to His very chosen people, and He decided to be blind about it.

            "answer_text": "Firstly, I think the question can be improved by differentiating between defense and response. A defense only needs to be deployed in the event of a perceived or actual offense. The \"problem of evil\" is not an attack, but a philosophical speculation that seemingly contradicts with the notional belief of a loving God, as maintained by Christianity. Secondly, evil is not necessarily a problem. Certainly evil can be problematic, but in and of itself it is not a problem. In Christianity it is a reality, not a problem. If the clarified questions is \"Is Free Will a justifiable/adequate response to the existence of evil?\" I think the answer is: No, the doctrine of Free Will does not help address the co-existence of evil with that of a loving God. The mythic concept of Satan takes care of that issue. Free Will certainly supplements the fulness of understanding, but it should never be deployed in attempt to solve the existence of evil. Actually, there is nothing to solve; not all dichotomies need to be justified. ",

If however by evil you mean only what people do to each other because they are bad people, the answer is still No. Arguing that god is all good and all powerful, while not stopping rapists and murderers makes no sense. God knew exactly what he was creating and what it would become. He knew at creation in detail what would happen to every victim of child abuse and torture. He chose to let it happen anyway. God is ultimately responsible for his creation. He created faulty humans and demanded they behave and play nice. That is at best naive. Cruel even. ",

            "answer_text": "Free will is a partial solution to the Problem of Evil, and it is the most foundational. Free will must be part of the picture, because without it God is directly responsible for evil that occurs. By creating free agents, God created the possibility for evil to be done. However, He is not culpable for the free actions taken by the free agents He created. Nevertheless, it's not likely that free will can be the only explanation for the existence of all suffering, since there is natural evil like tornadoes that free agents are not likely the cause of. I think in these cases we need to think of other possible reasons why God would permit suffering. I have an in-depth article I developed years ago that addresses some of these - http://www.skepticalchristian.com/problemofevil.htm Alvin Plantinga, however, did point out that natural evil could be caused by the free will choices of angels or other beings. In this case free will could be a full answer to the Problem of Evil. However, it would be less satisfying of an answer in because it seems implausible or silly to take this route to answer the argument. ",

            "answer_text": "Q. Does Free will defense successfully solve the Problem of evil (PoE)?  (1) Firstly, what\u2019s the PoE? If God exists, is God entirely good, or partially good and partially evil?How can you tell?If God is entirely good, where does the evil of the world come from?Did God create it?How could evil come from an entirely good thing?If God didn\u2019t create evil, why does God allow it to exist?(2) There\u2019re multiple responses to the PoE. The most famous is the \u201cFree Will Defense\u201d. (3) \u2018Free Will\u2019 Defense (3a) Simply\u2026 There is evil in the world.Evil enters the world through human choice.Free Will is so important to God that God allows evil for its sake.It would be lame if God allows Free Will, and then, as and when inconvenient, intervenes to mitigate evil\u2019s negative effects, or \u2018switches off\u2019 Free Will momentarily. Either there\u2019s Free Will, or there isn\u2019t.(3b) We return to this Quora question. Does Free Will Defense successfully solve the PoE? Short answer: By the above frameset, anddisregarding other competing responses,yes.All the other responses are relative to a specific frameset.(4) Other PoE Responses (4a) The following reponses depart from the notion of God. God doesn\u2019t exist.God exists, but is partially evil.God is good, but not omnipotent. So, evil creeps into the world despite God\u2019s goodness and love.There\u2019s a good divine force, but an evil one as well, strong enough to compete with God\u2019s will. Our world is a battleground between them.(4b) There\u2019s no \u2018evil\u2019. Only \u2018absence of good\u2019. Consider this analogy. There\u2019s light and there\u2019s darkness. There can be 2 different perspectives. Intuitively, there\u2019re 2 things: light and darkness.Somewhat less intuitively, there\u2019s only one thing: light. Hence, there\u2019s \u2018light\u2019 and \u2018absence of light\u2019.Thus, There is \u2018good\u2019.There\u2019s \u2018absence of good\u2019.There\u2019s no such thing as \u2018evil\u2019.Another analogy, this time, more personal. You injured yourself.You\u2019ve a wound.Your wound heals.You no longer have a wound.Your wound didn\u2019t \u2018go anywhere\u2019. There\u2019s just \u2018an absence of wound\u2019 on you. (Similarly, for \u2018evil\u2019, it doesn\u2019t \u2018go anywhere\u2019.)Thus, Evil is not real.It\u2019s only the \u2018absence of good\u2019.You fall into evil and suffering because God made you from nothing.When you move away from God\u2019s goodness, you tend to return to nothing.(4c) Theodicy Justification of God. God allows evil because suffering is necessary for human development. Without the negative, we can\u2019t appreciate the positive. Some elements of human greatness can only be achieved through suffering, strife and loss. The basic idea is that even though there\u2019s evil and suffering, this is still the best of all possible worlds. Good outweighs evil in the world. But, this is arguable. Go ask people who face discrimination all their life. Is God A White Racist? (4d) Suffering is a Divine Punishment For Sin What about the suffering of innocent individuals? Terminally ill infants? Animals burned alive in forest fires? (5) This Quora answer merely presents the common PoE responses, and their underlying framesets, dispassionately. It does not suggest that any response is superior to another. (5) Divine Foreknowledge If you\u2019ve Free Will, does God know what you will choose?If God doesn\u2019t know what you choose, why not, if God is omniscient and omnipotent?If God does know what you\u2019ll choose, why does he let you choose to do bad things?If God let\u2019s you do bad things, when he could\u2019ve stopped you, is it fair to punish you for doing what he could\u2019ve stopped?Or, if it\u2019s fair to punish you for your intention alone, why not stop you from doing something, and just punish you for what you would have done?",

Now in what comes the the inductive version, I'm not sure if the Free Will Defense applies to it.

There are other choices in life, however, each basically surmounting to the choice between following God's ways vs. any other way, including our own.  God is good, therefore He is the author and sustainer of what is good.  Evil on the other hand is anything contrary to God's ways; even His very attributes and desires.
