            "answer_text": "We are coming out of a long dark night. We are awakening but not yet fully awake. We may have been given a vision and experienced the Light of God but that is not the end but only the beginning. God has gotten our attention. We know that He is REAL and there is no denying it. We begin where we are. God has called us and we must begin the walk back to God fully aware that our garments are torn, ragged and soiled. On that walk we may stumble and fall into the mud again and again and yet we get up again and again and keep walking. We must keep walking; sometimes step by painful step, putting one foot in front of the other. Sometimes we lose sight of the goal; was it just a mirage? But then something within us, that Spark of God, flickers and we feel it and we become encouraged by it and we get the vision again. Is that a re-awakening? God does not give up on us even if we sometimes give up on ourselves. He wants us to come Home to Him. Pro 4:7 \u201cWisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.\u201d Everything is energy, frequency and vibration. We were created in the image and likeness of God, male and female out of the fire (Deu 4:24) and Light (1 John 1:5) of God. Our soul is the feminine aspect or ourselves while \u201cthe Spirit of his Son\u201d (Gal 4:6) is the masculine aspect. We are like a beautiful flower that has both the male and female parts within itself. When the soul (the bride) unites with \u201c the Spirit of his Son\u201d (the bridegroom) then \u201ca new creature\u201d (2 Cor 5:17) is formed. 1 Cor 15:47 \u201cThe first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.\u201d The two become one and the Higher Self, the Holy Christ Self joins in that union to sanctify it. Having merged with Christ, we are Christ and are able to then do the works that Jesus did and even greater works (John 14:12). When clothed upon with that Christ we then ascend to God to merge with and become one with God, we become a God in God; an Ascended Master. We, our soul, \u201cis hid with Christ in God\u201d (Col 3:3). It is then that we are truly AWAKE as we are born again in Spirit. That is the goal but how do we realize it? We were created in the Spirit Cosmos but we gestate and grow in the Matter Cosmos. The Matter Cosmos is the Womb of the Divine Mother and the bodies we wear while physically incarnated are the body of the Mother. Having been given free will we have used the light energy of God given to us for good and for ill. The light that we have misused becomes opaque or darkened as its vibration is lowered. That energy becomes veiled in darkness and is e-veiled or evil. Jesus spoke of this condition in men. Mat 6:22-23 \u201cThe light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!\u201d If we have created that darkness by our misuse of free will, then by the correct use of free will we can un-create it and restore that darkened energy to the light. The process of redeeming that darkened energy is what we are going through in what is called The Dark Night of the Soul. As we begin our walk back to God, God wants to help us redeem that energy quickly and so he begins to return more and more of that dark energy back to us for redemption. It can sometimes become very dark and we think that we have lost the way. But again, God wants to help us and so he has revealed to us the power of his Word as used in Spoken Prayer. God in us is the Word spoken in prayer. God is in the Words of our prayer. And God is the answer to our prayer. An important key is the power that is in the name of God given to Moses as \u201cI AM THAT I AM\u201d or \u201cI AM\u201d (Exd 3:14). That name is an affirmation of true being: AS ABOVE SO BELOW; I AM. Because \u201cthe kingdom of God is within you\u201d (Luke 17:21) when we say \u201cI am\u201d we are really saying \u201cGod in me is\u201d. Jesus understood this and that is why he affirmed things like: \u201cI am the way\u201d, \u201cI am the truth\u201d, \u201cI am the life\u201d. We can also make these affirmations. We can also affirm the Fire of God (Deu 4:24) in action in us. Of the Rainbow of God Fire, the Violet Flame is God\u2019s Universal Solvent. The Violet Flame is God\u2019s power of Forgiveness, Mercy, Freedom and Liberation. When we affirm that \u201cI am a being of violet fire, I am the purity God desires\u201d we are affirming that \u201cGod in me is his action of the violet fire cleansing me so that God in me is the purity God desires\u201d. Isaiah saw the day that we would have this understanding as he prophesied: Isa 1:18 \u201cCome now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.\u201d It is by the power of the Science of the Spoken Word and particularly in invoking the action of the Violet Flame that we may quickly pass through the Dark Night of the Soul and realize our goal in God. To learn more I recommend that you do a Google Search of \u201cThe Science of the Spoken Word\u201d as taught by the Summit Lighthouse. ",

            "answer_text": "It's not only possible, it\u2019s common. The Zen master Hakuin describes having between three and twenty one Kensh\u014d, or awakenings to his own nature, beginning at the age of nineteen, until his final awakening at the age of forty one. Plotinus, the Platonic philosopher, said that he had had \u201ca handful\u201d, or perhaps four or five big awakenings over the course of his life. Sts. Julian of Norwich, Theresa of Avila and Catherine of Siena all had multiple transfiguring experiences over a period of time. The tricky part of the enlightenment process, once that first real glimpse has occurred, is to stabilize it. The brain falls back into its old habits, fools itself, and goes back to dreaming. It often has to be reminded several times what it\u2019s like to awaken before that happens most or all of the time. ",
