            "answer_text": "So, let's make a single brave assumption, which we need to get any further. Brave assumption: For questions about possibility: the \"can x situation exist\" questions, we should look to see whether the current best theory in physics admits situation x as a solution.  If it is a solution, the answer is yes; if not, no. Right: so can space-time exist without matter? According to our best theory of space-time: yes.  Our best theory of space-time is general relativity, and this admits solutions without matter.  The Minkowski metric is the simplest: flat space-time with no matter at all. But wait a minute, what about our best theory of matter?  This is a variety of quantum field theory.  And according to this theory, there is no such thing as no matter.  \"Empty\" space is a seething mass of fields, with virtual particles popping in and out of existence.  So according to this theory: no.  There is no space-time without matter, because there is never no matter. So... they disagree.  What's the real answer?  Well, it depends which theory you think will retain its form when the two are unified.  At the moment, leading theories of quantum gravity take more from QFT than from GR, so you'd expect the \"no\" answer to be the one to survive in the future.  But physics has a history of surprising us. ",

Unfortunately you will - TRUST ME, dear friend - be profoundly unable to detect and to demonstrate the existence of space-time. Space-time but also mass, energy, axioms, laws and G-Ds they all are merely proclaimed = asserted = object-IFIED on the patient paper.You might argue, that space and time DO exist, since we are measaring them with high praecision all day long. IF so, then it is totally unbeknownst to you that a measurement is merely an operation using matter - one object arbitrarily proclaimed (asserted) as a standard as regards the property at stake, and the other the analyte. The property is NOT being detected / demonstrated on this occasion, during any measurement that is - NOT as such, NOT it-self, NOT on its own, NOT in its own right. ",

            "answer_text": "Matter is defined as that which has mass and occupies space. Nothing at the quantum scale occupies space. Matter doesn't exist. So technically, yes. But by matter you probably mean quanta, or possibly even the quantum fields which give rise to quanta. The fields are arguably the most fundamental aspect of the universe. Without them, one must wonder about the meaning of exist. Yes, space-time exists relative to itself, as does anything. But without the fields it wouldn't have its malleable properties. I think of the fields as terms of a single field. I think of space-time as both its domain and co-domain. This allows the universe to be defined by a single concept, as the field is a function which can't exist without a domain and a co-domain. And I don't try to define exist in any absolute sense. ",

Remove any orthogonal motion relative to the observer, the curved trajectory disappears. Relative acceleration of the observer or the light while the other is in inertial motion at 90 degrees to the first and curvature is detected in the trajectory. Drop a ball in a box that is being accelerated, the ball falls straight down, not curved. Gravity accelerates light relative to an observer at the surface, which gives the exact same answer if the observer is accelerated. ",
