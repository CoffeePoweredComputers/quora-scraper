            "answer_text": "I think all animals have a natural instinct at self-preservation. Including humans. Now having said that I cannot speak 4 any animals but I will tell you that there are animals out there that are more in tune 2 instability. You know sometimes you'll meet someone and they just sit wrong with you. it might be the way they laugh or their smile might seem to be a little off you can't quite put your finger on it but you know that something is just not quite right with this person. Sometimes even though that not quite right feeling may not be a physical threat to you that's still your body's way of telling you hey this guy is not all there he might be mentally challenged or he might be schizophrenic or something you just know that he's different that's your body's way of keeping you aware of your surroundings. I do know that dogs and cats seem to have the most obvious premonitions, premonitions might not be the right word but they can sense threats there's something in a \u201dmad\u201d individual that must smell different were there blood might run backwards I don't know but I know that my dog definitely knows when evil is present. And she knows the difference between someone being mentally unstable in a unsafe way and someone who might just be a little bit slow or maybe he has down syndrome. One she wants to eat the other she wants to cuddle. Can I tell you guys what I sure would like to be the one running that experiment. To find out which animals are more sensitive 2 bad or evil whatever you want to call it. Combination of some of my favorite things picking people's brains and spending time with really awesome animals. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cEvil\u201d as most seem to imagine \u201cevil\u201d, is not necessarily that. Undealt with emotions derived from the horrors humans expose each other to, actually affect the DNA and can possibly affect behaviors due to what the individual feels, or not, because of this issue. Deeply rooted issues of those who came before us, and even those charged with our care, affect our perceptions and how we do or do not feel and then behave accordingly. There is no thing to fear, but fear itself. Your animal fears what it senses for what could be many different reasons. Andm they too, have their DNA being affected by those who chose to harm animals and their ancestors. For those concerned about both humans and pets, please get yourself to an emotion code practitioner, as that particular technique has helped relieve many pets of the issues they experience as frightening, as well as, those pets who experienced the same and came before them.

            "answer_text": "One of the least recognized senses most animals have which humans have lost is a sense of smell. A dog, for example, has a million times more sensitive sense of smell than humans. They can smell a human that is a mile away. Sometimes further. Add to this the fact that all emotions cause a release of pheromones in the skin, and you have a dog that can detect the emotional state of a human that is one mile away. Evil is as evil does. Humans that are angry excrete a cocktail of heady aromas that are potent olfactants - this emotion is one of the strongest smells of all, second only to fear. ",

Animals are experts at picking up that sort of thing as part of their instincts to protect themselves and their pack or pride. There may also be scent changes we humans can\u2019t pick up on but our pets can. If one of my cats were to react poorly to someone on their first meeting, I would absolutely trust their instincts and find a way to get that person out of the house. ",
