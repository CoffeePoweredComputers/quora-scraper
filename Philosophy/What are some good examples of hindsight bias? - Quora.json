            "answer_text": "Here are 3 real life examples 1. Possible evacuation of the Pearl Harbor: Soon after the Pearl Harbor attack, people blamed the US intelligence for not evacuating even when they had intel about a possible attack. Back in 1941, only primitive technology existed. Besides, intelligence had also received information about a fake rumored attack. After the attack, the failure to evacuate looks like a blunder. Before the attack, based on the intel, the US intelligence had many such cases where there seemed like a need to evacuate. But can the whole Pearl Harbor be evacuated every now and then? Of course not. Intel ignores such news often and rightly so. Only when it causes a disaster, people fuss about it. 2. Predictions of Nostradamus: You can find enough articles on the internet about the shockingly accurate predictions of Nostradamus. But are they so accurate after all? Here is the so-called Nostradamus\u2019 prediction of the 9/11 attacks. \u201cEarthshaking fire from the center of the earth will cause tremors around the New City. Two great rocks will war for a long time, then Arethusa will redden a new river.\u201d Nostradamus People associated center of the earth to the World Trade Center, the New City to New York, 2 great rocks as two towers and whatnot. After an event, relating the event to generic sentences like these make it seem true. Ironically, no one manages to predict an event before it occurs based on what Nostradamus has written. If Nostradamus could predict the future, why does no one manage to relate an event before it happens? Oh wait, they do. Just that when people predict in advance, it turns out false. 3. Decision made by a sports team or a captain  During important sports events like World Cups or the final rounds of leagues, fans root for their team with blood and sweat. During such events, unforeseen random factors can influence the outcome. For example, a team or the captain makes a move which seems different from the usual tactics. Now whether this tactic gets praised or criticized depends on the outcome. You would have watched a fair share of cases where such unconventional decisions led to a loss. After the loss people ask, \u201cWhat was the need for such tactics? Sticking to the basics wins high-pressure games.\u201d However, had the team won, the same people would say, \u201cThat tactic was such a masterstroke. Champion teams know how to take make a tough decision.\u201d Certain decisions are lauded or hated based on the outcome even if the decision did not completely cause the outcome.

            "answer_text": "Imagine it\u2019s the year 2025. We\u2019re over the corona-pandemic. We have learned the end result, and we know all the events that have yet to play out. You now think back to the crash of 2020, how you suffered financially, and your behavior as a result of it. Although it might seem ludicrous looking at what we know today, human nature has it that a lot of people are going to look back and say they knew it all along. When financial advisers and TV experts are going to explain to future clients how their investments were handled during the dark period, many are going to start off with \u201cOf course, I knew that\u2026\u201d and private investors explaining to friends and family how they performed will say \u201cEveryone knew that\u2026\u201d This will happen no matter how dark or bright the crisis we now face becomes. Crazy, right? Remember, we\u2019re five years into the future. I\u2019ll now explain why this will happen. Let\u2019s take two examples of possible outcomes from the coronavirus crisis. Scenario 1:The world\u2019s strong isolation measures and lockdowns work to slow the spread of the virus but are postponed again and again. The coronavirus is like a wildfire that continues to put the world to a stop. Continued social distancing and isolation set the world into a deeper recession than anticipated, oil prices remain slumped, and the stock market has not properly discounted what\u2019s to come. We\u2019ll look back in astonishment at the levels of complacency showed by certain citizens and policymakers. Scenario 2:Markets have discounted a much worse scenario than what it comes to. New coronavirus infections peak miles short of what epidemiologists, the World Health Organization, and various experts predict. The doomsday scenario doesn\u2019t come to pass and we start returning to normal much sooner than most expect. Questions will arise about the extreme panic and why policymakers were willing to sacrifice such huge (and certain) costs to overweigh incremental (and uncertain) benefits. We\u2019ll look back in astonishment at the time when stocks plummeted over 30% in short months due to a temporary halt. A little mental exercise will pose one to think both scenarios fairly likely. Both scenarios will seem more obvious after the fact. This is because these scenarios are reconstructions of what happened - simplified descriptions of a reality full of uncertainty which no one has any idea about. Our minds tend to forget the level of details around an event from the past, so rather than become recollections, these events tend to become reconstructions made from a combination of what we don\u2019t know now and what we later find out. What I describe is hindsight bias. It\u2019s also called creeping determinism. It\u2019s the common tendency for people to perceive events that have already happened as having been more predictable than they actually were before the events took place. As Daniel Kahneman explains it: What hindsight does is it blinds us to the uncertainty with which we live. That is, we always exaggerate how much certainty there is. Because after the fact, everything is explained. Everything is obvious. And the presence of hindsight in a way mitigates against the careful design of decision making under conditions of uncertainty. What\u2019s the Big Deal? Hindsight bias is dangerous because it hinders one from learning from past mistakes. If we feel like we knew it all along, it means we won\u2019t stop to examine why something really happened. It also leads to miscalculating risk tolerance. The result is overconfidence which leads to bad future decisions and lower returns. Due to this bias, we tend to view ourselves in a positive light, and we tend to not remember our past mistakes as well as our successes. \"Knowledge of an event\u2019s outcome works as an anchor by which individuals interpret their prior judgments of the event\u2019s likelihood.\" - Max Bazerman Hindsight bias becomes stronger when one has explicitly published one\u2019s opinion of what is going to happen during times of uncertainty. Right now, social media is overwhelmed by ordinary people each having a say on how the current coronavirus situation will evolve, either catastrophically or mildly. A lot are having strong opinions about how others should behave and conduct their daily lives and a lot are strongly suppressing alternative hypotheses from theirs. Frankly, some of it feels like bullying. It\u2019s not pretty to look at. The problem is that the strongest publicly stated opinion is likely to be subject to the most bias in the future if it turns out as opinionated. This is also termed commitment and consistency, which, if coupled with hindsight bias, is a mind-killer. If an obviously uncertain event turns out as 'predicted' leading to \u201cI told you so!\u201d, that person is very likely to overestimate his judgment the next time. Don't be that guy. For instance, there are many examples of investors who were successfully able to predict the housing bubble and the ensuing financial crisis who then have gone on to overestimate their ability to consistently predict bubbles, testing their investors' and their own patience - and money.
