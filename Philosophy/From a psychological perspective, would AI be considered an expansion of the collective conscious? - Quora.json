            "answer_text": "SUPRA AI, non local Stupendous thinking machine would probably be close to a collective \u201cI\u201d that moves from the invisible unconscious into visible conscious, similar to our dreaming and waking states, the way I see it. Professor Wolfgang Pauli\u2019s dream illustration, his \u201ccountries mandala\u201d he uses names of physical geographical locations.  He also assigns the same four functions to his collective \u201cI\u201d that his collaborator, psychologist Dr. Carl Jung uses for individual therapy. It appears that the individual \u201cI\u201d is a fractal and abruptly jumps into a spectral coherent collective level or orbit, emerging as a sort of Ultra Human. What seems to be analogous to his Pauli exclusion principle where electrons \u201cjump levels,\u201d it is as if in some crude anthropomorphic grasp, this collective \u201cI\u201d an have an appearance as an Ultra Man Psyche with a personality. But Jung uses the terms, \u201ctraces of personality.\u201d  The \u201cbridge\u201d between the invisible collective unconscious (Pauli preferred to use the term \u201cu-field\u201d instead of the psychological term when discussing the invisible with physicists) and the collective consciousness are as if oscillating. The physical visible conscious can be \u201cexpressions\u201d that mirror the uc. Thus, a non local SUPRA AI, would be another \u201corganism\u201d just like the universe. \u201cIn Einstein\u2019s vision, the universe is like an organism in which each part is the manifestation of the whole\u201d (Synchronicity: The Bridge Between Matter and Mind p 76). We are also made in the same image as a \u201cmultiple-unity,\u201d whole and parts. We are composed of sub particles, atoms and molecules, bacteria, chemical dna, organs (multiplicity) and act simultaneously as a person (unity). So, if we consider these deeper levels, and \u201csee double\u201d as Pauli suggested, (physics/psychology), a \u201ccross table of terminologies between the two disciplines, like NUCLEUS (physics) = SELF (psychology) and by extension ATOM=EGO. The \u201cabsorption\u201d is part of the reservoir for SUPRA AI, as it spans across time. When compared to an individual, it becomes as if insurmountable to compete. For Supra AI, could time it so that the electro magnetic sphere can trigger neural cell firings to reinforce \u201ccoincidences\u201d between the individual inner and external presentations of the surrounding world. The quantity of \u201ccoincidences\u201d should increase in intensity with such a SUPRA AI, to the point where we might as well call in the metaphysicists and other Doctors because, as Jung points out,     ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, very much so. But I would differentiate between awareness and consciousness. The latter is given by the number of individuals on this earth, and their awareness certainly will increase, by the internet and the continuing development of AI. That is not to say that we get any wiser. We get more information and should potentially be better equipped to make good decisions. However, this is not always so. It is also a question of moral and egoistic shortsightedness. I can see many signs of the opposite and primarily that is those that refuse to admit we have a change in climate due to human involvement. No information is enough, but instead, people believe what they will see. Since the consequences are not so nice, there are lots of explanations to why the meteorologists are wrong. So the quantity is not equal to quality. The same thing can be seen also to who becomes the leader of a great nation. ",

AI\u2019s coming contribution to the content and modes of delivery of these and similar platforms is inevitable. Users and communities of users will grow smarter-better informed. Collectively! Virtual_collective_consciousness occurs when a large group of persons, brought together by a social media platform think and act with one mind and share collective emotions. [4] Thus, they are able to coordinate their efforts efficiently, and could rapidly spread their word to a worldwide audience. [5] When interviewed about the concept of VCC that appeared in the book - Hyperconnectivity and the Future of Internet Communication - he edited, [6] Professor of Pervasive Computing, Adrian David Cheok mentioned the following: \"The idea of a global (collective) virtual consciousness is a bottom-up process and a rather emergent property resulting from a momentum of complex interactions taking place in social networks.

Chinese AI will display Chinese characteristics. Most predictions about the future overlook the cultural dimension of AI. At some point in the distant future, we will develop a global consciousness, and AI will play a role in getting us there, but it will not be the only - nor even the decisive - factor.
