            "answer_text": "Since he still lives at home, he will have to bear with it, in the sense that he can neither change his father, nor leave home. Given this situation, it\u2019s best if he does everything he can to inwardly detach himself. In making this effort, it would help if he asks himself whether a man like that is really worth loving and respecting. Instead of seeing himself as a victim of his father, he should begin judging his father as an independent outsider. Being attached to this kind of person is only going to scar his mind. Also, he should never judge himself according to the things his father says. The father has obviously got some kind of problem, and if your friend takes him to heart, he will start losing his self-esteem. This will harm him greatly later in life. ",

Stop communicating with him as much as possible, but inform your mom about your activities too. Inform your mom that I can not talk to dad since his comments are sarcastic and I can not handle, learn to ignore them. But check, is there any valid point in his comments ",
