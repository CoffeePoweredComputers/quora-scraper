            "answer_text": "I\u2019d think rather the opposite where complex ideas that are difficult to study and compare do not fit the format of the digital age which is heavy on the sound bite and the image. The different social and political strands have dichotomised into tribes rather than finding a dialogue. They actually define themselves by simply not being the other. There are exceptions to this. Ted talks for example. I think personal stories are often a good stand in for philosophy and perhaps that is how we look at ideas now. Through a narrative of an historical event. There is also the rise of the talking book and amazon audible. This is my personal weakness. Doing a lot of Jung at the moment but also Bertrand Russell. Third there is Jordan Peterson who is really freaking the left out. Which is great to watch. ",

Unfortunately since the internet so many of those people have been indoctrinated into the subject based on poorly digested interpretations of the great philosophers or worse, twisted interpretations of the Progressive-Socialist left with ulterior motives.
