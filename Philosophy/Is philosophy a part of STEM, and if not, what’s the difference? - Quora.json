What can you do with a philosophy degree? | BestColleges.com Note this historical development: \u201cThe four medieval faculties of artes \u2013 variously called philosophy, letters, arts, arts and sciences, and humanities \u2013, law, medicine, and theology have survived and have been supplemented by numerous disciplines, particularly the social sciences and technological studies, but they remain none the less at the heart of universities throughout the world.\u201d taken from: List of early modern universities in Europe - Wikipedia And since Math is one of the foundations of STEM (they \u201cM\u201d part, LOL), you have this to ponder: BA and the BS Degrees Last, studies have shown that the IQ of philosophy rivals physics majors. Again, think about that for awhile. ",

            "answer_text": "Partly yes and partly no. Philosophy is woven throughout the mathematically oriented sciences; indeed, science was not a separate field from philosophy until the 19th century. Prior to this, early scientists described themselves as natural philosophers. Areas where philosophy heavily overlaps with mathematical sciences such as formal logic will still be considered part of STEM, as will a lot of very philosophically-oriented areas of mathematics, such as metamathematics. Other areas of philosophy such as epistemology and methodology should be more prominent in STEM than they are, but that doesn't mean it has to be part of STEM per se. ",
