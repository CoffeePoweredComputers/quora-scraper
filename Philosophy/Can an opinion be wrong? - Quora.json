            "answer_text": "Yes. Opinions can actually be proven wrong if the basis of it doesn't make logical sense. Certain opinions are actually worse than others logically speaking. People don't want to admit that but this is the truth. If I was going to have an opinion of how NASA operates for example or a rocket ship without knowing the entire mechanisms of how it works, and a rocket scientist or a physics professor tells me I'm wrong, I would be wrong! If my opinion of NASA and rocket ships are DIRECTLY INFLUENCED by incorrect evidence or from the lack of actual understanding of knowledge about wtf it takes to build a rocket ship, I would be wrong. Let's look at a more moralistic example of an opinion. If I say that funding towards NASA and to the advancement of aerospace engineering, is a waste of money, because that money could be going into better moral issues like to end world poverty and crime. That above is a moral grey area and is acceptable. Even if I disagree with it, it can be counter argued to support their opinion because the money literally can be used to support a variety of other moral causes. However if I say \u201cFunding towards aerospace engineering is a waste of money in ALL aspects.\u201d I would be wrong. Unless I want to condemn the human race to become extinct, and have 0 concerns about the future of our planet, I cannot be correct because to say ALL aspects, would include the concept of empathy and the survival of life. This same applies for people who say that reducing the use of plastic, or global warming and becoming vegan is pointless. What aspect of pointless are they talking about and comparing it to? If they compare veganism to being pointless because it will never get rid of meat eaters any time soon, this can be argued for because research shows meat eaters still vastly outweigh non vegans. It could also be argued against because the main goal of veganism isn't about obliterating meat eaters but to reduce it to create a cruelty free life the best way humanly possible. If they say it will never ever come close to doing that, they would be wrong because research shows there is not enough resources on our planet to feed everyone meat eventually. So, one has the RIGHT to an opinion but that is not the same as being correct. If your opinion is based on incorrect blatant evidence scientific or otherwise, it just wouldn't be correct. Also certain morality opinions can also be better than others. While morality differs depending on culture and individual opinions, if you understand how philosophy works and studied it, there are some moral opinions that can be proven to be wrong because with morality there still has to be some kind of logic and if that logic just doesn't work, it won't hold true. I'm not saying all opinions fit into being wrong or right, of course there are moral grey areas and theories but certain types of opinions really can be wrong. Take for example someone saying: I hate this shampoo brand because it ruined my hair. It is a horrible brand. Now I can say I disagree with it but it still has logic in the direct explanation they just gave saying it just doesn't work for their hair. I would not be able to argue that. However some people have legitimate warped opinions like they would say for example, This shampoo is horrible for EVERY human being on the planet. It is indisputable. And you can't tell me I'm wrong because my opinion is that it is horrible for literally everyone on this earth. The above one literally would be wrong no matter how much that is their opinion, because realistically and mathematically speaking they do not and cannot know 8 billion people. 8 billion people didn't even use that shampoo. This sounds insane but there are legitimate insane people that have opinions that have 0 grounds in reality, logic or science of any kind. There are people who believe the world is flat, and that 2+2 doesn't equal 4 and they sincerely legitimately believe this in their opinion. There are also more abstract issues. It's also why I said opinions that make sense are influenced by logic and evidence. All opinions would have to come from knowledge of some kind, even if it's incorrect knowledge that is how the brain forms opinions. In your case, you had the knowledge of the shampoo and what it did to your hair as direct evidence, but imagine if someone had an opinion of the civil war in South Korea for example or Vietnam, without doing hardly any research on it at all. That is where it gets dangerous. At the end of the day there are tons of opinions out there where people feel the right to think is correct, but they actually don't know what they are talking about. If their opinion had 0 relation to any form of knowledge or incorrect knowledge, by default it would automatically fall apart. An expert in the study of war for example would obliterate a false opinion that would state 'All Asians are scum and all of them have ptsd because of the Korean and Vietnam war.\u2019 A sociology expert, a psychologist, a philosopher can easily also obliterate that argument by saying 'there is no such thing as absolutes in that context for them to actually say that and have it hold true' because by aknowledging absolutes in that context would mean we would have to disprove the psychologist and the sociologist expert in the first place.

            "answer_text": "Philosophically, an opinion is just another word for \u201cbelief\u201d. We all have beliefs. Beliefs are not bad, in fact, they are essential in order for humans to make sense of the world. They allow us to \u201cframe\u201d the world in a certain way so that we can operate in it. Whenever you think of the word opinion, think belief. When we think belief, think frame. Can someone\u2019s frame of the world be wrong? Yes, definitely. This is the frog in the well proverb, or like the allegory of the cave. Someone can think that everyone must have a belief in god or a belief in something because the world presented itself to them that way. Still, they are wrong. There are atheist in the world. A simpler way to answer this question: \u201cIt\u2019s in my opinion that vaccines cause autism\u201d. Is this statement just factually incorrect or a wrong opinion? It\u2019s a wrong opinion. It is objectively incorrect. \u201cIt\u2019s my opinion, and you can say that it\u2019s wrong.\u201d Yeah, keep telling yourself that. This isn\u2019t just because I don\u2019t respect people that believe vaccines cause autism, it\u2019s also because I\u2019m really trying to drive home the fact that OPINIONS CAN BE INCORRECT. In fact, opinions can never be correct because humans CAN NOT frame the world in such a way that allows us to see it for what it really is. We will always have inherent, cognitive biases. Yes, even if we hypothetically were able to create a frame that was as close to the truth as possible, it would still not be \u201cthe truth\u201d. I know, philosophy is a bitch. But it\u2019s also a good thing, because this means we can always improve on philosophy. \u201cOpinions are always subjective, hence they are magically immune from being wrong.\u201d Incorrect usage of the word subjective. A subject is simply an entity that has unique personal experiences, ie a person. Of course beliefs are inherently subjective, because they are formed by subjects. Adur. If I grabbed pen and stabbed my hand with it, I will be injured. I can have a belief that doing this will not injure me, but I would be wrong. Hence, opinions are not magically immune from being incorrect just because they are subjective. TL:DR: Opinions can and are always to some degree inaccurate and anybody who says otherwise has not gone through the basics of philosophy. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to be very careful how I answer this, as this is actually an incredibly disputed issue with criticism online.  The short answer is, no. Opinions are just opinions. No one should ever be objectively \u201cwrong\u201d or \u201cright\u201d because of their opinion, because opinions are, by definition, relative to individuals\u2019 personal taste. This is the main difference between opinion and fact- fact is constant in all things. Fact remains always unaffected by personal taste. For example, if you say \u201cthe sky is red\u201d, then you\u2019re objectively wrong. If you say \u201cthe sky would be better if it was red\u201d, then you\u2019re not right or wrong. Only the latter involves personal taste. That\u2019s the key difference here- fact is never relative.  Now here\u2019s where we get to the tough part- can opinions be criticized? Let\u2019s apply similar reasoning here. Criticism, by definition, is the explanation of what caused someone\u2019s opinion to be the way it is. So, using the same scenario, \u201cred is often much more appealing than the color blue, ergo the sky is better if it was red\u201d would be criticism. Again, it\u2019s not right or wrong, it\u2019s just a deconstruction of one\u2019s opinion.  Now let\u2019s say someone goes up to this person and says, \u201cRed may be more appealing, but it\u2019s also more distracting, so blue is still the best color for the sky.\u201d By this same logic, once again, this other person isn\u2019t right or wrong. And so at first, this rebuttal may seem pointless to some. But then some dude in the crowd goes, \u201cHey, this person\u2019s kind of got a point! That would personally distract me. Blue it is.\u201d Then another random civilian in the crowd yells, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to distract me, and I like the color red. Red skies for all!\u201d And so, each civilian is handed different special science goggles of their choice- one that makes them see the sky as blue, and one that makes them see the sky as red. Because of the two criticisms brought to the crowd\u2019s attention- red being distracting, and red being a better color- each person\u2019s life is designed to suit them best. Even if those criticisms may have different answers for everyone, they still helped to improve their own individual lives.  Tl;dr, for people who skipped the long and bizarre metaphor- The role of criticism is not to categorize different opinions as \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d. It is to bring to one\u2019s attention why something may not appeal to certain people, based off of their own personal tastes. If opinions were considered \u201cright\u201d and \u201cwrong\u201d, then we wouldn\u2019t be allowed to have personal taste. ",

            "answer_text": "I distinguish between opinions (\"I believe God exists.\") and their rationales (\"Because yada, yada, yada.\") The subject of the opinion has no definitive answer . . . otherwise it would, instead, be knowledge. Where right/wrong or true/false enter the picture is in the rationale for the opinion. At the pedestrian level of everyday life, opinions are subjective. They're beliefs or convictions or value judgments. They do not constitute knowledge or facts. Opinions deal with shades of gray, so to speak. They are not true or false in any absolute sense. In layman's terms, facts are objective. They are knowledge: things that can be confirmed. If you can confirm it, it's not an opinion. Facts don't deal with shades of gray: they're black or white: true or false. You can disagree with opinions but the only thing that can be wrong with an opinion, are the claims of fact used to support that opinion. For instance I can claim the opinion that God is real because I know for a fact that he has answered my prayers. My opinion that God is real is neither right or wrong, true or false. But the rationale I offer in support of my opinion (that he has answered my prayers) is not actually factual because it can't be confirmed and is, thus, subjective, not objective (a prerequisite of facts). So no, opinions can't be right or wrong: only the assertions of fact in the rationale for my opinion can be wrong. P.S. In science, nothing's really a fact in the sense that nothing can be absolutely proved.  \u201cIn science, \u2018fact\u2019 can only mean \u2018confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.\u2019 I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms.\u201d ~Stephen Jay Gould ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for asking. Yes, no , maybe ? There are all kinds of angles that one can take with this type of question.  I would like to share a snippet of my goofy episodes with my mom that I hope will in a roundabout way answer this question. Imaging me at my parent's house helping my mom with lunch.  I had brought cucumbers and tomatoes from my vegetable garden. It was around  11 a.m. and we were doing prep work. I grab a cucumber and I proceed to cut off the ends. I then start to slice it. Please note I have translated in English what you are about to read below.  Mom: \" What are you doing?\" Me: somewhat perplexed and in a somewhat snarky tone  \" I'm cutting cucumbers.... \" Thinking duhhh  Mom: \" Stop. Stop right now.\" I stop and look at her really surprised and annoyed.  Mom: in a very authoritative tone  \" Don't you know that you need to rub the end of the cucumber when you cut it off before you slice it. \"  Me: \" Mom, that is ridiculous. \"  Mom: \" No it's not. Just do it. \" I look at my Mom and I thought to myself, is this an opinion she has or there is some purpose to doing this. Me being me, I decided to mess with her. Me: \" What difference does it make? \" Mom : blinks and stares and says with an amount of certitude in her voice that has sprinkles of do what I say or else type of sound  \" That is how my mother did it, that is how my grandmother did it, that is how I do it and that is how YOU are going to do it. \" Again, me being me, I stare at her and we both know how stupid her logic is and I then proceed to obey her because ... well... what difference does it make either way .... right ?  Then, she flips one of the dish cloths over her shoulder as she is grabbing a frying pan.  Me: Imagine a slight amount of fear in my tone of voice \" Mom don't do that !\"  Mom: startled \" What ?\" Me: I grab the dish cloth from her shoulder and put it on the counter \" Don't put the dish cloth over your shoulder. It's not right.\" She stares expecting some kind of explanation. Me: sheepishly \" Mom, when I lived with the nuns, I was always helping out in the kitchen. One of the first things I did is do what you do. I threw a dish cloth over my shoulder and I was very firmly told not to do that EVER because it was not sanitary. Her voice had such authority that I swear when I saw you do that, I heard Soeur Jeanne's voice ordering me to take it off.\"  Mom: Becoming somewhat annoyed with me \" Oh for crying out loud, I've been feeding you since you were born, as far as I know, putting a dish cloth over my shoulder has not killed you or poisoned you. \" She just starred at me. Blinked and said nothing. There was an awkward moment and she resumed taking the frying pan out of the cupboard and went on with the business of making lunch. I go to cut some cucumbers and wondered when did rubbing the ends of cucumbers and putting a dish cloth on a shoulder become such strong opinions.  Neither will not poison us or make our lunch taste bad or whatever...  Then, for some reason, I grab the dish cloth, we were back to back so she could not see me and I gently put the dish cloth over my shoulder. I swear, it did not feel right at all. Weird that. Just when I was going to take it off my mom turned to take some other type of kitchen implement that I have no name for and gave me this WTF look. Mom: Perplexed \" What was that all about ?\" Me: I blushed and became the four year old that had done a naughty thing, and said with a voice full of shame \" Nothing?...\"  Mom: with THAT voice that comes out when she is about to blow a gasket\" I swear those nuns as much as I respect them, have made you believe some very stupid insignificant ideas about the way I wear my dishcloth.\" Me: in a nagging pleading voice \" Mom, it makes sense what they told me. I mean it's makes more sense than having me rub the ends of pieces of cucumbers before I slice them. \"  Mom: Exasperated \" Fait \u00e0 ta t\u00eate c'est \u00e0 toi les oreilles.\" This makes no sense in English. I will translate.  \" Do what your head tells you since the ears belong to you.\" I hate that sentence. It does not make sense to me either in French or in English! Also, there is this voice that she uses that drives me nuts. This voice is like I am your mother, do not question me and please note that I put you in this world and I can take you out of it too.  THAT kind of voice makes my blood boil.  So, I go to the fridge and take out my bottle of Merlot and pour myself a glass.  My mom stares at me ... Without any hesitation and with THAT voice described above she says: \" A good catholic, does not start drinking until noon !\"  By this time it is around 11 :30 a.m. Me: in a defiant gesture, I grab the glass of wine and take a sip and state in a nonchalant voice. \" Mom, I don't care!  \"  Mom: Her face is getting red and I realize that I might not make it out alive of her kitchen. She yells out to my dad who has learned to stay clear of our discussions  \" Jacques, come and tell YOUR DAUGHTER that it is wrong to drink alcohol before noon!\" My father gets up from his man chair and only stays at the entrance of the kitchen, looks at me and says trying not to laugh and said in the most authoritative voice he could muster  , \" You only have to wait 20 minutes or so.\"   Me: Really really annoyed and getting quite perturbed by the stupidity of all of this situation and trying not to giggle because my dad is trying really hard not to laugh. Please note, my mom is really really not amused by either of us. \" Dad, come on you don't believe in God yourself. Why on earth would I have to wait. There is no logic to this assumption!\" My father giggled as my mom was staring at him really really pissed. With the most matter of fact voice he said: \" You see, you get to have lunch with us, you will leave latter, I will be stuck with your mother. We all know that a happy wife is much better than a pissed off one. So, would twenty minutes of your live be too much to ask in order for me to be at peace ?\"  THAT was the first opinion that I heard that made sense to me. I put my glass on the counter and crossed my arms and decided to wait.  AND.... Without her seeing me, I unrubbed the end of the cucumbers by going counter clock wise and them proceeded to slice them.  In conclusion, somewhere in there there are fallacious opinions based on facts that are nebulous at best. Who is right, who is wrong and in the end does any of it make a difference ? ",

            "answer_text": "I have read comments such as \u201cyour opinion is wrong\u201d. First let us understand the meaning of the word \u2018opinion\u2019 , which according to dictionary is \u2018 a view or judgement formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge\u2019. So, if we say \u2018your opinion is wrong \u2018 we are intruding the freedom of speech. You can differ an opinion. Also opinions should not be formed about proven facts. Opinions can not be said to be true about proven facts. Suppose Subba Rao is a Panchayat President of Ramapuram. If I say \u2018 in my opinion Subba Rao is not the President of Ramapuram Panchyat\u2019 then the opinion is said to be wrong. If I say \u201cin my opinion Subba Rao is not fit to be President of Ramapuram Panchyat\u2019, the the opinion can not said to be wrong. It can be deferred. Also opinions are voiced about future happenings. The opinion is true till such time that the fact happens. Suppose the election of Ramapuram Panchyat held on 13\u201309\u20132018. Subba Rao won the election and became the president. If, on 12\u201309\u20132018 I say \u2018 in my opinion Subba Rao will not be elected as President of Ramapuram Panchyat\u2019the opinion is true \u2018 till such time \u2018that the election results are declared. After that the opinion can be said to be wrong. Also, it is often commented as \u2018your opinion is biased\u2019 in favor or against some body or something. According to the meaning it self, the opinion is biased.We are voicing our opinion not based on fact or knowledge, so it is biased anyway. So there is no need to say \u2018your opinion is biased\u2019. Suppose a journalist says \u201c Subba Rao is a Good Panchyat President\u201d on one occasion, and \u201cSubba Rao is a Bad Panchyat President\u201d on another occasion. Which way he is biased?. He is biased of the situation prevailing at that time. Also I read comments in this manner \u2018I do not believe you\u2019 or \u2018why should I believe you\u2019 As I said no body should believe any body , because we are all voicing our opinions, that can be deferred need not be believed. So, opinions can not be wrong unless they are against proven facts. ",

            "answer_text": "Thank you for asking this question!  EDIT 1: in my answers I have realized that I expect some reading (from links provided) to be done in addition to simple deductive lines of reasoning. You have been forewarned; I provided a detailed response in the comments this time but it's much easier (and rewarding) if I can engage in an exchange with the OP and/or followers. This kind of communication is at the heart of philosophical inquiry and it's how I find best to answer philosophy questions such that the specific confusions of the OP (or other interested parties) are addressed.  It made me dig down to Ancient Philosophy in Spring 2012. Plato's Republic Book 6... Check this out: http://faculty.cua.edu/hoffmann/courses/201_1068/Plato-6%20knowledge%20and%20opinion.pdf  There's even the divided line graphic. How cool. In modern times, theory of knowledge philosophers focused heavily on knowledge as \"justified true belief\" and developed further accounts after it.  Justified true belief was called into question by a 3-page paper by Prof Gettier of UMass Amherst (http://fitelson.org/proseminar/gettier.pdf). There is also correspondence theory which tries to provide a workaround to \"justified true belief\":(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_theory_of_truth) ...this might fully address your concern because it requires a statement to correspond to a certain state of affairs in the world in order for that statement to be considered knowledge. It's also plainly built upon na\u00efve realism so step back radical skeptics. ;)  EDIT 2: I also think most of the other answers given on rhetoric (see here: http://i.word.com/idictionary/rhetoric)  are misplaced but still relevant. Although these concerns aren't philosophical at all, they should be given consideration when evaluating the \"truthiness\" of an opinion. That's a valuable communication skill to garner. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer revolves entirely around a common understanding of words involved, as it is fundamentally a question of semantic philosophy.  In short: I. Opinion is an expression of perspective. II. Perspective is an alignment of facts. III. A fact is a piece of information, neither true nor untrue. So, an opinion can be factually representative, but not perceptually accurate as compared to the codified experiences of other people.  Social rejection doesn't make the opinion \"wrong\", as an opinion merely states personal perception, but those people might disagree with the expressed perception on quantifiable grounds.  That leads us to: IV. An argument is a logical ordering of facts into a perspective: It states assumptions and then justifies a conclusion by aligning them coherently according to a set of rules (like mathematics, for instance). Arguments can express opinions, but are not expressed as opinions.  Which is to say, opining is a form of communication, as is arguing, but arguments can be \"wrong\": fail in their logical construction---coherence of 'perspective', or fail in their assumptions---social acceptance of predicate opinions.

Better to be prove dead wrong:)Now I am  tired to say I told you so! Being wrong is the next best thing that can happen to me..I am not being pretentious there.. I just like when life surprise me. When I am sure and I am less sure than I totally wrong. Being wrong is still the best way to learn .  Lately I am less accurate. I like to watch movie and series. I bet on the out come.. Some screen writers are unbelievable. They can trick you. The only moment when I upset to be wrong is when I warn a friend or my children .. And I am right . I hate it!!!  Being right is so arrogant.. The essence of life is to question, to wonder all the time. I avoid certitudes . They can kill you !!!I am a dreamer .  I am not looking for being wrong or right . Where is truth? We don't know. This fashion of quantique world is the typical exemple of dead ends. The fact that man knows right from wrong proves his intellectual superiority to the other creatures; but the fact that he can do wrong proves his moral inferiority to any creatures that cannot  Mark twain    And you have the fool the real psycho . They don't care to be wrong they just want victory. I make a big difference in expressing an opinion and being didactic. Very uncomfortable.What scare me the most is not being wrong or right .. It is the person who doesn't figure the difference between both.Thank you for asking me. ",

Opinion : 1. a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge. 2. the beliefs or views of a large number or majority of people about a particular thing. 3. an estimation of the quality or worth of someone or something. Depends\u2026 But that hinges on what an opinion is. You cannot really have an opinion on factual matters.. they are facts. Evolution is not real - that is not an opinion - you are just wrong.I don\u2019t like the colour fuchsia - that is an opinion.So on subjective matters - your opinion is your opinion, it cannot really be wrong. On factual matters - Yes, your opinion can be wrong if it contradicts facts... facts don\u2019t give a crap what your opinion is.. you are either correct or you are incorrect - but would that be considered as an opinion?

For example, quantum mechanics brought in a lot of changes to what is now referred to as Newtonian mechanics. The discovery of dark matter and dark energy being the dominant constituent of the universe has changed how we look at the universe.It depends on which facts you want to consider, what parameters you're going to use to decide your opinion. Alexander Fleming or Albert Einstein - who's the greater scientist? Well, who has a Nobel prize? Both, so no luck there. Who saved more lives? Probably Fleming. But wait, isn't Einstein's work being used in everyday science which indirectly means he saved more lives? Probably. Which is more important - physics or biology (or rather, medicine?)? Well, physics, surely, cuz biology is applied chemistry which itself is applied physics, right? It depends on how you use the facts you have to form your opinion.",

Opinions in the second category might be right or wrong, but we will never really know for sure. Opinions in the third category can be considered, for all practical purposes, wrong because to hold them is contrary to the most reasonable interpretation of the best evidence available. ",

For example - \"Gay marriage will erode the very fabric of our society and lead t0 the extinction of our species.\" Many people believed and/or still believe that opinion to be true with very little to no reasonable justification. Because its facts and its reasoning are very poor and unreliable, it's not a healthy opinion to hold. ",

The motivation is it seems to go against the very meaning of an \u201copinion\u201d for it to be right or wrong. If an opinion is a value judgment (like my answer or \u201ccats are mean\u201d) then it\u2019s subjective, neither right nor wrong by definition. If a testable statement of fact is misrepresented as an opinion (e.g. all cats are smaller than dogs) then you can counter that it\u2019s not an opinion at all but something that can be proven true or false. The mistake was to call it an opinion at all, it was a false statement all along.If the opinion is an untestable statement of fact (e.g. the universe is infinite) then that\u2019s a correct use of the word \u201copinion\u201d and we can\u2019t know it to be true or false. If the statement turns out to be testable and false, it becomes simultaneously not an opinion and a false statement. ",
