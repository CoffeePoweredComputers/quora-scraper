            "answer_text": "The preoccupation with self-esteem creates an enclosed maze from which there is no escape:  \"I want to think better of myself, but focusing on my self-concept isolates me from others and life, which lowers my self-esteem.\"   Catch-22, yes? The \"breakthrough insight\" for anyone who gets tangled up in this mess is to realize that there is no such thing as a \"valid self-concept.\"   All self concepts are, at best, limited things useful for limited purposes.   None of them are capable of representing your true self, and it's a major mistake to believe that \"I must get my self-concept in order!\"   No, that is not at all necessary.   It's actually the opposite:  being preoccupied with self-image tends to isolate you from life and produces a dead end. What you really want is freedom from concern about your self-concept:  that happens when you begin to recognize the nature of being.   \"Being\" is not a thing, it's not a fixed form which stands and poses in the mirror for photographs.   It's more like a fluid which flows from one thing to the next: your consciousness, your attention, your efforts -- they're mutable and free, not locked into one specific \"ideal shape\". But freedom is scary.   Freedom doesn't give you numbered figures to color in with your paints, freedom is blank canvas and no pre-existing tracks in the snow which you have to follow.   So the mind clings to self-concepts to avoid the nervousness that freedom provokes.   It takes courage to be free -- to be yourself involves braving the unknown of not having a fixed concept of self.    The more one clings to self-concepts, the more their world closes in and becomes a meaningless entrapment of self-centeredness.   Focusing on self-concept is the opposite of courage. So forget about fixing up your self-esteem or self-image.   Work on recovering your freedom.   Work on learning to recognize how you get trapped by rigid ideas of self. Freedom is the starting line for life.  Nothing meaningful happens until you understand that no container of ideas can define you. ",

            "answer_text": " I understand what a struggle it is for you to move between the two polarities of high confidence and low self esteem. Although you are aware of all your strengths and weaknesses and are completely capable of carving out a unique space for yourself in this world, you also are not able to give yourself the love and affection that you know somewhere deep down you deserve.  This could be because you are looking to others to validate you. To appreciate your positives, to understand your negatives, to give you the support you require. And when others do not give the reactions you expect from them, you fall into the mental loop of thinking what is wrong with you, even though you seem to have been doing everything right. As a person, who has struggled with this for the past 8 - 9 years, and probably is not completely out of it as well, I suggest only the above quote to be made your mantra. This has given me a little help. Stop. Stop looking to others for validation. First give yourself all the love, affection, care and space you need to grow and make mistakes. Learn to forgive yourself gently. Learn to hold yourself in the midst of fame or in the depths of loneliness. Learn to slowly pull yourself out of all the dark spots you get into it. Learn to love yourself. That is the only key to self esteem.  Others will follow! Wishing you loads of love and light. ",

If your esteem is low, that voice in your head is likely critical. Change it to be encouraging, as in: \u201cgreat job on that project,\u201d or \u201cyou were really kind to that person,\u201d or \u201cyou have done enough for today, time to relax.\u201dKeep your agreements with yourself the way you do with others. This one was personal to me. I noticed that I ALWAYS kept promises made to others - family, friends, colleagues, clients. But I fudged on promises to myself - things like keeping Fridays open for a long weekend - and then agreeing to meet with a client, \u201cjust this once.\u201d Or on putting money in my retirement account every month. When we don\u2019t keep our agreements with ourselves, we lose credibility with ourselves, and this erodes esteem.Keep a list of daily accomplishments - you likely achieve more than you give yourself credit for.Keep a kudos file - a place where you stash thank-you notes for making a difference, a job well done, a note to yourself about something great you did but others might not know about. On days when you wonder if what you do matters (we all have those) read through your kudos file and let the good feelings wash over you. I still have student letters from 20 years ago - those heartfelt thank yous lift me every time I read them.If you enjoy reading, read Nathanial Brandon\u2019s and Robert Anthony\u2019s books on confidence and esteem. They are both excellent.Remember that we all strive for perfection and none of us makes it, and be accepting of wherever you are on any given day. Thankfully, we get a fresh chance to improve every day. ",

            "answer_text": "Self gratification is in fact Self-esteem, and seen in that light it's easy for me to assert using my confidence that the gratification you are seeking is from an outside source. Although technically as stated above there is no difference, except as a   character trait seemingly  important to you,   not to be Self  indulgent and  that is a great spirit to possess. Obviously you feel others are not fully appreciative of the contribution that you are capable of, and you would like to remedy that without becoming egocentric. We Muslims believe that our calling is assigned to us by the composite of all that passed before, that is recorded and calculated by Fate which is the Administrator of everything. Therefore to be the recognition of your true capability there is no other avenue available beyond  what your inspiration allows. Just follow it carefully, and I find by considering prehistory often gives me a better relationship between then and now. Being blinded by myopic vision is a symptom of our existence that is very difficult to discern, if not impossible while struggling for rightful recognition of your true worth. It is also guaranteed to occur.

            "answer_text": "Low self esteem stems from underlying negative core beliefs about yourself as a human being, so the work to be done is to become consciously aware of what narrative might be playing out in your subconscious thoughts. We all have a negative critic lurking inside our heads and we allow it to constantly beat us up, making us second guess our sense of worth which causes us to retreat into ourselves. Thoughts such as \u2018I\u2019m not love able enough, I am worth less, I am not good enough\u2019 are all common themes that we all have to a greater or lesser extent. The way to build self esteem is to capture the negative thoughts and challenge their validity by asking yourself for evidence that this might not necessarily be true. In what ways are you good enough, worthwhile, etc. if you feel confident in certain areas of your life, perhaps because of your skill set, build on that, acknowledge yourself and your self esteem will grow. Use the affirmation \u201c I am worth it\u201d , because you are. Hope that helps. ",

How can you have high confidence but have low self-esteem at the same time? if you are confident, then by definition your self-esteem can\u2019t be low. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. I guess you want to know how to feel better about yourself or view yourself in a better way, in that case take care of your health. Physical health. Physical health affects mental health and mental health affects one\u2019s esteem. Then find hobbies you like, stick to them, and eventually you should make friends who share similar interest and hopefully those friends build you up etc. etc. I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t have friends, you might, but I\u2019m trying to say that social interaction with like minded people who share similar interest to you elevates one\u2019s level of worth and confidence a whole lot. Start by taking care of your physical health. The rest should follow. ",
