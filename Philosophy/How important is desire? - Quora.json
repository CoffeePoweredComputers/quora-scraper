            "answer_text": "Let me tell you a story. A very long time ago there was a person (beggar probably) sitting under a tree. A businessman passes by and observes the person taking nap under the tree and thought he should also rest there for a while and fell asleep. After some unknown time they both woke up, and started conversation. Beggar: \u201cwhat do you do?\u201d The businessman: \u201cI buy stocks for people of my village and sell them who can\u2019t afford to go to the city frequently, and what about you?\u201d Beggar: \u201cI just roam around the city and ask people for a little portion of their food, and that\u2019s how I get enough to fill my stomach for one day, and then sleep here.\u201d Businessman: \u201cWhy would you do that? Why don\u2019t you find some job in the city and then earn money to live a better life?\u201d Beggar: \u201cWhy do you think that I need a job?\u201d Businessman: \u201cSo that you can earn some money.\u201d Beggar: \u201cWhy do I need money?\u201d Businessman: \u201cTo buy yourself a house, buy some good clothes and have good food.\u201d Beggar: \u201cWhy do I need to buy these things?\u201d Businessman: \u201cFor god sake, to live a happy life you damn idiot.\u201d Beggar: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing right now. I\u2019m happy\u201d Businessman was shocked. But the story doesn\u2019t end here. Before continuing his journey, businessman said, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s a good thing that there are very few people like you in the world, because you don\u2019t contribute anything to the society, from where you take all your food, the clothes that you wear. Even this tree here might have been planted by someone. There is a big difference between the people who work their a*** off and you, they give something back to the society. Everyone gives as per their capacity, some give a lot, some people give little, but they all do and that\u2019s how the society improves. You have zero contribution to the society, Now how does it feel?\u201d So the point is that having aims and desires, somehow improves the social structure, from which we receive a lot of things from our childhood to adulthood. After that it\u2019s our turn to give it back to the society. ",

            "answer_text": "Aim can be seen as path which we are leading to and could be a reason to harmonise random acts we could be doing in absence of it. If discipline is one of the highest virtues that leads in a good and valuable life aim could be a product to help in disciplining the mind. This without aim one may be ignorance of further consequence preventing to be prepared well in advance about the steps ahead. If you understand the value of discipline and with it are prepared to navigate the life so the time constructively we may be able to address so many unknown variables that keep disturbing us. We learn by practice and thus if we gather random activity that is being done and convert into an aim the objective become clearer. The concentration then can help to focus and use effectively and efficiently helping us to gain experience that could have been alien to us. The life starts turning as meaningful experience is a joy in itself. The aim also helps in ascending our thinking and use it as ladder. The aim shall have an end but as we know now its importance we try to make a next aim and follow the same sequence with higher vigour to achieve. The process makes us efficient and has ingredient to make us aware that is transforming situation of higher order. Well there is a fall down situation if we try to see aim as one time activity when after its accomplishment change our view in its fruits only by adding desires and following a path for fulfilling them which never end. The Gita essence for enjoying the action not the fruits means the same. Having aim is an opportunity to enjoy the process or the steps which shall produce fruits in the path. We can stop for short interval to recharge and set another aim. In case we have enjoyed the process we must have learnt far more than the simple appearing things and the subtle points which a sincere devotee observes make them are richer in thoughts. This rich thoughts allow to work as universal quality in next aim and that would keep repeating. It is not only output of product but such mind are weaving human too and creating a culture in and around them enriching quality of people and so quality or mind. Would not that be a joy and really a greater success over any material one irrespective whatever one has achieved materially? ",

            "answer_text": "Desires are one of the most important factors in influencing our life: How? Let me explain you with a short story: Three friends, Mohan, Raj and Deep were discussing about their future dreams: Mohan: I wish to be a famous singer. Raj: I wish to be an investor. Deep: I just want to lead a cool life with lots of money and no work. After 10 years: Mohan is still struggling to be a famous singer, however his journey has started with short proposals. Raj is still working towards its goal in being an investor and working on future projects, meeting different businesssman and investors. Deep has involved himself in wrong company because his definition of being cool meant having liquor, smoking, hanging out with girls, going to discos, showing of costly gadgets. So for becoming rich quickly he has started selling drugs.  I guess you have got your answer as how desires influence our life. We get up with some desires in our mind, we perform every activity with the purpose of attainment of desires.  ",

My sister wanted something, my girlfriend wanted something, my teacher wanted something and I became everything. But, this was of the desires of others, I was nothing of my desire so those desires ruined me. Some desires have negative effects. Then I created my own desires, which hurt a few people, my parents, my girlfriend, my friends but you know what? I was happy and people who actually cared for me, stayed in any case. This is the power of desire, if they are yours, you have a happy life, if they are of other they give you a sad life. Cheers~!! ",

Sometimes we possess free will to control karma and some times not. We are lucky if spiritual desires are invoked in us. It can lead to euphoric bliss and ultimately salvation in that state.
