If i do not believe the ocean is full of water does not make me right, but in some individual lives it could have some validity.  Who decides when you eat or whether you eat or not.  My thinking is that free will has a profound effect on both determinism and randomness.  Even randomness has determination.     My primary focus of free will as it applies to our individual lives and it's operation  in our spiritual lives which is hard to do when physics is the ultimate action.  Think of and focus the applications to your decisions in connection with a deity .  God does not dictate your choice in that relationship or moral conduct.  However I do believe these energies extend to all of existence.  We utilize a minor portion of our abilities.  I am not a Bible thumper. but it does have God exhorting mn to take dominion over the earth.  I meet to blog on these protracted topics.     PEACE ",

It seems to me that the most common version of free will, libertarian free will, not only doesn't exist, not only cannot exist, but is not even logically coherent. Take your choices and break them down to their smallest, atomic decision. Why do you choose A rather than B? A determinist would say it's entirely due to prior causes: your knowledge and beliefs, your goals and desires, perceptions and outside influences, and so on. (If you're also a materialist you'll further reduce this to brain states, but that's a matter of mechanism not relevant to the logical argument.) The libertarian would say that's not free. On the other hand, if the choice is not determined by prior causes, it is ipso facto nondeterministic\u2014random. It is by definition not determined by your beliefs, goals, or desires. (A naturalist can accommodate this with quantum indeterminacy, but again, that's a detail, not central to the argument.) It seems to me that anything I do due to random chance is not meaningfully my \u2018will\u2019. The libertarian would have you believe that your will operates in a third state that is neither constrained nor random, deterministic nor nondeterministic. It seems to me that this violates a basic law of logic, that of the excluded middle. So, then, it's logically incoherent and can't exist (in any possible world, if you will). What does this mean? Not much. It's a blow to some forms of theodicy, but beyond that, what does it matter? Making correct judgements is basically deterministic anyway: I want my beliefs constrained by evidence and logic. Interaction with others is predicated on them likewise acting as if constrained by reality. Why should anyone want to be \u2018free\u2019 of causality? ",
