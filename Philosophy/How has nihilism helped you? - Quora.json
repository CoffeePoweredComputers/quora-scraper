            "answer_text": "If we assume my definition of nihilism (here: Vinney Cavallo's answer to What motivation and/or rationale does a nihilist have for doing anything, other than \u201cWhy not?\u201d? ) then: it can be helpful to have your worldview map closely onto the truth. Namely, the universe has no inherent meaning nor objective moral truths or laws. Aligning your personal expectations of reality closely to how reality actually works means you\u2019ll be less likely to have unrealistic expectations, such as: \u201cgood things happen to good people\u201d, \u201cX happened for a reason\u201d, \u201cif I do X and Y I\u2019ll receive Z reward after I\u2019m dead\u201d. These are all bullshit and it\u2019s typically unwise to use bullshit as a foundation for life strategies - like expecting gravity to work differently for you on the 15th floor, for instance. The shorter answer is: Maybe the rejection of objective meaning hasn\u2019t been helpful to a given \u201cnihilist\u201d. Doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s true. I\u2019m not sure why this question assumes nihilism has helped people. If a realist is truly being a realist, he/she doesn\u2019t believe something because it\u2019s helpful, but because it\u2019s empirically true. ",

            "answer_text": "Similer to how evil could help a person. By assimilating it into your being you won\u2019t be caught off gaurd when it comes up in the real world. To add, I would say if you place yourself above anything to do with nihilism you could risk becoming too sage like, ect. Have a nice balence, be a \u201cperson of the mountain and of the vally\u201d. See both the meaning and meaninglessness that life has to offer. Side note: it seems to me an osolation of meaningfullness and nihlism drives heavy the pistons of contemporary inquiry. Perhaps we have found our generations need for a new Faust. It is no longer with devils that wisper on our ears. It is the bombardment of the meaningless escapism. -Just my opinion ",
