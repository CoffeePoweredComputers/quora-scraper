            "answer_text": "Okay, you\u2019re smart. Look around a bit. Start by looking to the right of your screen* \u2026 \u201cRelated Questions: I\u2019m 15. I want to become a philosopher \u2026\u201d :) Here are a few additional ideas you might use: Do not believe for a moment that any one philosopher or philosophical school has \u201cgot it right\u201d. If you commit to one school, chances are you\u2019re making a mistake. You just have to look at (a) their own disarrayed lives; and (b) their influence on the world, to see how bereft of sense almost all philosophers are. Even those that were influential often spawned or supported monsters. Some got it partially right, however.Acquire skills. It helps to ask the question \u201cWhat works?\u201d Here are a few things that conspicuously do work:Science. Look at how we\u2019re re-shaping our entire planet, for good and bad. Many philosophers are and were bad at science. Oops. Many postmodern philosophers in particular don\u2019t seem to be able to find their bottom with both hands, in this regard. Become good at Science.Maths and logic. These form an indivisible whole, and can be used to create and test the models that we use in Science. Many philosophers are indifferent at maths, and when they do get it, they are indifferent at applying it to Science. Learn math. This is hard.Working with others. Find apparently sensible people, work with them, and don\u2019t allow them to get away with talking nonsense. Balance respect and incredulity, if you can. Be a reasonable mensch. Others will help you spot your mistakes.Ask what doesn\u2019t work. Learn to spot the inconsistencies. They are legion. Anything that\u2019s densely written and seems to go in circles may be profound, but is far more likely to be nonsense. Read Quine for deliciously horrible examples. If you speak German, Hegel is a laugh-a-minute, heh. As an antidote to a lot of this, read Carl Sagan\u2019s \u201cDemon Haunted World\u201d particularly The Fine Art of Baloney Detection.Learn to express yourself well. Write. Read. Argue. Practise.When you leave school, get a real job. Don\u2019t start by trying to become an academic philosopher.A few personal thoughts. Apply the above principles, and reject the following if they then don\u2019t make sense: a) We have come a long way since antiquity, so it\u2019s likely crazy to build your foundation on the rubbish spouted by (in particular) Plato and Aristotle. Even venerable philosophers must earn respect. They haven\u2019t. Plato had this utterly weird theory of \u201cforms and ideals\u201d \u2014 that in some ideal Platonic space there is a perfect model of e.g. a human\u2014used to justify all sorts of crazy, subsequent fascist beliefs. Aristotle provided some fairly decent logic, but then messed it up through an insistence that everything fits into nice, hierarchical trees (we\u2019re still recovering from this) and bad observational skills\u2014he tells us that women have fewer teeth than men, for gods\u2019 sake! b) Be particularly aware of absolutes, as they are anti-science. Reasonable science is about provisional acceptance of models of reality that appear to have been adequately tested\u2014for now. This doesn\u2019t make them true. Read Karl Popper (he got some things right) and Thomas Kuhn (careful there) and wonder at the contrasts. Then read a lot about Bayesian statistics, as this is likely the future of rational decision-making. Explore the difference between using what we know wisely, and generating and testing new theories. c) Just because we can\u2019t be absolutely certain about a theory/model, doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t use it, and certainly doesn\u2019t mean \u201canything goes\u201d. Most theories are false. Most options simply don\u2019t work. Science as I\u2019ve defined it gives us the only reasonable way of working out \u2018what works\u2019. d) Be suspicious of \u2018philosophers\u2019 who are entirely academic. The rough and tumble of real life knocks off sharp corners, and those academic philosophers who have gone from school to university to teaching philosophy without getting a real job are particularly dangerous. e) It\u2019s easy to drown, or go crazy. In particular, beware of spending too much time at philosophy. Do a bit every day over many years, rather than trying to assimilate huge, indigestible chunks rapidly. Avoid making commitments that seem irreversible\u2014like taking on a religion where they\u2019ll kill you if you leave :( A final, apparently irrelevant thought that may help you in the future \u2014 infinity is a convenient intellectual construct, not an even possibly real thing. Beware of those who seem to assert otherwise, because there madness lies. My 2c, Jo. *The original, distinct question was \u201cI\u2019m 13. I want to become a philosopher\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll be quick(yes, this is me being quick!): Listen to the people on here who are telling you to be an independent thinker rather than a reader of philosophers\u2014that\u2019s exactly what you SHOULDN\u2019T do. The people who recommend you read as much philosophers as you can clearly do not know what philosophy is about. You\u2019re young, you will have plenty of time to read about what other philosophers have to say about life and everything that goes with it. Reading them will stunt your growth (in terms of independent thinking=you will just quote what others have said instead of critically thinking on your own). This is what you should read(as very few people on here said): everything but philosophy books. That means: anthropology(all of them, especially physical and cultural), Science or similar(biology/chemistry/math/computer sci, physics, etc), politics, psychology, and even art. What I\u2019m trying to tell you is that to become a philosopher, you should study the world and the people and the laws we are governed by (man created and natural). When you are filled with all this knowledge, then you can start discussing topics that are controversial (you should start with simple things at first) and see how you can criticize or back it up. THINK! You shouldn\u2019t read philosophers books until you get there. Find people to talk to about these things. Question them, challenge them, find people to challenge your thought process/conclusions. When you are old enough to think critically and have enough knowledge of the world, only then can you read what other philosophers have to say: but don\u2019t take their word for it, as a philosopher, your job will be to see if they make sense and how; if they don\u2019t, why not. You will find some philosophers who think just like you or similar, and others who think exactly the opposite of you. Had you read them at a younger age (especially Plato and such) you would actually do the opposite of becoming a philosopher: you would put limitations on your own thinking. You would (since they are \u201cfamous\u201d philosophers) think they are correct and think like them (as I see many \u201cphilosophers\u201d suffer from). Bottom line: As a philosopher, don\u2019t restrict your mind and put limitations on it by reading what other philosophers have to say; your job is to expand your knowledge and critical thinking. That\u2019s done by reading as much about the above mentioned as possible. The more you know, the better philosopher you will be. FYI: If you are religious; I would highly recommend you start challenging your own religion, picking it apart. That might be the hardest thing you might do. If you are an atheist, do the reverse; pick it apart and see if there is a possibility of a God. I am not a real philosopher (in terms of majoring in it, writing about it, being an educator or it\u2026or whatnot)\u2026what I am is a somewhat of a natural philosopher. My sister and I have had philosophical conversations since we were kids (we didn\u2019t know it back then)\u2026But recently, we have both started taking college classes for fun/interest (well, my sister because she\u2019s thinking of majoring in it). What I see in my college classes sometimes depresses me. People are set in a certain way and refuse to see their irrationality or the rationality of something else. Or vice versa. This includes the professor (who is unfortunately extremely biased and annoys me because of this\u2014I can point to multiple times my professor makes claims that are a \u201cfallacy\u201d(you should read the different types of fallacies for more critical thinking)\u2014it just makes me cringe). Anyways, good luck. ",
