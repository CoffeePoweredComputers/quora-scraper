            "answer_text": "I am so sorry that this is such a long answer, but this question calls for a long answer; I have place a small amount of information here, there is more so therefore you will have to request for further readings, but this at present will suffice. Did the universe have a beginning or has it always been there? Here we refer to the laws of Thermal dynamics which govern the movement of heat between different bodies. The second law of Thermodynamics states that heat travels from hot bodies to cooler bodies and not the opposite. If for example a hot oven is placed in a cold room the oven will warm the room, this is because heat will be transferred from the hot oven to the cold room. Never will the amount of heat originally in the room cause the oven to get hotter. This transfer of heat between the oven and the room will continue until the oven has used up all its fuel source (e.g. a gas cylinder) . When that point is reached the oven will start to cool until such a point when the temperatures of both the oven and the room become equal. To calculate the amount of time during which the oven will continue to warm the room we need to know two things: 1- The amount of gas left in the cylinder. 2- The rate at which gas is consumed. If for example there is 5000 c.c. (cubic centimetres) of gas left in the cylinder and the oven uses up 100 c.c. every hour, with a simple division we find that the oven will continue to warm the room for 50 hours (we will call this stage A). After 50 hours the oven will start to cool till a point is reached where the temperatures of the oven and the room are equal (we will call this stage B). Now let us apply this to the universe as a whole. We know that the total amount of energy in the universe is equal to the sum of energy in all the stars, galaxies, and all other bodies containing mass. This is a finite amount no matter how large it is. These stars will continue to radiate heat, light and other types of radiation into the vast space of the universe, in the same way in which the oven would warm the space inside the room. So if we think of all the stars and all other active bodies in the universe as the ovens, and the vast space of the universe as the empty room we can deduce the following: From what is known about the life and death of stars in modern theories of cosmology, it is known that they would continue to radiate energy until they consume all their resources. To be precise, when all the hydrogen, that constitutes the vast majority of the mass of stars, has been converted into helium and other heavier elements in a process of continuous nuclear reactions. After that stage, some stars explode in what is known as super novae and give birth to second generation stars, but eventually when all energy is used up, the stars collapse and end up as cold dead bodies. Since the amount of matter in the universe (in the form of stars, nebula, quasars.....etc.) is finite (First law of thermodynamics: conservation of matter), then these energy sources will radiate energy into the universe for a finite length of time. In our example of the oven and the room we calculated that time to be 50 hours. Theoretically, and if we can calculate the total amount of energy in the universe, and also the rate of consumption of energy, we can also calculate the length of time (although obviously not as accurately as in the case of the oven) in which the stars will continue to radiate energy. For argument's sake, let us assume that the universe will continue to radiate energy for another 50 billion years. Since there is still plenty of energy available in the universe we are still in stage A. Now if we go back to our original debate, and try to decide whether the universe had a beginning or has it always been there, we can quickly reach the conclusion that if it had always been there, or in mathematical terms if the age of the universe goes back to infinity, it should have been a cold and dead place by now simply because infinity, is a larger number (if it can be called so) than 50 billion years.. If the age of the universe is infinity, we should have been at stage B a long time ago,. The accuracy of the figure 50 billion is of no importance to the end result, for whatever figure we chose to make it, it will always be less than infinity. What that means is that the universe had a definite beginning. That beginning, for argument's sake, being less than 50 billion years ago. The birth of new stars in the universe does not affect our analysis, they are not born out of the void, they are merely a conversion of hot gases into hot new stars, or as shown above, second or third generation stars. Their birth is not an addition to the total amount of matter that already exists in the universe. The total amount of matter remains constant. After a time all the hot gases in the universe will be used up and no new stars will be born.. As for the newly born stars, they too will eventually consume all their energy and die. This analysis confirms that the universe had a definite beginning. But \"thermodynamics\" is not the only branch of science to provide evidence in support of a beginning to the universe, for recent discoveries in space and cosmology also confirm that the universe had a definite beginning called the Big Bang. This was first confirmed by the discovery of the background radiation in 1965 by two American astronomers, then later by COBE (Cosmic background explorer satellite) that proved beyond any doubt the theory of the Big Bang. The Big Bang theory states that sometime between 14 and 20 billion years ago all the matter in the universe originated from an extremely dense concentration of matter and space that exploded outwards giving birth to all the galaxies and other heavenly bodies that comprise the universe as we know it today. The theory of the Big Bang was given its final seal of approval through the discovery that the universe is expanding. This necessarily means that if we were to go back in time the universe would be contracting until it would reach a point from which it all started, and that takes us back to the Big Bang. Now if we accept that the universe had a definite beginning, the next step would be to debate whether that beginning was caused by an intelligent power or by mere chance. Second Debate Was the universe created or is it merely an act of chance? Once again, we refer to the first law of thermodynamics (conservation of matter) which states that \"Matter cannot be created nor destroyed\". What that means is that all that we are able to do is convert one form of substance to another. We can never create matter from nothing, and similarly we cannot turn matter into nothing. Trees are brought down to make wood and paper, sand is used in the making of glass.........etc., but we can never create wood or glass out of vacuum. Similarly we cannot completely destroy wood or glass, for even if we burn wood, we are only converting it to ashes and gases that are given off in the process. We have also shown that all matter had a definite beginning or a moment in time when it came to exist, the moment when the universe was created. By joining these seemingly contradicting statements together: 1- Since the universe had a definite beginning, we can say that it was created. 2- Laws of physics state that matter cannot be created! Therefore, it is only rational to say that the universe was created by a power that is above and independent of the laws of physics as we know them. That power is clearly not restricted or confined to the basic laws of physics but far superior. And since this power is independent of the physical universe and all its laws, we can say that this power cannot be of a physical essence. It is also justifiable to expect this power not to have had a beginning because the concept of a beginning, and for that matter time in general, has been shown to be a dimension of the physical universe only. In his \"Theory of relativity\", Einstein stated that time, space and matter were all created when the universe was born, and that before that moment time did not exist. It is not easy for the human mind to envisage the concept of \"no time\", but if one accepts that time is only a dimension of the physical world the idea becomes more acceptable. Further still, and since the universe had a definite beginning before which nothing existed, then such an awesome event (the creation of the universe) cannot be attributed to chance, since before that initial moment of creation nothing existed, not even chance. The only rational explanation for this argument is that there exists a superior non-physical power responsible for creating and maintaining this universe. a- The Mechanical argument The mechanical argument is also in support of the concept of a creator. The 'Third law of Motion' by Isaac Newton states: \"For every action there is a reaction, equal to it and opposite in direction.\" Everything that has moved was moved by something else. If we go back in time, tracing everything to its original mover, we would ultimately arrive at that which was not moved by anything else. That analysis will also lead us to the unavoidable conclusion of an initial Creator. b- Entropy and Disorder Everything of order left unattended gradually moves to disorder. If one builds a house and leaves it unattended, in a few weeks it will become full of dust. In thirty years or so the paint will start falling off the walls. After two hundred years or so some of the walls will start to weaken and crack. If we leave the house unattended for a thousand years or so, the whole house will be flat to the ground. In other words, and if left unattended, any organised structure or system will eventually move to disorder. Never will chaos suddenly spring into a system. A house will never spring into being of its own doing. So if you say that entropy is a measure of disorder, and that nature tends toward maximum entropy for any isolated system, then you do have some insight into the ideas of the second law of thermodynamics.  If we try to analyse what has actually happened on earth we realise that it was quite remarkable. When the earth was first formed it was a very hostile hot planet with no form of life whatsoever. Gradually simple forms of life evolved leading all the time to more complex forms of living creatures and culminating in the appearance of mankind. The trend has been reversed, instead of things crumbling they have in fact developed all the time to higher forms of existence. Chaos has developed into a system. Has the earth been attended all the time?  In the following diagram, the concept of entropy (2nd law of thermal dynamics) tells us that the right hand box of molecules happened before the left. It is amusing, to put it mildly, to observe man so full of vanity thinking he is the master of everything merely because he is given some intelligence to discover some of the laws of the universe. In reality, man has no authority in setting or altering such laws. With the aid of the physical senses, man is given a view over a divine masterpiece, but considering the human being is a mere spectator within the huge universe, he can indeed be very pompous! c- The laws of probabilities The laws of probability offer another interesting argument: If we throw two dice, the chance of obtaining double 6 is (1 in 36). What this means is that on average if we throw the dice 360 times, the chances are that we should get double 6 around 10 times (and 100 double six's in 3600 throws ... etc). Now if we throw the dice 3600 times and we obtain double 6 every single throw then there is a design, a system or a controlling force behind the throws. We cannot call this a coincidental occurrence. The science of Genetics offers vivid evidence that chance could not be a factor in the process of creation due to the very precise combinations necessary in the building of cells. These requisite combinations defy all laws of probabilities. On a larger scale, We only need to look at the universe to be able to marvel at the endless examples of precision and beautiful design. Every field of scientific knowledge seems to testify to the existence of a master creator. It does not seem difficult to dismiss the possibility of chance. There is so much symmetry in the universe to be able to go through all of it, but one particular design has special appeal,. And that is the Macro/Micro pattern. d- The Macro/Micro patterns If we look at the universe at large we find that it is composed of vast areas of empty space and also other areas containing shapeless matter in the form of hot gases plus dark matter and already formed stars and other bodies. These stars group together to form galaxies. Our galaxy, \"The Milky Way\" has within it no less than 100 billion individual stars. Our star, the sun, has nine planets in orbit around it. Many of these planets have a number of moons again in orbit. The basic force that governs the movement of all these bodies is gravity. The moons rotate around their planets, which all rotate around the mother star, which in our case is the sun. Similarly, all these stars rotate round the centre of gravity of the galaxy. Galaxies group together to form clusters of galaxies, and once again individual galaxies rotate round the centre of gravity of the cluster. Clusters group together to form super clusters, and these obey the same laws. Super clusters are the largest units in the universe as we know it today. However, and if we proceed in the opposite direction, we notice that the similarity is truly remarkable. If we look at the other end of the scale and examine the atom which is the smallest form of substance able to exist in a chemical reaction, we find that it is composed of electrons revolving round a nucleus, in the same way as stars rotate round the centre of gravity of their galaxies. Are we but seeing the finger prints of the creator? ___________________________ If one searches one can surely find God. God's signs in His creation are all around us. It was very naive when the first man in space, the Soviet astronaut Yuri Gagarin, said when he was high in orbit around the earth: \"Where is God? I do not see him!\" It seems ironic though that he met his death in a helicopter accident, still in the air, where he could not find his maker! No doubt he found Him now! If we accept that the creation of the universe must have been the work of a supreme intelligent power, we are faced with another puzzle and that is: How many gods are there? Is God one, or could there be more than one god? ",
