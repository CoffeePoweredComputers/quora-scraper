            "answer_text": "Ofcourse, they both are crucial factors in the study of human behavior, since much of it is influenced by a person's beliefs, values, attitude etc. Faith and belief are both instrumental in healing people from the chaos in mind. For instance, it is the beliefs of individuals that are used as the targets in CBT ( a therapeutic technique to help with disorders) in order to replace distorted thinking patterns formed out of belief or faith where maladjusted behavioral patterns emerge from, with a new set of beliefs for a peaceful mind. Priming and placebo effect explains how beliefs play an important role in our psyche. Spiritual Psychology uses faith as a point which can be a source as well as a remedy for the inner state of confusion, despair or meaninglessness. In a nutshell, I would say wherever humans are involved, beliefs and faith are inevitably a part of phenomenon since it has a huge impact over cognition. I hope it explains you well for now. :) ",
