            "answer_text": "Other people have for sure said this but\u2026 Bertrand Russell\u2019s A History of Western Philosophy does a wonderful job of explaining and introducing the philosophy you most likely are looking for. If you\u2019re thinking Eastern, there\u2019s, of course, The Tao of Pooh which is very easy to understand, short, and, as an added bonus, funny. It\u2019s not as broad as Russell\u2019s but it\u2019s a great start nonetheless. If you want to take the fictional route, I recommend The Stranger by Albert Camus. I think this might have been the book that initially got me into philosophy in the first place. Plus it\u2019s short. Also, I know this is about books, but if you\u2019re a podcast person (I am), then you should definitely check out Stephen West\u2019s Philosophize This! podcast. Stephen is great at explaining philosophy and he starts right from the beginning. On top of that, he\u2019s super committed! He uploads the transcript to every episode of his podcast and has extra background information on his website (Philosophize This!). He\u2019s got a good voice too (not that that\u2019s important but it\u2019s a bonus). Wish you luck! ",
