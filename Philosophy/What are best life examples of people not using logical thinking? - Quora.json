            "answer_text": "Anchoring: Humans rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered when making decisions (even if the information has nothing to with the decision). Example: People are more likely to buy something if it is 50% off. Logically, the historical price should be irrelevant, only the current price should be relevant. Misvalued time: People are more willing to spend time to get money than to spend money to get time. Example: Scenario A: Let\u2019s say a person is willing to work for $10 an hour, but not $9 an hour. Scenario B: The same type of person is usually not willing to spend $8 extra for a 1 hour faster train ticket (even after adjusting for the enjoyment level of each activity etc). In scenario A he values his time at over $9 an hour. In scenario B he values his time at under $8 an hour. Logically they should be the same. Correlation does not imply causation Example: If a study suggests that people who drink red wine live longer, it does not imply that wine makes you live longer. For example it could also mean that people who drink red wine on average have healthier food and exercise habits, or that people who drink wine on average are richer (not because of the wine) and therefore have access to better healthcare. Gamblers fallacy: The incorrect belief that separate, independent events can affect the likelihood of another random event. Example: If a fair coin lands on heads 10 times in a row, the belief that it is \"due to the number of times it had previously landed on tails\" is incorrect. Loss aversion: People experience more pain from loosing $10 than happiness from gaining $10. Example: All gamlers who are down for the day and continue to play to get unstuck.
