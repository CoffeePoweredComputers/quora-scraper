Rajagopalachari (informally called Rajaji or C.R.,  on bhajagovindam. \u201cAdhi Shankaracharya wrote a number of vedantic works for imparting knowledge of the self and the universal spirit. He also composed a number of hymns to foster Bhakthi in the hearts of men. One of these hymns is the famous Bhaja govindam.The way of devotion, is not different from the way of knowledge or gyana. When intelligence matures and lodges securely in the mind, it becomes wisdom. When wisdom is integrated with life and issues out in action, it becomes bhakthi. Knowledge, when it becomes fully mature is bhakthi. If it doesnot get transformed into bhakthi, such knowledge is useless tinsel. To believe that jnana and bhakthi, knowledge and devotion are different from each other, is ignorance.If Sri Adi Shankara himself who drank the ocean of jnana as easily as one sips water from the palm of one's hand, sang in his later years, hymns to develop devotion, it is enough to show that jnana and bhakthi are one and the same. Sri Shankara has packed into the Bhaja govindam song, the substance of all vedanta, and set the oneness of jnana and bhakthi to melodious music.\u201d sloka1:seek the essence of spirituality now,because when we are going to die nothing comes in hand not even the property and not even the happiness that one have shared before , earn things those are necessary for life not exceeding life ,even the feelings you get like love,anger,envy,embarrassment nothing comes with us its just your soul thats with you will come with you,,make your soul divine by chanting GOVINDA!!! sloka2:One has to extirpate the desire of earning money,here  money is prerequisite but the desire of earning is extirpate. The desire is the root cause that needs to be uprooted ,for example  consider two guys comes to an friend's house and he offers them half a cup of coffee each and one drinks the cup of coffee with dissatisfaction thinking that \u201che just gave half cup\u201d and other drinks with pleasure thinking  that \u201ci did not even expect that he offers coffee but he offered half cup\u201d,so same half cup of coffee is making two different feelings here,so the way you think is the root cause,if that is the root cause then you can limit your desires by controlling your soul sloka3:In this sloka he elucidates the interference of women in the mens life ,the difference between men and women is the structure of the flesh meat ,,the flesh of the women is designed so that men get attracted to the flesh ,,but when we think in divine matter it is flesh of meat and nothing else,,so the one should control their desires to run for that flesh because god did not give the capability to think for the animals so they mate in improper way,but in case of man he gave the thinking capability so he should mate only to make ecological pyramid run and not to run for the desires ,,because its just the matter of skin!!!The allurement towards woman's physical beauty or the physical fitness or body-building of man will fade away with the passage of time.                                                       to be continued ,,,,,,,,, ",

True, these Slokas, do contain vedanta, meant for a person who is immersed in worldly affairs. So that he can understand material things, do vichara[enquiry] and inculcate Bhati, leading to Moksha.
