If you have known, this question won't be asked here. This is not simple question which can be answered by anyone, even those who can they will also laugh and leave you with your question. If you are willing to know this one life in its full depth and dimension you should stop believing that you know anything about it. This single life is the basis of our body and all physical forms and life whether known or unknown, manifested or unmanifested around us. To know this one life it requires your time and life and constant pursuit of seeking truth and above all grace. Without realising immensity of one life thinking about hundred life is nothing more than your imagination. This one contains billions life within or billions and one are the one and same. It is upon you whether you seek it or not. ",

            "answer_text": "I think we do that almost every day. You are a different person talking yo your parents, an entirely different person with your siblings and similarly to every person you have a conversation for 10\u201315 mins ot more, you live a different life as you attribute yourself with different names. Same is the case with the things you do, when you are drawing you are an artist, while studying you are a student.  According to me the question should be \u201chow\u201d should we live 100s of lives. The answer would be with immense gratitude and self-expression. Talk to new interesting people, do new awesome things, learn music, art, dance, programming, maths, physics, banking, what ever you feel like doing. Hundreds of live all fun, satisfying and most importantly worth spending your life. Do what your gut says! And what ever problems arrive your way logically figure them out. Life's Fun! ",
