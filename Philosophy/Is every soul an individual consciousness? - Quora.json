            "answer_text": "And this is everybody\u2019s experience: when something spiritual enters, body [in the womb] starts functioning, and when it exits body stops functioning, which means something not physical, a spirit factor, is the more important than body parts! That is why we sense that complete whole is more complete than just the sum of its parts, as the word \u201cholistic\u201d being defined: \u201cThe view that an organic or integrated whole has a reality independent of and greater than the sum of its parts.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary) That means there is an invisible spirit entity that hold all the parts, organs and body systems together and that make me feel I am constitutionally whole, because of which I know that I am more than this body, something of higher energy. No wonder Yoshinori Ohsumi, Nobel Laureate in Physiology and Medicine, said in his acceptance lecture in December 2016: \u201cLife is an equilibrium state between synthesis and degradation of proteins.\u201d In similar vein, French physiologist, Claude Bernard, wrote: \u201cStability of internal environment (in the body) is the condition for free and independent life.\u201d Words such as coordination, connecting, equilibrium, synthesis, stability, design\u2026 all point to the work of something higher and spiritual. The way it functions shows that every soul an individual consciousness. This explains why some marriages collapse when a partner discovers the best-kept secret of his/her spouse accidently. Keeping secret from the loyal partners/friends is not possible if every soul is not an independent entity. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes! Every individual soul is a part of that potential divine residing within the body and brain in the form of a \u2018Witnessing Self\u2019. It is that real self within the illusory self. The soul is a step down from the cosmic spirit of awareness, because of being individualized. It is in between the personal and the transpersonal cosmic spirit. It is that impartial witness, which radiates individually in order, to make your mind aware and conscious. Even though the soul is independent of every activity of the mind, it still creates a subject/object relationship with the cosmos and the mind - dualism. It may be the highest indicator signifying that the creator and creation are one, but being within an individual, it has to eventually dissolve back into that total and absolute cosmic awareness after death.
