            "answer_text": "Yes. It\u2019s the whole speech Rhett Butler gives about them (he and Scarlett) not being a gentleman or a lady and about being hard and though, selfish and after what they want. They don\u2019t get it because they lack empathy. Instead they figure others are just too silly or \u2018weak\u2019 when they obey requisite of decency. They don\u2019t really understand decency (toward others) as a thing that stands on its own without pressure or intimidation. That\u2019s why Melanie is such a puzzling and disturbing presence in Scarlett\u2019s life. Althought she does get the hint, she chooses to ignore it. As for Rhett, he bows to her but he may simply attribute her dispositions to the fact of her being \u2018a real woman\u2019. But the main argument is Ashley Wilkes as he is presented as weak, useless and contemptible (despite being her love interest because he is dreamy) and he just so happens to be an abolitionist as well\u2026 So he is presented as effeminate because it is not acceptable contrary to Melanie to be concerned about the well being of others. So they generally figure it\u2019s some kind of defect in the \u2018normal\u2019 selfish mecanisms that drive one\u2019s actions. Between the lines and in line with the depiction of the black population in the book, you can clearly read, slavery : o.k. Paying regular wages to workers in the wood mills Scarlett O\u2019hara runs : unacceptable. She does not even consider it as a legitimate way of doing things. Paying the labor ? Who does that. She is estranged to that notion. So, slaves are no longer available ? Then we\u2019ll have convicts take theirs places, that is the new solution put forward. And when we\u2019ll see evidence that they are worked to death, we\u2019ll just have to look the other way. What else can we do ? They are the smaller fish that their handler (who fallows the same logic as Scarlett when he figures how else is he going to get rich if he doesn\u2019t skim the money allocated for food ?) gets as ressources for his own social climbing ambitions. Their status permits this to occur, just as the former slaves\u2019 status as \u2018black\u2019 did permit the abuse. So, their logic is : change your status if you want to be treated decent, otherwise it\u2019s open season. ",

            "answer_text": "HI OP! Wow, a lot of GWTW questions on Quora lately. So nice to see people taking an interest in a book and a film that was written in the 1930s. No, GWTW does not glorify either racism or slavery. People who try to dismiss the historical quality of the novel ignore the fact that Margaret Mitchell, as the granddaughter of people who lived through the Civil War, gives a much more accurate picture of what life was like in the time period she was writing about than an historian would have. She understood the mores and the mindset of white Civil War era Georgians. She didn\u2019t need to be an historian; she grew up in the presence of living history and she was essentially writing about her own culture. Just because we may not agree with her views does not mean her depiction of that era was not historically accurate. That is why, as a person of color, can appreciate GWTW. In my youth I just thought it was a great novel but as I get older I see it as an historical time capsule, a window into the lives and the customs of a long-gone generation. Have a great week! ",

            "answer_text": "Most works about slavery had an agenda. Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin was written to help abolish slavery. After 1865, books and movies furthered the agenda of their time. Neo-abolitionism began with Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, a fugitive slave novel. Mark Twain criticized post-War and Jim Crow injustices, but to do so set his tale in the Old South. Vehement objection to slavery, well after others decided the issue with iron and blood, is usually a commentary on perceived contemporary injustices. The very early movie The Birth of a Nation melodramatically depicts Reconstruction from the Ku Klux Klan perspective, at a time the Klan held considerable political power. Gone With The Wind glorified the Old South and Plantation Myth, espoused the paternalistic view of slavery, and did not dwell on the inhumane side. In 2001, a parody of Gone With The Wind appeared, Wind Done Gone by Alice Randall, a Writer-in-Residence at Vanderbilt University. Wind Done Gone parodies Margaret Mitchell\u2019s portrayal of blacks as inferior, one-dimensional creatures and counters the Plantation Myth from the perspective of Scarlett O\u2019Hara\u2019s mulatto half-sister, who is sold by her father.
