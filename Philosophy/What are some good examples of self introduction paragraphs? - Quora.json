            "answer_text": "\u201cCRASH! The Steinway smashed to the ground a scant yard from Henry\u2019s head, spearing lances of shattered wood and deadly shards of blasted metal through the air. Henry lurched back, impacting the wall hard enough to knock the breath out of him. What did the angry piano dealer, Jasper, really want? Was One-Eye\u2019s strange message credible, or even comprehensible? And could he really trust the sweet-eyed librarian, Jane Russell, who smiled just maybe a little too urgently? One thing the policeman-turned-piano-tuner knew: things were never going to be the same.\u201d I don\u2019t write this sort of stuff. But you get the idea. What the hell is going on here? Do you want people to turn a page over to get at least some of the answers? Well, give them a clue: maybe a search for Jasper, whose studio has suddenly disappeared for some reason. Is Jane an allied secret agent or an enemy agent\u2026 or just a librarian? Is One-Eye a dissident looking for sanctuary, a disguised allied agent, or an enemy operator looking to confuse and trap the man who had killed his brother? Or was he really only the deluded lollipop-seller on the corner of Carter Street and Church Lane that he appeared? If you are hoping to sell a manuscript to a publisher for the first time, you have to go through the slush-pile. The copy editor has thousands of books to read. If yours doesn't grab-grab-GRAB at least for a few pages, he or she is going to drop it in the trashcan if it doesn\u2019t make them want to read on. Make the copy editor WANT to know what\u2019s on the next page. Trim unneeded words: excess adjectives (come on, we\u2019ve all done it, including me. Adverbs, too.) ANY WORDS THAT DON\u2019T ADD TO THE STORY, DELETE! \u201cI did,\u201d she blushed. \u201cWhat?\u201d he blurted. \u201cCome on,\u201d he snarled. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d he bleared. WHAT? Have you ever heard of \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d? Do you know what it means? Every time you stop to say, \u201cshe said\u201d, or \u201cit was really great\u201d or \u201cFreida's team won\u201d as prose, you are yanking the reader out of what should feel like a movie to the reader. Imagine all these sorts of words are narrative: it would annoy you after a while. You can\u2019t avoid \u201cMary said\u201d or the like sometimes, but please, keep it to that. Mary blushed. \u201cWho told you that?\u201d works better than, \u2018\u201cWho told you that?\u201d Mary blushed\u2019, because \u201cMary blushed\u201d as a statement is something the main character can see, rather than a strange new vowel you, the reader, have to imagine. Your first paragraph MUST want the copy editor to want to read to the second page, then on to the third, and so on. Above all, just WRITE. Maybe people will love your first book. Maybe they won\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t make you a failed writer: just a writer. I was spoiled by having my first book published: that\u2019s not bragging. I now have a meme based on my first two books: L. H. Franzibald. Thanks, guys. I has arrived. To paraphrase Rocky Horror with regard to editors: \u201cI didn\u2019t MAKE him for you!\u201d ",

A crude thought crossed his pristine mind, interrupting a career move he\u2019d been plotting. He grabbed his towel and headed off for a cold morning shower.\u201d A Fever in Paradise - Ruth Hessey What makes a good opening paragraph? You have to grab the reader\u2019s attention, catapult them to the heights of interest in order for them to read it and KEEP reading. Use humour, intrigue, vividness, drama, slapstick, whatever, or a hybrid of these, to achieve it. It\u2019s like an audition for drama school. You have to be good in the first ten seconds or you\u2019re out. Or a cover letter for a job interview. You have to grab the employer\u2019s interest in the first sentence/paragraph to put you in the \u201cyes\u201d pile. Don\u2019t stuff around. Be bold, have flair, be felicitous. Pique interest, curiosity. As Billy Wilder said, \u201cYou gotta grab \u2018em by the throat and never let \u2018em go.\u201d ",
