            "answer_text": "\u201cTo become happy, a person must live a virtuous life\u201d Firstly, I\u2019m not sure I believe in happiness. Happiness isn\u2019t real. People spend their lives \u201cchasing\u201d it, but I do not believe happiness as a permanent state of existence isn\u2019t possible. Sure people feel happy when they laugh, or when they find out that they have been given a rare job opportunity, but it doesn\u2019t last. Happiness is only a temporary emotion. It\u2019s a positive one, but temporary either way. I googled the word virtuous and the synonyms that came up were: righteous, good, moral, ethical. What comes to mind when I think of this and how it relates to how Socrates\u2019 believes happiness is achieved, is the fact that the concept of morality is subjective. We do not all perceive life through the same lense. Our biological makeup and life experience is where we develop our beliefs, which influences the way we think, act, and behave. We all have our idea of who we want to be or become. If we aren\u2019t living our lives according to our idealized version of \u201cgood person\u201d, we aren\u2019t living a true life. I think that authenticity is the key to have we can achieve this or \u201cbe\u201d this. ",

How do we expect a person to rejoice and to enjoy himself while his children are abused, while his brothers and sisters are hungry and while his friends are oppressed? Every abused child is our own child, every hungry person is our brother or our sister, every oppressed person is our friend. How can we ask a person to rejoice and to enjoy himself while his sons and daughters are lost? Every son or daughter who are searching the internet for the true word of God and are being misled to the wrong teachings by the bad teachers are our lost sons and daughters The right way to be happy and content is by feeding the hungry, by defending the oppressed, by clarifying the truth, by establishing justice, and by helping those who struggle to survive ",

            "answer_text": "I think the way people become happy and how they pursue their happiness can be different for everybody. People can choose that which is not virtuous, as described by Socrates or other philosophers, feel satisfied, and decide to continue this attitude in life. Moreover, one can have different opinions as to virtues and as a result, choose not to come to terms with living a life in accordance with putative virtues. Therefore, Socrates\u2019 view of happiness mentioned in the question can be valid for some people, but not for everybody. ",

            "answer_text": "Since Socrates himself cannot arrive at a conclusion on \u2018the definition of \u2018 Virtue\u2019, in his dialogue with Meno, could we therefore ascribe happiness as a limb of virtue ? Such a line of reasoning does seem pedantic but if we preclude reason as a means of arriving at a conclusion, we could instinctively equate happiness as an attribute of virtue. Since virtue is a positive quality and happiness being the same, a virtuous life would generate a good feeling so to speak, in a person who practices such edifying attributes.. ",
