            "answer_text": "What are President Trump's moral standards? Yes, Trump IS vulgar and undignified. So what. I will support and will work to defeat any leftist who puts their interests above the interests of America. That is what the left has done prior to the election. When I look at the mirror, I see the same demeanor in me as well as in President Trump, He is loyally in love with the American people and not to the Politician, President Trump is the disrupter who the American people voted for. So, say anything you want about this president - I get it - he can be vulgar, he can be undignified at times. I do not care. President Trump fight for the American People and we cannot spare this man. He fights for America! The Left has been engaged in a war against America since the rise of the Children of the \u201860's. To them, it has been an all-out war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale.. It has been a war they\u2019ve fought with violence, the threat of violence, demagoguery and lies from day one \u2013 the violent take-over of the universities \u2013 till today. The problem is that, through these years, the Left has been the only side fighting this war. While the Left has been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way, the Right has continued to act with dignity, collegiality and propriety. But, when you see a man come down the golden escalator, he is here for a reason. This man who is not a politician, defeated sixteen other politicians, has called out how both parties have betrayed the middle class, American people. This man has beaten the media, Bushes, the Clintons, voter fraud, deep state and big tech. Gets spied on, becomes president, and they launch the fake Russian collusion, Mueller probe., the Dossier, and gets impeached, He moves the embassy to Jerusalem, walks away from the Iran deal, defeats ISIS, three Noble Peace Prize nominations, the most prolife president since Lincoln. (Charlie Kirk) With Donald Trump, this all has come to an end. Donald Trump is America \u2019s first wartime president in the Culture War. And the left dont like it! ",

            "answer_text": "I see only self serving actions that show that he has no control over what needs to be done as the president , and now it seems he\u2019s scrambling to get another term just cause he\u2019s still in the mind frame of a billionaire with the Trump brand to promote and I\u2019m sure in his eyes he feels that losing re election will somehow damage the Brand \u2026. My opinion is that if it\u2019s more important to do that then he shouldn\u2019t have bought his way into office (\ud83d\ude0f) / ran for office in the first place \u2026. It\u2019s important that we as a whole are the deciding factor and he was the better choice of the candidates but we should\u2019ve stood up and said \u201cNONE OF THE ABOVE\u201d instead of settling , but clearly he wasn\u2019t prepared or capable of letting his brand take a backseat while he ran the country. This shows them that we are weak as voters and all this COVID stuff was a tool to test out how much control they have over the populous .. I don\u2019t doubt virus is real but it was known that it was deadly and yet it got out and there wasn\u2019t even a vaccination in the works already to prevent or limit the diseases progress which is a red flag cause being ahead of any virus is the only way to beat it into non existence and in several years of knowing it would be Dangerous if it got out to the masses as it has, there should have been treatments already in trials before it ever struck. None of these people we\u2019ve elected to govern us care about anything but their goals and agendas which have nothing to do with what their duty\u2019s are supposed to be \u2026 old money family\u2019s in this world can\u2019t stand the overnight millionaires in the markets last 20 or more years so this was a play to throw them back to poverty and discourage the masses from the drive to prosper cause that\u2019s not allowed unless your tapped to succeed by them \u2026 its a theory but it\u2019s a viable one and has been reality in these types of people\u2019s minds and we let them stomp us down without a fight \u2026 trump is a businessman , not a politician and he\u2019s the puppet that was put in office to test us and see how much control they really have over us and it\u2019s a scary world now because of it ! It\u2019s not a conspiracy that happened behind our backs either , cause this has mostly been in front of our eyes and we are to blame as much as it is shameful that selfish serving people are how they are .
