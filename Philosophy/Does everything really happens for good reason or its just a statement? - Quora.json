            "answer_text": "This one is really a good question . It\u2019s a great question cuz I will try to open up many things here through ur fabulous question . Nope.. Not at all. See the nature of ur Karmas. Watch Urself . There is nothing in this world standing or Happening with out reason or a Logic behind it. Now coming to a more Elaborate reply of ur question \u2026 Every thing which happens is a result of his/her Karmas. Nothing happens for only good purpose & Automatically . There are reasons which leads to the results of Ur Karmas. There are so many Things & forces behind every work which goes together . I gives u an e.g. .. Did u think that we Bharatvanshi ( Whole bharatvarsh )which was spreaded to combodia ,Beyond Afghanistan & even whole of Russia & many more regions were under Bharat\u2019s belt & even then we got ruled by merely a tribal goons of Islam & bunches of evil brains of Britishers. It happened Cuz of lots of bad decisions & our own brotherhood clashes lead to partition of our Single kingdom in -to several other kingdoms . Things dint stopped over there. We furtherly got divided in-to other thousands of small kingdoms and this process killer our Id. And then slowly & steadily we got slaves at the hands of Britishers , Muslims & even Portuguese ruled Us. Did u think it happened for good reasons ..? I comes to another e.g .. We all are here as members of Quora & all have to reply in English . Why..? Why we are bounded to do so ..? Is it a right thing ..? We had n still have a great culture n civilization . Our Sanskrit n Hindi languages are more richer & most ancient then any other language existing in Universe .But English culture n western way of living style is killing our roots of Vedas lessons & our Epics authenticity. Is this happening for right Reasons..? Why not we stand Up together & makes a more knowledgeable group then Quora , Where even Vedas preachings & our heroes & lords cud be remberered & followed in a more constructive way . But none of us here trying . Here people are fighting over Evil forces . And ready to humiliate the characters of Ramayana & Mahabharata . People are comparing lords with evil characters . People here fighting over Lord Mahadev & Lord Vishnu . They are humiliating our civilization n culture for nothing . Just for the sake of their satisfaction n false perceptions & beliefs they are killing our own Roots. Is this all bullshit happening for good reasons . ? No..A big no . And it all shall be stopped . It\u2019s just a statement made by fools & those who wanted to wait for Lord Mahadev & Krishna to come & do their Karmas . They just left everything on god . It means 97% people here too makes sluggish comments & have never read Bhagwad Geeta\u2019s ultimate knowledge of Enlightenment. I can\u2019t give n put better reply n logics for ur Query. It\u2019s for all to think . \u201cThink before Act\u201d is not new quotation,it\u2019s already a lesson given in Ramayan & MB. I hope I have clarified my View. Thanx. ",

            "answer_text": "We generally ask this question when something has happened which we don't like. Well one thing is a fact that everything cannot happen according to our wishes. There are actually very few things which happen as we have wished. But even in those there are some minor lackings. Now what is the solution? One is to curse your destiny as to why it happened. What I did wrong so that this happened to me and all that silly stuff. Another is to correct the course. Rectify your own mistakes and learn from them so that in future these mistakes are not repeated. If it was not your mistake and your compulsions and condition led to this then improving your condition can help. And if someone did this to you then to show strength. Forgive and move on. As time will pass by you will realize that all these have become less important to you and you have become even more mature and stronger. So no nothing ever happens for good or bad. It is we who have to make the best out of everything. ",
