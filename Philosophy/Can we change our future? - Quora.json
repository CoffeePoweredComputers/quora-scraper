            "answer_text": "Yes ,we can definitely change our future .I will give you 2 examples . Example 1: Let's say that if any person is studying in government school is very studious then he will have a better livelihood than a person who is always fooling around. Now the person who studied became an officer while the playful one became a rickshaw driver. Now if the person who was fooling around would have become aware ,changed his decision and studied rather than fooling around then he also would have good livelihood. Example 2 : Thomas Elva Edison, tried 1000 times and invented bulb. Now let's say he would have tried only 1 time or 10 times or 100 times only instead of 1000 times ,then would bulb be invented? Of course not. So because he took the decision of trying and trying until he would succeed that's why he succeeded. A simple formula is that when we make any decision, we must think that how it will impact us in future.If you think that your current behavior isn't good then change it for good ,take right action ,right Decision and your future will change as you will change. Many friends of mine tell me that their astrolgers have told them that their marriage won't be good. I am not saying that astrologers say wrong but you have to understand that what astrology actually says may happen .If you Don't change your bad pointers then something bad may happen.So astrology basically lays down the probability that your marriage won't be good.Maybe that's because you are more argumentive, egoistic. So if you become more sacrificing, loving then your marriage will change. CONCLUSION: If we change ourselves,our habits,take right decions , become aware and take action to Change future THEN FUTURE WILL CHANGE. ",

Meditation is the key to manage thoughts. So if we want to change our FUTURE then we must first work on THOUGHTS which with impact on words, actions, behavior etc will change our FUTURE. \u0935\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092c\u0902\u0927\u0928 \u0939\u0940 \u092d\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928 \u0915\u093e \u0906\u0927\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u0948 \u0914\u0930 \u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092f\u0947 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0924\u0903 \u0939\u0940 \u0939\u094b \u091c\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0964 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u0927\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0935\u093e\u0926 (THANKS FOR READING) ",

In such a case we can call the future uncertain. It may mean all possibilities exist. It\u2019s your choices which define the path to your future destination. So when you think about your future think about it that it\u2019s a destination where you have to reach. Now there may be many roads to reach that place. Some are good roads, some may be bad ones. But you may not know if you don\u2019t have any guide. In that case you have to make certain choices as to which road to take. But don\u2019t be afraid even if you have walked on some very bad roads cause life is such. It\u2019s a mixture of good and bad times, happy and sad times, positive and negative feelings, yin and yang. So rejoice in present moment. Whatever you do give your all. If it was a wrong choice learn from it and step into your future. Just don\u2019t give up. Don\u2019t you think it won\u2019t be fun if you know where you are going. It won\u2019t be adventurous. Uncertainty adds a magic into future which makes us believe that we can make out anything from it. ",
