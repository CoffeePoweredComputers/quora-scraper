            "answer_text": "LOL what a funny question. Yes of course. Some things in life are factual and some things are not. For example, if someone\u2019s opinion that 2+2=5, they would be wrong. However, most everything is not as deductive as mathematics. For example, if we ask \u201cis it hot or cold outside?\u201d. Well, we can objectively say that the temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit. But the observer is what matters here, less so the external world. So one person\u2019s hot might be another person\u2019s cold. I might say, it\u2019s 70 degrees outside and I am cold, and another person would say it\u2019s 70 degrees outside and I feel hot. Both are mostly true. As human beings in the universe, everything is perception, and most \u201ctruths\u201d about the world are simply not independent of our observation. Most people that work in science and engineering realize that there are cold hard truths about the world that are very true no matter what you do. But there are a lot of people on Earth that operate differently and have trouble accepting or recognizing universal truths or objective fact. Those people are bad, LOL. ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean having an opinion on something that has a right or wrong answer, then you're wrong simply by having an opinion, rather than knowing what the answer actually is. You should never have opinions about things that aren't subjective.But if it's a subjective things, then no, it's impossible to have the wrong opinion. You can never be wrong about something that is subjective, because if so then it is objective, not subjective. Subjective things are things that depend on a mind. Therefore, the mind is in charge of it, aswell, so it cannot be wrong. \"Right or wrong\" doesn't even make sense in that context. Objective things, however, do not depend on minds, and minds do not change them. So if the mind is not in line with that thing, then the mind is wrong about it. If you cannot or do not know what is right about it, there is no point in having an \"opinion\" about it, since that would be to treat it as if it was subjective when it isn't. ",

If one is ignorant on something, an opinion could be wrong. For example, if I believed that Disneyworld was in California, and said that it should be moved to South Dakota because California is not good enough for it, part of that opinion is wrong. However, one who is mentally ill may have a wrong opinion due to their condition. One might think that a man named Guy Fieri is the president of the US and was on the ballot. This obviously isn't true, as there wasn't a candidate called Guy Fieri on the ballot in any of the 50 states. ",

Here\u2019s a simple proof: Now that I have stated my opinion, you must either agree with me, disagree with me, or remain undecided. If you agree then we are in agreement, people can have the \u201cwrong\u201d opinion. However, if you disagree with me, you actually prove me correct by believing that my opinion is wrong. Even if you remain undecided, you prove that my opinion is correct because you are acknowledging the possibility that my opinion might be wrong, which of course is only possible if it can be wrong. So the question is decisively answered: Yes, of course they can. ",

Now\u2026if he says\u2026..\u201dTrump is clinically retarded\u201d then you can deem his claim wrong, as it will not stand-up in a medical, objective, psychiatric test.

I would prefer that we not torture children for any reason, but without an absolute moral standard I cannot say it is wrong. No one reading this would say that there are times when rape is beautiful (at least I hope not), so someone holding such an opinion would be said to be wrong without any facts to back them up. ",

Therefore, it differs widely across people and the drifts are even larger among people who are in different environments who do not share common experiences.
