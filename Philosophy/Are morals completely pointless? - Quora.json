            "answer_text": "Morals are what drive a human to do what they think is right. Morals are not needed for an individual, but expect to have a very troublesome life. Why? Ever heard of karma? Well there\u2019s a very select few in this world who were physically born without a \u201cconscious\u201d. Therefore they can commit more heinous things and consciously be okay with it. For people that have genuinely healthy brains, when we do something bad, it tends to stay in our mind. When it stays in our mind, we are not totally focused at the task at hand and our performance suffers. Following morals keeps your mind worry free (for the most part) and able to live an easier, routine life. The hard part about morals is choosing what\u2019s right for you and abiding by them. ",

Similarly, just because there are no precise, objective standards in healthiness doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no such thing as healthy or unhealthy lifestyles. Some things are objectively worse or better for you, both in your actions and in your lifestyle. ",

There is no shortage of people who just \u201cplay to win\u201d which means making themselves and their benefactors wealthier, at the expense of everyone else getting poorer. Using deceit and taking advantage of un-educated people is fair play in their mind, so long as you can maintain plausible deniability. The democrats and mainstream media have been playing it that way for decades, and that\u2019s why the wealth distribution in the USA has reached \u201cobscene\u201d levels.  ",
