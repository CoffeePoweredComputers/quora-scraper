            "answer_text": "The self may define in many ways to prove what exactly you are affecting consciousness is how well you react to the situations, for example If a problem arised if you are not aware of that situation someone said something bad about the situation or about you when you came to know about it, how you feel about it you will feel bad right you can't get or give a chance to others but you want to prove yourself that you are not. But sometimes it may also be like for yourself and your happiness you just don't believe and you will get to know how people are you will accept and understand the situation and you will console yourself, depending on each and every single situation you consciousness will start to react to those situations whether it's a good thing or a bad thing it all teaches you about experiencing.

            "answer_text": "Self is the state at which all the activities of our life are interlinked and automatic and is governed by universal and eternal laws. It is what we call god. Self is in two halves. Positive Self leads to achievement and Negative Self, to satisfaction. This is in contrast to \u2018I\u2019 in which under our control and is left to our whims and fancies. Consciousness is an energy optimizing mechanism of our perceptions, thinking and movements. Thus, Self optimizes energy usage automatically. If we can be hyperconscious of our self we can feel how it works and imitate with our \u2018I\u2019. This is what \u2018Aham Brahmasmi\u2019 means. What god does automatically we can do it manually.
