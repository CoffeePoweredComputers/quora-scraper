            "answer_text": "The location of the Garden of Eden is not in heaven with God but here on Earth as that is where he planted a garden of pleasure from the beginning. The book of Genesis is read by many and misunderstood by many because the original setting of the Genesis story from which Moses derived his version was enclosed by our planetary shell on which we live on the exterior surface. The world of Genesis was located on the interior surface and still is! This image will show you the location of the original home of the human race. The knowledge of its location was lost during the deluge until 1683 when Edmond Halley produced the first of his many papers on the Earth's magnetic field. In 1696 he argued that the earth was made up of a shell and a separate inner core each producing its own magnetic dipole. According to him, it was the motion of the inner core that produced the observed behavior of terrestrial magnetic field of the earth. His postulation was a wake up call for humanity. Although the science community of that time rejected his discovery, it was not until Symmes and Marshall B. Gardener brought the idea that our planet is a spherical shell planet caught up the public and the media up to date. Here is the image of our planet as it is and was according to the book of Genesis!  All the events of Genesis occurred on the interior surface world of the earth. If you read the book of Genesis once again up to the time of the flood, you will come to realize that the existence of the world of Genesis enclosed by a firmament/ landmass before the deluge is not far fetched. The book of Genesis starts by saying that in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Here, there is no timeline, meaning we are not told the time it took God to Create either heaven or earth. Heavens here refers to stars together with their planetary systems. The point here is, the day and night we are experiencing is not part of God's creation in the first day! Then, which day and night that Genesis talks about as being created in the first day? The answer is still within the book of Genesis but we have failed to see it because of the influence of our current environment and the accepted science of our planet. Here is the image of the model of our planet according to Marshall B. Gardener.  The answer is contained in this statement from Genesis,\u201d The earth was without form and void, the spirit of God was moving over the waters in the deep\u2026\u201d \u201c and God said, let there be light and there was light. God separated light from darkness. God saw light was good, the first day\u201d. It is very clear that God was not on the exterior surface of the earth but on the interior surface! Had God been on the exterior surface of the earth, He wouldn't have created light in first day for the sun whose light we are experiencing was still in existence even before the earth was created. We deduct from Genesis that God was within the depths of the earth, a place where darkness was still in existence until God created separated light from darkness in that place in the first day! Don't you agree? In 1913, Marshall B. Gardener published a book titled,\u201dA Journey to the Earth's interior or have the poles really been discovered\u201d. In this book, Marshall B Gardener gives us sufficient evidence to support his theory that our planet is a spherical shell planet with openings to the outside surface through the poles. He used observations made by Polar explorers at and beyond North pole in support of his theory. He used astromical observations made at the poles of many Planets within our solar system. He also used the observations made by Astronomers on the different types of nebula cloud of gases and particles in the universe, he specifically used the existence of shell nebulas in support of his theory. As for gravitational force, the mass of a spherical shell planet is concentrated at the periphery and hence gravitational force is directed towards the centre of mass from either exterior or interior as shown in the last image above. To cut the long story short, you should know that, regardless of what many people believe, hollow earth theorists believe that our planet is a spherical shell planet with openings to the outside surface through the poles and therefore all the events of Genesis took place on the interior surface world of our planet. This is the reasons why the ancient civilizations around the world believed that their ancestors came from within the Earth's interior or the Navel of the earth! This is according to William Fairfield Warren in his book,\u201d Paradise found: The cradle of the human race at the North Pole\u201d. William Fairfield Warren's findings clearly shows that the location of the lost Paradise is beyond the North Pole if we use our understanding of the polar regions using Marshall B. Gardener's Theory.

            "answer_text": "There are multiple biblical descriptions of Eden\u2019s location: In Genesis, it is theoretically located in what is now Turkey, since that\u2019s where the headwaters of the two identifiable rivers from Genesis chapter two - the Tigris and Euphrates - are located (although, contrary to the biblical description, they don\u2019t share a common source). A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin and onyx are also there.) The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.However, in Ezekiel twenty eight the garden of Eden is located on a mythical \u201cmountain of God\u201d, a place of fiery stones and supernatural beings. You were in Eden, the garden of God\u2026 You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones\u2026 and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones.In this mocking lament for the king of Tyre, Ezekiel seems to be alluding to a Canaanite myth about the location of Eden on the \u201cmount of the assembly\u201d, the meeting place of the divine council. In Ezekiel thirty one, however, Eden is in another semi-mythical location: the cedar forest of Lebanon, where the nations are represented by gigantic trees: Consider Assyria, once a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful branches overshadowing the forest\u2026 I made it beautiful with abundant branches, the envy of all the trees of Eden in the garden of God\u2026 I made the nations tremble at the sound of its fall when I brought it down to the realm of the dead to be with those who go down to the pit. Then all the trees of Eden, the choicest and best of Lebanon, the well-watered trees, were consoled in the earth below.When it comes to the Christian bible, the tree of life appears again in Revelation twenty two, but here the image of the paradisiacal garden is replaced by that of the city of God, the \u2018new Jerusalem\u2019 that comes down from heaven to replace the former city that had recently been destroyed by Roman armies. Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of the river stood the tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit, yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.In summary, there is no biblical basis for the suggestion that the garden of Eden is located \u201cin heaven\u201d. References to various terrestrial sites for Eden suggest that we are dealing with mythological rather than geographical locations. ",
