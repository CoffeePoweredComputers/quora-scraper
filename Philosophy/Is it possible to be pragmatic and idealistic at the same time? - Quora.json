            "answer_text": "Yes, it is possible, but depends upon our commitment and perception. If we believe that our aims and the means to achieve them, both should be ideal, then we won't have much problem. Ideals are well-defined, tried and tested.  The practical approach to a problem is time-specific. It varies from person to person, time to time, place to place. The former is value-oriented, while the latter is result-oriented.  The two approaches have been beautifully dealt in our two of the greatest epics--Ramayan and Mahabharat. Ramayan tells us about the importance of idealism over pragmatism and Mahabharat tells the opposite.  It is always difficult to decide and perhaps the best way is an ideal combination of the two, say idealistic pragmatism. ",
