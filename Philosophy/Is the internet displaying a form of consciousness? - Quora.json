            "answer_text": "Minds + Hands make Knives. The knives appear sharp, don\u2019t they? They seem to \u2018possess\u2019 this quality. But ask yourself this question: did any knife ever cut anything by itself? No. Why not? Because hands make knives so that minds can cut. A knife just sitting there is not the same kind of \u2018sharp\u2019 as a knife in a living hand, because it cuts nothing. This is a linguistic deception that is deadly to make concrete. Only the knife in and guided by a hand \u2018is capable of cutting\u2019, and the capability, which language can erroneously place in the knife... was never there. It was in the hands that make and use it, and the minds and purposes that drive them. The sharpness is in the mind and the user, not the implement. Hardness may be local to the knife. But notice that, logically, sharpness is only partly local to the knife. To be hard, it can just sit there. But to cut something it must be wielded. First order phenomenon produce second and third order phenomenon. No tool (3rd order product) becomes a second or first order (process) phenomenon. Ever. Except in language. And this is why so many people will live and die in nearly complete confusion about the properties that objects may possess, which are quite different from those language casually associates with them. One imagines a knife whose \u2018sharpness is intricately self-informing\u2019 such that any application of the knife results in cutting modes that are so sophisticated that they appear \u2018mind like\u2019 to the one wielding this blade. Still, it is an illusion: it doesn\u2019t matter how many knives, edges or symmetries one employs: the \u2018sharpness\u2019 (consciousness) is in the histories, minds, engineers and users \u2014 it cannot subsist in the objects. Ever. No matter how \u2018structurally or connectively sophisticated\u2019 they have been made. You cannot put first order process phenomenon which are generative into their third-order products in the same way you cannot place language as a process or potential... in a word \u2014 no matter what you do.

            "answer_text": "Virtual Collective Consciousness is a process which works between individuals within a social network when their social group takes a life of its own, thinking and acting with one mind, sharing collective emotions. Revisiting Whitacre's \"Cloudburst\" Through The Wisdom Of The Crowd Click here to watch the TED Talk that inspired this post. Sid Mohasseb, the Chief Executive Officer for WiseWindow, described such collective intelligence in http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxOrangeCoast-Sid-Mohasseb-Ex;search:tag:%22tedxorangecoast%22  [Mohassed asserts that it is] the result of the collision of two worlds: the virtual world and the physical world. He said that, \"collective intelligence will drive actions. To date, by large, actions were taken, reactions were measured. That dynamics will change; reactions and desires will be measured first before actions are taken.\" The technological advances that brought together these two worlds crossed the virtual barrier and enabled collaborative (artistic) projects across the globe. Additionally, they boost our capacity to reach a greater level of performance by allowing us to come together for common goals. In this regard, \"Cloudburst\" is simply a compelling picture of McLuhan's \"global village\", a shrinking big world made possible by technological extensions of human consciousness. Consciousness as Integrated Information: a Provisional Manifesto  provides a mathematical framework for assessing consciousness as something which can exist in places other than the human brain.  The challenge of demonstrating the processes operating on the internet among social groups qualify as an Integrated Information Process remains. ",
