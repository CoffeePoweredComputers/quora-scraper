            "answer_text": "When I die, my little boy is going to hurt. He is five years old and he has apraxia. He is just as capable of everything any other kids his age is. He is very intelligent. When his brain sends the signal to his mouth to form words, along the way they don' t make it. His motor skills do not receive the message. He knows the words and thinks and behaves as any other child but lacks the ability to talk. Since he can not speak, he is constantly under strict supervision by my wife and I. He may not ever gain the ability to talk. All that aside, as most little boys, he looks to me as if i am his hero. He emulates everything I do. When he wakes up in the morning and sees me getting ready for work the first thing he does is put his little work gloves on. I have awoken at six in the morning to him sitting next to me with his little gloves on ( backwards or the wrong hand) with my big work boots on his little feet. Waiting for me to wake up. Hoping that if he is ready that he may get to go with daddy. When a child is so dependent on someone and can not communicate; how do you explain to them that you might die? He doesn't know what death is. If he has any thoughts or questions he can't tell us. He is stuck in his head with no way to escape or let us know how he feels. A million unanswered questions. If I die he may not understand. I dont want him to think I left. I dont want him to think it is his fault. I want to be there to protect him and help him. I would not leave if I had a choice. But cancer is not as caring or understanding, and five year olds do not need to know about death and life should never be taken for granted. ",

            "answer_text": "From your question I interpret that you want to stop thinking about one specific thing, as opposed to thinking too many thoughts and hoping to quiet your mind. You can stop thinking about one specific thing by thinking about something else the very moment you catch yourself thinking about that very thing. Simply don\u2019t allow it the time. Many, many years ago I did something embarrassing and for the life of me I couldn\u2019t ever forget about it. Even after years had gone by, the embarrassing memory would just pop up out of no where. Whenever this happened I couldn\u2019t help but cringe at myself. Needless to say this wasn\u2019t good for my self-esteem. As I matured however, I learned that this was a perfectly normal thing - to wallow on embarrassing moments in our lives . We often retain memories more strongly whenever there is a great emotional impact on us. Many of us can\u2019t remember what we ate for dinner last Tuesday but we can easily recall an embarrassing moment in high school for example. The trick is to force yourself to forget. Unless it\u2019s potentially detrimental to your mental health, for simple things like an embarrassing moment, you can simply let the memory fade away. These memories aren\u2019t important. We give them more weight than they deserve. Interestingly, when we think of a memory, we recall the last time that we thought about that memory - not the memory itself. Think of it like making a copy of a movie file, whenever you go to open and view the file, you make a brand new copy and you delete the old one. Memories are like this. If you allow the movie to play itself out, you are making fresh copies - preserving the memory. If you simply refuse to play the movie, that memory will eventually degrade and you won\u2019t be able to view it any more. Every time we play the movie, we form new opinions about it. Over time this can greatly colour the way we think of the original memory, often in a negative, untrue way. Whenever you catch yourself thinking or recalling a memory, simply distract yourself with another thought or activity. The next time you think about that memory again, stop. Distract yourself with another thought or activity. Continue to do this. You will think of that memory less and less, and in time, it will fade away. If you ask me today, what embarrassing moment I let fade away, I could not answer. If I sat down and gave some time for me to retrieve the thought, then it may be possible, but I don\u2019t allow it the time. Using this trick, I allowed those memories to fade away and for me to forget them. This is how you stop yourself from thinking about something. Good luck! ",
