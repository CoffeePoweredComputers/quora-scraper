One theory about human development is that they \u201cself domesticated\u201d, giving up violence (on a relative basis of course) for cooperation. Chimps are more violent than bonobos, who settle disputes with sex. Chimps are along the road toward upright walking, opposable thumbs, and large brains as we no doubt were 6 million years ago (although we don\u2019t understand how the ancestors of chimps and bonobos developed over time since 6 million years ago). Orangs are too solitary and gorillas greater gender ratio body sizes is too different than ours (and they are less close to us than chimps and bonobos). ",
