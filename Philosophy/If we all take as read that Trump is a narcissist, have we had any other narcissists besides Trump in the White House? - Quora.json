ALL to rescue America YOU think that is the definition of being a narcissist? Obama - yes. Broomhilda - certainly. Trump? you need to revisit the definition of the word. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a fantastic student of history, so can only answer generally: most were. I think most leaders are somewhat more narcissistic than average, and it\u2019s likely that the higher one rises in politics (or industry), the more narcissistic. Ambition runs the show, and the less you worry (or even recognize) the downside or fall-out of ambition, the more successful you\u2019re likely to be. One of the elements of NPD is in seeing the world as a game of win or lose. It\u2019s not about building a contented, happy life, it\u2019s about winning. Relationships are tools for achieving ends, not for the benefit of the interpersonal connection. It requires calculation and dispassion, both of which are more difficult to maintain the less narcissistic (or ASPD) someone is. The more empathic, the more attuned you are to the negative consequences of your ambition on others, and the more you\u2019ll avoid those. ",
