Moral of the story: Good and evil don\u2019t exist, what does exist is choice. Any choice that makes us feel good (yes helping others while putting yourself down can feel good) is what\u2019s considered a \u201cGood\u201d choice, and any choice that makes us feel bad is considered an \u201cEvil\u201d choice.
