            "answer_text": "This reminds me of the incident in Mahabharata where drona was killed. It seemed almost impossible to defeat the mighty dronacharya in the kurushketra battle who was one among the best archers ever. If he had continued longer, victory would've been a dream for the pandavas. Then Krishna came up with a plan. The pandavas got to know that the elephant named 'Ashvatthama' was dead. Krishna used this very opportunity and asked yudhisthira to declare that Ashvatthama was dead as yudhisthira never lied and everyone would believe him. He eventually did the same and declared ' Ashvatthama is dead'. Drona got to know about this. His heart was filled with intolerable grief as he believed that his son Ashvatthama was no more, moreover it was declared by yudhisthira who drona knew he would never lie. Eventually Arjuna took advantage of the situation and killed drona. Now did yudhisthira tell a lie? No he didn't. It was a sweet lie to the pandavas, whereas it was the harsh truth to drona which ensured his downfall. What we can see from this episode is, the end result was achieved with conviction without going out of the boundaries. The same can be applied even here because what we call as truth in a worldly context is very much relative and is not absolute. Hence if the end result is what matters to us, we can take advantage of this fact in certain situations. However, if the emphasis is on the process and not the results, it's better not to go for it.

            "answer_text": "Definitely better, which is why lying works. Life runs it's course short term & long term, a lie is typically much better for the short term but as time inevitably marches on, the lie falls like a house of cards in the wind and truth will with stand that. Lying is definitely better in the short term. ",
