            "answer_text": "The best argument for this is posed by philosopher Nick Bostrom: https://www.simulation-argument.com, where you can download and read the paper. It is based on a few assumptions first, for example that we reach a stage to have the proper technology for it, while not exterminating ourselves on the way. These assumptions aren't trivial and you can undermine the argument here already. Still, you've got to give it to him for then coming to the conclusion that we're almost certainly living in a simulation then, since the odds that we do far outweigh the odds we'd live in \u201cthe real world\u201d if you look at it through Bayesian statistics. Essentially it goes like this: suppose you know people \u201cfrom the future\u201d will run an awful lot of simulations about their history, say for example every college and university of every year or term will run such a simulation in their workshop. That would be equivalent to you for example knowing that there's a pile with thousands of \u201cace of spades only\u201d cards, just like you know there are extremely many simulations. You also know there's one single \u201ctwo of hearts\u201d in that large pile, just like you know there must be one real-life universe out there. But then if you pull a card from the pile, like if we look at our universe, it's highly unlikely you're going to get that lonely two of hearts; you're almost certainly holding an ace of spades. And so we're almost certainly living in a simulation if we accept the initial assumptions. The strength of this reasoning, in my opinion, lies more in the reverse: if you think you are not living in a simulation, you're also almost inevitably assuming that the initial propositions are wrong. In other words, we will never reach that technological stage, or for some reason the humanity of the future will never ever have an interest in running simulations of their past. You've got to admit that that is somehow scary. There are plenty of other arguments against it also, for example that those humans in the future will also run representative simulations of their epoch, perhaps to test a new political idea or economic model. But that simulation, being reliable, will also run its own simulations. And you'll end up, as so often in philosophy, with a problem of infinite regress. Furthermore, simulations will require energy and have a certain resolution. With each layer of simulation that will cause more and more problems. ",

            "answer_text": "All the laws of physics are, essentially, logical functions. Logical functions that define relations between logical structures. The ultimate fundamental constituent of the reality can only be a pure logical structure and nothing else. Think of that: We can only know something about reality by creating in our brains logical models of the object/phenomenon we want to know. That means that all we can ever know is the logical structure of the reality. Is there something else, different from a logical structure, that is a constituent of the reality? If something that is not logical will be one of the ultimate constituents of the reality the consequence will be that it will have a completely aleatory behavior. You can\u2019t link/relate illogical elements by logical functions. No repeatability and no patterns can emerge. We couldn\u2019t observe or even know theoretically such an element, not to say that we couldn\u2019t even exist in such a reality. Therefore there could be nothing else than logical structures related to each other by logical functions that ultimately constitute the reality. Logical structures related to each other by logical functions = CODE. Some facts that could reinforce such a conclusion: Time-space seems to be discreet (quantum) and not continuous - like in a computer created dimension.At quantum level the reality seems not to exist if nobody is looking (like in a virtual reality computer game).Big-Bang, the fact that everything came out of nothing, is hard (if not impossible) to explain in the traditional cosmology but it\u2019s the obvious beginning in the simulation hypothesis.Some scientists seem to have discovered in the superstring theory what could be described as the presence of what appear to resemble a form of computer code, called error correcting codes",

            "answer_text": "The premise of the Simulation Hypothesis is not that we definitely ARE living in an artificially compiled reality, but that there is no way that we can know that we are definitely not. The premise is simple. Imagine that our ability to create more and more powerful computing hardware, and more complete and perfect simulation software, continues to grow into the future. There will come a time that we can create a computer simulation of an entire universe that is so perfect that the \u2018people\u2019 that \u2018live\u2019 within this simulation (with real artificial intelligence,) will experience that simulation in exactly the same way as we experience the universe. They will be unaware that they, and their universe are simulated. If allowed to evolve and run it\u2019s course, the \u2018people\u2019 within this simulation will one day reach a level of technological competence where, they too will be able to create a similarly advanced simulated universe on computers within their simulation. Now we have a simulated universe within a simulated universe within a real universe. This cycle of simulation-creation could go on and on indefinitely! So, the problem now raises it\u2019s head. If we agree that the above scenario is possible, then we must also agree that we have no method of determining that it hasn\u2019t already happened. If there could exist a possibly infinite series of simulations within simulations, then the odds that WE just happen to exist in the original \u2018real\u2019 universe, and not one of the enormous number of simulations within simulations, become vanishingly small!

How different is that really from the binary computer language that currently makes virtual reality? Not to mention that every single level of progress could have been undone by regression, or stagnation. What would happen if there's no proper quark alignment? Only up quarks? Or maybe, no electron field? Or, way before that, no impetus for discrete units of unformed energy? The Universe is eternal. Anything is possible. What's improbable is that chaos was ever involved in the formation of anything complex. After all, the Universe at rest, should stay at rest. Thus, all constructs are in rebellion to the simple state which is natural. Anything complex is contrived, precisely because it was unrequired. Nothing was required, rather everything was desired. This may not be a \u201ccomputer\u201d simulation, but you can bet it's less real. ",
