            "answer_text": "There are several good answers here that address different scenarios that might occur, and they are all right, however the question of what to do if ordered to do something illegal or unethical hasn\u2019t been brought up. If an officer orders you to do something, you do what is ordered. If they are in conflict with previous orders from someone higher up, then usually this is a failure in communication between the chain of command. At this point you inform the officer of what orders you are following and let him determine whether his own orders stand or not. At that point the responsibility for any fallout falls on that officer and not you. I would like to mention that if either of the officers orders you to do something that is ethically, morally, or legally wrong then you have a responsibility to not follow them. A good example of this is when a new company commander ordered two soldiers working in the orderly room to remove and gather license plates from all vehicles parked on the grass and bring them to his office. We had a parking lot for 40 vehicles and around 100 vehicles to park, so you do the math. The captain at the time was intending that personnel would have to \u201csee him in his office\u201d and explain their actions. What you should understand is that appropriating non-government property such as license plates is illegal, regardless of whether it was ordered by a captain or the President himself (at least in this context, seizing property is legal in some instances, such as criminal investigation). I was returning from chow with a few other NCOs when we found the two soldiers hard at work \u201cappropriating\u201d (it is only theft if the commander had the intent to keep the items) license plates. After first confirming that these soldiers weren\u2019t randomly stealing license plates (it happens), we found out that they had been ordered to do so. As they both were fairly young and new to the Army, it didn\u2019t occur to them to refuse the order, in fact they probably thought the commander had the authority to confiscate the license plates. We stopped them and I took the two soldiers to the company first sergeant and explained what was happening, then returned to my normal duty. I later heard through the grapevine that the MPs had been called by several people, who eventually showed up at that commander\u2019s office to investigate the \u201cappropriation\u201d of several soldiers and civilians personal property, but that is beyond the scope of this story. The point of this story is that illegal orders do happen and it is everyone\u2019s responsibility regardless of rank to refuse them. If one officer of lower rank countermands another\u2019s order, it is usually for a good reason. It may be that it conflicts with the law, ethics, or moral standards that every servicemember is expected to live up to. It may be due to safety considerations, or that the previous order is no longer tenable. When servicemembers ignore their morals, ethics, and the law, events like the Mai Lai massacre can occur. Granted, that is an extreme example, but it does happen. Fortunately, everyone who serves briefed on what is a lawful order time and again from initial entry training to yearly ethics training, so they are aware of the proper response when encountering questionable orders. It may take some mental fortitude and guts to stand your ground, but in the end it is better to be following the regulation instead of facing punishment for knowingly following orders that are illegal. \u201cAll persons in the military service are required to strictly obey and promptly execute the legal orders of their lawful seniors.\u201d AR 600\u201320, section 4\u20132 Obedience to Orders.

            "answer_text": "Legally you follow the orders of whomever is the highest ranking officer in your chain of command. Realistically everything is about as clear as mud any given day and your average soldier isn't getting direct orders from Battalion commanders. Example, lots of Army units use things called Daily Tasking Orders. These cover non standard day to day activities. Such as providing manpower to reorganize all the closet space in the Battalion headquarters, or send all mechanics to a class on how to properly install a new part. These orders are signed by the operations officer and carry the authority of the Battalion commander. Quite often as a company executive officer and commander I would tell my subordinates expressly not to executive certain taskings. Because they would negatively impact current operations, and sometimes because they just seemed like a stupid idea and waste of my soldiers time. This is, in effect telling my soldiers to disobey an order from a higher ranking officer. I would immediately inform the Battalion commander or Executive Officer of what I was doing and why. 7 times out of ten, they saw it my way. The other 3 times I was told to get bent and execute the order. ",
