            "answer_text": "The answer most people would want is yes. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. Sometimes lies win out the day and the truth never sees the light of day. Some people postulate those who perpetrate lies will be seen by an unknown entity, others (myself included) believe a lie told will eat a person inside and if it doesn\u2019t, they will see this situation as a win and start lying more often and more brazenly. So perhaps eventually the lie comes out, through guilt or carelessness; but sometimes the truth never sees light. For instance, an innocent man might spend his life in jail for a crime he never committed. I think what is so counterinuitive about this is we would never know the innocent person rotting in jail was innocent\u2014otherwise he would be out of jail! I remember Homer Simpson saying, \u201cIt takes two to lie, Marge. One to lie. And one to listen.\u201d In a way, when we allow someone to lie to us, especially oneself, we are in some way perpetuating the lie. This may also seem a bit incredulous, but at the same time it makes sense. Thus, we have a duty not only not to lie ourselves, but also not to let others lie to us. Look at it this way, if you or I believe that person is guilty, we are part of the lie; and every time we speak of the incident we will be complicent. Another way of putting this is, so long as we believe a lie, the lie is truth to us. Yet, one exception exists for this prospect and that is the benevolent lie; these lies will generally reveal themselves over time. Believing these lies, so long as they are good, is actually a virtue\u2014stranger than one could imagine. A caveat, these are generally rare and almost always come purposefully from good people, only rarely by bad people accidently, and never by evil people without a greater evil awaiting the hearer. This is why we care so much when people speak about truth or perpetuate falsehoods. We care because someone (including oneself) could become hurt by the lie. Such as the innocent human sent to jail. (We could be that innocent human). Lies are evil in the hands of the malevolent and the most common liars are for evil ends. There just aren\u2019t a lot of things that are good to lie about. So, the truth may find its way out; it may be benevolent or good; but, sometimes a lie never sees the light of day; and more often we are indebted to lies for good or evil. ",

            "answer_text": "The truth has been the truth from eternity and will remain the truth for eternity. The only time truth surfaces\u2014 (breaks free) is when human beings discover and begin using it\u2014for good or for bad. At least that is when it is recognized. Otherwise the truth simply remains the truth and continues to operate in and of itself. i.e. just because virtually everyone was positive the earth was flat, didn\u2019t change the shape of the earth. but as soon as they discovered\u2014and accepted the truth, it inadvertently led us to a whole bunch of different discoveries of the truth. On the other hand, it also allowed people to think more \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d, which allowed people to believe in many, many, many more thugs that are just as wrong and foolish as the earth is flat\u2026 So, the key to allowing the truth to \u201cbust out\u201d is to conquer your #1, very biggest obstacle and that is to bridle and train you ego. It is just like an ominous wild stallion. Left to its natural accord, it is full of incredible, out of control, and destructive power and it will eventually kill you (because it is more powerful than you\u2014-and it never gets tired or sleeps). But if you will get your own fear under control, deliberately earn its respect that you are a person of integrity, then train it to work with you instead of fight you, you will create such a synergy with it, that together, you will be able to accomplish things that you used to believe were impossible for you\u2014compounded many times over\u2026. In other words, when you completely override your desperate need to justify and defend your ego, with a passion to discover the truth, at any cost, you have just enabled your ego to be a powerhouse of focused energy, to literally tilt your world on it axis and create your own ecosystem that naturally produced streams of miracles to accomplish whatever you most want\u2026 that will Simultaneously be a great blessing to everyone around you in the process. That is the only way the truth ever \u201cbreaks out\u201c\u2026 when you break it out for yourself. Like Jesus said\u2026\u201dand ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free\u2026\u201d if you don\u2019t set yourself free, you will always be a slave to the propoganda of others who are always on the prowl to take advantage. I heard one person say years ago\u2014 \u201c The bad news is that it\u2019s all up to you but the good news is that it\u2019s all up to you.\u201d ",
