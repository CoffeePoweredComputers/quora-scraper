If you have the following traits then you should consider yourself as artistic- Sensitive to color,shapes , sounds and feelings in a positive way.Artistic people go in their own zone while creating some artwork and dont care about others.They solve problems by creating something new.They find peace whenever they are indulged in creating something or when they are near their supplies and working station.They take criticism in a positive way.Artistic minds are impulsive and independent.P.S.- Even if any of these points dont match to your personality ,never stop creating your artworks if you love making them\u2026 no one can decide whether you have artistic mind or not , you should always introspect about it and ask your inner self about it. ~FYI :) ",

            "answer_text": "Artistic mind : Sometimes it is realized by oneself, on one's own and sometimes it is detected by others like parents, teachers, friends and promoted or encouraged. Generally, society tries to brand us as general human being who leads a routine life. It imposes fixed ideas into our mind. Religions also do the same. As a child we have no alternative but to accept the tradition. But an artistic mind questions everything and tries to find out the inner meaning of everything or everything in his field of interest. He does not mind giving lot of time to his interest, even though, it may not be so remunerative. He likes what he does. He wants to go deeper and deeper into his persuit. He may like to interpret it afresh. He may try to improve upon it. All these characteristics show that you have an artistic mind. ",

Do you like to purchase/see/ be around the aesthetically pleasing, beautiful, fine, attractive, decorative, ornamental, things? Do you always prefer and practice emotional, tasteful, graceful, stylish, elegant, subtle, exquisite, expressive people/gadgets/activities/discussions? Then you have an artistic bend of mind. You don't need to be an artist to have an artistic mind you just need to to observe your tastes and likings from the daily life to know what you are. ",

            "answer_text": "Look at how differently you choose to solve a problem. Do you tackle a problem by lining up facts pros and cons in a linear fashion? Or do you make balloon circles with major categories and then draw points off them each category?( mind mapping) Or do you just write down words with lines draw all over the page to connect them.(scatter method)  All of these are viable problem solving methods.  The artistic mind will chose latter two methods. The factual linear mind will chose the first two.  All methods will get you to the solution of the problem. Might not be all at the same time. Linear does tend to be faster. But there are times when you need to use mind mapping and scatter methods at the start of a project. Then linear becomes much more useful when you are working for a timeline and details with in the timeline.  This way you are using both sides of the brain and utilizing everyone on your committee or group. Nothing is ever straight forward but is a mix of everything.  Makes it much more interesting and keeps a happier company or group. ",

That being said, I feel that an artist is not someone who is competent at making art, or who does so with great ease. Rather, an artist is someone who is miserable if they are not making art. Art isn\u2019t fun, it isn\u2019t easy, it\u2019s a relief. At least, that\u2019s my take. Everyone has their opinions on the subject. ",
