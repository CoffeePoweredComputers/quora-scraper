            "answer_text": "I have my doubts if Man learns ever about who he is because Man, mostly the scientists use to ask: \u201cWho are we and where are we going to and where do we come from\u201d so and because by this doubt I don\u2019t know if Man really knows or learns about who is he and if there will be a proper age to learn that once on every ages Man learns new things and to learn things there isn\u2019t also a proper age to that so the question is if Man can really learn about himself and if he learns about he can do on nature and over his kindred mostly the bad things that Man is capable of. And so and because Man doesn\u2019t know who he is, from where he comes and where does he go Man isn\u2019t able to recognize that he is a creation from his real Creator, at his image and similitude, that is God, and not, nature and whose God is waiting for him in Heaven that is where does all men go to after their real death to Earth on their earthly body and rise up to Heaven on their form of soul to be judged by their real Creator, that is God, and not, nature.

Had they perceived me as a \u201cchild\u201d they would not have shared that information with me. By learning about other people, I came to an idea of who and what I would like to be and what I needed to do to head off in that direction. ",
