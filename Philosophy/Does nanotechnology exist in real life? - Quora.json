Example: 7 nanometer processes Control of material microstructures (nanostructures?) at the nanoscale is also known in metallurgy, electronic materials, and other materials fields. Example: Superstrength of nanograined steel with nanoscale intermetallic precipitates transformed from shock-compressed martensitic steel If you mean, \u201cAre there sci-fi nanobots and nanites?\u201d the answer is \u201cno, nanotech is much more boring than that.\u201d ",
