            "answer_text": "The normal procedure is to go to the priest in the temple, and have him touch your beads to the Lord\u2019s lotusfeet. If you can\u2019t do that, for some reason, you can also sanctify your beads by touching them to the deity, in your mind, and that will suffice. As stated by the Lord in the quote below, there are no hard and fast rules for chanting Hare Krishna. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu says: O my Lord, Your holy name alone can render all benediction to living beings, and thus You have hundreds and millions of names like Krsna and Govinda. In these transcendental names You have invested all Your transcendental energies, and there are no hard and fast rules for chanting these names. O my Lord, out of kindness You enable us to easily approach You by chanting Your holy names, but I am so unfortunate that I have no attraction for them. \u2014Sri Sri Siksastakam 2 Srila Prabhupada explains: There is no need to take to any process of spiritual realization other than the recitation of the holy name. In the Vedanta-sutras, Fourth Chapter, 4th adhikarana, 22nd sutra, it is stated, anavrttih sabdat: \"By sound vibration one becomes liberated.\" Simply by chanting the holy name constantly, one can go back to Godhead and never have to return to this miserable material world. It is also stated in Bhagavad-gita, Eleventh Chapter, 36th verse: \"The world becomes joyful hearing Your name, and thus do all become attached to You.\" Thus Arjuna also accepts the potency of the holy name. In the Narada Pancaratra it is stated that all the Vedic rituals, mantras and understanding are compressed into the eight words Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare. Similarly, in the Kali-santarana Upanisad it is stated that these sixteen words, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare / Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, are especially meant for counteracting the degrading and contaminating influence of the materialistic Age of Kali. In the Brhan-naradiya Purana, it is clearly stated that it is only chanting of the holy name of Hari (Krishna) that can save people from the problems of materialistic existence, and there is no other alternative, no other alternative, no other alternative in this Age of Kali. This automatically eliminates the usefulness of the processes karma, jnana and yoga. Therefore this chanting process is the one simple and sublime process of achieving the desired goal of life. One need not take to any other process. The Lord has thousands and millions of names for this purpose. Any name of God will do, but the ecstatic method, the easiest means for most people, is to chant the Hare Krishna mantra: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare / Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. If one feels that this is a sectarian name and prefers to chant any other authorized name of God, that is approved, but Lord Chaitanya and His followers have chanted the Hare Krishna mantra, and therefore it is authorized for all people of all times and places. The holy name of Krishna is nondifferent from Krishna Himself. In the material world we find a difference between the name and the object. If we are thirsty and simply chant \"water, water, water, water,\" it will not satisfy us. But, if we want Krishna and chant \"Krishna, Krishna, Krishna, Krishna,\" He is personally present in His name, and we can feel that presence of the Lord even in the beginning stages of chanting of the holy name. As one becomes more advanced, by uttering the holy name he can see Krsna dancing on his tongue. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, Krishna says to Narada, \"I am not in the hearts of the yogis, nor am I in Vaikuntha, but, O Narada, I am present wherever My devotees are engaged in chanting My holy name.\" There are no hard and fast rules for chanting the holy names of Krishna. Anyone can chant, anywhere and at any time. The chanting may be done loudly or softly, alone or in a group. Thus one can chant in the temple, while walking down the street, while working in the office, while attending school -- even in dream one can chant Hare Krishna. In this way, all the twenty-four hours of the day, one should be engaged in chanting the holy names. This does not mean that one must give up other activities, but whatever he is doing he should do in full consciousness of Krishna. It is not recommended that one go off to a solitary place and chant Hare Krishna; one should always be engaged in activities for the satisfaction of Krishna, especially the preaching of His glories to others. Thus the path of God realization is made easy and open to all. Anyone who is not attracted by the holy name of the Lord and does not feel ecstasy immediately upon utterance of the holy name is surely suffering the result of past sinful activities and is being punished by Yamaraja (the superintendent of sinful reactions). But even such a person, if he sincerely takes to the chanting of the holy name with determination, will become quickly purified and develop love of God.  ",
