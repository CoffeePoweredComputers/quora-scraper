            "answer_text": "Knowledge is \u201cjustified true belief.\u201d A belief is an idea about reality, true or false. Ideas are statements about perceived reality. Truth is what corresponds to reality, so if a person holds a false belief, he is disoriented or disconnected from reality. One\u2019s understanding is a consequence of his beliefs as they form his belief system. We interpret reality according to our belief system or worldview, an interpretive framework or outlook. The Christian belief system, with God in the equation, is relevant to all of life as an all-encompassing worldview and outlook, not just a religion. If you are negative or pessimistic, it will skew your understanding of reality. People can be biased due to false beliefs or understandings. It is unfortunate to not understand realty or the truth, because misbehavior results as a consequence. If you are righty interpreting reality, your understanding will be accurate and oriented to the truth. This is why Jesus claimed; \u201cI am the truth.\u201d He came to bear witness of the truth and told us it can set us free. If He is right, then the only valid interpretation of reality would be the Christian worldview. Many people hijack their faiths and become fanatics and even cause evil in the name of their God or religion. Being sincere, is no excuse for people can be sincerely wrong. NB: All ideas have consequences and no one can resist an idea whose time has come. There is a season and a time for every event under heaven. ",

            "answer_text": "If our beliefs is strong enough in our heart it can influence our perception of the world around us and determine how we talk to and treat others. When those beliefs belong to a larger group such as a culture, nationality, race, or religion then the impact can be much greater. For example, if you believe in evolution, you may think of \u201csurvival of the fittest.\u201d Looking out only for your interests and that of your kind or group. If anyone suffer because of your actions it's because they are the weaker species--natural selection\u2014too bad for them. If your religious belief teach you that you belong to a superior or master race then you will act accordingly and mistreat and oppress those who are different than you are. If you believe in an Almighty but loving God you will do your best to treat people the way He would want you to. Of course, most people are not guided by just a single belief but rather a combinations of belief systems such as cultural, religious (or lack of it), political, etc. History is full of these examples. We can honestly examine what we believe and be open-minded enough to talk about what we believe. Hopefully discard wrong and harmful beliefs and learn new ones that can benefit all of us. ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, Beliefs are an interesting thing because they shape our worldview and can distort how we perceive reality. A lot of people like to think that their beliefs are based on lived experiences, however that concept is fundamentally flawed. Every one was raised by adults, other humans that held their own beliefs and convictions. Growing up, many of us had religion in our homes. We were taught what to believe in as if it was undeniable fact. Interacting with people who have different belief systems than us can be very sobering and open our eyes to the realization of just how wrong we might be. In my life, I have many beliefs but I strive to learn about the beliefs of others as well. When I find a belief I don't agree with, I look at what evidence there is to support it. If I can find concrete evidence that is contrary to my previously held belief, I change that belief and listen to the evidence. When faced with new information, it first passes through the filters of belief. Belief can be a very limiting and harmful thing, or it can add immense value and purpose to our lives. Being open minded and willing to learn about other belief systems ensures a constantly evolving and bettering existence for everyone in my opinion. ",

            "answer_text": "Knowing something can mean several things: you have a certain belief, you are convinced, you learned, you are certain, you're sure of\u2026 Many languages have different words for different ways of knowing: Gnosis is a feminine Greek noun which means \"knowledge\" or \"awareness.\" It is often used for personal knowledge compared with intellectual knowledge (\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd e\u00eddein), as with the French conna\u00eetre compared with savoir, the Spanish conocer compared with saber, the Italian conoscere compared with sapere, the German kennen rather than wissen (thank you Wikipedia) There is a development from beliefs and convictions to being sure or scientific knowledge. You learn something that changes a belief to a certainty, you understand something that changes a belief to a certainty. But this is not an answer to your question because this is how understanding influences belief and your question is about belief influencing understanding\u2026 Belief can be a tremendous incentive to want to discover something: this will help you understand! On the other hand, if it's hard to believe something, you will have little incentive to try your best to understand it. The history of science has many examples of belief holding back understanding (ask Galileo) and on the other hand: beliefs have been the root of many great discoveries. So belief guides you, be aware of this. Does it hold you back or does it lead you to being a better person. ",
