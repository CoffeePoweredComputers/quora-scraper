            "answer_text": "There are two main categories of utilitarianism: act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism says to choose actions that maximize utility (that is, produce a state of affairs where the greatest amount of intrinsic goodness is achieved across a population), and rule utilitarianism says to choose the set of rules (e.g., rules, laws, rights, etc.) which maximize utility. The word utilitarianism by itself with no qualifiers usually refers to classical utilitarianism which is a type of act utilitarianism with a hedonistic theory of value \u2014 that is, happiness is considered to be intrinsically good. Within the category of act utilitarianism there are other varieties, such as preference utilitarianism (where the satisfaction of preferences or desires is considered to be intrinsically good), or negative act utilitarianism (where both happiness and the alleviation of suffering is intrinsically good, but the latter is given higher weight or priority).
