            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting question. I don\u2019t have academic data on this, unlike many of my other questions. However, from my experience, more untrusting people are more likely to be broke. In business, if you can\u2019t trust people, it is harder to expand. Even a few months ago, I was watching a Youtube video, created by an entrepreneur I personally know. He was saying one of his regrets was not trusting his staff more 10 years ago. Likewise, trusting people are more likely to get higher investment returns than untrusting people, because they realize this time probably isn\u2019t different. Also at the start of my answer, I said I didn\u2019t have any academic data, but thinking about it, I can think about one study I read about. The study found that people who believed in anti-Jewish and other conspiracy theories, were much more likely to be broke or at least get lower investment returns. It is obvious why. If you believe everything is a conspiracy, why not just leave money under your bed or spend it all. What is also true, is that the public at large, over-estimates the extend to which the world is a dangerous place. Crime has fallen in most cities in the world, and the chance of a complete stranger repaying you money is 80%-90%\u2026..most people assume 50% because of the media. People who have more wealth or income, often spend less time watching the mainstream media. They have nothing positive to say, because positivity doesn't sell newspapers. Having said that, there is a line between being trusting and gullible. People who are relatively trusting still have a screening process. None of us trusts the intern to get the job done as much as the person with 10 years experience in the industry, even though we trust their ethics just as much.

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A! Since I\u2019m definitely a skeptic, and definitely not broke, I\u2019d say \u201cNo.\u201d :) On the contrary, I\u2019d think skeptics would have the advantage in money matters if they did so choose. I get that on the far end of the spectrum, being skeptical would cause a lot of indecision. But, being skeptical doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being irrational. ",
