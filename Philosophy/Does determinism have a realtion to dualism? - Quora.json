            "answer_text": "Determinism says no matter what we will always be the same. This is the Predeterminism variation of determinism. This school of thought is contrasted to the Buddhist cause-and-effect. The main reason is that predeterminism is too strict that it embraces one of the extremes: claiming that everything is predetermined, which involves in the existence of an almighty entity such as God or Fate or Destiny and claims that nothing can be changed no matter what. This school of thought is a bad way to be enchanted with because you'll be opposed by those who support free will. Such opposition would end up with debate, argument and separation. Some Buddhist schools embraces this school of thought - they say that everyone would eventually become Buddha no matter what - and the result is that they entered into conflict with others. It's disturbance in the community. Dualism says ego does not exist because we feed our illusions. There are two separate parts (the mind and body) to the human condition. The 2 above statements contradict and destroy each other. In the Buddha's teachings, illusion means that one would take the body as self or the mind as self or both body and mind as self. This separation/discrimination between body and mind actually is the illusion. Scientifically proven, the body can't be human body anymore without mental activities and mental activities can't take place without the physical body. Therefore, separating such set of physio-mental events into 2 areas is an illusion, created in the attempt to define a self. Practically, one can't precisely determine any concrete boundary between such so-called body and mind. Therefore this school of thought is not one you should be enchanted with. Otherwise, you'll be opposed by those who support non-dualism. Such opposition would end up with debate, argument and separation. Some Buddhist schools embraces this school of thought to the extreme that they spent so much time on determining which is what. The result is that they entered into conflict with others and directly conflict with the canon teachings of the Buddha. It's disturbance in the community. ------------------------------------ As mentioned, none of the 2 above schools are correct and if you cling to them, you'll get yourselves into trouble with others. They are to be dropped, thus determining the relation between them should be disenchanted too. ",
