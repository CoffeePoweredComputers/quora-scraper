            "answer_text": "Repeated numbers such as 333 are called repdigits, short for repeated digits. They are popular in recreational mathematics and in the occult study of number called gematria. Numbers like this are thought to be a reiteration of the concept of three. Three three's means really, really three, whatever three may mean to you. Mathematically repdigits have a unique signature in it prime factors (prime factorization is the basis of modern mathematics). All three digit numbers such as 333 include a prime factor of 37. 111 = 3 x 37, 222 = 2 x 3 x 37, 333 = 3 x 3 x 37, etc. The number 37 and multiples of 37 in modern theistic gematria (the study of letter as number) is of great significance. The first verse of the Bible is: Genesis 1:1 = 2701 = 37 x 73 Jesus Christ = 2368 = 37 x 64 Jesus Christ (2368) + 333 = 2701 = Genesis 1:1 The early Christians were fascinated by repdigits because Jesus in Greek added up to 888. Some people believe repdigits like this are God or the universe's way of getting someone's attention. Maybe the universe wants to talk...  ",

            "answer_text": "There are numbers that occur naturally, and those that occur deliberately to follow some pattern. In the example you give, there are only 9 out of 999 three digit numbers or 1/111 of them that are repeated in the way 333 is. I am ignoring all zeros. i would suggest that it is very unlikely that you are seeing that pattern as the result of natural measurements. Your noticing of such a pattern might bias you in favor of noticing it, however. On the other hand, numbers that are created through human agency, or through a mathematical process that favors repeated digits (also, ultimately a human thing) could definitely be biased toward repeated digits. A simple example would be a phone number chosen to include repeated digits to make it memorable. Another, rather disturbing case, this time with all zeroes, is that for a number of years the nuclear launch code was set to 000000, which made it easy to remember\u2014but unfortunately pretty easy to guess.
