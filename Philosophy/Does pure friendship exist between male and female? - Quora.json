            "answer_text": "Of course. However, even if my answer is clearly a \u201cyes\u201d, this is not to say that this isn\u2019t a good question and that there may be troubles that get in the way. I am excluding from my answer the instances when one or both people are gay. I am assuming this is a question that regards a relationship that could be sexual. The same troubles may arise between two gay people of the same gender. There\u2019s something to say about becoming close to someone to whom you could be attracted. This means that they are a member of the appropriate gender and that they are not related to you. When we form bonds with people and those bonds become very tight, romantic and/or sexual feelings are quite likely to develop at some point. We are social animals, who enjoy social bonding, but the sexual urges that drive us may come out when feeling that a bond is a very tight one. This pull towards bonding romantically and/or sexually happens in many relationships where we begin to open up in emotionally intimate ways. Talking about our deepest feelings makes us vulnerable and we do encounter this emotional intimacy whenever we \u201copen up\u201d to someone. Opening up about our intimate thoughts may give rise to havning mixed feelings about opening up intimately altogether. These mixed feelings are notorious between therapists and their clients and also between teachers and students. You have all these ingredients: emotional intimacy, respect, interest in the other person, deep caring feelings for the other person, mutual or partial support for the person, an openness to helping out, deep trust that enables this display of vulnerability, etc. All these happen in a relationship between therapists and clients, between teachers and the students that they work with more closely, and, of course, between friends that have the appropriate gender to become candidates for intimacy. So the only thing that misses from this type of relationship and a romantic one is the feeling of sexual desire. One trouble is that sexual desire often happens as a natural result of all these other types of relating. Another trouble is that we don\u2019t often get to meet people who become so close to us, so we may start thinking of them as a potential partner even in the absence of clear sexual desire. All I\u2019ve said so far are natural psychological and biological responses to becoming close to someone. And, in my opinion, whenever you have a very tight bond to someone of the appropriate gender and who is not related to you, you are very likely to have to deal with (at least) the arrival of thoughts of romantic love and/or sexual desire. But there are ways in which these natural tendencies can be overcome in order to make room for a non-sexual bond. We are driven by our biological instincts, but we can also resist them and we are not their slaves. I\u2019ve had friendships with people who were good candidates for having a romantic/sexual bond. Sometimes they started out with some kind of sexual relating that didn\u2019t seem to work and so we arrived at the conclusion that being friends is the best option for us. In this case, the sexual option was explored and didn\u2019t seem to have its place. Even with all these other elements in place, it\u2019s possible to simply have the sexual urges missing. Then there are times when you make friends with someone who already has a partner. In this case, it\u2019s possible to feel the other urges and simply to ignore them until they go away. You do it for ethical reasons. If you have good ethical principles about not participating in an act of betrayal, then you simply get over your attraction. This is the case also of therapists-clients relationships and of teacher-student relationships: your ethical code should forbid you to act upon feelings of sexual attraction and these feelings will wear out if ignored. You just work through them until they go away. And there\u2019s also the case of having a really tight bond with someone and simply sensing from the very beginning that a sexual/romantic relationship is not part of your closeness to that person. This is quite rare, but it does happen sometimes. That person will just feel like a brother/sister to you and the \u201cwires\u201d of bonding will not be crossed with the \u201cwires\u201d of sexual desire. So\u2026 although it is quite natural to experience sexual thoughts in any kind of strong bonding, if the setting isn\u2019t right, then you just ignore them and they do fade away leaving room for a perfectly innocent friendship. It\u2019s very very often the case that you have to go through these feelings. It\u2019s much more likely that these questions will come to your mind than that they won\u2019t. You just have to be smart about it and take them for what they are: thoughts of sexual desire that are natural to come when we feel close bonding with someone. It\u2019s your job (or the other person\u2019s) to judge whether these thoughts have their place between you, or if they should just be ignored. Ultimately, they do fade out. Just don\u2019t stress about it too much. It\u2019s normal to feel them and it\u2019s quite normal to wait for them to fade out in due time. They will ultimately leave room for the innocent friendship. These thoughts/urges are not a sign that a friendship is NOT possible. The friendship is absolutely possible. You need to understand what is happening and understand that you are able to overcome them if it\u2019s the right thing to do. Of course, there are also countless instances and countless reasons for which a friendship between two people is not possible. But that was not your question. Your question was about whether the friendship is possible and my answer is \u201cYes\u201d. Any feelings that are \u201cparasitical\u201d to a friendship will fade away if you don\u2019t give course to them. It\u2019s best to be aware of them and be clear (in your mind) that you will not give course to them. ",

He's my confidante, my rock, my beastie, and I share everything with him. I helped him care for his daughter when he and his wife divorced, he helped me get through my divorce, he made sure to find me before hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992 so he knew I was OK, I helped him when he had medical issues and was out of work for some time. He was with me and my kids for the first Easter bunny visit, I was with his daughter when puberty hit and she needed advice dealing with her first cycle. He has held me all night as I cried in his arms when my heart was broken, he's the one I run to when others hurt me. We are intimate on an emotional level but not a sexual level. I can't even picture that\u2026it'd be like having sex with my brother. He's a very important part of our lives I can't imagine being without him and I wouldn't want to. My husband knows him and understands our relationship. He has no problem with us because he knows the nature of our relationship and that I'd never betray his trust. I haven't always been so lucky with past boyfriends but they knew, up front, that my BFF came in a package deal with me. I wouldn't trade my male best for 30 of the best female friends in the world. He's priceless. ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm. I\u2019ve had close female friends for a few years now. My oldest friendship with a female is with a girl I met about 5 years ago in middle school and we are still good friends, even if we don't talk that much anymore. We have a great friendship and have always had great conversations. I\u2019m still friends with a girl I fell in love with in middle school. We started talking as friends but I quickly developed an interest for her. I\u2019ve had multiple female friendships of all kinds since then. I never thought much about it until recently: I noticed that there was always \u201csomething\u201d that we both knew but no one wanted to talk about. I\u2019ve never had a 100% platonic friendship with a girl, and I think that unless either one of you is gay, it's really hard to do. Even my oldest female friendship has had some weird moments where I feel we both wanted to make a move. We were both far too shy and afraid to do it so we never did anything. All of my other close female friends have either liked me or I liked them at some point. I think it just tends to develop naturally, attraction just grows on you if you spend that much time with someone and find more and more things to like about them as you know them better. I think if the friendship can live on through those weird moments of sexual/romantic tension, it will survive. Otherwise you'll have a ruined friendship, or in the right situation, a relationship. Opposite sex relationships between two straight people require a lot of communication and an open mind to work. ",

I have several long-term male friends who are like brothers to me and most with the exception of one who used to hope for romance but doesn\u2019t anymore, have never wanted romance with me. The one in question wasn\u2019t so much pining for me as that he\u2019s the sort of dude who will help a lady out, and if she\u2019s conscious, consenting, over 18 and presents with no obviously oozing sores, he\u2019ll be there with bells on. That\u2019s just who he is. If I called him up and said that my marriage suddenly opened up and I wanted it, he\u2019d leave skid marks, but he is also in an open marriage himself and has other girlfriends than his wife already. My friend, Daren, has absolutely no interest in me and never did. He is definitely straight but I\u2019m just not his flavor of girl. We have lovely talks though and I\u2019m gonna have lunch with him this Friday. My guy friends and I have specific things we do when we are together. Daren and I talk about deep, spiritual and esoteric topics. Rob and I study runes and talk about witchcraft. Richard and I go to bars and to the opera together (my husband doesn\u2019t like opera). I have a tentative new friend, Scott, who is a chef and we are gonna geek out about being foodies. Talk about a friend with benefits\u2026.cook for me, dude!! Scott is also polyamorous and dates Rob\u2019s wife and another woman I know through my spiritual community. I have female friends too, of course. I think everyone would benefit from opposite gender friendships. Having a man\u2019s friendly perspective on life is fabulous and I couldn\u2019t live without it very happily. ",

Before puberty and extremely late in life, Yes. But No, for most of us in the time in between. All life forms are preprogrammed with a powerful and unavoidable triad of survive, thrive and reproduce (not in any particular order since one or two can be sacrificed for a third). Yes, we can suppress one or more but that is only with deliberate ongoing (and often intense) focus and effort (and hiccups will occur along the way). So pretending that reproducing (the sex act) is not on our mind over a long period of time (with repeated ongoing testing on that topic) is foolishness, IMO. Just looking how much \u201csex sells\u201d in advertising, should give us a clear example of the pervasive and often subliminal \u201cdraw\u201d for sex (romance included). Wisdom is to avoid all the possible temptations we can if we want reproduction/sex to \u201cdisappear\u201d as a drive. That\u2019s why there are monasteries/retreats such as this one, which does not allow women. How an autonomous male-only retreat in Greece is trying to resist the modern world They are not mean spirited\u2026actually, they are wise. Female groups might be doing the same (I have not searched that out), I\u2019m sure there are many. They know it\u2019s difficult enough to quell the drive for the sex act but to allow contact with the opposite sex is \u201cjust asking for defeat\u201d. Of course that doesn\u2019t mean all opposite sex friendships led to sex nor that opposite sex friendships cannot remain \u201chealthy\u201d. But anyone who says opposite sex friendships are just like same sex relationships is either naive or deliberately try to deceive others (with some purpose in mind). I hope this helps. ",

Physical attraction and romance is not limited to the teens and twenties, but becomes less important as one matures. My wife is my best friend, and we are past the romantic time of our lives, we have both cared for each other in times of serous illness, and gone though a lot together. That\u2019s not to say that we can\u2019t complement each other on how we look, etc. Before I retired, I worked in an organisation finding myself reporting to two women at different times. One was rather fat and unattractive but an excellent thinker, and leader and an empathetic \u201cman\u201d manager. We worked very well together and became trusted friends. I was very sorry when she left. The second was a stunningly beautiful, athletic and dynamic younger woman. Physically a real head turner, but our relationship was always professional. She was equally efficient and empathetic and we worked together extremely well. I would say we were trusted friends - especially when she broke her collar bone and reluctantly needed some help. (Ironically I had broken my collar bone some time earlier so I had some knowledge or the problems. she allowed me to affix her arm support and drive her home and back. We became quite close, but never romantically involved. Its about mutual respect. ",

            "answer_text": "The literal answer is of course yes - millions of men and women are friends with one another, and have not had any sexual contact. However, I have a feeling the underlying curiosity this question is trying to address is: Is it possible for heterosexual men and heterosexual women to be friends with one another, without any interest or thought from either person of sexual or intimate contact. And to this, I would say probably no. It would be very difficult, perhaps impossible, to prevent two heterosexual humans of the opposite sex from ever even considering or thinking of intimate or sexual contact. This does not mean they necessarily will act on those thoughts, or that they even particularly like having those thoughts - but it\u2019s not possible to prevent the thoughts themselves. It\u2019s normal, and very understandable considering how humans used to live, in small communities where sexual and romantic partners were shared between many people, most of whom we would think of today as \u201cfriends\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Assuming your asking if a friendship can be possible without any kind of feelings developing for one another in the opposite genders. My answer to this is, Yes and no. Yes in the sense that a male and a female can be friends if there's hardly ever any kind of physical contact (E.g when someone is constantly nudging, hugging, always sitting next to one another for any reason, etc) and if they keep more of a communication friendship than they do a \u201changing out all the time kind of deal\u201d because just like the saying goes. Out of sight out of mind. Will lead you through many paths if you are always constantly looking at them. So here's where the No come into place. Because one can never really confirm this theory of that one can be strictly friends and that's it. Because only I know what I truly feel, or only you can really be sure what you truly feel. But you can never truly see what the other person truly feels and some might keep that to themselves forever just to keep that person in their lives. ",

Prior to my husband and I dating, I have also caught feelings for some of my male friends. So, yes I do think it is possible, but, in my experience, someone usually catches feelings.1 ",

Yes, yes and yes, although on a certain level it is a question of maturity rather than sexual orientation. I have great friendships with the other gender that are entirely platonic. I have had best friends that are platonic with ladies - even when neither of us are seeing anyone romantically or even erotically. It is that the trust and comfort of friendship are there, but not the spark of more for it to be something romantic and/or erotic. And before some claim \u201coh, it\u2019s gotta be that you\u2019re both ugly,\u201d looks are not a consideration - even sometimes I can tease a lady-friend about being dressed on the prowl, knowing that she is going out for \u201cpotential\u201d socialising. And to be honest, it can be one of the best friendships you ever get to have. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure I do. Some of my friends are men, others are women. Some are in relationships, others are single. It doesn\u2019t have to be a big deal. As for the attraction thing: sure, unless you are gay/lesbian, it\u2019s quite likely that you\u2019ll find some of your friends of other genders attractive and vice versa. (If you\u2019re demisexual, maybe *all* the people you find attractive are or at least were your close friends.) Similarly, you could be in a monogamous relationship and find people attractive in addition to your partner, or others could be attracted to you. The key thing to remember is that attraction doesn\u2019t have to define the relationship between the subject and object of the attraction. You can accept your feelings without acting them out or blaming them on the other person. If you get stressed out by platonic interactions with someone you find attractive, or you can\u2019t resist the temptation to exploit someone else\u2019s attraction to you, or you are disgusted by the thought of someone you find unattractive having the opposite opinion of you (this also includes friends of the same gender by the way), then it\u2019s up to you to deal with that. There will always be situations in life where other people\u2019s preferences don\u2019t align with your own. Trying to repress your feelings or isolate yourself from such situations is likely to backfire in the long term; focus instead on controlling how you act. ",

I\u2019ve got a female friend from back in grad school; there was absolutely nothing wrong with either of us, but we *clearly* wouldn\u2019t have fit together as a couple. We studied the same subject and had some classes together; we were in one student organization together and had similar career goals, but just no sexual chemistry between us. And we were both totally cool with that; I was freshly scarred from a vicious divorce and she was having too much fun playing the field. We studied together sometimes and went out for drinks or a meal once in a while, but nothing ever came of it and I don\u2019t think either of us wanted anything to. So yes, I think it can be so, but only in certain cases. ",

Most people I know have at least one long-term platonic friend. Hell, I have had opposite gender friendships that have lasted decades, that are platonic. When you stop looking at people as sexual objects or conquests, and start looking at them as real, live human beings, it is much easier to form and be friends with them. ",

If I ever got stuck doing a research project for the volunteer organizations I am involved with, all I had to do was email him with the phrase, \"HELP -- DOING RESEARCH PROJECT -- STUCK!\" My second male friend -- well, we were both \"science nerds\" as young people and still are, and we can talk for hours about scientific discoveries, and how they relate to the lives of average, ordinary people, and how we prefer to believe in science as opposed to old wive's tales. And we both love the new technology that allows us to connect with like minded people and gather current information. ",

The attraction will be less apparent as the friendship grows but it never goes away completely. People dont want to be friends with a woman they dont see as attractive. A fear that one person might develope romantic feelings when the other could never go for it would prevent the friendship from getting a start. One would push the other away from the get go. Take internet romances and catfishing scams. One person thinks the other is the best, most interesting, amusing friend they ever had until they meet in person and this cute sexy person turns out to be old scraggly and has a potbelly in reality. Think they stay friends? Think this person feels the real person is still interesting and amusing? This is just an example of course. ",

After the emergence of society, roles and forms of relationships changed and even labels changed. For instance, at the period of our ancestors, they used to form tribes, and to each individual his/her own role, but they never dared or even so any benefits in terms like Friendships, Family and so many other social constructions till society emerged and started to create a system which included unfamiliar labels and relations to nature. From my perspective, I would say you can be a friend with a girl/man that you are not physically attracted to and you may never get attracted to. Otherwise, if you start a friendship with a person who is physically attractive, at the end you will fall for and you will never be able to keep labeled just as \u201c Friendship\u201d. ",
