            "answer_text": "Q. Are we only responsible for ourselves, or do we have responsibility for others as well? -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, you have responsibility for yourself first. If you have more ability, it is better for you to take responsibility for yourself and others too. - \u2026\u2026\u2026 The Lord Buddha said, \"Once upon a time, monks, a bamboo acrobat, having erected a bamboo pole, addressed his assistant, Frying Pan: 'Come, my dear Frying Pan. Climb up the bamboo pole and stand on my shoulders.'\"'As you say, Master,' Frying Pan answered the bamboo acrobat and, climbing the bamboo pole, stood on his shoulders.\"So then the bamboo acrobat said to his assistant, 'Now you watch after me, my dear Frying Pan, and I'll watch after you. Thus, protecting one another, watching after one another, we'll show off our skill, receive our reward, and come down safely from the bamboo pole.'\"When he had said this, Frying Pan said to him, 'But that won't do at all, Master. You watch after yourself, and I'll watch after myself, and thus with each of us protecting ourselves, watching after ourselves, we'll show off our skill, receive our reward, and come down safely from the bamboo pole.'\"What Frying Pan, the assistant, said to her Master was the right way in that case.From Samyutta Nikaya 47.19: Sedaka Sutta - Four types of people -\"Monks, these four types of individuals are to be found existing in the world. (1) The one who practices for his own benefit but not for that of others.(2) The one who practices for the benefit of others but not for his own.(3) The one who practices neither for his own benefit nor for that of others.(4) The one who practices for his own benefit and for that of others.Just as a firebrand from a funeral pyre -- burning at both ends, covered with excrement in the middle -- is used as fuel neither in a village nor in the wilderness: I tell you that this is a simile for the individual who practices neither for his/her own benefit nor for that of others.The individual who practices for the benefit of others but not for his/her own is the higher & more refined of these two. The individual who practices for his/her own benefit but not for that of others is the highest & most refined of these three.The individual who practices for his/her own benefit and for that of others is, of these four, the foremost, the chief, the most outstanding, the highest, & supreme.- Source - Tipitaka ",

            "answer_text": "We permit some people to become dependent on us, by inviting them into our lives and accepting their dependence. Our first responsibility is to ourselves, but if we agree to take responsibility for those others, then we must live up to that promise. However, we owe nothing to people who simply impose that responsibility on us and demand that we take care of them. They have abdicated their own responsibility; we are not obligated to accept it. ",
