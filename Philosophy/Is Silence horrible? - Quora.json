            "answer_text": "It depends, when there is lots of havoc happening around you like a noisy workplace or a dorm then you prefer some quiet over the noise. It is peaceful for us for couple of minutes but not always. Being in a place where it is always silent can make you feel lonely and sad. Its like you feel all alone in the whole world and you have no one to talk too. So yeah silence could be horrible to people ",

            "answer_text": "Silence is far from horrible. It is probably the best thing that ever is. Silence in sound is the equivalent of the True self. It is the background of everything we hear. If Silence wasn\u2019t there, we couldn\u2019t have enjoyed music. Forget music, we could not have had sound. Now Silence can magnify some aspects of life like the voice in the head. If that voice in the head is unbearable then silence can be dreaded. Even then, if you could learn to stay in silence, mind can also get silent. When mind is silent you get to see your true self and you experience true bliss. So I would say, Silence is an essential and default ingredient of life. Making friends with it can only make you better and blissful. Making enemy out of it means a fight for life. Choose wisely ",
