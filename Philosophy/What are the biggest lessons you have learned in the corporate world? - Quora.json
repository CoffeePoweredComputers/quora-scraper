            "answer_text": "A simple list DTA: Don\u2019t Trust Anyone, especially Management and HR.Shit travels up. If I complain to my boss, then he\u2019ll complain to his, and so on. Never complain about your superiors to peers or staff.Nobody works for free. If you\u2019re doing work, get paid for it.Stay out of the huddle. Every office has a group of people who congregate at the water cooler, break room, or cafeteria. The sole purpose of these groups is to commiserate and brew negativity.Your manager is not your friend.HR is there solely to protect the management and the company. Woe unto you if you think that they give one shit about you.HR is generally useless and underperforms. Do not expect their support.If you work in IT, then you need an exit strategy. Your goal should be to reach the management level as soon as possible. There is no upward potential in being an individual contributor; the pace of change is vicious and unrelenting, and it is inevitable that you will simply be unable to keep up. Do you see a lot of senior IT talent in their 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s? Nope.If you want to make real money, then you need to be managing people.Everything is about sales. If you are not directly tied to generating income, then you\u2019re seen as an expense or cost center. That\u2019s bad for business\u2014and bad for your career. Income generators keep their jobs. Expenses get reorganized or cut.Interview carefully. The person directly managing you will make or break your career with the company.Work less, not more. You are paid based upon a 40-hour workweek\u2014not a 50-hour or a 60-hour one. It is your boss\u2019s problem to figure out how to staff and manage resources effectively.Avoid personal debt like the plague. Debt makes you a slave to your income, which in turn makes you a slave to your employer. Your goal should be to be able to walk away from any job, at any time, for any reason.Network. I cannot stress this enough. No one gets jobs by applying to company websites, because HR and Recruiting are broken. Your best opportunities will come from people you know.Maintain your integrity. Always do what you say you will do. Never over-promise and under-deliver.Create compelling, concise content that is uniquely your own and that is recognized as such.Don\u2019t become complacent. Everyone is replaceable and will eventually be replaced.Never share with colleagues any information that can be used against you. They will do so, eventually. Try to recall the Miranda warnings on TV: Anything you say can and will be used against you\u2026Your boss knows less about how to be a manager than what is required. Managers are professional politicians.Your current company doesn\u2019t give a fuck about you. Companies act in their own self-interest.You should be advancing in role, title and pay level every 2\u20133 years as a junior to mid-level employee, every 3\u20134 years as a mid-level to senior employee, and every 4\u20135 years as an executive. If you are not, then find a new job.If your company doesn\u2019t pay bonuses or cost-of-living adjustments, then leave. No one can afford failure to keep pace with inflation, and high performance should always be rewarded.Pay attention to your employee benefits, particularly if you have a family. Companies have gotten stingy, and you can end up paying huge sums for deductibles and for out-of-pocket and uncovered expenses.Remote work (telecommuting) may be convenient, but it limits your potential growth. No one ever scored a big promotion from being in a remote-only role. In-person office relationships are critical.Age discrimination is real. Your chances of finding work after 50 diminish every year. The exceptions are management positions at the director and management level, for which an older age is expected.Save every penny that you can.An MBA is worthwhile only when you have a plan that includes an ROI (return on investment). As a general rule, if you have more than 15 years\u2019 experience in the same industry, an MBA won\u2019t make you more employable.If you have student loans, work for a non-profit early in your career while you can afford to make less. The PSLF program sets up 120 qualified payments on time (using income-based repayment) and you are done. The moment you have children, you can throw away any frugality plan you imagined you had.Choose your college by understanding that you are buying into a social network. If you want to live and work in Boston, attending UC Santa Barbara, for example, isn\u2019t going to amount to shit, and you\u2019ll be just like every other asshole out there. The potential for referrals and networking is huge. That\u2019s why Harvard charges $50k a year.Be inspired by what your employer does, or you will never do your best work. Any asshole with a keyboard can collect a check. To be inspired is to be fulfilled as a person, and there is no better formula for happiness.Stress is a motherfucker and will eat you alive. No one lay to his or her deathbed and said, \u201cI wish that I had worked harder,\u201d or \u201cI wish that I had saved more.\u201d Instead, they always wish for more time. Companies don\u2019t give a fuck about your workload, your stress, or whether, you live or die, quit or get fired. You are there for one purpose only: to make them money, thus and fulfilling their shareholder and stakeholder expectations. Don\u2019t be a statisticsBe nice. Nice people get things, and mean people suck.If your boss is a rotten fuck, leave at the earliest opportunity. Toxic managers are never worth it.Culture trumps strategy (or talent) every time. If you can\u2019t fit in, you\u2019re fucked. Adapt or die, or move back to wherever you came from. You need to be aware that the US has MANY different cultural areas, each with different norms. If you\u2019re East Coast and go to Seattle, you will never fit in. If you're from the West coast and go to the Deep South, i.e., the former slave states, you are fucked. And if you\u2019re from Texas and go to New England, you are fucked. Each area has its own personalities and cultural norms that will leave you frustrated and on the outside looking in. You\u2019ve been warned!When you land a job, commute time is a huge issue. Almost every major metropolitan area in the U.S. and abroad is in complete gridlock. Shortly after World War II, the United States made the fateful decision in favor of the automobile as the default standard of transportation. The emergence of national and state highways created a massive infrastructure that worked fine when there were around 120 million people in the country, but now it sucks balls with 330 million. If the amount of time that you spend in the car commuting back and forth to work isn\u2019t part of your game plan, you are fucked. It will eat away at you like a cancer. There is nothing worse than spending $1,000 per month to own and operate a car just to go to work in the city. You are fucked! Chicago, Boston, and NYC are the only cities in the country with good enough light rail or commuter rail systems to avoid this trap. And these are also three of the most expensive cities in the country. For my money, I\u2019d rather take that $1,000 per month and spend it on rent or a mortgage than a car, and take back the 80\u2013100 hours per month you\u2019ll be sitting in a car to play with my kids, go on dates\u2014anything other than commuting.You are in charge of your career.Your employer doesn\u2019t own you and isn\u2019t doing you a favor by employing you.Bad bosses are everywhere. Your first priority is to smoke them out in advance and never accept a position working for one. No matter what they are paying, it is not enough.",

            "answer_text": "Arriving early and doing nothing is viewed more favorably than staying late and working assiduously. It\u2019s unfair, but it\u2019s only the first boot of real life to kick you in the ass.HR and the ethics hotline don\u2019t exist as a resource to you; they exist to cover management\u2019s ass. I\u2019ve worked for bosses who have used racial slurs, homophobic epithets, threatened and intimidated staff, used drugs in the office, and misappropriated their expense credits, but they were never so much as suspended. I almost lost my job for marking a sale as closed when I got verbal confirmation from my client (with my manager on the phone), only to get the actual signed documents a few days later.Always, always, ALWAYS document and organize files of communication between you and your superiors and you and problem clients. Did I say always? Discrepancies (read lies) in accounts of your interactions from either of these parties is a fast track to being escorted out of the building. Nothing shuts up a lying SOB like a time-stamped email with the intro, \u201cPer my email on July 15, I mentioned\u2026.\u201dAlways keep a pulse on the job market. At least twice a year apply for jobs in your industry to get a sense on what your skills trade for in the open market and to sharpen your interviewing skills. It\u2019s also a great habit to be in the orbit of recruiters because they operate within a tight-knit ecosystem, network with, and know one another. If you\u2019re not a great fit for one role, and they like you, they\u2019ll refer you to a friend or colleague looking to fill another role as a courtesy.Even if you\u2019re not interested in a role that they may reach you for, always try to recommend or refer qualified candidates to recruiters. This pays dividends down the road.Be wise as a serpent, yet as humble as a dove. Many people advise against making friends, but I would advise that you make them believe that you\u2019re a friend. Being too cold and stoic in the office will make your colleagues withhold gossip, news, and politics from you that may be actionable. You can be friendly without being friends. Whatever your line is, find it and stick to it.Never get comfortable. I had a former colleague who never placed photos of his family or accomplishments in his cube and I asked him why. He said he is always prepared to walk out of the building with the items on his person at a moment\u2019s notice. Speaking from experience, there\u2019s nothing more humiliating or anxiety-inducing than taking the security assisted walk of shame with all of your belongings in a box and colleagues peeking above their cubes like prairie dogs to watch you walk the green mile. Work is a place where you should be as productive as possible; your family, spouse, hobbies, religion, proclivities, and creature comforts shouldn\u2019t occupy the work space.Your manager is NOT to be trusted with personal information. Whether your mom has cancer, wife left you, your kids are suspended from school, or you\u2019re late on the rent, these aren\u2019t the people to share your most vulnerable moments with for two reasons; 1. They don\u2019t have the power to do anything about them, and 2. They are more likely to report this things up the chain of command to use against you should it ever become convenient as a manipulation tactic. I know this oversimplifies things for the truly empathic, and supportive managers out there, but for the sake of generalities, let\u2019s leave those 8 people out of this and err on the side of caution.Use your lunch hour as an opportunity to network with people within different departments to grow your customer base. Every employee has internal and external customers, and it will behoove you to learn how to cater to them. If you\u2019re in sales, take someone in Dev Ops, Professional Services, R&D, or Customer Experience to lunch. You\u2019ll learn all the horrible things sales people do that make their job a living hell, so you won\u2019t perpetuate that. You\u2019ll also forge some great individual relationships for emergencies when you need to phone a friend.Stay away from the office complainer. Every office has at least one, and he/she is a cancer on your outlook and productivity. Regardless of how valid their complaints are about the quality of the snacks, the scheduled All Hands meetings, the increased co-pays on the new insurance for annual enrollment, the way management is trying to screw us with the new Comp Plan, etc., the best thing to do is to keep your exposure to this individual AT. A. MINIMUM.Become a Subject Matter Expert in at least one or more topics within your department. This makes you indispensable among your peers and management, because they don\u2019t want to(or can\u2019t do) do the job of training the whole staff or answering all their questions.Volunteer to headline new products or services, and you\u2019ll become more visible with leadership and ahead of the curve when those products/services become mandatory.Make your career decisions for the people who will attend your funeral one day; not the people in that office. Days, or even hours after your death, someone will be posting a requisition for your position, and your duties will fall on the shoulders of another. Make sure you spend your strategic decisions improving the quality of time with the people who will be crying at your funeral. This puts a whole lot of unnecessary office bullshit into perspective.If you\u2019re in the US, talk to your colleagues about your salary. Corporations benefit from dwindling unions and individual, rather than collective bargaining by negotiating salary and compensation on an individual basis. Men, this is our opportunity to gain solidarity with women who work equally to ensure that they\u2019re paid equally. White folks, this is an opportunity to ensure Black folks, Hispanics, and Natives are paid equally. This isn\u2019t a zero-sum equation; corporations make enough money to pay us all equally. They have the luxury of not doing so. Hold their feet to the fire, or have them risk losing the war of retention.Be kind. Especially to the people who least deserve it. 9 times out of 10, they\u2019re fighting prodigious personal battles, and the only place they can funnel their energy is at work. Be gentle, but don\u2019t be a doormat either.Bring your authentic self to work. I\u2019ve seen introverts, extroverts, flashy dressers, frumpy dressers, those gifted with supreme elocution, and those with the longest, strongest Southern drawl succeed in business, which proves one thing. Success doesn\u2019t care how you show up; just that you show up. I wish you the best of luck on your journey! ",
