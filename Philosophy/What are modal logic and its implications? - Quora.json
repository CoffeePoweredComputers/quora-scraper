            "answer_text": "Modal logic is a branch of mathematical logic that concerns with mathematical structure. This field is very important in studying the consistency of the structure of particular topic. Each of the fields of mathematics will have their unique structure. Take linear algebra as an example, we have a mathematical structure for linear algebra, or we have a structure of number theory, we have a structure of real analysis or even structure of set theory. So modal theory is actually the most formal way to study all field in mathematics. Modal theory is also important to prove Soundness theorem, deduction theorem, completeness theorem and Godel's incompleteness theorem. Modal theory is such an important subfield from mathematical logic. ",
