            "answer_text": "Yes, I think there is. I sat on the fence about this for many, many years, but with evidence I was confronted with, I began to realize that there are simply things that cannot be explained without some sort of survival of death. The evidence that finally convinced me: The University of Virginia, after years of intensive research, came to the conclusion that reincarnation is real. They were confronted with hundreds of cases that simply couldn\u2019t be explained. A few examples that I read about included a boy who at three, understood the design of the Titanic and had detailed memories of its sinking. The child who was able to tell his parents about his previous life as a WWII pilot, the name of the ship he served on (The Tahoma), names of former crew members, and even describe the hotel where his parents had conceived him. All of it was absolutely accurate and checked out. He can reference drawings his sister had made in his previous life-- all accurately. Or the young man who came back and discussed detailed, private experiences with his grown former best friend; things he couldn\u2019t have have possibly known. Or, the young boy who described who he was and how he had died in a fire in Chicago in the 1990\u2019s. When investigators checked the names and descriptions of the fire casualties, all of it checked out. He even was given a group of over 20 pictures of women who fit the description of who he had been; he picked out the exact one that he claimed to be.I have been involved personally in several hauntings. Despite whether or not you believe in ghosts or spirits, I have my own evidence that I cannot deny. I\u2019ve been pushed by an invisible force in a bed in a hotel room, had things move around my bedroom at night, had drawers to cabinets open and close by themselves, heard clear footsteps when no one was home, had doors slam with no wind or open windows\u2026 the list goes on. Within my own experience, I know there\u2019s more than just the physical world.One of the world\u2019s most respected death researchers, Elizabeth Kubler-Ross came to the conclusion that we survive physical death. She studied death most of her life and claimed there were too many aspects she had seen regarding death that couldn\u2019t be explained as a permanent loss of consciousness. For example, the dying child that told the room that his brother had already died, despite the fact that he had been taken to a different hospital\u2026 and had died just moments before. If there were one or two examples like this, it would be easy enough to call that coincidence, but she found hundreds of these over her lifetime, and had no fear of death whatsoever when she passed. She told her family to view it as her \u201cgraduation.\u201dThe information and transformational changes people experience from Near-Death Experiences. People have changed dramatically after experiencing them, and many became new people afterwards. Some became spiritual and entered the clergy. Others changed their personalities and chose to focus more on giving back to others. Some completely changed their religious beliefs and stopped viewing God as the universe\u2019s chief cop and instead, as more of a loving, caring entity. We\u2019ve all had powerful dreams and some have had hallucinations, but they don\u2019t change us for life like NDE\u2019s do.NDE\u2019s who were able to tell what was going on in a hospital when they were either clinically dead or anesthetized. There\u2019s the story of the doctor who never believed in survival of consciousness at death, until after his patient told him what was going on and being said while she was dead. She had been undergoing brain surgery and her brain had been drained of blood, yet she described in detail what was said and done during the surgery\u2014and under anesthesia no less. As a result, he began to question his own understanding of death and it changed his mind; he simply had no logical explanation for what had happened. There are multiple reports of people who were able to tell what was being said by friends and relatives in other parts of the hospital during their NDE's. These incidents cannot be explained by a dying brain going haywire.No one knows where our soul resides in the brain. We can manipulate the brain and cause memories to be called on or body parts to move, but we can\u2019t find the controller, or ghost in the machine, so-to-speak. In other words, we can find the computer, we just can\u2019t find the operator. Also, if souls were part of the brain matter, we could clone people and animals and with the same environment, reproduce roughly the same person, as everything would be identical to the original person. But that\u2019s not how it works; cloned animals are often very different, and have markedly different personalities from the animal they were cloned from, furthering evidence that the soul is a separate entity from the brain.And for the last\u2014 probably the single most powerful piece of evidence possible, that literally proves existence of the soul. People who were blind since birth were able to see and describe things accurately during their NDE\u2019s. There simply is no plausible explanation for this other than survival of a spirit outside of the body: New Evidence Suggests that the Near-Death-Experience is the Spirit Leaving the Body and Not Just a Dying BrainAdd all of these together, and it quickly becomes apparent that there is something more going on than meets the eye. Five hundred years ago, we understood very little about the world and medicine. Five hundred years from now, they will say the same thing about us. I don\u2019t claim to know what that is exactly, but there\u2019s something going on that we have yet to understand. Maybe technology will advance to a point soon where it can tell us what exactly does happen, but I\u2019d say in light of the evidence, the odds of us surviving death in some form are very, very high.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think we can prove it for sure but I can tell you a couple of stories about what happened to me. If I want to believe in these stories or not it is my choice but I chose to believe because they were powerful and full of messages. My grandfather was on his death bed and all his life considered himself an atheist. I wasn\u2019t convinced of that because I heard him many times talking about religion and I know that somewhere in a corner of his heart he believed in God. A week before dying, he started hearing a beautiful music, a chorus that sounded divine. He asked me a couple of times if I could hear it myself and because I didn\u2019t want him to think he was crazy, I confirmed. He also, started seeing a person that he said was sitting by his bed and waiting for him without saying a word. He asked me several times if I see the person and to remove it from the room because it scared him. I figured that he was hallucinating and I agreed with everything he was saying. Two days before he died, my grandfather had a moment of lucidity. He was a very intelligent person and we usually had this deep conversations that never got me bored. That day we talked about soul, God, death and afterlife. He asked me questions and wanted to know my opinion on those topics, especially on afterlife. As my opinions were subjective, based on what I have read or my own experience, he proposed to make a pact. Who dies first amongst us two, comes to the other in a dream and shows them if there is life after death. I shook his hand and he fell asleep with a smile of relief. Two days later he was gone and a couple of weeks after that I had a dream. I dreamt that I was walking on a country road and I could see flowers everywhere. The light was bright but didn\u2019t bother my eyes, it was very warm but without making me hot. I felt that the light was wrapped around me and very comforting. I continued to walk until I saw a small white house surrounded by lots of beautiful flowers. I knocked on the door and my grandfather opened it. He seemed to be very happy to see me and invited me in. Before I woke up from my dream, I heard his voice asking me to make a coffee. I told my grandmother about the dream as I couldn\u2019t understand what it meant. She started crying softly and told me that my grandfather always had this dream of buying a small white house somewhere in the country and plant lots of flowers. She also reminded me that my grandfather loved coffee but for the last 30 years of his life he wasn\u2019t allowed to drink caffeine because of his high blood pressure. I understood then that he kept his promise and came to show me that life after death exists. Next experience it made the first one even more credible. My grandmother died a year after my grandfather and a while after her death I had the same dream, with the same small white house surrounded by beautiful flowers and once again I knocked on the door. My grandmother opened the door this time and I could see my grandfather in the background sitting on a chair and reading a book. He raised his eyes, looked at me with a serene face and said \u201cYour grandmother is good now that she is with me in our new house\u201d. Now I am going to narrate the third experience I had but this one is not the last. I\u2019ve had a couple more but I will stop here because I don\u2019t want to bore anybody. I had a friend, she was 25 years old and died of stage IV kidney failure. Before she died, she spent a month in the hospital and she seemed to be scared of dying the whole time. I tried to encourage her that she will be fine and soon she will come home and we could go have some fun and dance in a club. I made her promise me that after Christmas we would go together to dance. She promised! The night she died, it was a Saturday, I dreamt that I went to a house in a town I\u2019ve never seen in my life. I knocked at the door and guess who answered? My grandfather! I checked the house and there were no walls but instead were white sheets that were floating everywhere and were replacing the walls. I met my friend there, she was dressed in a gown like the ones they wear in the hospital. She grabbed me in a hug and started dancing with me and crying. I wanted to ask her why she was crying but she did not answer and continued to dance with me. I woke up the next morning knowing that she was dead. I am not sure if my experiences can prove that there is life after death but I believe in it. Hope that you will find whatever answer you were looking for either from me or from our fellow Quoranians. Good luck! ",
