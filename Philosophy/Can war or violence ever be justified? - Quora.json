Look at the example of the U.S. entering WW2 after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. Had we maintained our isolationist policy, Hitler would\u2019ve eventually invaded us with the global victory of fascism & many more lives lost. ",

            "answer_text": "To answer this question, we must specify our definition of violence. Violence usually seems to be bad. So violence is considered as an immoral phenomenon. However there are some emotions and the action tendencies of them, that seem to be violent, but they are not. For instance, anger is regarded as a negative emotion, but in many cases, it is considered as a moral reaction, because anger arises when assumptions about proper behavior are breached. In addition, anger plays an important role in maintaining our moral order. So we have two types of anger: constructive and vengeful. Our problem is that we fail to distinguish anger from rage. Rage is a passion whereas anger is a kind of affection. We become angry when our moral principles are breached. Rage in contrast, is not a moral emotion in that sense. As a result, if violence includes all phenomena that don\u2019t seem nice, we can\u2019t say that it is necessary to avoid it, because there are some emotions that lead us to care about people, and support their rights against invaders, even when their actions are not nice. Imagine you need an operation. Although operation doesn\u2019t seem nice it is necessary to recover your health. Some emotions and behaviors have the same function. ",

The problem is that they are accepted as normal and they have come to be such a large part of the economy. I wonder how all the people employed by these things would make money if they were eliminated. I would be happy to live a very humble lifestyle in a world with no violence or war. There is no justification for not solving the problems which are well within in our ability to solve were it not for the resistance to making any sacrifice at all. Thank you for asking me this. ",

We are still that aggressive animal fighting for territory with imaginary lines and borders. Logically we can not justify killing, but many times, because the opponent is just as ruthless we have to maintain an amount of animalistic behavior. To say that we as a country, any country, will stop killing and refuse to fight because of moral value is to invite complete annihilation of the race or group. Killing can never be justified, and at the same time we have no choice in the matter as a group as long as we can\u2019t seem to figure out how to get along with each other. ",

The United States spends more on \"defense\" than the next 44 countries combined. When did \"too much\" become \"not enough\"? I believe war/violence is never justified. Jesus taught us to love our enemies, to turn the other cheek, to go the extra mile. Petsonally I don't see any way round that. ",
