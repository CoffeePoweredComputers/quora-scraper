Everything that has happened and will happen all exists in the divine mind, because God exists outside of time. Eccl 1:9 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.\u201d God went to sleep in man. God is subconscious mind. Man asleep is in the state of consciousness of Adam. Limited knowledge. Room for expansion. Christ consciousness is God awake in man; man is one with God. Paul describes Jesus as, \u201cBut unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.\u201d 1 Cor. 1:24 People ask, can God make a rock too heavy for himself to lift? Yes. He created the heavy rock and then he created a physical vehicle for himself (mankind) that was incapable of lifting the rock. \u201cWith God, all things are possible.\u201d Test it. Before you go to sleep at night, ask God a question with the full belief that you will have an answer. You will either awake with the answer or the answer will come to you through other means: a news article, a comment from a stranger, a random thought. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes you can ask anything you want. Let me ask you another question in response: Is it possible for an all powerful God to create a rock that He cannot lift? And then the 2nd part of that question would be this If God cannot create a rock he cannot lift then how is He all powerful? There is a logical fallacy in both questions. Both questions assume a limited God meaning that He would be limited by the laws of the physical universe. However, God, the God of the Bible is unaffected by the Universe and existed before the universe existed. God created information so there is no information that he is not already aware of. God exists outside of time, space and matter and yet throughout time space and matter as well. God created logic which would suggest that God can do anything that is logically possible. The question Can an all powerful God create a rock that he cannot lift is a question outside of logic just as your question about you being able to ask an all knowing God to create information that He does not already know is an illogical question.

Logically speaking: If it is the case that there exists a being such that it is both all powerful and all knowing then it follows that the being already knows the question and answer before you ask. The being would know if the question is well formed or nonsense. If not well formed then the best answer might be to just laugh at the foolishness. If the question is well formed then the answer might well be beyond your understanding of logic. (It is possible that you do not have a perfect understanding of logic, right?) Imagine for a moment a three year old asking a question that they think would really trick you. Might happen, but then, you and I are not omniscient. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cThe omnipotence paradox is a family of paradoxes that arise with some understandings of the term 'omnipotent'. The paradox arises, for example, If one assumes that an omnipotent being has no limits and is capable of realizing any outcome, even logically contradictory ideas such as creating square circles\u2026 A common response from Christian philosophers, such as Norman Geisler or William Lane Craig is that the paradox assumes a wrong definition of omnipotence. Omnipotence, they say, does not mean that God can do anything at all but, rather, that he can do anything that's possible according to his nature. The distinction is important. God cannot perform logical absurdities; he cannot, for instance, make 1+1=3. Likewise, God cannot make a being greater than himself because he is, by definition, the greatest possible being. God is limited in his actions to his nature. The Bible supports this, they assert, in passages such as Hebrews 6:18, which says it is ,impossible for God to lie.\u2019\" - Omnipotence paradox - Wikipedia ",
