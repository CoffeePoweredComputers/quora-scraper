            "answer_text": "Well, literally speaking, there are no people to whom nothing has happened, and so the statement is vacuously true. But that's surely not the intended reading. There are people who might claim to have had nothing happen to them, really meaning that they take all of the events in their lives to be mundane and trivial. On this reading, Eliot is arguing that the events in other peoples' lives that such a one might take to be significant are just as mundane to those who lived through them. And presumably vice versa.

I guess most people live their lives waiting for something huge to happen and change them somehow.  So, if nothing happens, you will never know that 'Events' have no importance in one's life at all.What really matter is the effort you put in you daily actions, on daily basis. ",
