            "answer_text": "Before Einstein work e=mc^2, things are mass.After Einstein work, things are energy and mass.People expects that things will never disappear. If in the future, science find out a case that energy disappears like mass transfers into energy, it transfers into another form X, then things are energy, mass and X. From the view of Taoism, things are children of Tao. But the Tao is so vast and undefinable (The Tao that can be completely explained or expressed with spoken words is not the constant, eternally unchanging and true Tao.) My opinion is that things are existence that is governed by Tao, not our mind. Some examples: Is language \u201cthing\u201d: yes, by writing it out the marked on paper expressed it, by speaking it out the sound expressed language and silence thinking, our brain stimulus results in chemical reaction in our mind. (You can find more: The Feral Child Nicknamed Genie).Is information \u201cthing\u201d: yes, information is transferred via signal. Without signal, that information is lost, for example a broken pins memory card. Signal has its form of energy, electric, magnetic or optical.Is \u2018Doraemon\u2019 thing: no, just a model of its is thing, for example a Doraemon puppet, a Doraemon doll.",

            "answer_text": "\u201cThings\u201d in dialectical philosophy are finite objects with a birth date, a specific duration, and an expiration date. All \u201cthings\u201d are finite \u2014 by definition. Some \u201cthings\u201d \u2014 e.g. the botanical and biological \u2014 reproduce before they expire. As long as \u201cthings\u201d exist in time, they occupy some degree of space. All \u201cthings\u201d exist in a spatial and temporal relationship to all other \u201cthings.\u201d As spatial entities, all \u201cthings\u201d tend to be three-dimensional, so that to examine each \u201cthing\u201d requires that we \u201cturn\u201d them this way and that way \u2014 that we \u201ctour\u201d them. While we look upon one side of a \u201cthing,\u201d we cannot see the other side of the \u201cthing.\u201d \u201cThings\u201d can have many other relationships with other \u201cthings.\u201d And so on.
