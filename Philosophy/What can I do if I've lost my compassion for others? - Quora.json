            "answer_text": "The fact that you are asking this question here and probably have noticed that you have lost compassion is great news in the first place. If things were beyond repair, you wouldn't even have noticed that you lost compassion for others and worse, would not have cared even if you did. I am not going to tell you to try. From what I understand, love pouring out from our inner self is not a matter of choice. It is more like sunshine - some days, its there. Some days, it isn't. And occasionally, it is a long dark winter like what you are going through.  I am not going to advise you, contrary to what the topic says- life advice. Instead, I will just share with you steps which worked for me. I hope it makes you feel better too. First, tell yourself that it is okay to feel this way - Yes, it is okay. We can't be  warm, cheerful, filled with love people all the time and well, it is NOT a crime. The world is very adept at making us feel guilty and its standards of moral perfection is a one-size- fits- all thing. But you need to give yourself a break and tell yourself that well, today was a bad day and you need time. You need love from yourself. Secondly, firmly tell yourself that your dislike or indifference to other people is not their fault. Often, we tend to justify our irritation with others by concocting faults and attributing it to the other person. This is a self-defense mechanism but it just tends to make things worse. So, tell yourself that you might not feel anything for the other person but he/she is a wonderful being and it is just a short phase you are going through where you are unable to recognize this. Be with nature - The shutting down of our benign feelings is most often, a symptom of pent up stress. So, maybe it is time to re-connect with yourself and the beauty of life. Try to change your routine, wake up early, go for a peaceful morning walk, pamper yourself with a spa, listen to zen music. As you slowly pamper yourself, you will feel the love - for the self, for the world and for life. Hope things get better for you soon. Cheers! ",

            "answer_text": "The hard part to restoring compassion is facing why you lost the compassion in the first place. The truth is it takes forgiveness to restore compassion, but the forgiveness means you have to look at the issue that caused you to lose your kindness for others. The truth will result in you looking at your pain and then forgiving the one who caused the pain. Compassion comes from kindness. When we are hurt we take away certain emotions to protect ourselves. We choose to guard ourselves and build up walls against those who hurt us. Recently I was talking to a friend of mine about a wall I have currently in my life. My friend told me that it is good to be guarded, but instead of a wall, have a gate so that people you trust can come in. This is what forgiveness does, it turns part of your wall into a gate so you can show actions of kindness again. This will require trust, so finding people you can trust is vital to this process. I have 3 friends that I know that I can trust, and when I hurt or make a mistake, I hold myself accountable to them. This is what is healing my heart from the pain that I felt that created this wall in my life. ",
