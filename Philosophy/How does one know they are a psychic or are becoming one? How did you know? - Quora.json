            "answer_text": "It begins with ignorance and a vivid imagination, and can progress to a full-blown delusion. Greed may or may not be involved, depending on whether you intend to use your lie to con vulnerable and grieving people out of their money, and give them false hope. Which is despicable. For people who just make it known among family and friends that they are 'psychic' - seeing signs of dead relatives around the house etc. - they just like the attention (making a fuss over their correct guesses and ignoring the majority of wrong & unprovable ones), and will usually be completely ignorant of things like coincidence or statistics. Because it's all rubbish. ",
