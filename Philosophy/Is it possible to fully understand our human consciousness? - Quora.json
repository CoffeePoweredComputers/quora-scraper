            "answer_text": "No, not in any real sense of the word \u201cfully\u201d. Not in the sense of consciousness apprehending or understanding itself. Here are some considerations. The consciousness is what is doing the understanding, and it is also the thing being understood. The essential problem is that human consciousness is almost completely lacking in self-awareness. This is by design (or evolution, if you prefer). The eye, by design, cannot see itself. If it could, then it could not see the world. The function of consciousness is a necessary division of labor resulting from the impossibility of a transcendent, god\u2019s eye view. Its purpose is to handle things in a flexible way when more basic functions (unconscious and/or automatic) are not effective. Consciousness is the end result of a very complex process \u2014 you do not want to be aware of the details, only of the end results insofar as they are useful in a particular situation and moment. This is why, for example, we have prodigious memories but no awareness at all about how it works. Another way of answering the question is whether we will ever have a sufficiently complete intellectual model of how consciousness \u201cworks\u201d \u2014 for example, a body of scientific models or explanations. Here, again, the models will not get near \u201cfully\u201d \u2014 in the sense that the models relevant to a particular way of understanding (such as science) will necessarily exclude other types of explanation (such as art, or mysticism, etc.) Along the way there will be people who believe the relevant and real facts can be reduced and encapsulated into specific models \u2014 they will claim that such models constitute \u201ccomplete understanding\u201d. Some of these will be mystics, and others will be laboring under a presumption of scientism \u2014 the idea that science can adequately explain \u201ceverything\u201d. But what if we had some kind of intellectual meta-system for tying all these other systems of understanding together? If that were possible, we\u2019d be challenged to come up with new ways to define \u201cfully understand\u201d. The complexity of the full extent of consciousness and how it penetrates material and social realms might be sketched out in general, but is likely to remain beyond the understanding ability of individual humans or even collectives. And then an interesting thing happens \u2014 the \u201cconsciousness\u201d itself evolves to penetrate and partly encapsulate those new means of understanding. So short of defining \u201cfully\u201d in reference to a simplifying and reductive theory, we\u2019re likely to find the operations of active consciousness continually evading \u201cfull understanding\u201d.

            "answer_text": "I think so. I suspect many are in love with the notion that consciousness is deeply mysterious and ultimately inexplicable. This is a romantic notion and probably linked to a fondness for supernatural explanations. If one were to provide an entirely naturalistic explanation for consciousness, that explained what it is and how it worked. I think the its-all-a-mystery crowd would reject or ignore the explanation. They would find an objection, or proclaim it to be unsatisfactory in some regard. But they would perhaps struggle to articulate why. Here is my comprehensive explanation: Awareness is a process. It is something we can describe in engineering terms. It requires a certain amount of information processing. There are algorithms needed to do the awareness activity. We don\u2019t know all of them yet. But we are figuring out some of this stuff. A comprehensive understanding of awareness is emerging. Consciousness is just awareness, from the awareness\u2019 point of view. That\u2019s it. Our sense of subjective experience derives entirely from our existence as a system of gathering information, assigning significance and deciding what to do next. Human level awareness is measurably more far reaching than the equivalent activity in a dog or a beetle. That\u2019s my explanation. Please pick it apart. Be my guest. It requires no supernaturalism. It means consciousness has a naturalistic explanation. And it means there is no \u201chard problem\u201d. But there are a set of smaller engineering problems (which biology has had the courtesy to solve for us. ) And I expect we will have workable versions in the coming decades. ",
