            "answer_text": "Freedom isnt free at all. Every freedom we take for granted today, was paid for in someone elses blood, sweat, and tears at some point and time or another in the past. Thats why freedom as so special. Its a sacred trust, entrusted to us by those who have come before us, and opened up the oppertunity for all of us, to live as we see fit, and allow others to do the same. Its our obligation to remember those who sacrificed everything they had to keep this great country protected and free for all of us to love and thrive in. And should the time come when those freedoms we've paid for, are put in jeopardy once again, its our duty and our sacred honor to be willing to do our part and defend that freedom, just as they once did. Freedom costs. But its a price we all willingly pay, as its the only way we have a place where we can make our own choices, and do as we see fit, most of the time without direct violent interference from those who would willing take our freedoms away. Treasure our freedoms. They are quite priceless, as they were paid for with those pricless souls of our ancestors. And paid for willingly. So that we could remain free to live as we see fit. Not a gift or sacrifice to be taken lightly. ",

            "answer_text": "Free: no one owns you. Independent. Does independent mean Alone? Does free mean the universe has to serve me or I can take whatever I want from anyone or the earth, however/whenever I please? I cannot be free of a body to feed, exercise, keep safe because that is not what was meant to be a Human. I know some religious people have tried to live without eating, without moving\u2026meditating in one place for years. Was that Free? Free People just do not know what freedom means anymore. If you were ever Slave, owned or had cruel dictator parents, or strict old time religious upbringing, then freedom is just getting away from the truly bad and wrong situation. Then you have to take care of self. One person alone is very difficult and very unnatural, very much work/responsibility. It does not even feel free. Grouping with others gives more freedom but everyone must respect the other, help the other, treat the other as equal. Fairness gives some freedom. Laws give safety and that gives freedom. New inventions gives us so much freedom of what to do with out rime. Electricity gives tremendous freedom as does Medicine, washing machines, travel, new ways of communication. For me, most important (besides all the new inventions that free me from being a slave to cave person type living) is that I will not be owned by anyone. I live in a place where we have Laws against that. Thats good because if I were Owned by another person, occupation, religion, system which I could not Choose to leave, I feel I would rather not live. In that context \u2018Liberty or Death\u2019 makes sense to me. But I have heard that some people only feel free if something tells them everything they should think, what they are, what they should do, what they should eat, who they should befriend or marry\u2026.I have heard some people feel \u2018liberated\u2019 when they have to make no decisions. They feel free from responsibility and the struggle to figure things out or do critical thinking, and are free from making mistakes. A little of that feels good to me too, but not when carried too far or becomes Dictatorial. I like Wise, Experienced suggestions, examples. Bottom line is the difference between not being OWNED or Owning anyone else. Not just taking whatever I want whenever i want. That is just Licentious. Bottom line is also not allowing this kind of thing to happen or welcoming this kind of thing into my home, or country. Everything under the sun is NOT to be tolerated without great harm. (USA has forgotten this with KKKlan, White Supremacists, Islam, Nazigroups. These destroy freedom. Freedom does not mean allowing the teachings of destruction, no matter how Right these groups think they are, Their manifestos and religious books tell a different story) Bottom line is that freedom is responsibility to self and OTHERS. Benefits today are more free time, should give less anger and less pressure/stress. Anger and pressure/stress are signs something is wrong. War cannot be the only answer to things when \u2018something is definitely wrong.\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "Free, allows us to discover value. Free is found between the differences of chaos and reasonable-limitation. Without limits society floods and consumes the way towards famines and chaos. With too many limits, we are the slaves of despotism. Freedom, understands its place. It stewards itself, so all can be nourished with much more to spare. When the laborers are few, she hopes to gain our cooperation. Cooperation that doesn't demand self-sacrifice of the few, the few to pay its overwhelming amount of dependents. No, free trusts that each of us can pull the Weight with our gifts and talents that serve our communities. For one it maybe the levity of entertainment intended for the grueling work of laboring for 18-hours. For another its the care of the service-worker working said 18-hour shift. Still yet others who build and maintain our utilities, for heat, power, and light in our homes. The list is endless, and us armchair-philosophers have it easier than most. But fatigue comes to us all, and those that can take comfort in the written-word; hopefully ours will suffice. Free isn't free in the sense of being without-effort, by those who are able. It must be protected, a military. It must be created, the vision of such men as our nation's founding-fathers. It must be sustainable, enough contributors in the necessaries, to endure the long-term. It must regenerate and evolve for inclusion of those seeking safety. It must be encouraged through the education of the leaders of the next-generation. In order for free to be free, it must have a critical-mass of those willing to participate. Free is free, when we participate by creating more value than we consume. ",
