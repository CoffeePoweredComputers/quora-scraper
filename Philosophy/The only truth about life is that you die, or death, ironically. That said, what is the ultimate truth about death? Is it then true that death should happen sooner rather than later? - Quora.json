            "answer_text": "Pretty good question, actually. I have a pretty good answer. The ultimate truth about death is\u2014\u2014YOU DON\u2019T REALLY DIE. Your soul leaves your body, rests a bit\u2014\u2014that\u2019s the entire purpose of death, rest\u2014-then reincarnates. You absolutely, positively do NOT have to take my word for this. The existence of the soul and reincarnation is something that be logically deduced and experimentally proven. There is already a TON of anecdotal evidence in the form of reincarnation studies that show we are all eternal beings with eternal souls and always have been. Here, let me post the entire thing, theory and possible ways of building a soul-detector plus one reincarnation study and, this being Quora, you can decide for yourself. It\u2019s all quite simple. Won\u2019t take ten minutes. And oh, by the way, the ultimate result of the scientific confirmation of the existence of souls and reincarnation will be the absolute, utter, permanent, irrevocable destruction of all evil on Earth. See my story at the end. (Original source: Jeff Corkern's answer to Why do so many people believe in life after death when there is no scientific proof of it?) [EXCERPT] There is actually PLENTY of evidence. SCIENTIFIC evidence. I\u2019m about to list one experiment in particular. First off, the existence of the soul is ENTIRELY testable and solvable by the scientific method. Theory and experiment both, the whole nine yards. Let me address the experiment part first. Strictly speaking, the best possible experiments would be first) building a soul-detector and confirming the existence of souls, then second) using that soul-detector to detect a soul entering a fresh body and confirming the existence of reincarnation. NEITHER of these experiments has been done\u2014-YET. They will be. It\u2019s an historical inevitability and an historical necessity if the human race is to survive the present century. In the meantime, we have anecdotal data in the form of reincarnation studies. Cases of people spontaneously remembering past lives have been quietly accumulating for decades now. Here, let me show you one scientifically researched and documented case of reincarnation done by actual scientists.  There is actually MORE than enough data for scientists to start wondering how to build a soul-detector. There is one VITAL piece missing the scientists don\u2019t have that would make reincarnation make sense, be simply another natural part of the Universe. A rigorously logical theory. A theory based ONLY on scientific principles, with NO citing of religious texts or demands for faith, no calls to \u201cBelie-e-e-ve, brother!\u201d Just calm, clear logic. This theory right here. It\u2019s all quite simple. Won\u2019t take ten minutes. And oh, by the way, the ultimate result of the scientific confirmation of the existence of souls and reincarnation will be the absolute, utter, permanent, irrevocable destruction of all evil on Earth. See my story at the end. (The following is a line of reasoning I have posted before on Quora. All the content, every single word, including the referenced links, is entirely my own work, and it hasn\u2019t been posted anywhere except Quora, unless you count my hard drive. Here is a link to the original source: Jeff Corkern's answer to Is there any hard scientific evidence in support of life after death? ) [EXCERPT] The basic problem you have to consider\u2014-and that scientists have never, ever, considered, not even for a nanosecond\u2014-is the SUPREME threat sentients pose to a Universe. Sentients have the power to blow the Universe COMPLETELY to Hell and gone. Stephen Hawking, bless his little heart, dreamed up an elegantly simple way ONE sentient could do it by pressing a button ONCE. I will lay out the Stephen Hawking Method For Destroying The Entire Universe a little further down. So: Suppose you are a Universe Engineer. You have been handed the problem of designing a Universe that is going to evolve sentients. Sentients who, moreover, have been directly required by the Boss to possess the property of completely, totally free will. It gradually sinks in you have an INCREDIBLE design headache. How in the WORLD are you going to stop all those trillions and trillions and TRILLIONS of sentients, every single one of whom will have the theoretical capacity of destroying the entire Universe, from doing just that? While retaining completely free will? Man, that\u2019s just impossible. Just flat-out impossible. You go back and ask the Boss to let that free-will requirement go. It\u2019s just too dangerous. The Boss says: \u201cNO!\u201d Back to the drawing board. You make your coffee, grumble to yourself about impossible Bosses with their impossible demands, lean back in your chair, and you think. You think, and you think, and you think, and you think. And one day, the solution hits you out of nowhere, a bolt from the blue. You will make every single sentient\u2014-an ETERNAL being. Beings for whom existence has NO limit. This will keep your free-will-sentient-containing Universe safe for a brilliantly simple reason. Nobody sane is going to burn down their house while they are still in it. Right? And even if somebody tried, all the other free-will sentients would QUICKLY exercise their own free will and put a CRASHING halt to it. HA! THAT\u2019S IT! THAT\u2019S IT! So you immediately set up all your laws of physics so that all sentients are eternal beings. And bang, you have set up a Universe that is completely, perfectly safe from its free-will sentients. The, ahem, Boss is gonna be really, really happy with you. Please note that \u201ckeeping the Universe safe from its sentients\u201d is a totally logical, totally SCIENTIFIC, reason for believing in an afterlife. No citing religious texts. No calls for blind faith, no call to \u201cBelie-e-e-ve, brother!\u201d Just calm, clear logic. You now have a totally rational reason to go into the lab and try to build a soul-detector. Here is one possible way of doing that, based on ghost-hunter reports of \u201cbattery drain\u201d. http://theninepointfivetheses.bl... Along with the story of the cat soul who dived through my chest. (Yeah, I\u2019ve seen it. Not just theory with me.) On Detecting Souls: A Proposed Experiment Now, let me repeat all of the above in a more rigorous fashion. And would you like to live in a world where nobody is afraid to die? Where you personally are no longer afraid to die? It\u2019s only a single experiment away. Oh, by the way, the eventual result of the scientific confirmation of the existence of souls will be the complete and total destruction of all evil on Earth. See my story at the end. Life after death is real, the cold-sober scientific truth, the way the Universe works. Life after death is not a fiction or a fantasy. It is real, something vitally necessary in order for the Universe to be stable, mainly to keep the Universe\u2019s sentients from blowing the Universe the Hell up. On this one thing, the existence of the soul, those silly religious woo-woos are ABSOLUTELY right. Those moonbeam-dancing, ley-line-loving, crystal-worshiping, long-haired-hippie-freak woo-woos are totally dead-bang right. I can prove ALL of this---if you are smart enough to understand it. (Although intelligence really isn\u2019t the main problem, but rather the ability to think clearly and objectively. THAT is rare, even among scientists. THIS IS AN EASY PROBLEM TO SOLVE. Considered simply as an exercise in logic, the problem of the existence of the soul is entirely trivial.) I can prove it all by the best, most rigorous method the human race has ever found for finding the truth. The scientific method. Observation, hypothesis, and finally confirmation by testing in the lab. By building a soul-detector and detecting souls in the lab. The detecting principle, I suspect, will be rapid changes in Planck\u2019s Constant. You don\u2019t even have to use people. You can use cats. Why cats? Cat-soul dived through my chest once. Also, soul theory indicates the source of emotion is the soul, not the brain, and therefore any animal that shows emotion, in particular love, is an eternal being and has a soul. The observation and hypothesis parts I have solved. I\u2019d get the third one too, if I had the money. Alas, I don\u2019t. It would take a million bucks just to start. I continue to hope some bad-boy millionaire scientist or engineer will trip over my Quora answers one day. (You hearing this, Elon? Would you like to smash the whole damn world? I can show you how.) Let me give you the short version, then the long version. Rigorously objective analysis of human behavior reveals human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence, on quite a number of levels. Since human bodies are certainly not eternal, human beings MUST contain an eternally existing component, i.e. they must have souls. You might object something as weird as souls could only exist if the Universe had some EXTREMELY powerful need for them. You would be correct. There actually is an extremely powerful need for a Universe\u2019s sentients to ALL be eternal beings who have souls. It inhibits the sentients from destroying their Universe. If a Universe\u2019s sentients are NOT eternal beings, then the Universe logically becomes Hell. Because most sentients\u2019 lives are composed mostly of pain, and unless their existence was without limit, their pain, and their lives, would be completely meaningless. Live in Hell, and then die. Sentients would destroy any such Universe in a cosmic heartbeat. It would be the MORAL thing to do. And oh my, yes, all sentients possess the theoretical capacity to destroy the entire Universe, as one aspect of sentients is knowledge of how the Universe works, as in the ability to write down the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws and then use those laws to change the Universe around them as they see fit. Stephen Hawking embodied the entire situation perfectly. If anybody understood the Universe\u2019s fundamental laws, it was Stephen Hawking. If anybody suffered at the hands of the Universe, it was Stephen Hawking. (Return to us quickly, Stephen. We need your mind.) And waddya know, Stephen Hawking found a way to destroy the whole damn Universe. With a flick of his little finger. He has pointed out the Higgs field exists in an excited state, and that the existence of all the Universe\u2019s particles depend on the Higgs field remaining in that excited state. So, because the Higgs field exists in an excited state, the Universe contains a fundamental instability which can be used to destroy it. If the Higgs field ever drops to its ground state in any particular area, all the Universe\u2019s particles in that area will promptly disintegrate. And from that area the drop in energy (and therefore disintegration) will spread, exactly like dropping a spark into gunpowder. And the entire Universe dissolves back into the Chaos it came from. So all we have to do is build a machine that will catalyze the drop of the Higgs field to its ground state. We will only have to use it once. (Note to physicists: The initial estimate for an accelerator large enough to reach Higgs field energies and catalyze the destruction of the Universe was \u201can accelerator the size of the Solar System\u201d. Accelerator technology has rapidly evolved since. Fingernail-size accelerators have recently been constructed. Here: https://www.npr.org/sections/hea... How many of these things would you have to daisy-chain together to reach Higgs field energies, I wonder? You physicists should figure this out. And then ask yourselves why this has NOT happened, why the Universe is still there.) We punch the button\u2014-and poof, no more Universe, at the speed of light. Remember, if we all are not eternal beings, we all live in Hell, and this is the moral thing to do. The odds are pretty good the human race is NOT the first sentient species to evolve in the Universe, but no sentient species has ever actually done this. The Universe is still there. I hereby conclude this Universe\u2019s sentients are eternal beings, and there is a way to detect souls in the laboratory. That\u2019s the short version. Now the long version. Here is an essay which explores this Universe-destruction thing further. This is the rock-bottom of it all. It\u2019s ALL about keeping the Universe in one piece, man. ON THE SENTIENT CONSTRAINTS OF A SENTIENT-CONTAINING UNIVERSE http://www.theninepointfivethese... Now an exploration of the various ways human behavior contains the assumption of eternal existence. (This is by no means all the ways.) If human beings possess immortal souls, it should be possibly to logically deduce this by objective analysis of their actions. It should be possible to show in your own personal actions. It should be possible to show you ACT like you have a soul, even when you think you don\u2019t. THE MURDER ON A BEACH THOUGHT EXPERIMENT http://theninepointfivetheses.bl... It should be possible to demonstrate the rule exists in collective action. It should be possible to demonstrate the assumption of eternal existence exists in the foundation rules of the world\u2019s stable societies, although they may not be aware of it. ON EMOTION DRUGS http://www.theninepointfivethese... The physical purpose of souls is stability. So it should be possible to demonstrate denying or removing the assumption of eternal existence results in extreme personal pain and extremely violent instability. AND NOTHING HEARD MY SCREAM http://theninepointfivetheses.bl... Reincarnation. I observe fiction is reincarnation. A RATIONALIST LOOKS AT REINCARNATION People wonder what happens to them when they die. They do it every time they go to a movie, read a book, watch TV, or even watch a commercial. And now one last stinger. This is for the REALLY smart people out there. The existence of souls is currently perceived as mostly an academic debate. Something that won\u2019t make much difference one way or the other. It is not. The confirmation of the existence of souls will cause the most profound change in human behavior there has ever been. This will be a scientific discovery that will cause a change in humanity\u2019s MORAL behavior, as people will finally understand it is impossible to escape the consequences of your actions. Let me illustrate this with a story. A scientist builds a soul-detector, IMMEDIATELY detects souls\u2014-and smashes the entire world. The total and permanent destruction of all evil on Earth begins as the good guys are finally cut loose. Because science has now proven the MORAL thing to do is also the SMART thing to do. AFTER THE AWAKENING https://futurism.media/after-the... This story is the future, what\u2019s about to happen, right around the corner. The Awakening is coming.
