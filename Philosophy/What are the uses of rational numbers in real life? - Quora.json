            "answer_text": "What are the uses of rational numbers in real life? How about its your \u2018birthday\u2019 party and someone brings out a cake. There are 12 people at the party; all want some cake and, to be fair, you want to divide it so that everyone gets the same amount. So, each person gets one twelfth of the cake. One twelfth means one divided by twelve [math]= \\frac {1}{12}[/math] Now \u20181\u2019 and \u201812\u2019 are both integers, i.e. whole numbers (and \u201812\u2019 is certainly not zero), thus one twelfth is a rational number. [math]\\\\[/math] You go to a local shop to buy your lunch, say some sandwiches, a bag of crisps and a soft drink. The person on the till asks you for $4.75. $4.75 is the same as [math]$4\\frac {3}{4} = $\\frac {19}{4}[/math] Now, \u201819\u2019 and \u20184\u2019 are both integers (and \u20184\u2019 is certainly not zero), thus nineteen quarters (fourths to people in the USA) is a rational number. In fact, every financial transaction you have ever been involved with has involved rational numbers. [math]\\\\[/math] Going back to your \u2018birthday\u2019, how old were you? Let\u2019s say 20. Well, 20 = [math]\\frac {20}{1}.[/math] Now, \u201820\u2019 and \u20181\u2019 are both integers (and \u20181\u2019 is certainly not zero), thus twenty is a rational number. Ah, your \u2018birthday\u2019 was actually one week earlier, whilst you were on holiday. So, when you are dividing up the cake, you are actually 20 years and 1 week old. Approximating a year as 52 weeks, you are therefore 20 years and one fifty-second of a year old, i.e. [math]20\\frac {1}{52} = \\frac {1041}{52}[/math] Now, \u20181041\u2019 and \u201852\u2019 are both integers (and \u201852\u2019 is certainly not zero), thus your age is a rational number.

            "answer_text": "Rational numbers are used to construct the real numbers rigorously by using Dedekind cuts or Cauchy sequences. They are countable and a dense subset of R (the set of real numbers), making R a separable space too, which shows that every open cover of a set in (R,||x||) (||x|| is the Euclidean metric) has a countable subcover (Lindel\u00f6f's covering theorem). If two continuous functions are equal on a dense subset of some metric space then they are equal everywhere. As Q (the set of rational numbers) is a countable dense subset of R, it is helpful in proving that the set of continuous functions on R has cardinality |R|. Also, I think if a space has the Cantor intersection property (The intersection of any infinite sequence of nested closed and bounded sets isn't the empty set) and is seperable then it satisfies the Heine-Borel theorem, all closed and bounded sets are compact. I'm not sure about that last one. ",
