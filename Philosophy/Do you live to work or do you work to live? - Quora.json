            "answer_text": " I think Nick Offerman put this best when he said this: \u201cIt\u2019s so sad that so much of our society says \u2018Man, Thank God it\u2019s Friday!\u2019. Thank God 5 of the 7 days of my life are f*cking over, because I hate 5/7ths of my life. Now I\u2019m going to spend 2/7ths getting drunk at Olive Garden so I don\u2019t have to think about the upcoming 5/7ths.\u201d If you work to live then you are not living! You are spending a giant part of your life hating your life, for what? So you can have enough money to survive the week just to go back to work? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I know some people have to take on bad jobs or use a not-so-good job as a stepping stone, but too many people treat that as the end goal. I\u2019ve heard people tell me that you are not supposed to enjoy your work, that it sucks for everyone and everybody should hate it, and that it\u2019s a myth that anyone could love to work. What a horribly sad way to view the world! How defeated must they be to settle for such a negative life? Most people that do this live to work. Their work runs their entire life to the point that they will often will drive themselves to the brink of stress, burnout and even depression. When asked about what surprised the Dalai Lama most about humanity he said something that nails this on the head: \u201cMan.Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money.Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health.And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present;the result being that he does not live in the present or the future;he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.\u201d To me, letting your work run you like this is one of the worst ways to live your life. That being said, this is obviously not a black-and-white scale; there are a lot of grays in the middle. People who enjoy their work at times, who spend their hard earned money on luxuries and experiences and joy, and those who go more into the white and actually do both. But the ideal, in my opinion, is to lead a life in which your work does not feel like work. A world in which you get paid to do the things you love; one in which it feels like the 2/7th are the worst part of your week relatively speaking. If you approach the week with joy and excitement rather than stress and sadness, you are probably going in the right direction. ",

He and I had a nice chat. We talked about the fact that I'd already made a solid reputation for myself around the company. I didn't need to kill myself so much. As an individual who had been in the industry for over 20 years, One Ball gave me some safe advice. \u201cWork to live, don\u2019t live to work.\u201d Money is a great thing but it's meaningless if you don't take the time to enjoy it and the family you're working to support. Besides that, at my pay rate the more I worked the more I'd be taxed and all my hard work was for much less than I'd earned. Since then, I've worked hard to establish strong self- care habits and try to set boundaries between work and family. While I would love to be back making the big money I used to make, I do love my new career. I still volunteer for overtime whenever it's available but I no longer feel obligated to the company I work for. ",

            "answer_text": "Ideally, work should be a part of your life. But then we don't live in the ideal world.If you work to live or live to work, that depends on your perception of work and the kind of your work. Also, internal factors play a role in deciding what you perceive your work as. There are people who love what they do and they would not want to miss a day of it, their work is what brings them happiness and excitement. They are ready to keep other needs, societal obligations and family needs at a lower pedestal. They live to work. The only strength and sense of happiness they derive is from the work they do. We know them also as workaholics. There are others who get stuck with jobs they don't like and don't enjoy their work. But, to survive one needs to fulfil some basic needs and in order to do that you need money,and hence you need to work to live, to sustain. Romanticism regarding the perfect life, where you neither work to live nor live to work, but, strike a perfect balance between the two, is commonly talked of. But, it is achieved by few.You need to be happy and satisfied with yourself and your surroundings in order for that to happen. And, as I said, this sense of content is achieved by very few. ",

            "answer_text": "A question with thousands of unique answers, many of which could probably be characterized as accurate, so here's my take on the situation. Here's the long answer: One common goal among everyone who is granted the opportunity to live on earth is, undoubtedly, the pursuit of happiness. Each person's life tells a unique tale, from a different point of view. So how can billions of variable scenarios come to define a single goal, that is, happiness? Research has shown that we are more likely to gain a deeper satisfaction and greater level of happiness through experiences gained, rather than material possession. The basic principle being: It would prove more valuable to one's life to save for a trip to Europe (just an example, any experience would do) than to buy a new wardrobe. As both 'Living' and 'Working' can provide happy (and horrible, for that matter) experiences that can last a lifetime, it all boils down to what the individual values in life. Some would receive more enjoyment from raising a child to become a productive member of society, over climbing a corporate ladder, and vice versa. Essentially, some will achieve their happiness through experiences gained by \"Living to Work\" and some by \"Working to Live.\" Here's the short answer: Personally, I'd prefer to work my ass off in order to gain experiences by \u201cLiving.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Very interesting question there which reminds me of this, are we living or existing? Well, truth be told, in order for humans to survive, they must engage themselves in some work to meet basic necessities. So our work enables us to generate income to live on. However, each one of us has a greater purpose to life, and finding that purpose is what makes you have a reason to keep pushing against the storm. This need gives us fulfilment in life. \u201cLiving to work\u201d is now a matter of choice and financial investments. In the beginning, we all start by working towards something, it could be with a long term focus of setting up a business. I am of the view that, a wise investment is one that you can live off should you stop working\u2026it is wealth that is generational. At that moment, your focus is no longer about \u201cliving to work\u201d but merely engaging in activities you are passionate about that will bring positive impact in other people\u2019s lives. It is no longer about self but about achieving greater good. The sad truth however is that most people are not living, but existing. Why?they live to work until they are old and retired. Only a smaller percent of people are actually living and expanding their potentials. My notion is, I should work hard to the point where my money begins to work hard for me. Wise investment portfolio. This system will then allow me to be able to live my life in full as intended. So, quiet a tricky question but just depends on what one\u2019s view about life is. It really comes down to choice, where you want to go and how you will work it. ",

I have a handful of close friends, some of whom are half a world away, as are my mom and sister. They mean a lot to me, but I hardly get to see them. And that's OK with me. ",

I feel that working, living a life in a routine, maximising my productivity is like a vacation for me. It doesn't require taking much risks and doesn't require a lot of improvisation. Travelling solo on the other hand I consider it as somewhat like a work. A work that I really really enjoy. Why? Well, travelling alone requires planning, taking many risks, putting trust on strangers and making random friends, which all requires hard work and high tolerance. Trekking the Himalayan mountains, is not exactly vacation, when you had to walk up mountains 8 hours a day, sleep where ever the lodge owner put you, being in the forest alone most of the time.  But since travelling is something I love and enjoy most of the time, no parts of my life feels like work anymore. It all blended into one word, \"Life\". ",

            "answer_text": "Its actually like this. . People work to earn living, to have all their necessities & luxuries but eventually the process of doing work makes it live to work. Work is what makes a person busy. One gets involved in what they are ought to do may it be of their choice or no. Lucky ones get to do the work of where their passion lies but those who don't have the work of their passion they still have to do their work. So they convince themselves for liking their work & then out of 24 hours people work 8 to 10 hours, sleep for 7 to 8 hours & the remaining time that is obviously quite less they spend for themselves their family & friends. This means most of the time people just work in their life & eventually work to live becomes live to work. People when face difficulties & emotional set backs in life they start working in the name of diverting their attention from the grave incident or misfortune or any such bad happening with them instead of nurturing their souls & gaining more wisdom they resort to working & their life changes to just live to work. The above answer is just an opinion on the basis of observing lives of some different people. Thanks. ",

Secondly, when we live to work, we often neglect our health, and if our health is affected, ultimately our capacity to work will be affected. So it is reasonable to work to live.  ",

Shiny PVC pants loose pleated for men tight fitted for women. Shiny patent shoes. That are airated to allow oxygen flow, and promote cooling.CLEAR PVC aprons.I wish we could just stay quiet too. The customer likes us to mindlessly serve them. It makes them feel superior. Just have our head lowered and be docile. I suggest taking small amounts of dexedrine too it will help for the long hours. And help put you in that mindset to treat the customer like a Goddess or God. Which will make them want to come back. Every staff member should give the boss a 5 dollar gift card, and a thank you card every paycheque. Cashiers should also take over the role of service clerk. So when a cashier isn't doing anything they are available to serve customers and perform carry outs. Carry outs shouldn't be an option either it should be a mandatory service. On the rare occasion a customer should be allowed to go with the customer supervised of course to put away the groceries for the customer. Wash vegetables and fruits, and be trained to do prep work. Starbucks uniforms as well as the others should be the same colours but have a PVC layer over it and PVC aprons. To draw the attention. Light flirting should also be allowed. Don't over do it but let's face it sex sells. Rainchecks should be printed out. We shouldn't think we should just mindlessly serve. When a cashier is free they should follow a customer around with their permission of course to grab things off the shelf and push their cart. Indian customers will love this the most. As cashiers are slaves there. And they will want to spend more money in our store. ",
