            "answer_text": "Youre a high school junior with a 3.4 GPA, and you don't know enough about calculating your grade point average on your own? You absolutely should be panicking! Let's go over this step by step, and see if we can enlighten you on the process. There are two ways we could calculate your GPA: class by class grade (too many), or by year, taking your cumulative GPA each year. I'm going to use that one, because it's much easier. What we'll do is take the sum of each year's GPA, and divide the sum by the number of high school years you will have taken when you're finished. Your GPA now is 3.4 (not bad at all.) Let's multiply that by 2, since that's your cumulative grade for freshman and sophomore years. That gives us 6.8. We dont know what your grades will be in your junior and senior years, so let's figure out the maximum, and go from there. Let's say everything comes together and you get a 4.0 in your junior year. Then, another 4.0 in your senior year. That's 4.0 + 4.0 + 6.8 (from your freshman and sophomore years) = 14.8. Then, we divide 14.8 by 4, which leaves us with an even 3.7 GPA. That is the maximum GPA you could earn if you ace your entire junior and senior years. Now, can you do that--can you ace all your classes even though you're sitting at a 3.4 right now? That's a question that only you can answer. Its also possible that your high school offers AP courses, which can theoretically leave you with a GPA higher than 4.0, but you will be required to do more arduous assignments, papers and exam problems. My advice is to shoot for at least a 3.5 GPA, take standard test prep courses, and develop some well- rounded interests if you want to be considered by better colleges and universities. Good luck. P.S. And learn how to compute averages! ",

            "answer_text": "Do not stress! A 3.4 is a fine GPA and you will be able to get into good colleges with that GPA. I am a junior in college right now and I got sucked into thinking my GPA was everything and I limited myself by not applying to more advanced colleges. I got into every college I applied to (Lewis and Clark, University of San Diego, CU Boulder, Lafayette) The reality is, colleges look more at your extracurriculars and interview since grades can be so subjective. Especially with Covid-19, schools are putting much less weight on GPA. Don\u2019t panic but if you want to get your GPA up, schedule a meeting with all your teachers and ask what you can do to get an A/to improve your grade. It makes a big difference for your teachers to see how much you care. I recommend an in-person, or zoom, meeting instead of an email. Show up to tutoring sessions, consider taking an off period (especially junior, year off-period(s) are really helpful since there is so much additional stress with SAT/ACT and applying to college) and focus on the classes you can get a good grade in. Say you struggle in Physics so you spend a lot of energy in that class to get a B, but it takes so much of your time you get worse grades in other classes - that\u2019s not a good look and it\u2019s going to hurt your GPA more. Colleges understand that not every student will excel in every subject and what looks best on an application is to try and apply yourself to multiple subjects and extracurriculars but you only need to excel in a few. Try to get a few As. Good luck! ",
