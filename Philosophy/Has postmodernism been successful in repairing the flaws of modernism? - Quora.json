            "answer_text": "Asking whether postmodernism was \u201csuccessful in repairing the flaws of modernism\u201d is like asking if a movie critic is successful at repairing the flaws of a movie. It\u2019s not what they aim to do at all. Postmodernism is a critique of modernism. It is not intended to be Modernism 2.0. Particularly, postmodernism is notoriously devoid of solutions. It often points to how things are bad\u2014really really bad\u2014and then leaving us hanging without a solution. This aspect of postmodernism is internally consistent with its critique because, for one, postmodernism seriously questions the role of reason and systems in advancing the human condition. Providing solutions would entail providing a systematic procedure which would undermine the whole project. ",
