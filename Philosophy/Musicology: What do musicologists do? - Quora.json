            "answer_text": "There's no set rules and there's a lot of areas of specialization that you can go into, but in the long run you want to develop and attain the skills necessary to come to a very deep understanding of how music actually works. If you hear a song on the radio for example, you should be able to identify some traits of it and speak coherently and articulately about it's history, significance, and meaning.  It's harder than you think -- music is such an abstract thing that most people have trouble talking about even the basics of what it's \"doing\". It's good to treat it as scholarly field, because it's populated by academics and intellectuals whom most of them probably consider themselves to be \"researchers\" in the area of music.  It's fundamentally different from how most people appreciate the medium -- the vast majority being listeners and audience members first and foremost, with a few of them deciding that they want to become producers (performers/composers) of the art form.  Musicologists, on the other hand, observe these trends and happenings from a distanced standpoint, hoping that a birds-eye view of the situation would help to shed some light on the things that are happening around them. Like any other research field, the way to spend your time is to read what people are writing, go to conferences/meetings if you can, learn the lingo and quirks of the people who attend and run these things.   Why would anyone want to become a musicologist?  No idea.  In my case, the profession chose me, rather than the other way around, I feel. ",

            "answer_text": "University programs vary, but you can expect at least the following requirements: - Piano proficiency (which can require two years of courses)- Personal instrument proficiency (two years)- Choral participation, if you're not a vocal major (also two years)- Possibly an early music instrument proficiency (Renaissance music and earlier)- Sight-singing proficiency (usually goes along with two years of basic music theory courses)- Aural skills proficiency (same as above)- Advanced music theory coursework- Advanced music history and literature coursework- A thesis on a topic in music history and literature Even for a good musician, a music degree takes a lot of day-to-day time.  Expect to be very, very busy. As for what kind of job you might be able to find, outside of teaching, one might look into writing about music, working in a music library, working in the radio industry, and things of that sort. ",
