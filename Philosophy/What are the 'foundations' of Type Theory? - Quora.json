            "answer_text": "Great Question! First of all what is Type Theory? Type Theory is a Programming Language invented by mathematicians to encode the mathematics. It was done several times by Russel, Church, Kleene, Martin-L\u00f6f. The latter is a ground for homotopy type theory that implemented in modern provers like Agda, Lean, cubicaltt, RedPRL and theoretical languages such as Calculus of Constructions, Calculus of Inductive Constructions and Calculus of Higher Inductive Types. What mathematicians call foundations in this context for type theory itself? The categorical models! The most formal and complete models of type theories are (pre)sheaf models. Usual models for dependent type theories was Categories with Families (Dybjer), Categories with Attributes, C-Systems (Voevodsky), but CwF of (pre)sheaves gives us direct correctness and computation in intensional type theory. However some problems remains in sheaf models while constructing with universes. ",

You can find out all about the foundations from the Wikipedia article on the Calculus of Constructions, which speaks to the logic-as-a-calculus. ",
