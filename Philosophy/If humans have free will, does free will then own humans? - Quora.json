            "answer_text": "No. That's the same as asking, \"If humans have free will, is free will then not free will?\" It's stringing words together to say something that contradicts itself\u2014to make a phrase not mean what it means. People don't understand \"free will\" because they're trying to understand it as if it is an object, force, or substance that has a discrete existence. It is better understood as something people do. People can freely will. If you don't believe me, go outside right now and howl at the moon. .... Hey, why didn't you go? Because you control your own will\u2014not me. That being said, humans can\u2014and often do\u2014submit their wills to other things or to the will of others. For example, someone who is willing to control their appetite and eat healthy will yield to their desire and pig out on comfort food and dessert. A robbery victim may hand over his wallet though he desires to keep it, acting against his will but according to his better judgment. Yet, in handing over his wallet, the victim is exercising his will\u2014to choose between two opposing intents: keeping his wallet and staying alive. The fact that we all will against our own will\u2014coupled with the fact that we don't always do this consistently\u2014is what demonstrates our capability to will. Nothing demonstrates free agency like whim. ",

            "answer_text": "Thats like saying, \"If apples are red, does red own apples?\" In other words, its a bit weird to ask if an adjective owns you. Adjectives define you. And apples.  That said, adjectives can influence you. Maybe red apples get eaten more because they look tasty.  Maybe humans who obsess with free will miss out on utilizing their free will. P.S: To be extra clear, because free-will is posed as possibly a defining characteristic of being human, its can be viewed as an adjective. ",

            "answer_text": "Free will is a second order thing. Consequential. You couldn't choose NOT to have free will, so you don't have free will. But there is a first order natural law of human behavior, and that isn't free will at all. All humans are compelled beyond their control to do whatever they believe to be in their best interest. Think about that. There is no escaping that, like there's no escape from gravity, and if there should come one, it would be a victory, not a crime. ",
