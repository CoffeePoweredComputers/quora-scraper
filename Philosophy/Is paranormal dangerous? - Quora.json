            "answer_text": "Personally, I think it's like asking \u201cAre people dangerous?\u201d Ghosts are formed when people die. Sometimes they realize they're dead, sometimes they dont. But they definitely carry their personality to the other world. Some things they learn or pick up later. But they are also governed by a few rules, just like we are -eat, drink, sleep and cycles of time. Most ghosts can't leave from one place; they're stuck. Now with lockdown and all, how do you feel? Stuck? Irritated? Angry and cranky? Now imagine this lockdown goes on for years together. How would you feel then? Now imagine someone comes inside your house and asks you, \u201cRespond if you can hear me\u201d Or \u201cshow me your presence\u201d. INSIDE your house. Or better still, asks a favour of you or tries to enrage you just to get a response from you. How would you feel? What would you do? Place yourself in that situation, really put yourself in that situation and you'll find out how the ghosts feel. Now, are ghosts dangerous? Tell me, are people dangerous? Of course, they are. People are capable of any amount of atrocities on another human being or on more than one people. Ghosts have the benefit of being invisible. INVISIBLE. That's what you are up against when you go poking around in their world. Now tell me, how do you read people? How do you find out whether they are good or bad, dangerous or nice, or whether they can harm you or help you? By looking at their eyes, their expression, their body language, and hearing them speak. Right? Ghosts do nothing of this. So how will you find out? That's why they are dangerous, that's why they should never be poked, that's why they should never be invoked or angered, because you never know what their intentions are for you. You wouldn't even know if they are near you or have left you alone. So it's best to keep away from them. ",
