            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not a research scientist, but here\u2019s my thoughts on general weaknesses in our current approach to scientific research: Personal human bias is always a big issue. Yes, in a perfect world a scientist follows the results wherever they may go, but in reality scientists are humans too and can bend data analysis to fit a certain way due to personal beliefs or external pressure.To go along with the above, institutional/group bias could also be a problem. Not all science is done with impartial funding. There\u2019s going to be scientists with an agenda/bias due to external pressures from their company/organization.Also closely related is the reproduce-ability of results. This is an issue that has been coming up on the radar lately as in order to get and justify funding, you have to have your work published and gather attention. This external pressure can cause scientists to cherry-pick and/or flat out falsify data to achieve a certain result.Obviously what these issues I\u2019m bringing up have in common is the \u201chuman\u201d factor. A method is only as good as the individuals executing it, and in many cases it seems that problems stem not from the method itself, but from the people executing it. ",
