            "answer_text": "\u2026 if one were to go to a psychic (any one) for a reading, what should they do to know if the psychic has this ability and is not a fraud (like how almost all psychics are)? \u2026 most psychics are not frauds; even psychics who believe they are deliberately committing fraud may still be genuinely psychic. all people are psychics, but some people have a better developed ability than others. any person you speak with may inadvertently read something about you and then share it with you in an unexpected manner. psychics have learned to do this sort of thing more often and more reliably than most other people, but like all other people, any psychic may have a bad day or a bad streak. it would be unfair to call them a fraud simply because they aren\u2019t up to their usual standards of performance all the time. what a person most needs to know when consulting a psychic is how to use misinformation to their own advantage. a psychic who provides very accurate reliable information may actually be doing their clients harm. this is because people need challenging growth experiences to help them mature and excel in life. if a psychic hands out success on a plate it may stunt their client\u2019s growth as well as make other people jealous or suspicious of their client. this means that frauds can actually be much more helpful than psychics with a strong reputation for reliability. to get the most out of any psychic reading regardless of whether or not you might believe the psychic may be a fraud you need to learn how to listen with your heart. your heart knows what you need to know, it just lacks the right words. but your heart can say uh-uh (for no) or uh-huh (for yes) and you can listen to those responses to know when someone has said something useful. the uh-uh responses can be particularly helpful because by defining what is not correct you develop a clearer idea about what is correct. hearing an uh-huh affirmation can often be misleading because those uh-huhs may really come from your mind rather than your heart; the uh-huhs from your mind are more often wishful thinking that may lead to trouble. going to several different psychics and hearing your heart say uh-uh many times may help you decide what your best course of action will be even if none of the psychics spoke it in words for you. we learned this partly by observing our clients during their readings. we were puzzled why some people like to see so many different psychics. we usually recommended a client return for a reading only every three months because that is the natural cycle needed to fully process a good reading and reap its rewards. it is far better to become adept at turning all spoken or written words to your own advantage than it is to find a reliable psychic. \u2026 -enjoy! love, the grigs\u2026 \u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "As a person who has went to psychics for more than a decade and knows these sort of things, here are the things what you should do in order to determine that a psychic is true or is a fraud: Ask yourself questions about whether the psychic can do something that seems grandiose. Here are some examples:Does the psychic offers spells that can help you with problems such as money or relationships (such as reuniting lovers). Honestly, no one can do something like this, not even a psychic or some sort of a real \u201cmiracle worker\u201d. You can\u2019t, especially, affect the free will of others. Spell casting is impossible.Does the psychic tell you that you have a curse and asks you for money to let it go? Run away!!! Some people have even paid $10000+ for such things that have never worked. No one can place a curse on you. That is impossible and this is such a common psychic scam.Maybe ask the psychic to demonstrate their ability to you without charging you? You should see it for yourself. If something feels even a little off, and you ask for an explanation and do not get an adequate answer, then assume that the psychic is a fraud.Ask some important questions to the psychic about psychic abilities. They should know it, even if they say they were born with this gift (I think). Here are some examples:How does the theory of psychic abilities work?How do you personally \u201cperceive/sense\u201d the information that you get through your ExtraSensory Perception (ESP)/the 6th sense? Also, can you give me an example, a real one or a made up one that is similar to a real one, of how you have sensed someone else and was able to help that person?How did you get this gift? If you were born with it, then you still must\u2019ve developed it. If so, then how?",

            "answer_text": "There are several things that you can do to ensure that you are dealing with someone that is legitimate. First I want to remind you that a lot of tarot readers are confused with psychics and they aren\u2019t the same thing. So the first thing that is important is to have an idea what you are looking for, and if the reader that you have chosen fits that bill. Next thing you want to do is to google them. Usually one of the best indications as to authenticity is how long they have been in business. A lot of frauds make it about six months before they are outed and have to close down. Typically the longer a person has been in the business the better. From there you want to check and see about the business itself. Is there a name attached to it and an address? The more documentation that looks legit the better. In this day and age you can also find reviews online to check too. Find out what people are saying on Google, Yelp, Facebook, etc\u2026 No reader is ever going to be 100% accurate or make every client happy, so it isn\u2019t a bad thing to see less then glowing reviews, as long as they account for a small percentage. Now the financial aspect. What methods of payment do they accept? (Avoid Western Union!) Do they have a refund policy? Are they charging a reasonable fee? You want to watch out for those who tell you that they also sell special candles/can remove curses, etc\u2026 these are usually signs of a scam. Overall do your research, be smart about your choices, and when in doubt simply say \u201cwe aren\u2019t connecting\u201d and walk out. It\u2019s not always easy to find someone good who you connect with, so it may take a couple tries, but when you find the right one it is all worth it! ",

Good readers don\u2019t have to charge huge fees. Be skeptical if they do! If you are thinking of going to a local reader then do your homework and find out from friends and people you meet who they have been using and how accurate the readings were for them. Investigate thoroughly and then decide and make your appointment. Go for the fun and experience. Try not not to have specific expectations of what you are hoping to hear. Let the reader use their skills to tell you things that are uppermost in their importance. That is what good readers do. I prefer not to know anything about my clients and the reading is more helpful in my experience. While its true that not all readers are accurate in everything that they will tell you. Most are well meaning and not trying to con you! ",
