            "answer_text": "As the youth of this country, we have an opportunity to contribute to the country in many ways. But before we jump into anything, it is very important that we enhance our own abilities and competence, because just a desire to contribute is not enough. We must have an equanimous mind which allows us to apply ourselves in every situation. But at the same time, we must be do our jobs with full exuberance. This is necessary so that our work is effective enough. Coming to how we can contribute, there are a variety of issues in our country. We need to be observant enough to know what is best needed for the people around is and to enhance their lives. The issues can be divided into local issues and issues which may cover larger territory, maybe, a district, state, or country. Your observation and attention is needed to identify the local issues and innovate ways to solve them. If you look carefully, every district or every state represents a distinct set of problems. However, most of them could be solved if the local issues get sorted out. Because ultimately, the state issues are more or less a reflection or net summation of various local issues. Essentially, I feel it is important to work at the grassroots level. And just not your contribution is enough. We need youth from all over the country to take responsibility. The policies brought on the state and the national level should support the activities taken up on the grassroots. Only then we can see some significant change. ",

It doesn't take more than that to make the world a better place. You don\u2019t have to move mountains . Start small, maybe, with family, then friends, college groups and then figure out which groups of people who you have the most compassion for. Is it grieving widows, uneducated street children, homeless people, kids who are bullied, kids who are invisible in the class room etc. Find out the group of people, who when you help, it makes your soul smile, your heart dance with delight. Spend time with those people, volunteer in those groups and you will figure out for yourself your own unique way to contribute to society. ",

            "answer_text": "As a student you play a crucial role in the future of humanity. Observe it, know what is positive in it and what is negative in it. The more you learn about a human the more you will know about his condition right now and how he should be in future. Because you are the future, you can design it as your wish. If your design of future gets acclaimed among others, they will adopt yours. Thus whole humanity may come under your idea.  HUMANITY IS RUNNING LIKE HELL RIGHT NOW FOR BLOOD AND MONEY. YOU CAN COME UP WITH A LIVELY IDEA TO HELP THE SOCIETY AND HUMANKIND TO LIVE LIFE EFFICIENTLY IN MOST POSSIBLE WAYS. IGNITE YOUR INTELLECT If you learn now what is what, you'll get an idea whether this society is going upstairs or downstairs, and which one is a better choice for human to live a better life. If something is going right or wrong in a positive or negative way note it down in your memory right now. So that you can act accordingly in changing the humanity if you think it is not good. AS A STUDENT ONE THING YOU SHOULD KNOW FIRST OF ALL, 'LEARNING' MEANS TO KNOW SOMETHING AND TO HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND 'LEARNING' DOESN'T MEAN TO ADOPT SOMETHING AND HAVE SOME PREJUDICES, JUDGEMENTS AND CONCLUSIONS ABOUT SOMETHING OR SOMEONE. All the very best :) ",

I still remember\u2026 I went from high school straight to college, and I was so impressed with how worldly and wise my professors appeared to be. I ran out of money and dropped out of college. I ended up enlisting in the Army, and after my discharge went back to the same college. Remember those wise professors? I found myself amazed at how parochial and narrow-minded they were after I had real world experience of my own. I also realized how much of the personal political views some of them tried to foist off on students were shaped by their own lack of experience in the real world. If you truly wish to benefit society, start learning to compare differing viewpoints. Don\u2019t be afraid to be the Devil\u2019s Advocate, and for God\u2019s sake, don\u2019t waste time and money by choosing a major like \u201cGender Studies,\u201d or \u201cAfrican-American Studies.\u201d See how many job offers you get with a BS in those fields.

You have no credibility in how one should alter business operations and social institutions when everything you advocate comes from teachers who likewise never worked in the real world. And the desire to just tear it all down ignores the harm caused by that social disruption and destruction. It dismisses the risk that after you tear it down to rebuild, no one may rebuild (a common issue with eminent domain and civic groups that are destroyed, leaving a hole in the social fabric). It arrogantly assumes that what is built on top of the ruins is better, and if it isn\u2019t better, tends to turn into violence against those who said \u201clet\u2019s not tear it all down, maybe incremental change, it is safer and more controlled\u201d.

Life chances would be evenly distributed rather than a concentrated in the 20-65 age range. No longer would people be thrown on the scrap-heap for being ill, disabled, too old etc: rather, there would be a just way of distributing resources to all. This could be implemented in various ways to adjust to society\u2019s changing needs. I am able to define only a good society. ",
