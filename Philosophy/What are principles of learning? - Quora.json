            "answer_text": "You\u2019ve been listening to someone who doesn\u2019t really know about learning, or who has fabricated their own list of so-called \u201cprinciples.\u201d Learning is governed by enless variables, and has many types. For starters, from \u201clearning,\u201d Wikipedia: \u201cThe nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many fields, including educational psychology, neuropsychology, experimental psychology, and pedagogy. Research in such fields has led to the identification of various sorts of learning. For example, learning may occur as a result of habituation, or classical conditioning, operant conditioning or as a result of more complex activities such as play, seen only in relatively intelligent animals.Learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness. Learning that an aversive event can't be avoided nor escaped may result in a condition called learned helplessness. There is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally, in which habituation has been observed as early as 32 weeks into gestation, indicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in development. Play has been approached by several theorists as the first form of learning. Children experiment with the world, learn the rules, and learn to interact through play. Lev Vygotsky agrees that play is pivotal for children's development, since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games.\u201d See the many types of learning at that site and find out why no 6 \u201cprinciples\u201d could possible suffice, except maybe as a beginning.

            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cWhat are the 5 principles of learning?\u201d The principles of learning are contained in and communicated from the subject of Study. You can take a course on how to study, like The Student Hat Course (80 hours), or The Basic Study Manual and learn these principles and how to apply them, as a student. Affinity, Reality and Communication equal Understanding. This is abbreviated as ARC = U. One has to have some level of Affinity for a subject to learn it. When one increases their affinity for a subject, like realizing they like it, one also increases their reality, and their ability to communicate with the subject. Affinity is the general term, people usually think in terms of emotion. Emotions can be arranged into a scale from low or negative emotions to very high. The range of human emotions is considered 0 or the feeling of death up to 4.0 or enthusiasm. Serenity of beingness at 40.0 would be way above the normal level for human emotions, but such levels have been discussed in human experience. There are negative emotions down to -40 or total failure. One has to have some level of reality or agreement on each things they learn. One recommendation is for a reader to read through a book, or a new subject, and look for something they can agree with. Then start again and read the book, or learn the subject, for understanding. When one raises their level of agreement, or reality, one also increases their affinity, and ability to communicate and together their understanding of the book or subject. Communications is the corner stone of this three way or triangular relationship with affinity and reality. To improve your communications with someone, you might start with increasing your affinity/emotions or your reality/agreement which will result in an increase in your ability with communications. One definition of Art is the quality of communication. So a beautiful painting, or art, would be one that communicates best. All mathematics can be derived from ARC=U. Understanding can be defined as: to have a clear and true idea or notion of something, or full and exact knowledge of something. This would include learning something as a skill. 2. The only reason a student gives up a study, or becomes confused and unable to learn is that they have gone past a word that not understood. This principle has resulted in a very successful technology known as Word Clearing. When a word is located that a person went past it may clarify a basic confusion, it may return an ability to learn when one has become unable to learn. When one has given up on a subject, a word can be found that returns their willingness to learn that subject. In fact this can be systematically applied to all subjects to clarify all confusions, all unwillingness's to learn, and all inabilities to learn. 3. A datum can be evaluated only by a datum of comparable magnitude. You can not learn about the behavior of a nation by learning the behavior of an ant. They are not comparable. It makes no sense to try to tell someone how big a mountain is by showing him a grain of sand. If you want to teach someone about what a car is which would better: a verbal description, a picture, to see one in a show room, or a test drive? 4. A datum is as valuable at it has been evaluated. The importance of something has to be compared to the importance's of other things. Someone says, \u201cWill you take me to the dance?\u201d It might be easy to say, \u201cYes!\u201d But if the right person asks you do the dance, then you have evaluated your answer. You might have three job offers. Which is the most valuable? How would you find out? A philosopher asks, \u201cIf you have a sea of data, or ideas, like the drops of water in an ocean, how do you sort out which are the valuable ones and which are not of value?\u201d The answer is personal observation, personal inspection, personal evaluation, personal testing, and personal re-testing. The more you have evaluated something, the more likely it will be of value to you. 5. The value of a datum is established by the amount of alignment (relationship) it imparts to other data. The owner of a prestigious company once asked me how I begin any project, just as I was going out the door at the end of my job interview. What is the first thing I do? I said, \u201cI start with First Principles.\u201d The first principles of a subject are the ideas that align all the other data in a subject. So what is the value of knowing such thing?
