One is evil, he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, self-doubt, and ego. The other is good, he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith. The same fight is going on inside you, and inside every other person too.\u201d The grandson then asked his grandfather, \u201cWhich wolf will win?\u201d The old chief simply replied, \u201cThe one you feed.\u201d . . . There\u2019s a battle in everyone\u2019s mind. Sitting on one shoulder is an angel, and smirking from the other shoulder is, of course, the devil. Our great friend. The annoying thing is that they both try to whisper words into your ears at the same damn time, occasionally talking over each other and yelling insults in the process. It can sometimes feel as though there is this tussle, this fight-to-the death for power of your mind and emotions. Shhh(!) Promise you\u2019ll keep this between me and you: Sometimes my mind feels like a ticking time bomb, too. Trust me, it\u2019s fine. You won\u2019t feel like one hundred bucks every day. Some days, you may even feel as though you just finished a marathon run across the scorching Arizona deserts. Your fuel tank\u2019s finally dried up. Hell, some days the silent voices of doubt may even hiss louder and louder as they creep up to bite you. To tell you that you\u2019re not good enough. That you\u2019re a Godforsaken loser. That you should call it quits. Throw in the towel. You\u2019ll experience conflict in your mind a lot. Some days, it\u2019ll be like No Man\u2019s Land up there, let me tell you. And that\u2019s fine. Don\u2019t sweat it. What\u2019s important is that you know what your answer is to this question: Which wolf will you feed? I write more over at Medium. You should pay a visit sometimes :) ",

I think when we unable to decide which or what way to take in situations or what to choose may cause unsettled feelings and may cause self-conflict. The self-conflict arises from unsure of self, unable to find a better way and the stress may cause conflict to self as well. It also can arise from lack of self-confident of self or unable to accept the facts about self. Please don\u2019t waste your time against yourself from own conflict but start to focus on your positive area and find it and develop it to the fullest. Remember, every one of us humans have something others do not have. It is called God\u2019s gifts. It is the way brilliant God created all of us so that we\u2019ll need for each other. Find your gifts and use them wisely. ",

It helps avoid facing those inner conflicts\u2026..for periods of time anyway\u2026..but eventually, we find it hard to divert our attention away from those conflict that refuse to \u201cgo away for good\u201d. This is why many folks turn to various addictions IMO. Even a media or intellectual addiction can now develop to feel apart of something \u201cmore important than solving their inner conflicts\u201d (and desperate to gain and keep the acceptance (or status/celebrity) in the eyes of others). Politicians, advertisers and media in general \u201cpeddle this trap\u201d to weak and needy folks who have unresolved inner conflicts. Note: Charles Manson and other cult leaders did this exact same thing\u2026..needy people search for answers and clever predators sense that and are delighted to serve that role. So Yes, I think this is a fairly common dilemma\u2026.basically: children with inner conflicts that have yet to \u201cgrow up\u201d. Like Peter Pan\u2026..Pinocchio\u2026\u2026not know how to grow up\u2026.in a holding pattern over an airport unable to land\u2026.like no landing gear: due to inner unresolved conflicts. Before you \u201ccondemn me\u201d, I was one of those folks with unresolved issues before and after my three divorces. I\u2019m 71 now and can reflect back and see those more clearly. ",

When we feel both good and bad about a situation, then we are said to be ambivalent (ambiguous is when nothing is clear about the situation).

            "answer_text": "All the time, depending on how impactful the parenting, and teaching was. Most of us operate on the fears, fallacies, fables imposed on us by parents, teachers, preachers, politicians. When you focus on the fundamental realities of life, as expressed in the mantra Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, you infuse validity into your mental-emotional activities. Many problems seem to re-occur at times, and places. They are usually created by negative thoughts of one kind, or another. Habits are often like walls around behavior choices. Blame is often looked for, and assigned. Oh, it\u2019s their religion, or its their social status, their caste, or it\u2019s their economic system, or it\u2019s their tribalism, or it\u2019s just what they do, or it\u2019s their lack of religion, or its their educational system, or its their politicians. These blame targets can also be in the personal realm. The problem is my religion, the problem is my lack of religion, my parents, my teachers, my caste, my income, my girlboyfriend, my wifehusband. If you want to do more than assign blame, and skate on, take a look at what some very caring, smart people have observed. You can help yourself in the process If the common elements of many of these problems are examined, a pattern emerges. People forget that we are each unique, or people forget that we are an aspect of everything. Forgetting the uniqueness aspect ignores reality. Forgetting the connectedness aspect also ignores reality. Both are true, simultaneously. People easily forget that causes produce effects, and try to get away with doing negative acts, without understanding that what goes around, comes around. Humans know that life is temporary. That one recognition creates a biting sadness that is covered over, and never goes completely away. It is the source of most music, art, and poetry. That realization is also the reason we have so many diversions to try to escape the sadness. These lapses in reality cause problems directly. They also hinder the search for solutions. There is a way to overcome these lapses. Use Commonsense. In order to optimize life, the basic relationships of life that apply to every particle, and every being, are kept in mind. Anyone can improve his/her life by making better decisions. We make better decisions when we focus more on the enhancements that make us human. We spend most of our lives doing what is necessary to maintain our lives. A large part of the remaining disposable time is spent in dressed up versions of instinct driven nest material acquisition, and reproductive-drive games. Some of the remainder of time-energy is actually spent exercising the enhanced abilities like communication, cooperation, cogitation, coaching, and compassion. They are what enabled us to get out of the caves, and into glory centers. Those times are better when pure humanism is strengthened by consistency with the following points. Nam- 1. Keep your brain in the game. Myoho 2. You are unique, and so is every other being. Being unique does not mean you can live well all by yourself. Renge 3. What goes around comes around. Kyo 4. Lives change, and Life goes on. The Nam Myoho Renge Kyo are the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese words that summarize points 1 through 5.  They are spoken repeatedly in order to create synaptic connections that keep the mind rational, and lead to frequent winning. If you forget any one of those, you will have collisions with reality. If you never forget any one of them, you will win more often. It helps to have a short, convenient form of these principles in order to infuse them deeply into your life.
