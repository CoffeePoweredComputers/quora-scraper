            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cHow does everything come from nothing, without there being anything to begin with?\u201d \u2026Short answer: \u201cIt can\u2019t!\u201d Science is the most reliable tool we have for discovering the truth about all that we see and experience from a human perspective. Unfortunately, sometimes even science is at a loss on explaining certain events, happenings and conditions that we know take place within our universe. Science cannot explain gravity, the existence of the human consciousness, what\u2019s happening inside black holes, self-awareness, the origins of life, love, perseverance or even where a single individual thought comes from. One of the greatest mysteries that has boggled history\u2019s most renowned intellectuals and scientists is offering a definitive answer as to how our universe came to be. The two most intellectually-supported quantum theories regarding the origin of our universe are the Big Bang theory and the New Model Quantum Equation. The Big Bang theory proposes that our universe began at a point of singularity. All matter was tightly compressed into a single state of \u201csomethingness\u201d to which a series of expanding and contracting pressures produced a cosmic explosion of universal proportions. What happened before this point of singularity is a complete mystery. The New Model Quantum Equation takes the Big Bang theory one step further and proposes that the universe remains in a constant state of flux with the potential of re-occurring Big Bangs happening throughout infinity. This newer, updated quantum theory attempts to compensate for the Big Bang\u2019s apparent breakdown of the laws of physics right at the point of singularity. Yes, you read that correctly. Science has two diametrically-opposed explanations for the origin of our universe.  Although both of these popular quantum theories offer explanations for how our universe came to be, neither offers an explanation as to where everything came from to start with in order for our universe to ultimately \u201cbe.\u201d So how does science explain something coming from nothing? \u2026You might be surprised at the answer: Science becomes a politician! Science likes to deal with logic and reason. Logic and reason are safe, reliable and repeatable methods for processing data. Anything that does not directly follow logic, the laws of physics and various other governing rules of the universe is considered \u201csupernatural.\u201d Science hates anything that appears to be supernatural and seeks to logically explain its true nature. However, since science cannot explain how one single photon, quark, particle or molecule exists in our universe, it resorts to what politicians do when they are faced with a question they cannot answer\u2026 They marginalize the question! Rather than accept the fact that science is totally baffled on how something can come from nothing, it attempts to re-define what \u201cnothingness\u201d actually is. What science has oddly chosen to do is to sacrifice its cornerstone of logic and reason in behalf of celestial conjecture and semantic sorcery. Science now attempts to convince us that \u201cnothing\u201d isn\u2019t really what we think it is.  \u201cEmpty space is a bubbling brew of virtual particles that are popping in and out of existence at a timescale so short you can\u2019t see them.\u201d - Lawrence Krauss So there you have it! Apparently, \u201cnothing\u201d can have a certain amount of weight, volume, exhibit fluctuations of energy and have exciting little things simultaneously happening within it. \u2026\u2026\u2026..Who knew? Whereas at one time, \u201cNothing\u201d was clearly, accurately and logically defined as, \u201ca condition or state which is void of all things\u201d has now been re-defined as an apparent \u201csomething\u201d that has a measurable weight, volume and a litany of \u201cvirtual somethings\u201d that spontaneously appear and disappear within it.  Since science cannot explain how something comes from nothing, it forwards a curious new definition of what certain \u201csomethings\u201d are and summarily declares them as being a byproduct of \u201cnothing.\u201d However, for the rest of us non-quantum-theory-savvy people, \u201cnothing\u201d is still defined as being empty, void of anything and everything that exists. Nothing cannot be something and something cannot be nothing. They are mutually-exclusive. Where one is found, the other cannot be! You cannot take \u201cnothingness\u201d and have something magically appear within it and then claim that it came form nothing because this \u201cnothingness\u201d was actually made up of these \u201csomething(s)\u201d all along. \u2026A Creationists might humorously regard this type of thinking as the, \u201cScience of the Gaps.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Two possible solutions at least exist, in my opinion. Again.. ;-) First, scientifically it's perfectly possible for absolutely nothing becoming something. One solution of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation says space, time, matter and energy (i.e. primordial quantum stuff) can come into existence from absolutely nothing, where nothing means totally, completely, ultimate nothing, without time, space, spacetime, matter, energy, etc. This form of absolutely nothing is unstable, hence unavoidably will decay into something.  (With energy below Planck scale:)  https://www.georgeshiber.com/spontaneous-quantum-to-classical-cosmological-collapse-dynamics/ A second possibility, though it could be very well combined with the above, I worked out myself almost 10 years ago (apparently not the only one ;-)), as a possible explanation for the missing anti-matter, saying the Big Bang went into opposite directions, creating a universe and an anti-universe simultaneously. A mirror universe where time is running backwards, filled with anti-matter. When seen as one universe, the total energy level will be zero, the same as before the Big Bang, so no energy law is violated, where the same counts for the second law of thermodynamics. The unstable nothing fel apart into two directions, with the same amount of matter and anti-matter, keeping everything perfectly balanced. Since the real endpoint of this mirror universe is our beginning (i.e. the Big Bang) and vice versa, which may sound like an oxymoron, technically both universes retroactively created each other, forming an infinite closed loop, also holding each others future, present and past, with a certain degree of uncertainty.  With the interaction between them (or seen as one universe pulsing in real and imaginary time) behaving like for example D-Branes, like in String Theory (or M-theory or K-theory), causing the weird quantum behavior, vacuum polarizations, etc., but possibly phenomena like dark matter and dark energy as well..

            "answer_text": "What exactly is \u201cexistence\u201d? What do you mean when you say something exists? Do you mean something exists because you are are able to touch and feel it? The only way you can feel something is if electrical signals are transmitted from that thing, via the neural network, into the brain, where it is translated so that you can understand what that thing is - what we call feelings. Apart from the fact that feelings are merely electrical signals translated by the brain, the thing you call \u201ctouch\u201d has multiple layers of illusions: First, you are not actually fully grasping or touching anything. For there exists between your hand and the object you are touching, a force field caused by the repulsive forces between electrons on both surfaces of the bodies involved in the \u201ctouching\u201d. There is tension acting in a scalar manner\u2026 Second, both your hand and the object you are supposedly touching, are illusions of a highly complex degree. For they only appear to be solid to the naked eye, while in reality, they are merely illusions of motion. Your hand, and so is the rest of your body, are made up of light particles under violent motion and in a state of high compression. Think of a bicycle wheel spinning with its metallic spokes when visualizing the illusions of your body\u2026. you will find that the bicycle wheel appears to form a solid circle from far and will in fact act like a solid object if you try to bounce a rock off of it\u2026but it is just motion!! So what then is existence? What is real? Is the motion of a thing the same as the thing? Is the motion of the bicycle wheel the same as the bicycle wheel? If our bodies and all of matter is made up of only motion, and motion is not real, then what is real? Who then are we? At the end of the day, it only makes sense if we think of ourselves as only idea, represented by form in a universe full of illusion. Idea is the only thing in the universe that does not end once created. It goes on forever morphing into many forms\u2026the idea of the car, the idea of the Apple, the idea of man are all forms of realities represented by form/matter/spinning particles. Form follows idea, and not the other way around. Even your brain knows this, for it will create an instant image of the the idea you think about. Think about a goat, and the form of the goat appears\u2026think of a cat, and it is there! Form follows idea. Mind is the idea. Energy is mind's tool, and form is the mind's canvas. Since energy can never be created, nor can it be destroyed, and we know that the Mind(idea) uses it as a tool, why then do we think the mind had a beginning? The Mind has no beginning, nor will it have an end. So to answer your question, I would say that there is no time, for ideas have never stopped and the mind has never been created. Everything exists in the NOW! TIME is an ILLUSION of MOTION! ",

            "answer_text": "Question: How does something come from nothing and create everything when there isn't anything to begin with?Answer: Thanks for the A2A.  I am not sure if this is an honest question or an attempt to say \"gotcha\", but I will answer as if the question is an honest one. There are \"thought errors\" in your question. 1) How does something come from nothing- we do not know that there was nothing.  We think that there was a singularity that was preceded by a  period of great density and high temperature.  What preceded this is unknown.  Is it possible that there was another Universe that had reached its death and that in its final expansion of heat and energy actually created the new universe?  Is it possible that this is actually how each universe gets created, by the death of the previous one?  Of course this is possible, we do not have the answer yet.  Is it possible that a god created our universe? Again yes this is possible.  Does it require a god?  Current evidence suggests that No god is required but again we have not reached a solid conclusion. The answer we have achieved in the last 50 years of our existence on this planet are themselves amazing.  The next 50 years will bring even more amazing answers, some of which may actual contradict the current answers.  That is what is great about science, it does not say \"this is the answer so stop looking\" it says \" this is what we think based on the current evidence but keep looking and you might find a better answer\". 2) Create everything: the term create carries an implied creator.  Evolution began immediately after the singularity, if the evidence is correct.  The Universe: Big Bang to Now in 10 Easy Steps 3) When there wasn't anything to begin with: assumption of the worse kind as we do not know that there was \"nothing to begin with\".  We do not currently have the technology to answer all these questions but that is okay.  I DON'T KNOW is a valid answer and much better then \"GOD DID IT\". The difference between the Theists stance and the Atheist stance is the Theists allow their Truth to become their Perception.  They operate by Faith not by Evidence so their Truth is inflexible.  Atheists allow their Perception to become their Truth and we not only allow our Perceptions to be altered by evidence but we expect it to be.  Our Truths therefore are flexible.  We could accept the evidence that a GOD or GODS exists if the evidence was credible, verifiable, independently obtainable or observable and repeatable.  Theist cannot accept the evidence, no matter how credible, to refute their Faith. Again, thanks for the A2A. I assume that you knew I was an Atheist when you asked this me to answer so you already had some clue as to how I would answer this question. ",

            "answer_text": "This morning an ant was born and looked out of its window and could see this giant standing there looking down at the ant hill. Mum said the ant, what is that. The ant mother said, we think it is God. It comes and goes, but we can feel its steps rumble the ground, and it leaves food near us. I think it is a provider. Sometimes there are several of these giant beings, and some kick our ant mound, and we think it must be the devil and the bringer of death. How long have they been there mum said the ant. The ant said they were there long before I was born my little one, and they will be their long after we are gone. They must live forever. This is a story of an ant looking at humans. To an ant we out live them and are there before and after them. To them we might as well live forever. So we look at our universe and we are so developed in our thinking that everything must have a beginning and an end. After all we are born, live for say 70 years and then die. We have a start and a finish. We see animals born and die in our lifetime. So therefore the universe must have had a start, and one day an end. But the length of this term is so much bigger or longer than our lifetime. That we just cannot fathom what is forever, is forever forever. how can this be. We think the universe is expanding. So if it is expanding then it must have started smaller. And thus the idea of a big bang is the idea of how it started. a point of origin. But then we ask what was before that. If the universe ends, whats after that. If space is expanding what is beyond space. Our brains are so small in our thinking that we cannot fathom outside of these questions. The bible says God created it all. Science says a big bang think about this, how do scientist know how old a star is, and how long before it dies . Stars are so massive and we live 100 years, and even if the last 2000 years we gained notes, stars live potentially for billions of years. How do we know. We only know by maths and assumptions. A pure guess that things start and finish. Even the science of black holes was being derived 300 years before a black hole was potentially seen. And could be just all so wrong. time will tell. So what was before time, has it just always been. How can it have no start, everything must have a start. ",

            "answer_text": "Presently I\u2019m working on a revision of what I call my \u201cCausal Argument in Abbreviated Form\u201d; that addresses the question. But more than that, it actually tosses out a rationally grounded solution to Kant\u2019s critical challenge, which addresses your question. The question belongs to the branch of philosophy called metaphysics. For myself I limit metaphysics to the Kantian definition \u2026 this means, as a science. What\u2019s a science of metaphysics for Kant? A science for Kant would consist of a priori judgments or principles. But the caveat is that these principles would have to help us make sense of the world of our practical experience. How can metaphysics do that? It\u2019s not all that easy to answer this question but then again, neither is it impossible. The first thing we have to do is shed ourselves of our practical common-sensed notions about reality. When dealing with cosmological questions such as yours common sense can only take us so far, that\u2019s why Immanuel Kant (in his \u201cCritique of Pure Reason\u201d and follow up work \u201cProlegomena to Any Future Metaphysic That Might be Brought Forth as a Science\u201d, states there can be no appeal to what he calls \u201cthe magic wand of so-called common sense.\u201d I don\u2019t dispense with this magic wand altogether however. There\u2019s a proper balance that can be achieved between our common sense and our critical reasoning. For starters, think about the concept of nothing, as a state wherein all complexity has been washed away. What do we have? We have not just our common sensed practical dictionary definition of nothing, for there\u2019s nothing in existence to frame our use of this practical definition. If all complexity is washed away then there is simply a Void. So again, what do we have? We have not nothing, but we have an Absolute state. What\u2019s the grounds for postulating this when all we have is a Void? It\u2019s absolute for such an empty concept, emptied of all complexity, resists our imposing on it any arbitrary limitation, and it\u2019s as simple as that. We are finite beings and as such we are not capable of grasping by our mere thinking alone, the totality of that which reaches out to infinity. We can only possess an abstract concept of such a state, and so the concept of this Void presents to us an absolute concept. This is a critical insight that Kant failed to notice, but I have to be careful here for Kant also gave out a clue that maybe he did notice this, only he didn\u2019t come right out and say it clearly. And for an answer to the apparent dilemma of how something followed from this state, the only instrument that we have to guide us on our path toward answers is pure speculative reason. It\u2019s a question that lies outside the scope of our sciences, even though science may point in the right direction for our reason to follow in its quest for a solution. My response to Kant is at causalargument.com, if you care to peruse it, or just glimpse at it \u2026 and if you do, you\u2019ll find I\u2019ve given the subject some serious thought. The revised Abbreviated Version should be uploaded within a week or so, baring any unforeseen delays. ",

I wanted to write after retirement, but ended up becoming a guided writer (I resisted for a while, but gave in towards the end of the last century). I now write as Jesuis Laplume, which is French for \u2018I am The pen\u2019 and am usually just a scribe in a portion of each book I write (even this article). One of the things that I addressed, was a question (which branched outward and inward) along the line of: \u201cWhat could there have been before the \u2018Big Bang\u2019 process started?\u201d I keep rewriting, as well as studying what others are doing in Science and Philosophy, including such fields as quantum gravity and what Philosophy historically said about the totality of this universe and creation. I also cover what is going on within studies of consciousness (now often both human consciousness and Cosmic Consciousness). Most of this points out a major fallacy of Traditional Science in that it ignores what the Ancient Greeks told us about knowledge, namely: There are two, necessary sides to the one coin of all knowledge, Science and Philosophy; and,The tools on one side will not likely work well on the other side.Traditional Science does not accept that Philosophy has anything to offer (a form of deliberate ignorance fostered by Fear of things not known and called Culpable Ignorance) and is also partly influenced by a Dogma that there can be no top-down fields in the universe that could guide the development of the processes within the universe. There should never be Dogma in good Science!! So, my story is that, before there was even a \u2018spacetime\u2019 grid, there was a field of Pure Information in place that helped select, from a myriad of possibilities in the growth of the universe, only those that could and would result in life and then such as humans. Any decent analysis of the probability of life forming in this universe, in the time available so far, indicates that the universe is trillions of trillions of trillions of times too young for that to happen; if only by random selection. Ergo, it is almost certain that there is a selection process in place (there are no certainties in this universe since quanta and probability are the two founding realities!). First there was a field of Pure Information;Then came a multi-stage, expanding \u2018spacetime\u2019 grid;Then came Energy;Then came the micro-components of matter; andThen came matter.One concept that could explain the above is still the (oft-rejected by Science but not always by Philosophy) concept of an uncaused-cause that was in existence even before the field of Pure Information. Or, that field is a component of that uncaused-cause, or? Questions are still leading to more questions and not working answers! It is not only possible, but likely, that we are going to add to our knowledge about some of the above; but you might have to accept that you and I are not quite up to understanding it all (and that maybe humans never will). LoL \u201cIf you aren\u2019t laughing at life, you don\u2019t understand it well enough - Yet!\u201d Love and Above to those who seek The Truth! Some of what others have written is well worth reading! ",

I am not that smart or imaginative either But if I were to make a wild guess based on what is in my heart, I can tell you that although I am a unique individual just like you are, the essence of my heart is the same as yours. The trials and tribulations I face though unique in my personal life just as they are as unique to your personal life, our yearnings to be happy and whole are very similar if not the same. Why are they all essentially the same if we are unique individuals with unique circumstances and life experiences? I believe there is something that bind us all. Something more than a simple byproduct of biochemistry. Something more than a simple carbon base existence. I don't know what it is, but it is something that comes from nothing since time immemorial. And to me, that is how I know that something could come from nothing that even if there is the absolute proof that there is no God, even \"something\" somehow came from nothing. Something that is even more external than the matter that exploded in the initial big bang. Something outside of that matter. Something that could exist outside of the universe's string-like expansion and contraction. Honestly, I don't know what that something is. I'm also just a human being with limited lifetime; so for the sake of practicality I call that unknown something God, which could exist outside what we can know and observe. By then it's just a matter of choosing which set of ethics I would live by, and for all belief systems that exist, I choose one that emphasizes compassion for others though they are imperfect hoping that others would be compassionate toward me in my imperfections and mistakes. Long story short, that's why I believe there is something outside of something that can create something out pf nothing. Can I prove it? Probably never. But again ask yourself this: is our essence the same? I believe that essence is something out of nothing. Thanks for A2A; and I hope you find your something, yet even from nothing even with no satisfactory answer from me or anyone else. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing, in the philosophical sense of absolute nothingness, is not a valid physical concept. Absolute nothingness is what is not possible. It could never have been. It is however quite plausible that time, space, and the quantum fields have never not existed (the double negative makes sense here), which doesn\u2019t mean that time has an infinite past, only that without time existence has no meaning. The quantum fields fluctuate continuously and a large enough fluctuation would be enough to produce our universe. It didn\u2019t take as much as you might think. Alan Guth has recently said that inflation could have been triggered by as little as one gram of matter in a space one billionth the size of a proton. This is within the realm of possible, albeit rare, quantum fluctuations. It was inflation that stabilized matter, while amplifying that gram into all of the matter/energy into our entire universe (about 1000 times the size of the currently observable universe), set entropy on its way toward infinity, gave time its arrow and space its dimensions, and linked them all together. Our universe was not impossible, it was inevitable, and so would be universes before and after ours. ",

            "answer_text": "In short, it is clear that science and knowledge are nothing other than the search for causes; all progress and advancement in human affairs result from the investigations carried out by scholars into the causes of phenomena. Were it to be possible for us to find in a single being or corner of the universe a sign of absolute self-origination or creativity, we would be justified in extending that one instance to the whole scheme of being. Of course, it is not necessary that the law of causality should always manifest itself to us in familiar forms. The variety and multiplicity of causes is such that an investigator concerned with only one phenomenon might not be able to specify all the causes. However, in all the affairs of mankind, particular and general, past and future, in the circumstances of the individual or of society, not a single point can be found that is accidental. Not only is there a particular order inherent in the creation of each separate phenomenon; there is also observable in the relationship of every phenomenon with other phenomena, as well as the relationship of each phenomenon with the environment within which it exists, a subtle and finely calculated order. For example, in the cultivation of a tree, the laws of the heavens and the earth operate in perfect harmony with the structure of its roots and branches. There is also a relationship of animals with that tree insofar as they draw nourishment from it. How is it possible that accident should lie at the origin of such orderly relationships? If a phenomenon were to take shape at a certain level in the structure of being, unconsciously and on the basis of chance, this would furnish an excellent groundwork for the disappearance and destruction of the world. For the slightest disruption in the balance of elements and the smallest disharmony in the radiant laws of the universe would be enough to make things lose their moorings and the heavenly bodies collide, resulting in a massive explosion and the destruction of the world. If the origin of the world were based on accident, why are the theories even of the materialists based on the supposition of a plan, an ordering, an absence of chance? If the whole world is the result of chance and accident, what is it that did not emerge on the basis of chance? If an existent thing came into being not by virtue of chance, what are its distinguishing features and characteristics and can they be applied to the numerous and variegated phenomena of the universe? Now since accident is opposed to order and harmony, it follows that whatever bears traces of planning, design and calculation should be disharmonious and discontinuous, because the concepts of planning, design and calculation are opposed to accident and chance. To suppose that accident is the infrastructure of the universe and its governing principle does not rest on any logical proof or scientific evidence cannot be accepted as a definitive solution to the geometry of the structure of being. When the experimental sciences demonstrate that the elements and natural factors cannot exert any independent influence and do not possess any creativity; when all of our experiences, our sensory feelings, and our rational deductions point to the conclusion that nothing occurs in nature without a reason and cause and that all phenomena are based on an established system and specific laws, when all of this is the case, it is surprising that some people turn their backs on scientific principles, primary deductions and propositions based on reflection, and deny the existence of the Creator.

            "answer_text": " Consider the revelations of The Urantia Book, one of which is that GOD is the only uncaused CAUSE, creating everything out of \u2018the Paradise patterns\u2019, etc. (see Urantia for it). [The Urantia Papers, or The Urantia Book is the 5th epochal divine/spiritual revelation of truth for us humanity of this our world, being published 1955 in Chicago, U.S. It\u2019s NOT a spiritual channeling, therefore not coming at all whatsoever from the Devil. (Urantia is the name of our world according to the celestial authors/revelators of it.) It\u2019s in the public domain & free to read/download entirely on the Internet; having near 2,100 pages, 197 Papers or chapters.] URANTIA example: 0:3.20 (5.19) REALITY, as comprehended by finite beings, is partial, relative, and shadowy. The maximum Deity reality fully comprehensible by evolutionary finite creatures is embraced within the Supreme Being. Nevertheless there are antecedent and eternal realities, superfinite realities, which are ancestral to this Supreme Deity of evolutionary time-space creatures. In attempting to portray the origin and nature of universal reality, we are forced to employ the technique of time-space reasoning in order to reach the level of the finite mind. Therefore must many of the simultaneous events of eternity be presented as sequential transactions. 0:3.21 (6.1) As a time-space creature would view the origin and differentiation of Reality, the eternal and infinite I AM achieved Deity liberation from the fetters of unqualified infinity through the exercise of inherent and eternal free will, and this divorcement from unqualified infinity produced the firstabsolute divinity-tension. This tension of infinity differential is resolved by the Universal Absolute, which functions to unify and co-ordinate the dynamic infinity of Total Deity and the static infinity of the Unqualified Absolute. 0:3.22 (6.2) In this original transaction the theoretical I AM achieved the realization of personality by becoming the Eternal Father of the Original Son simultaneously with becoming the Eternal Source of the Isle of Paradise. Coexistent with the differentiation of the Son from the Father, and in the presence of Paradise, there appeared the person of the Infinite Spirit and the central universe of Havona. With the appearance of coexistent personal Deity, the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit, the Father escaped, as a personality, from otherwise inevitable diffusion throughout the potential of Total Deity. Thenceforth it is only in Trinity association with his two Deity equals that the Father fills all Deity potential, while increasingly experiential Deity is being actualized on the divinity levels of Supremacy, Ultimacy, and Absoluteness. 0:3.23 (6.3) The concept of the I AM is a philosophic concession which we make to the time-bound, space-fettered, finite mind of man, to the impossibility of creature comprehension of eternity existences \u2014 nonbeginning, nonending realities and relationships. To the time-space creature, all things must have a beginning save only the ONE UNCAUSED \u2014 the primeval cause of causes. Therefore do we conceptualize this philosophic value-level as the I AM, at the same time instructing all creatures that the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit are coeternal with the I AM; in other words, that there never was a time when the I AM was not the Father of the Son and, with him, of the Spirit.

The theory of multiverse thus becomes true. Creation is an endless pursuit and everything in it is bound to change. Time is the reminder of that change. Now I know this is very difficult to accept because this logic has been fixed into us that a thing has it\u2019s own origin. And so we start tracing back things in search of the very source. And how far back have we reached !? This search for the source seems endless and too ambitious for extremely small creatures like us. We might never even get to another galaxy. But we know for sure that Nothing leaves the existence. It\u2019s just that things won\u2019t appear the way it used to be at one time. Because all that is happening is state change. Things forge for sometime and then break. Energy enters a system and growth or combination happens. Energy dissipates and it starts dissolving\u2026 loosing it\u2019s last known state to become something else. If you can accept that then there is no such thing as \u2018nothing\u2019. Nothing is just no - thing. We are only familiar with things(matter) and not with those that are not things(anti-matter). So things and no things have always been part of the existence. But if we believe there is something beyond everything then please understand that we still haven\u2019t seen the everything because we just can\u2019t ! We cannot scale up or scale down. There is no vantage point. When that\u2019s the case then how can we even imagine whats outside this everything! ",

The one stable condition would seem to be: changeOr as it is said so well in French: Plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose. Etymology An epigram by Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr in the January 1849 issue of his journal Les Gu\u00eapes (\u201cThe Wasps\u201d). Literally \u201cThe more it changes, the more it\u2019s the same thing.\u201d . . . Proverb plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose the more things change, the more they stay the same The underlying logic Seriously, conceptually or logically it seems change being more basic than both everything and nothing would seem to be enough. That would imply that verbs are more interesting to us than nouns, which is to say that perhaps we should view particles and waves and all that more as events than \u201cstuff\u201d. [1] When we are speaking of processes, we are not surprised when we notice that Event B follows from Event A, and that Event C follows after Event B. Process implies change. So perhaps we should speak not of no thing and some thing or every thing but rather something like this: Formula: no event \u2192 some event or every event Yet that violates a basic rule, the one which says that nothing comes from nothing (ex nihilo).  Ex nihilo But perhaps nothing is not the nothing we thought we knew. Perhaps nothing isn\u2019t empty (or how to put it). Perhaps empty is more like open than void. If so, the everything once upon a time seeming to come into existence ex nihilo could be about something coming from \u201cthe openness\u201d rather than \u201cthe emptiness\u201d. If nothing can be something while being nothing, for being open is being something, even if empty, then nature may be obeying also another old rule, practically the same one in different clothing, which says that nature does not make jumps (natura non facit saltus).  A pause And, here\u2019s the catch (or one possible catch), \u201cNo event\u201d is what you have in a pause. When you have something building up to critical mass, you have \u201cno\u201d event, here meaning no discernible event. Yet, when critical mass is reached, suddenly something happens. Why should we not be able to have that pause first? That is, nature doesn\u2019t necessarily make jumps big enough for us to notice. Formula: no event \u2192 some invisibly small event \u2192 some other invisibly small event \u2192 another other invisibly small event \u2192 yet another invisibly small event \u2192 some indiscernible event \u2192 one more \u2192 some event no one notices yet again \u2192 some such event one more time \u2192 third\u2019s a charm but no one there to see the tree falling-event \u2192 some other completely unknown event \u2192 infinitely many more of these \u2192 oops critical mass!!!! \u2192 all events start happening (Big Bang) The Big Bang as the limit after an infinitely long no-time of openness. Waves/potentialities coalescing into actuality, into point particles, time and space. Critical mass is practically the same term as quantum. Things may have been going on for ages and ages (timelessly, somehow) before the Big Bang, just not discernible, just not enough to reach critical mass and set the whole process off. So, that\u2019s my suggestion: everything and nothing are better rephrased into categories that are process-based rather than \u201cstuff\u201d-based, in which case the question doesn\u2019t seem that puzzling anymore. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..

That is the big bang theory.  Now where this hot dense state came from is a different question.  Much like evolution deals with the evolution of life here on Earth from an existing form(s) of life.  Where that first life came from isn't part of evolution it is part of abiogenesis.  All scientific theories start with some initial conditions.  The theories don't account for those initial conditions they just proceed on from that point. This doesn't mean there isn't any hypotheses about where the initial condition came from.  There are.  There are a few of them.  Some of them make predictions.  Many of these predictions are not currently testable.  Some of them explain aspects about our universe better than others or explain things that other hypotheses don't. That said we know that in our universe there really isn't any such thing as \"nothing\".  Even empty space still has stuff going on in it.  Particle pop into existence, stick around for a little bit then disappear again.  I can suggest reading  A Universe from Nothing  as it explains it in fairly layman's terms. It isn't saying this is the answer.  It is just saying that it is consistent with what we observe.  That is what science is about. ",

Before the \"big bang\" (whatever that was) there was something that gave rise to the \"big bang\" and we are ignorant of what that was. We need a theory of what gave rise to what we call \u201cthe Big Bang\u201d, one that doesn\u2019t assume nothing produced something.

No one posits that the universe came from \u201cnothing\u201d. That is not what the Standard Model Of Physics says. Rather, the Standard Model maintains that at the beginning of the universe, the \u201csingularity\u201d was a point of almost-infinitely-hot and almost-infinitely-compressed energy. There is no limit to temperature or density for energy. The energy represented by the singularity became the observable universe. What we do NOT know is why this situation obtained in the first place, or why the singularity expanded (\u201cinflated\u201d) and began to cool, causing the precipitation of the basic building blocks of matter\u2026 the subatomic particles. There are a number of hypotheses, but they are pretty \u201cheady\u201d stuff. Any good contemporary book on cosmology or astrophysics should provide some insight. ",

But first I will say, in regard to your question, that just because \"something comes from nothing\" doesn't mean that it creates everything. It obviously can't create because it is nothing, however I will concede that everything does indeed come from nothing. All you need to do is take away everything - what have you left? Nothing! So where did it all come from - nothing! Now here's the mathematical proof: 0 = +1 -1 Thanks for asking. I love talking about nothing (maybe I should go into politics lol) ",
