            "answer_text": "Deontology is a branch of normative ethics that is based on the concept of duty, as opposed to virtue (virtue ethics), or consequences (i.e. utilitarianism). In deontology the act itself is considered right or wrong, not the consequences, therefore, the agent\u2019s obligations are stressed rather than the outcomes, or the virtuous character of the agent. In deontology, the duty might arise from three sources: Nature (Natural law and natural rights)God (Divine command)Agent himself (Constructivism / Kantianism)Deontology for me, in its most appealing form, is described by the constitutive approach of Christine Korsgaard. I think it is the fullest and most complete account of deontology. It avoids both moral realism and moral antirealism and is highly plausible. I recommend Korsgaard\u2019s Self-Constitution: Agency, Identity, and Integrity, it is a great book that presents a mature and modern deontological theory based on Kant, Aristotle and Plato. ",

            "answer_text": "Crowly Mathew Arackal has given a good definition. I would like to elaborate on it. In deontology, an act is judged on its intrinsic worth rather than on its consequences. To give you an example, honesty is the best policy. The deontological justification of this is that you must not cheat people as they cannot be used as means to achieve profit by lying. A deontologist is not following the policy on basis of the consequences that will ensue on following the policy. While a consequentialist may say that follow the policy because it is good for business.  Another beautiful example of the two school of thoughts appears in Mahabharat in dialogue between Arjun and Krishna. In the middle of the war, Arjun loses his nerve and refuses to fight saying that it will bring more bloodshed and he will be a murderer of his kith and kin. To this Krishna replies \"karm kiye ja fal ki chinta mat jar\" which roughly translates into do your duty and so not worry about consequences. Krishna point Arjuna that this war is between good and evil, between dharma and adharma and it is your duty to stop evil from taking over even if its consequences are violence and more bloodshed One of the foremost deontologists in modern    times was Immanuel Kant.

            "answer_text": "Dear Friend,                 basically the word DEON...means DUTY... the present world we see that deontology is that part of science in which they define which decisons of our are moral ethical and those from whcih we are forbidden. Now these define duty, which are a complete extremity to the aretaic (virtue] theories)  which are more on assesing the individuals and there by providing a kind of path way for people to thread on...these deontologist...are against the one called consequentialists, who focus and work more with the consequences than just blindly following the customs traditions, rules and regulation. Thus as we see, deontology is more with laying dpwn rules, and ethically determining whats right and wrong.. Maya... ",
