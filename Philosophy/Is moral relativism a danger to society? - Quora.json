            "answer_text": "Relativism is a very popular theory but also deeply flawed as well and it is because of these flaws that we'll have to move beyond relativism in order to find an adequate ethical theory to base our moral judgments upon. Relativism is an ancient ethical theory and has its roots in the Greek philosopher Protagoras who once said \"man is the measure of all things.\" What he meant by this was that each individual is their own arbiter for right and wrong. Relativism can be seen at this individual level and still has adherents. In his 1987 book The Closing of the American Mind Allan Bloom wrote \"there is one thing a professor can be absolutely certain of: almost every student entering the university believes, or says he believes, truth is relative.\" So, this view is pervasive still. But, being widely accepted does not make a view correct. Let's examine relativism and some of the problems with it. Relativism has several formulations: Different societies have different moral codes. There is no objective standard that can be used to judge one society's code better than another's. There is no \"universal truth\" in ethics; that is, there are no moral truths that hold for all peoples at all times. Are these claims correct? The first seems to be a mere observation and a correct one at that. The others seem to follow naturally and when we think about it seem equally true. The main argument for the truth of relativism is based on the seemingly obvious claim that different societies have different practices and codes of morality. Just consider the examples James Rachels gives in his book The Elements of Moral Philosophy such as the difference between the Greeks and the Callatians in how they deal with death. Or the differences between us and the Eskimos when it comes to infanticide. So, from these differences it follows that there are no objective moral standards. There are several problems with this line of reasoning. 1. The premises do not support the conclusion.2. Relativism implies that we cannot make moral judgments about our own culture or others.3. Relativism implies that there cannot be moral progress.4. There really is no fundamental disagreement on moral values.5. All cultures have some values in common.6. Relativism is self refuting. Let's look at each of these in turn. First, the argument for relativism is not based on sound logic. From the premise that different cultures have different moral practices it does not follow that there are no objective moral principles. The flaw in this argument can be seen with the following example. There are still some cultures that believe the earth is flat. So, different cultures (and even individuals within a culture) disagree about the shape of the earth. But from this it doesn't follow that there is no objective shape of the Earth. This is nonsense. From the mere fact of disagreement it does not follow that there is no objective answer. This is not only true for empirical questions like the shape of the Earth but also true for ethical questions as well. In fact, the very disagreement we witness implies that there are objective standards. The question is simply what these are and how they can be justified. If ethics were only a matter of opinion and cultural belief what would be the point of disagreement? Disagreement only makes sense if there's something objective to disagree about. But, relativism denies this. From the perspective of relativism the mere fact that a culture believes something makes it so. But, does believing something make it so? No. If it did I could believe I'm on the beach in Hawaii and it would be true. Unfortunately, life doesn't work like this! You might respond to this by saying \"well perhaps it's true for you.\" But what does this mean? What could it mean to say that something like this was true for me alone? A second problem with relativism is that it implies that we cannot make judgments about our own culture or other cultures as well. You might think this is a good thing. After all, who are we to judge that another culture is doing something immoral? But if we cannot judge other cultures then we must condone things like enslaving people, genocide, gross violations of human rights, etc. Are we really prepared to say that the mere fact that a culture believes these are right means that they are right and morally justifiable? To see the problem let's consider the fact that relativism implies that we cannot even judge our own cultural practices. Around 1820 in this country slavery was practiced and even thought to be morally permissible by some. So, the culture said this practice was fine. Was it? Weren't there people making well reasoned arguments for abolition? If relativism is true then their arguments would have been for naught. They would've had no basis for the claim that slavery was (and is) immoral. This leads to the third problem with relativism, the denial of moral progress. Take the slavery example again. I'll also mention another example as well to help. In 1820 slavery existed in this country, now it doesn't. Are we better off without slavery? Also, in 1820 women did not have the right to vote, now they do. Are we better off because of this? I hope you answered yes to both questions! But, consider these answers from the point of view of relativism. How can you say one situation is better? You can't because this implies an objective standard by which to measure better or worse. But this is precisely what relativism denies. So, there can be no such thing as progress in the realm of morality because progress implies the possibility of things getting better (or worse) which implies an objective standard. Interestingly enough, the foundation for relativism that cultures have fundamentally different moral practices may be false. This may sound strange to say since all we have to do is look at a culture's practices and we can see they are fundamentally different. Look at some Hindu countries where the people don't eat cows even if they're starving. Look at the Eskimos who practice infanticide. But, as Rachels points out there may be more to the story than these surface observations. Consider the Eskimos. Shouldn't we ask why they do what they do? Shouldn't we examine the entire context of their practice before we judge it? If we do this, and consider for example the harsh environment and the fact that they do not indiscriminately kill babies we can see that their moral beliefs are not radically different from ours, only how they practice them. The example of a culture who doesn't eat cows provides another useful insight. As Rachels points out the difference here may not be their values but their beliefs. They share the same values as we do but because they have different beliefs, their practices are different. So we do have some moral principles in common after all. And in fact, in order for a complex society to exist there must be some objective moral principles in spite of relativism's denial of these. Examples include: 1. truth telling2. caring for the young3. no indiscriminate killing Every culture must have these values in common otherwise they couldn't even exist. Sure, some people lie sometimes, some people do not adequately care for their young, some people kill others. But, the general principles hold for the majority of cases. If they didn't we would likely not even be here! What many philosophers like James Rachels argue for is a culturally neutral standard for judging right and wrong. In fact, this is the whole point of ethical theory to adequately formulate just such a principle. We should ask whether the practice promotes or hinders the welfare of the people who are affected by it. Still some people are reluctant to abandon relativism. One argument is that relativism encourages tolerance. We should be tolerant of other individuals and cultures. But, look closely at this argument and you'll see a problem. Tolerance is a moral value. By saying we should practice this we seem to be implying that it's a universal principle. But remember, relativism denies these! So, the relativist is contradicting themselves. Another way of saying this is to say that relativism is self-refuting. The basic idea of relativism is that there are no objective moral principles. But this claim itself is an objective moral principle. So, if relativism is true, it must be false! ",

            "answer_text": "Moral Relativism is defined in: from Modern Catholic Dictionary by John A. Hardon, S.J. Doubleday & Co., Inc. Garden City, NY 1980 Moral Relativism. The theory that moral standards vary from one society to another, and from one period of history to another. Ethical principles are said to be social products and not universally binding or based on the objective moral order founded in human nature. As Catholics we believe that God created each and every one of us, and that He instilled in us what Catholics refer to as the \u201cnatural law\u201d: The Natural Law is covered in paragraphs # 1954 through 1960 in the Catechism. Natural law is something that is present in the heart of each man and established by reason, it is universal, immutable and permanent throughout history. Nevertheless, it is not perceived by everyone clearly and immediately, man needs grace and revelation so moral and religious truths may be know \u201cby everyone with facility, with firm certainty, and with no admixture of error.\u201d (Pius XII, Humani generis: Denzinger-Sch\u00f6nmetzer, Enchiridion Symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum {1965} 3876; cf. Dei Filius 2: Denzinger-Sch\u00f6nmetzer, Enchiridion Symbolorum, definitionum et declarationum de rebus fidei et morum {1965} 3005) from The Catechism of the Catholic Church, second edition, English translation 1994 1954 Man participates in the wisdom and goodness of the Creator who gives him mastery over his acts and the ability to govern himself with a view to the true and the good. The natural law expresses the original moral sense which enables man to discern by reason the good and the evil, the truth and the lie: The natural law is written and engraved in the soul of each and every man, because it is human reason ordaining him to do good and forbidding him to sin . . . But this command of human reason would not have the force of law if it were not the voice and interpreter of a higher reason to which our spirit and our freedom must be submitted. (Leo XIII, Libertas praestantissimum, 597) Thus we can see that there is a natural law which is binding on all may and can be perceived by the unaided light of reason by an honest man not swayed by outside forces. Moral relativism, on the other hand, tries to claim that what is right for me may not be right for you as far as a moral code is concerned, and you have no right to judge me. All of which would completely be the beginning of the end of any society of men living together in any kind of freedom from complete anarchy. We have all kinds of people locked up in asylums and prisons because we as sane citizens do not put up with people running around stealing and killing because they think they are entitled to. But it is even worse than that, because things that will eventually spell the downfall of western civilization, and have ended civilization in the past, we have put into law because some people feel that is okay. That is moral relativism, it is losing the ability to judge according to a correct conscience and to make moral decisions about what is right and wrong. It will be the end of civilization. ",
