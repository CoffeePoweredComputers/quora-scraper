            "answer_text": "It is pretentious as all get out for anyone to try to interpret  Socrates, and all the attempts to do so are a bit feeble, like this one:   Consider the amount of knowledge in the world, from the size of a lemur's toenail to the names of the moons of Jupiter.  We cannot possibly know even 0.000000001 of all things there are yo know.  Probably a great deal less.  Any reputable statistician (and I am one) will tell you that that number is not significantly different than zero. Now...I don't think that Socrates was dealing in t-tests and analyses of variance and the like, but I hope you carch the meaning of  my words.   We know, for all intents and purposes, nothing.  Especially amusing are people who believe they can 'synthesize' pieces of knowledge from many different disciplines.  They know so little.  It makes for interesting reading, and after many milennia we may begin to know a very little, but tihere is just too  much to know.  We should consider ourselves very lucky that, in no matter which direction we look, there are worlds to discover. ",

            "answer_text": "I believe one should take his statement with some irony (but not sarcasm). For someone who says that he knows nothing he: 1) died decisively  for his beliefs [when the Powers That Were did not really want to kill him, just to send him into exile in disgrace] and 2) he typically asked a chain of connected questions [with intermediate answers] which were magnificently helpful.  For example, assuming the \"Theaetetus\" was at least in outline faithful to Socrates' thinking, he decisively disproves empiricism and sophistry. He certainly was NOT a skeptic. And in \"Theaetetus\" he says he is a midwife who helps others to give birth and judges whether that which is born into the world is a real offspring or a flatulance. ",
