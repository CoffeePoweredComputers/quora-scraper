            "answer_text": "No. Truth is not relative. Only in relativism is truth moldable, hence relative. When you surround yourself with \"yes'' people (people who always openly agree with you, even if deep inside they disagree wholeheartedly), you'll feel good, but their presence will stunt your personal growth. Have you ever read the story of ''The Emperor's New Suit'' by Hans Christian Andersen? Let me tell you a cliff's note summary: There was this King whose servants always told him superlatives, even if they had to lie. One day the King hired a tailor who apparently had magic fabric, and only the smartest people were able to see that fabric. It was invisible to the stupid people. The tailor was paid a large sum of money, and he worked day and night sewing the suit for the king. When it was ready, the king organized a parade, so people could admire him in his new suit. The tailor gave him the suit, but the king couldn't see it, however not wanting to be deemed ''stupid'', he didn't say anything. He walked in the parade proud and mighty, many people couldn't see his suit, but they didn't say anything, because they didn't want to appear ''stupid''. So all applauded him, and told him how great his new suit looked. Then suddenly, a small child's voice could be heard from the crowd saying: ''The king is naked!'' By that time the trickster tailor was long gone! The End. 3 years ago i had a medical misfortune that only by the grace of God didn't wipe me out. While spending 3 weeks in the ICU, many friends came to see me, almost all told me ''You look great!'' (actually I looked terrible!), then my best friend came, and she said:''You look dry, don't you have some lotion to put on your face?\" They all were right in their comments, only their comparison point varied. The first set compared their observation to the fact that the outcome of the ordeal could have been worse, and my best friend compared my then appearance to my normal, healthy appearance, and those two comparisons had some difference to say the least. People who are for you will not only make you feel worthy, but they will tell you the truth too.  ",

Reading books and getting a university degree are pointless. There would be no difference between having a university degree and not having one. There would be no difference between reading 10,000 books and reading none. Without absolute truth, the common ground we discover and forge in conversation would be totally meaningless. Society wouldn\u2019t survive 30 days if truth wasn\u2019t absolute. This is why the famous and influential political philosopher Thomas Hobbes said the state of nature was \u201c\u2026nasty, brutish, and short\u201d one of an anarchical \u201cwar of all against all.\u201d Conflict resolution would be totally impossible and cycles of revenge and violence would run rampant. A powder-keg of human power, emotion, and biases run wild across the land. It would be Mad Max meets the Lord of the Flies in short order, with incredibly self-destructive results.
