            "answer_text": "The shift in consciousness that is taking place is about Gaia and each human being\u2019s own unique consciousness. In March 2019, the timelines of probabilities aligned, and it is now a mathematical inevitability that humanity will shift into fourth density consciousness. Planet Earth and humanity have been developing in third density consciousness for the last 75,000 years. There has been stuff going on for the last 1,000,000 years with relationship to human beings and higher consciousness entities seeding earth, but I have no information about it. The last 75,000 years has been 3 consciousness cycles where planet earth had the possibility of shifting into fourth density consciousness if humanity was also ready to shift. The only reason that we made it. was that Gaia and the small collective consciousness of authentic people, manifested enough unconditional love that could resonate with the new cosmic energy that began pervading us from 1986.This enhanced energy is now of a divine feminine nature as it is based on love. The last 6000 years of human history has been male dominated and negative based, which is why we are currently having such difficulties with what should be, a very joyous occasion. There are three different ways of consciousness development. The positive path of service to others for the good of the whole. The negative path of greed and selfishness that uses others for the needs of the self. And those people who have not awoken and will go where their natural natures take them on either the positive or negative path. These are the people that organizations, companies, and institutions try to own. Like minded people attract like minds as individuals with their own unique consciousness. Together they become a positive collective consciousness of humanity. There are also negative consciousness organizations, but because of the separating ways of negative consciousness, tricks are needed to entice people to \u201csell their souls\u201d and basically form a collective negative consciousness. Positive fourth density consciousness is the beginning of becoming mature, as Gaia human beings. We are the beginning of a new era of humanity that will align with Gaia and each other. Positive fourth density consciousness is based on the positive powers within love and the intelligent energy of light, so we will eventually become one collective consciousness of individual personalities. Based on the massive struggle that Gaia and humanity have been through, we will also maintain a little bit of bad as an offset of becoming too good. I think that will be the power of this experiment with free will. ",

            "answer_text": "The concept of \u201cnumber\u201d doesn\u2019t really work for consciousness\u2014 there could be more than one, multiple parts, perhaps only a partial consciousness, and so on. Have you ever watched the embers and coals in a fire flicker and glow? The hot spots move from one place to another and back again. The pieces of carbon are clearly necessary for holding the heat, but it moves from place to place with additional influences of its own. We have no evidence that consciousness is a solid object with a definite boundary, or something like a number, where 1 is clearly different from 2. Instead, it\u2019s as ephemeral and changing as clouds, as ripples in a pond, as scents in the air, capable of forming and dissolving, crossing, overlapping and permeating. The answer for \u201ccollective consciousness\u201d is not essentially different from \u201cindividual consciousness\u201d. Can a person contain two consciousnesses? Why or why not? ",
