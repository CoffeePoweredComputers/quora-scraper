            "answer_text": "You've got to hand it to logical positivism - in a sense, it's the most scientific philosophical movement we've ever had, because it's one of very few (perhaps the only) where you can point directly to an objective falsification. The positivists had a 3-step plan, properly called 'Logicism,' to put an old philosophical dream into effect: 1. Establish a consistent and complete foundation in formal logic for all of mathematics. This would involve developing a set of axioms and rules of inference in basic propositional logic from which all truths in mathematics could be proven, and from which no paradoxes (inconsistencies, or proofs that P & not-P) would follow. 2. Translate all of the problems and theories of philosophy and science from informal natural language into this formal logical notation, ruling out those which were inconsistent or unverifiable as 'nonsense.'   3. Develop definite and effective procedures (algorithms) for sorting out truth and falsehood in all such propositions, now converted into our tidy logical notation. This would turn philosophy into just a sort of 'meta-science' or computer science, responsible for maintaining, applying, and extending these logical techniques in all the domains of knowledge.  Lots of philosophers already had this dream: a 'real character' or 'mathesis universalis,' a unified philosophical language in which errors of reasoning could be demonstrated as clearly as they can be in mathematics. The falsification comes right at the first step, with G\u00f6del's Incompleteness Theorem (1931) and related results (Tarski's Indefinability). These showed that there could be no absolutely consistent and complete logic: any logical system sufficiently flexible to prove the truths of arithmetic would also be capable of producing paradoxes. It also cuts into the imagined second and third steps. There's no solid reason to rule out everything not encompassed by logic as nonsense, since there's no One True Logic, but many logics, each with their own paradoxical propositions that seem true but unverifiable. And by extension there also can't be any universal algorithmic procedures for sorting out truth from falsehood for all logical propositions.  Positivists, being scientifically minded, understood all this, and largely set aside their program. A very small handful of philosophers are still pursuing some variant of it, but as it originally stood, the project has quite truly been proven impossible. (Again, this almost never happens in philosophy!)  Now, lots of philosophers still hold to the idea that logic - formal and informal - is crucial to clear expression of ideas, and also reject the kinds of 'metaphysical' questions that the positivists did, but that's not logical positivism. The term should be reserved for those who believe in a thorough formalization of all knowledge and truth based around proof.  Note also that there are other forms of positivism that don't share the core program of the logicists, and shouldn't be confused with them: what they share, and what makes them 'positive' philosophies is that their central criterion of truth is verifiability. Especially today, some positivist philosophies are quite empiricist in their orientation; the log-pos circle was quite explicitly not, and saw mere observation as very much secondary to formal symbolic reasoning. Anyone suggesting that logical positivism is the 'de facto' position of scientists is playing fast and loose with terminology. Scientists like proving their own hypotheses, generally, and they like logical arguments, but their epistemology is really grounded in empirical testability, not logical proof. If pressed, most scientists will adopt a philosophy of science more consistent with Karl Popper's critical rationalism, not positivism - the source of the very criterion of 'falsifiability' for science that I used in the opening of this response.

            "answer_text": "I'm am not that sure whether one should speak about \"the demise of logical positivism\". The entire label has most certainly disappeared from present debates. Yet I do not quite see that there was a defeat or decline. Many of the options of thought once comprised under the term have rather moved into the mainstream of thought. Wittgenstein's (and the others') attempts to dismiss questions of essentiality, i.e. questions about the objects and their essential qualities - are today pretty normal moves of thought. 1970s Foucauldian discourse theory and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard's La Condition Postmoderne all went into the same direction of taking the linguistic turn and of reflecting our statements as moves in debates. I'd say one can do a lot of that thinking that was first considered in the 1920s today with far less efforts to substantiate them in the field of logic. One can simply continue these considerations without repeating the thoughts that originally led to them. We have a similar situation in the natural sciences. Those researchers who work in institutions like CERN - they do not have the atom under their microscope. They make experiments and they think of mathematical models to explain results. Astrophysicists do the same thing where they discuss theoretical questions like the total amount of matter that must exist in one form or another in the entire universe... These people have moved away from simply empiricism or 19th century materialism. They create theoretical options in a field of observations they have translated into statements. ...yet they would not brand their own philosophy as a variant of logical positivism. Once positivism had moved into the mainstream it became far more interesting to focus on the next steps and to see these next steps as answers to the previous situation of positivism (the word had been odious anyway (after it became a label of Comtean attempts to create a church of atheism under the term positivism), so why continue to refer to that word?) I'd say: we have moved positivism and logical positivism into the mainstream of academic theorising and we see today our debates under competing labels that can agree on one thing that it does not make sense to stress what they tend to share: a common ancestry in early 20th century positivism. You do not stress what you share with your competitors if you want to get beyond them. ",
