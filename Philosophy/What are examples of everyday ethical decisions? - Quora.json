            "answer_text": "Depending on how hard you care to think about it, almost everything can be an ethical decision. Do I have a cup of coffee at my local diner without first verifying it was fair-trade, or pesticide free, or purchased in a manner that supported an oppressive regime? Do I shop at Walmart because of the low cost pricing but ignore their pay scales to their employees? Do I creep up over the speed limit because it is to my convenience? Do I enjoy someone\u2019s art without compensating them for it? If you are willing, life is a constant ethical decision, one after another, and figuring them out is a full time job. It is one of the key reasons why so many humans sign on to myth based thinking (religions) as it can offer a playbook that you simply follow as opposed to struggling to wend your own way thru a maze of options and outcomes.

            "answer_text": "You're getting on a crowded bus, train or highway.  There isn't a lot of room.  Do you zoom to the next clear opening, or do you wait for others to make their move before settling in even though you might be standing or get cut off?  Once there, do you give up your seat or allow someone to move in front of you? Much of our ability to work in the modern world depends on co-operation even when competition might give us a slight short term advantage.  The big question is often do I follow the law and be polite and hope others will as well, or do I assume everyone is selfish and act selfish myself? ",
