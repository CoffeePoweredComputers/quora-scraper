The illusions we see being done by those who style themselves as \u201cprofessional magicians\u201d, on TV, in Las Vegas, etc. are designed to be very appealing to the eye and such that would capture the imagination. Something inside us actually wants to believe it\u2019s real, like a child believes in Santa. It is somehow disappointing to find out, no, it\u2019s not really real. As long as there are people that are fascinated by what we illusionists do, there will always be people like me who do it. It\u2019s a way for people to escape reality for an hour or so, and become little children again. The audience has a great time, the illusionist gets payed, and we all go home. Cool, huh? ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s stage magic and, for lack of a better term, \u201cserious\u201d magic. Stage magic is mostly about skillfully exploiting bugs in the human brain to trick people into misperceiving what\u2019s happening on stage. People find it amazing to experience this, and it\u2019s fine entertainment. \u201cSerious\u201d magic, i.e. the practice of breaking the laws of nature by supernatural means - is strictly make-believe, often self-delusion, and often fraud. There has never in the history of mankind been a credibly verified supernatural act, so I feel very safe in saying there ain\u2019t no such thing as magic. ",
