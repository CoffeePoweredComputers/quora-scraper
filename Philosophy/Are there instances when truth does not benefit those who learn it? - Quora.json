            "answer_text": "When it came to the subject of the truth, Friedrich Nietzsche had this to say on it: \u201cThe strength of a person's spirit would then be measured by how much 'truth' he could tolerate, or more precisely, to what extent he needs to have it diluted, disguised, sweetened, muted, falsified.\u201d What Nietzsche is correctly pointing out here is that people aren\u2019t equal in strength, and that some people are better able to handle the truth more than others as a consequence of that. This is an important insight since it reveals to us that if you feed a weak person too much of the truth in its purest form, it will destroy them. Now that we\u2019ve covered Nietzsche\u2019s correct insight on this question, I want you to hold that insight in the back of your head as I bring up another insight from the field of psychology. Since Psychology was founded in the 19th century, many different fields of therapy have arisen to combat psychological illness. While the techniques and the focus of these therapies differ from one another, they are all similar in the sense that they are all variations of the phrase, \u201cKnow the truth, and the truth will set you free\u201d. This insight from the field of psychology is important because it reveals to us that most psychological and mental issues can be cured by bringing your thinking, emotions, perceptions, beliefs, and values into a greater alignment with the truth. Since humans are so different from one another, the way in which we heal from the truth varies from person to person. Therefore it is important that people are exposed to the right expression of the truth that will help them grow. So to answer your question the truth is always more beneficial than a lie, but not all ways of speaking the truth to somebody is beneficial. ",

            "answer_text": "Truth is truth - it\u2019s the way things are, and just like everything else, it only makes a difference from one\u2019s point of view about it. Sun is shining, whether it\u2019s good or bad is irrelevant, it\u2019s the truth and it exists regardless of how we think about it (unless it\u2019s that joke about a politician recommending to land on the Sun at night, when it\u2019s not that hot). Truth is a fact, and it will either benefit or hurt someone depending on what that person imagined the reality to be and how well that imaginary reality is aligned with the fact: if they match, that\u2019s perfect, if they don\u2019t match but the person is able to adjust to it, then they can still make it work. And if those realities don\u2019t match and the person is unable to adjust (unable or outright refusing), then chances are that the truth will hurt them. There are also instances where people either know or suspect the truth, yet due to the immense pain (emotional, physical, or financial) they believe they are better off pretending that truth does not exist - that\u2019s their choice (akin conditions such as selective hearing). Any one of us can be handed a life-changing event tomorrow - what we do with that event and how we react to it will determine whether we will be impacted by it in a positive or a negative way. It\u2019s really a choice. ",

We learn from our mistakes or we fail by ignoring the results. We accept bad habits because we find patterns of behavior more efficient until they cause pain or damage. Good or bad, right or wrong, true or false; either answer can be true. ",
