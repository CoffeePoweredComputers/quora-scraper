            "answer_text": "Hitler\u2019s actions were bad because he caused untold suffering and death using a dehumanising murdering machine that killed around 17 million people, robbed millions more of their freedom, and provoked a war that killed 85 million people and spread pseudo-science about racial superiority that survives to this day. The values that Hitler violated are not those of \u2018objective reality\u2019 - they are my values as a compassionate human being and those of my society. That is what makes it bad. I don\u2019t have to refer to an external objective definition of badness in order to know that what Hitler did was an abhorrent violation of almost everything I hold dear. I have courage in my own convictions. I don\u2019t need permission to be outraged and horrified. And what makes it more than just a personal opinion is that it is also a violation of shared moral principles of my society and which I subscribe to. In effect, the great majority of my society has consented to principles that define right and wrong and which we expect ourselves and others to abide by. And Hitler\u2019s actions and those of his regime are such a gross violation of such principles that it can barely be overstated. It does not bother me that my moral outrage is not an objective fact. It does not bother me that from the perspective of Nazi ideology, those actions were good, or at least, a \u2018necessary evil\u2019. That does not mean that I have a moral duty to tolerate it. The actions taken by the Nazis and the world they wanted to build, would horrify anyone who cares about the welfare of human beings. ",

Fortunately for me, many people agree that kind of thing is bad. Counter question: Suppose something were objectively bad, in whatever means you intend that to mean, but everyone subjectively didn\u2019t think so? Like, say, things colored cyan were objectively \u201cBad\u201d. But no one knew or cared or ever would. What consequence does that have? Seems our subjective evaluations are generally what matter either way. ",
