            "answer_text": "First, let me say that everything borders on the ideas that one learns, internalize, and adopted as his or her own. Ideas are introduced to us by what we continuously see, hear, touch, feel, and smell. That is movies, the music we listen to, the food we eat, the chemicals we introduce to our bodies, and the experiences we permit in our lives. The theory of learning is this, whatever you and I are continually exposed to, that we will begin to accept, permit, and allow as normal eventually. Ideas turn into concepts, thoughts, philosophy, belief, habits, attitude, and then behavior. They automatically set our principles, values, and standard. So everything we say, and do streams from the ideas we have in our mind, ideas we have heard, internalized and accepted as our own. In truth, what someone says, how they behave, their habits is really a manifestation of what is in their heart/mind (core ideas). Thus the quality of our decisions and life, in general, is determined by what source of ideas our life is anchored on. With this knowledge and understanding, the truth is that you and I have no original ideas of our own. What we know today comes from a source somewhere and has been cultured and conditioned from the time we were born to this very day. There are ONLY two sources one can get his ideas from. 1. God (The truth) 2. the Devil (Lies) Your ideas about life today, what you and I know today is anchored on either God or the lies of the devil.  So if I want to live right, make good decisions in my life, if I want a better life, the starting point is changing my original ideas. Until you and I have a mental transformation (change of the entire belief system, that is ideas, thoughts, concepts, philosophy, mentality, principles, values, standard, behavior, habits, and attitude), nothing can truly change. Now if I am, to be honest with you, I had what I thought was my own personal Philosophy about life, I had my principles, standards, and values, all of which I had learned from the time I was born until not long ago. From that time onwards, I am now committed and I am in the process of unlearning or replacing the ideas I have with no other personal philosophy but the philosophy that God defines and directs me to follow. In other words, I am in the process of changing my mindset (repenting), and surrendering my life to God. That to me entails that I have to make a full 180-degree turn, a full personal, unconditional surrender to God as my Lord and Survivor. For this reason, I have been in the process of learning new things based entirely on the Word of God, in the hope that in the end my thoughts, ideas, beliefs, mindset, philosophy, attitude and more so my identity, my standard, the definition of life, my purpose, plans, vision and everything about me should be anchored on what God says, his will, purpose, and plans for me. With this, I know for sure that if I will remain faithful and committed, the decisions I will make now and in the future will always be right. In summary, please know and remember that the quality of my life and yours is found in meaning. Unfortunately, most people assume that Life is all about the challenges that they face, when in fact life is all about the meaning that you and I give to those challenges. Emotions are the fuel of life. The quality of your and my experiences depends on the quality of our emotions. Emotions can be controlled and transformed from negative to positive. Remember negative emotions lead to destruction, while positive emotions lead to growth, personal development, meaning, fulfillment, and happiness. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHow do you live right when so much wrong is around you?\u201d Well my answer is to be as intelligent as any dog is. A dog, can have an absolutely criminal owner, but he will be a good dog throughout his life. No dogs follow the criminal examples of their owners. Dogs are always good creatures, however their owners decide to behave. So, if you can muster the same intelligence as the average dog, then you can easily live in a good way, while the people around you are behaving in the worst way possible. It\u2019s quite simple really. Or at least it\u2019s easier than you think it is. And more difficult as well, I must add. It\u2019s both more difficult than you think it is, and more simple than you think it is. Dogs are far more intelligent than human beings are you see. Dogs are almost infinitely more intelligent than human beings are in fact. So, you\u2019d have difficulty in being as intelligent as a dog, unless you were one of those very rare human beings who are as intelligent as dogs are. Dogs have practically infinite intelligence, whilst humans are very limited with their biocomputer minds, which give them the intelligence of well-programmed computers, but not the intelligence of living creatures. To have the intelligence of a blade of grass ,or a worm, or an oak tree, or a daisy, or an elephant or a shark, or a dolphin, or a lion, or a seagull, or anything living that is intelligent, you have to be able to perceive the infinite variables of every situation. Those unfortunate human beings with biocomputer minds in their heads, are only capable of perceiving a very limited selection of variables. So, they are handicapped the human beings are. Human beings messed things up in their development many thousands of years ago. So, as a group some human beings know this , and some of them know that, and they need to be in millions altogether to discover as much about the World as any dog can find out on his own in a flash. And usually the human beings don\u2019t find out anything even when they are millions all together, because they are so busy lying to each other, and trying to trick and deceive each other. So, the human species of the Earth is a failure, full stop. That\u2019s the truth really. ",

            "answer_text": "In this time of our history, there is much going on but no matter what the turmoil is, it is not ever about that turmoil, it is only about you, the individual. As an individual, you are the only decider, the only council, the only figurehead that needs to be taken care of. I am a firm believer in the individual, not the crowd. I believe in making an informed choice as to my own direction and hold myself to the highest standards I can muster. I am the sole master of those things that I can control, all else can twist and turn around me but I don\u2019t have too. I was sitting on the banks of a stream once, it was late fall and there were tons of leaves being swept down that stream, big parcels of leaves stuck together rushing towards a connecting river and that river was heading towards the vast ocean. But here and there, along the shoreline were little backwater eddies, and in those little eddies were a few leaves were not being pushed by the full force of that stream. Those few leaves had somehow found a reprieve from the course most leaves were caught up in. Little spots to rest while the majority flowed full force into the distant ocean. This certainly does not mean those few leaves would not eventually find that same ocean, but it might take longer to get there and who knows what journey they will experience by getting out of the general flow. Take this image and use it well. If you choose to go with the flow with others, of being part of a crowd that is chasing the bandwagon down the road, then that is a choice, but not the only choice. As an individual, stepping out of the crown will allow you to choose well, to make a different choice that is right for you. This does not mean you bury your head in the sand, but to look directly at the turmoil and decide whether you wish to march in step with the crowd or not. This in never about what all the others are doing, it is about what you are going to do. I cannot tell you what to do nor think you should think the same as me. I would be egotistical to assume anything for anyone else. So if the world is not standing on balanced feet, then maybe, just maybe, we as individuals need to balance ourselves first. The first step in solving any problem is knowing we have a problem. The second step is to decide what you, as an individual, is going to do about it. Fixing a broken leg in one thing, but if we have a broken leg, we had better fix that first before we can help others with their broken legs. I would rather stand on my own, choose my own course of action, decide for myself than follow the parade down the road to one tune, only to find the parade coming back down that same road playing a different tune with the same crowd in tow. Individual are the solid foundation to all life and when that foundation is broken, only the individual can ever rebuilt it. I trust in the individual to do what is right before I trust in the crowd deciding for me. Just Sayin\u2019 ",
