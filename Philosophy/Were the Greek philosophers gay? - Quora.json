            "answer_text": "The first thing you learn when you start to deal with the ancient world, in particular that of Ancient Greece & Rome, is that not only homosexuality was widely accepted, but wasn\u2019t even defined, as same-sex relationships were as usual as the heterosexual ones. Actually, homoerotic love was depicted as philosophically higher, because it requires \u201creal love\u201d between two souls, a sense of affection that is detached from utility (make love in order to procreate). We have plenty of examples about this kind of relationships, starting from Socrates (who\u2019s told to have been in a relationship with Alcibiades) to Alexander the Great, from Achilles to the poetess Sappho (whose poem about one of her students meeting her husband is heart-breaking) : He is more than a hero He is a god in my eyes \u2014the man who is allowedto sit beside you \u2014 he who listens intimatelyto the sweet murmur ofyour voice, the enticing laughter that makes my ownheart beat fast. If I meetyou suddenly, I can\u2019t speak \u2014 my tongue is broken;a thin flame runs undermy skin; seeing nothing, hearing only my own earsdrumming, I drip with sweat;trembling shakes my body and I turn paler thandry grass. At such timesdeath isn\u2019t far from me. Eventually, even in Rome we\u2019ve plenty of examples: Caesar (whose relation with the king of Bithynia, Nicomede, was the main topic of many gossips at the time), Nero, Hadrian and many others. Nevertheless, it wasn\u2019t accepted as much as in Greece, as some Roman writers were used to describing it as \u201cthe greek vice\u201d. What mattered in Rome was the position in the act: had someone had been active in the relationship, he wouldn\u2019t have been discriminated. The passives, instead, were insulted. So, I guess plenty of ancient philosophers had homosexual relationships, even though not everybody wrote that in their philosophical works. ",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s an anachronism. \u201cGay\u201d is a modern term. In most of Ancient Greece, same sex relationships between older men and teenage boys or between men was accepted as normal. The people who did this were not identified by any term that translates as gay. Some people in ancient Greece engaged in these practices, others did not. We don't know a lot about the lives of the Ancient Greek philosophers, though you can read about some of them in Plutarch (a fun read) or Diogenes La\u00ebrtius (not so much), among other places. As far as I can recall, and I'm not a classicist, we know a bit about Socrates, who was married to Xanthippe, a woman, but who had some sort of romantic, as we would say, relationship with Alcibiades, one of the leaders of Athenian political and military society. I don't think we know whether the relation was physical. About Plato or Aristotle, I don't think we have any real information regarding their sexual preferences or practices. I do note that Mary Renault, a historical novelist of Ancient Greece, a writer of real importance in my view, whose work is deeply scholarly\u2014as far as I can tell when she depicts a person or a situation there is a historical basis for it\u2014represent Plato personally disapproved of same sex relationships. (\u201cPlato\u201d was actually, as she points out, a nickname he acquired as a wrestler in his youth: his real name was Aristo-n.) That Mary Renault so depicts him this suggest to me there must be some basis for this. It's not the sort of thing she makes up. ",
