            "answer_text": "Solipsism is the idea that the mind or self is the only thing we can know really exists. This is not compatible with the bible, which says there are a lot of other things that exist (e.g. God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, the world, the universe, people, love, grace, mercy, salvation, heaven, hell, history, the bible and its truths, etc.). I\u2019m not a philosopher, but it seems only common sense to know other things exist in the fact they have an effect on us (e.g. germs, cars running over us, rain, people, etc.). The key in life, according to the bible, is to realize God exists and loves us and has provided a means to know Him and be blessed in this world and be a blessing and go to heaven when we die (i.e. by repenting of our sins and putting faith in Christ as Savior and Lord by grace through faith, evidenced by good works).

            "answer_text": "Is Solipsism compatible with the Bible? +JMJ+ I hesitate to answer such questions for the simple reason that Protestants do not have a complete Bible to begin with, and if you examine all 9,000 variations of Protestants you can say anything is compatible with the Bible from Amish/Quaker/Baptist to High Church Episcopalian/Missouri Synod Lutherans. But giving a Catholic view of the Bible, solipsism would be exactly heretical. solipsism noun so\u00b7\u200blip\u00b7\u200bsism | \\ \u02c8s\u014d-l\u0259p-\u02ccsi-z\u0259m , \u02c8s\u00e4- \\ Definition of solipsism : a theory holding that the self can know nothing but its own modifications and that the self is the only existent thingalso : extreme egocentrism ",
