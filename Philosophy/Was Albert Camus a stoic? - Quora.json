            "answer_text": "There are points of similarity. Camus advocates integrity as opposed to morality; there are no outwardly-defined rules, there is only loyalty to your own values. This is similar to Stoicism: every act is indifferent, and every act has the potential to be appropriate in particular circumstances (however contrived). There is no morality in Stoicism; only your own decisions. The acceptance of existence as absurd may also result in a form of indifference towards external things, their having been stripped of meaning; indifference towards all things external is also an important aspect of Stoicism. However, I believe that Camus would probably look down on Stoicism as a philosophy. This is because Stoicism believed in inherent purpose and absolute standards of excellence, and was generally speaking a theistic (or deistic) philosophy.  Epictetus (a significant Stoic teacher, many transcripts of whose speeches survive) was quite explicitly theistic; he encouraged devotion to the Greek gods and regarded oracular divination as valid. Even if they did not believe in anthropomorphic gods, Stoics had a rather panentheistic view of Nature (often referred to as \"God\"). Although not necessarily conscious, Nature was a benevolent force that it was perceived as befitting to \"be in accord with\". For the Stoics, acting in accord with Nature was the absolute purpose of every human, and whoever did not do so was failing. If you asked a Stoic \"is there absolute purpose to existence\", they would say \"yes\", and they would say that every human should live by the same fundamental philosophy (although this may manifest in different courses of action in different circumstances). I believe that Camus would take issue with this. I am very familiar with Stoicism and only moderately so with Absurdism, so I apologise if I have misrepresented the latter in any way. For more information on Stoicism, I would recommend Tad Brennan's book The Stoic Life, and you can also consult: Alexander Palmer's answer to What's indifference (feeling neither good, bad, nor affected) from a moral perspective?Alexander Palmer's answer to What is Stoicism?
