            "answer_text": "Thank you for your question, i had reminisced from the past and saw that my parents did not teach us anything about a childhood words of wisdom. Now i do not wonder why i have no wants, no desires for professional success. I did not even ask for anything for me. But i know i was a giving person from my nature without even thinking twice before i do the act. Although my elder sisters pursued a college degree, (two of them), it was because my Father is focused to education. It must be an important aspect in his life before when he was a young student in a state college. i knew from stories about Father heard from my older sisters that he had to walk a couple of kilometers in the province just to be able attend his class. It was said that his father did not wish for them a college education. He wanted them to plow the fields. Father has other four brothers siblings. They all worked in the field. The outbreak of a Second World War prevented Father to finish his schooling. Instead, he served in the Army fighting a war which was not ours. We were under American colony then, and most of our male population joined the battlefield. Father and Mother were childhood sweethearts. When they got married, the war had ended already. They lived a life based from the old school of thought. And Father did not finish his studies, and that could be the reason why he was bent on providing for us an education for ourselves. In fact, he offered his whole life to give us the education we wanted for ourselves. Perhaps in that, he was successful, except with his two daughters and a son who married early. my parents must be right for giving us the life we know and wanted. But perhaps being poor, because we were nine siblings, they must have discovered the difficulty raising a whole brood of a family. The childhood words of wisdom were not provided for us, but the love of parents for their children is enough to make us good followers like children respecting their parents, and the older people, as well. In their old age, our parents knew their children expressed their love for them unconditionally. In the same way they had shown their love to us, unconditionally, too. i noticed how my female and male siblings expressed the respect for fellow siblings as i began to make observations. All my siblings are respectful members of society even those who did not finish a college degree. Unconsciously, our parents\u2019 positive attitudes were transferred to us, and that is wisdom in itself, not verbally, though, but a silent rendering of what i considered similar to a service, from patents to children.

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s funny, I told my mother once how often I\u2019ve thought of one thing she said, and she said \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever say that!\u201d But she did\u2026 It was \u201cEveryone isn\u2019t thinking about you all the time\u201d. She said it in the context that I shouldn\u2019t be so self-conscious and shy, that people aren\u2019t really noticing other people that much anyway. She meant that most people are caught up in themselves, and so when we feel like people are judging what we do, they are probably not\u2014-they aren\u2019t even probably noticing what we do. These words have helped me a great deal going into situations where I\u2019m not sure how to act, which as a person with some social anxiety, come up a lot. I figure nobody is really watching me to see if I\u2019m doing anything stupid, so I shouldn\u2019t worry about acting just the right way. ",
