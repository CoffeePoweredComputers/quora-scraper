            "answer_text": "Determinism and Freedom (or Free Will) are hopelessly irreconcilable. As I understand it, Determinism (which I take to be Causal Determinism) posits that all activity in the universe is both (i) the effect of [all] prior activity, and (ii) the only activity that can occur given the prior activity. That is what is meant by saying that everything is \u201cdetermined\u201d \u2014 it is the inexorable consequence of activity that preceded it. In a deterministic universe, everything that has ever occurred, is occurring, and will occur since the universe came into existence (however that might have occurred) can only occur exactly as it has occurred, is occurring, or will occur, and cannot possibly occur in any different manner. This mandated activity necessarily includes all human action, including all human cognition. As I understand the notion of Freedom (or Free Will), it posits that a human being, when presented with more than one course of action, has the freedom or agency to choose between or among the alternatives, and that the state of affairs that exists in the universe immediately prior to the putative exercise of that freedom of choice does not eliminate all but one option and compel the selection of only one of the available options. Based on the foregoing, if Determinism is true, human beings lack the ability to think in a manner that is not 100% caused by prior activity that is outside of their control, and thereby lack Freedom (or Free Will). By the same token, if human beings have Freedom (or Free-Will), they are capable of thinking in a manner that is not 100% caused by prior activity that is outside of their control, which rules out Determinism. As I understand the two concepts, Determinism and Freedom (or Free Will) are hopelessly irreconcilably unless (i) Determinism is defined to exclude human cognition from the inexorable path of causation forged through the universe long before human beings came into existence, and/or (ii) Freedom (or Free Will) is defined to be include the illusion of human cognition that is a part of the path of Determinism. I could write many pages describing the varied attempts of by compatibilists to harmonize the irreconcilable concepts of determinism and free will, but it is unnecessary for me to do so, as there is an excellent discussion of this subject on-line at Compatibilism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). It should suffice to say that none of the various arguments for compatibilism courageously presented on the Stanford website is satisfying, and all suffer from the same flaw identified above \u2014 namely, a stubborn refusal to come to grips with the true and complete nature of the two incompatible concepts.

            "answer_text": "There is no need to reconcile the two, because it is pretty clear that there is no such thing as general determinism in our universe. Causality there may be, certainly, in the sense that most things that we see in our lives only happen because other things happened first, but precisely which of all the possible things will happen cannot be predicted. even in principle.There are at least two reasons  for this.Firstly, our world works according to quantum mechanics, which among other things describes how the smallest parts of our universe work, and how they interact to make larger parts work. At quantum levels the only possible predictions are probabilistic; we can only say how likely a given event can be compared to certain other events, and the smaller the event the less certain we can be about it. In fact, the more precisely we can say how a certain thing happens, the less precisely we can say how certain associated different things happen, so there ALWAYS is something that we cannot predict, and nothing else in the universe can predict it either, because it isn't real before it happens. If it were deterministic, it would in some sense be real a million years before it happens. Secondly our world is a chaotic system. This means that even without quantum principles, some things are effectively unpredictable. Suppose you have a billiard table with one ball bouncing between two other balls back and forth. Exactly back and forth. this means that the slightest error, enougn to make the ball miss dead centre by little enough to take a billion billion tries to miss an atom, would start a progressively larger error so that within a surprisingly small number of bounces, it would miss the other ball completely. Now, to predict anything deterministically means that you need an infinite amount of information to determine it, and information is a physical reality, so you can't get an infinite amount of information, any more than you can get an infinite amount of energy.In practice, this doesn't matter, because LOOOONG before we start worrying about information limitations, we run out of the precision that QM permits. So one way or another, forget about determinism, no matter how confident you might be about causality. There are certain implications about butterfly effects changing our entire history if the slightest change in whether anyone in Berlin, Illinois trips over a pebble, leading to a totally different govenment in Berlin, Germany a generation later. But never mind that for now.More important is the implication for free will. Some people argue that free will depends on randomness, but that is a complete non-sequitur. Free will is not randomness; it depends on anyone with a will (whatever that might be) making a choice according to a value judgment and an assessment ot the probable outcomes. And the choice should be free (whatever that might be) in that it is not determined by an outside will. Accordingly, freedom and determinism need not be reconciled; they have nothing perceptible to do with each other. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a number of different semantic senses in which people use the terms \"freedom\", \"free will\", and \"choice\". The problem is that those notions, as well as \"determinism\" are still very ill-defined. There is a problem reconciling ill-defined terms. If you mean strictly how to reconcile moral agency and responsibility with causal determinism, you might review Compatibilism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).  Typically, compatibilist theories tend to ignore the ontological and cognitive questions in favour of the epistemological or moral ones. A moral theory, for example, might define moral agency and responsibility by its lack of coercion by other moral agents. If I don't have a gun to your head, or I'm not otherwise coercing you, you are morally free and responsible for your actions. Such as definition doesn't provide a positive description of what moral agency really is, which is a much more complicated cognitive question involving things like personal identity and decision making. Without a positive description, it turns on a positive description of coercion, which itself has many grey areas.  Does McDonald's coerce you to eat cheeseburgers with aggressive marketing campaigns? Is consumer consent really manufactured, as Chomsky suggested? Then there are cases where \"external\" circumstances, not coercion are responsible. Suppose your car gets a flat and drives you into another car which pushes it into oncoming traffic where a large truck hits it and kills the passengers. Your agency wasn't compromised by coercion, but by external factors. But then how do we ontological and cognitively define which factors are \"external\" and which ones are \"internal\"? Along these lines, we could get into nature and nurture debates, both of which might be thought to compromise your moral agency and responsibility. If a sociopath is demonstrated to be genetically predisposed, or if he has been shaped by society and his upbringing (or raised by wild dogs), isn't that also a compromise to his moral agency and responsibility?Epistemological leaning reconciliations rely on either: the fact that, even though the universe may be causally determinate, you cannot determine all the causes and predict all the outcomes,or your experience of free will, even though it's an illusion, is sufficient to make you practically free and morally responsible.1 above has the strange consequence that, if you could determine all the causes and outcomes, you wouldn't be free. In a more narrow scope, an informed decision is precisely that. A lack of information, or ignorance, isn't what we say makes someone free and responsible. It's quite the opposite. 2 above doesn't help for a similar reason. If you are deluded because you have a mental illness or have taken mind altering drugs, we ordinarily consider you less free, and possibly less responsible, for your actions, no matter how free you feel. One ontological and cognitive reconciliation has been to suggest that, perhaps the mind operates on a quantum level of indeterminacy. So while causal determinism operates on an \"emergent\" scale, at the scale of your \"personal identity\" and decision making, causal determinism has no effect. There is actually no evidence for this. Even if ontological indeterminate interpretations of quantum mechanics are true, there is no evidence that they have any effect on the electro-chemical biological level of the brain at which your consciousness most likely occupies. Besides that, indeterminacy does not help define free choice. If your choices were indeterminate, or random, we wouldn't say that you were the ones making the choices. Again, someone who is crazy or on drugs, or otherwise acting in a random way, isn't thought of as being free. Just the opposite. Indeterminacy would be equally, if not more inconsistent, with freedom than determinacy. So on the ontological level, what sort of structure would a system require to be free in the sense that we would hold that that system responsible for their actions. Based on the above we would expect it to at least meet the following criteria: intentional (this rules out coercion)informed (this rules out illusion, lack of information, and error)self-determined (this rules out indeterminacy)We are considering a pocket of the universe which is ontologically self-determining, capable of informed intentional decision making. This doesn't rule out the possibility of this pocket being caused, as long as its internal structure is in some sense determinate from within the structure, but indeterminate from without. For at least (3) self-determination, others have considered the possibility of notions of self-reflection, bio-feedback, self-awareness, and other \"loopy\" style structures as being responsible. Such structures seem, at least intuitively, to be able to create the sort of pocket we need within an otherwise causally determined universe. While I think its likely loopy structures are involved in the brain and conscious thought (I seem to experience them often when I get the spins doing deductive logic), I don't think they are necessary or sufficient to break the causal chain of determination. A might cause B, which causes C, which causes B', which causes D. A still causes D, whether there is a loop in between or not. Just in terms of (3) self-determination, I think we're looking for is something like this (where \">\" is causal determination and \"()\" encloses the \"causal pocket\"): A > B(a>b) > C such that A determines B(a),B(a) determines B(b),A does not determine B(b),B(b) determines C,and A does not determine C.The logical problem is that causal determinism is generally thought of as being transitive. If A causes B, and B causes C, then A causes C. The seriality of causation seems to imply its transitivity. So how do we formalize an intransitive notion of causal determination without also breaking the seriality of the causal chain? One way to do it might be to distinguish between direct and indirect causation such that direct causes are determinate and intransitive, and indirect causes are transitive but indeterminate, both being serial. If A (directly) causes B, and B (directly) causes C, then A (indirectly) causes C. Thus, A does not determine C even though it is a transitively indirect cause of C. C can be said to be \"free\" of A's determinism even though, if A happens, ultimately so will C. If you think about it in terms of responsibility, it would be bizarre and rare to hold a transitive notion of responsibility (except in cases of coercion and so on discussed above). This solution might seem overly semantic, and it hasn't really addressed the cognitive criterion of intentionality and epistemological criterion of being well-informed. Leaving out intentionality and information for now, focussed just on (3) self-determination, let's consider how this distinction might apply to cognitive and non-cognitive descriptions. First, we know a brain is determinately caused by many factors, from its genetic heritage, it's physical electrical functions, it's chemical interactions, and it's biological substance, among the oodles of environmental factors which impact and shape it. We also know that the brain is primarily responsible for our behaviours, as long as we aren't physically moved like a puppet if, for example, we're hit by a car while crossing the road, fly into another car's windshield and break it. So as long as there is something going on in the brain, we can say that the brain determines the body's actions and not the factors which determine the brain. While the brain isn't \"free\" of its direct causes, the body and our actions are. That's not the case with the example of being hit by a car, in which it is the car which determines the body's actions, not the brain. So in terms of (3) self-detemination we seem to be able to express ordinary usage of determination and freedom (except perhaps within this oversimplification we might prefer to call an agent's behavior \"free action\" or \"free body\" rather than \"free will\"). Considering a billiard table, we might wonder whether this distinction breaks our intuitive notion and ordinary semantics of causal determinism. The cue hits ball A, which hits ball B, and goes into the pocket. Let's ignore the fact that there is a person holding the cue who intended or didn't intend (and had or didn't have the skill) to make this combo shot. What we say is that the cue is responsible for the movement of ball A, ball A is responsible for the movement of ball B, which then goes in the pocket. We also have to say that the cue is not responsible for ball B going in the pocket. The causal concept here is that, suppose we removed ball A, ball B wouldn't have gone in the pocket (the cue would have misfired into the air or skinning the table). To me, this seems a perfectly reasonable way to describe what happened. Ball B's fate is \"free\" of the cue's action in the counterfactual case that ball A is not in play.  On a cognitive note, considering the person behind the cue, I'd say that it's our cognitive ability to consider counterfactuals which both allows us to predict sequences of actions like billiard combo shots, making us the determining factor in which ball is sunk (when all goes according to plans), and the one responsible for the consequences of those actions (a free beer if I win I hope). There is still the cognitive element of intention behind it. In billiards, we deal with this aspect by requiring one to call their shots, including combos. In court we might look for signs of pre-meditation, like buying the ice-pick the day before a murder with no obvious intention to pick ice. In other species, we look for behaviour indicating indirect plan-ahead routines. By being cognizant of indirect transitive causal sequences, we can (assuming we are also capable) bypass or break the ordinarily intransitive sequence of causal determination, and jump ahead of the natural unimpeded cue in determining the final desired outcome. It's in this sense that I believe our past is determined but our future is free. ",

I can imagine that there is some way in which human beings' consciousness is able to escape the strictures of determinism. But even if you assume that, how do you articulate what the heck it actually means to act freely? Attempts to describe freedom typically end up sounding like they refer to cause-less or random actions, which is probably not what we have in mind when we refer casually to free will. ",
