            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. I\u2019m not an expert in politics, but I understand some of the principles of manipulation. In my mind, these are the basic points: Negative Methods: Control. In order to propagate political ideals and agendas, you need to control your audience. You can achieve this in many ways, and not all of them are positive. Unity is key for successful implementation of the goal. Ignorance. Keep your audience from knowing all the facts. Withholding any information that might give people an alternative weakens your influence.Relief. Offer to lighten their burden. Leaders often offer to lead, ease people\u2019s suffering, or to make their lives somehow better.Manipulation. You need to convince people to follow the leader. Why should they? What do they have to gain or lose? Most people take offence, but on average, people are lazy and selfish. They are looking out for number one. Fear. Instil a sense of immediate fear and people will turn to those who offer support and propose a solution, even if it is flawed. When people are comfortable, and life is good, they are not interested in your political principles. Challenge their comfort zone, and you have a captive audience.Debt. Give someone debt, and you have create the modern version of slavery.Positive Methods: Freedom. I mean true freedom, and not silly promises that will never be fulfilled. You do this by: Responsibility. Encourage people to be responsible for their words and actions, most successfully achieve in leading by example.Decentralised power. You cannot have one person in charge of everything. We have systems in place that are recipes for abuse and corruption. You achieve this by encouraging people to take responsibility in their own world.Education. True leaders of humankind are those that spread education, and not withhold it in order to manipulate and control.",

            "answer_text": "It is very difficult to change what a person values, but it is relatively easy to change their understanding of the world and how other people think.  Therefore, if you want to change someone's opinion, the best way to do that is to (1) convince them of a set of factual statements that naturally lead them to your side and/or (2) that the opposition thinks something so crazy, stupid, or evil that anyone in their right mind must support you because you offer the only real alternative.
