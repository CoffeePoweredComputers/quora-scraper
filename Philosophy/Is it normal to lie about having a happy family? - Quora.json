            "answer_text": "It\u2019s common, but it is not healthy. Mu family covered up its internal battles, and as if that was not enough, my parents set up so many taboos that we could not speak about any of it, even to each other. This was upheld under the threat of violence. I left home more or less an emotional cripple. I didn\u2019t understand even the most basic aspects of relationship-building, did not know how to say no to anyone because I had had it drummed into me that I was not important and that my emotions and my body didn\u2019t matter. I would belittle myself for the merest scrap of love, which caused others to disrespect me, and regard me as a doormat. And of course I was. It was hard - very hard - to desconstruct myself and then re-parent myself and I did not thank my parents for putting me in such a poor position. I had to confront many things, including the fact that I really didn\u2019t like my parents very much at all. I achieved my goal of re-parenting myself and of becoming a stronger, more enabled person. Now, as a consequence of that, I feel like a powerhouse of insight and I get to say that I did that. They did not and they don\u2019t get to take credit for it as better parents do. I don\u2019t recommend the secrecy - it sounds as if none of you are really talking about your feelings or betrayal and potential emotions about how your family is imploding in on itself. It must be making your life intolerably unhappy and costly for overcome. It took me years to negotiate myself out of the bitterness that resulted from our family dynamic. I have forgiven my parents, but not my sister yet because she is currently engaging in a horrible, full-scale manipulation of my mother which is for her money only, and has admitted this to me (it goes on). My father is dead now and prior to his death we made our peace, which was an important moment in my life. My mother is still alive and we have developed quite a nice relationship, which I greatly enjoy, but the fact remains that I don\u2019t respect them for the poor choices they made in these matters and for the fallout that these things caused which was very difficult for me to deal with. The appalling obligation to present a different front to others destroyed any chance that we may have had to have a happy family dynamic. I urge you to forge your own path, maybe leave on your own terms - wait to get your own place - and just before you leave, call your family together and tell them how you feel about how the dynamic is sucking the lifeblood out of all of you, like a sickness. Speak clearly, calmly, present your feelings as facts, and let it sit with them, in the silence. Confront them with the truths that you see - the big white elephant in the room if there is one - and wait for their response. It\u2019s risky for sure - they could choose to see you as the enemy for presenting them with something they are possibly not ready to face, but it could also open the cauldron and let the steam out, at last, calming things down and bringing about a dialogue. Be clear about what you expect for yourself, if you do this, and be ready to say it. Be clear about what the consequences of your action here could be and be consistent with any choices you make. In effect, you need to be the parent here. I wish I had done this. I think it would have been cathartic for me - and an eye-opening education for them. It would have saved me from so much pain and taken away the suffocation I felt for much of my life. Doing it now would not achieve anything, so I focus on other things. I have focussed on developing a simple, kind, respectful relationship with my mother, not because I have to, but because I choose to. The love I give her is a gift. It is, as such, an expression of my healing, and of my insight. It shows how much bigger I am, than narrow thinking that creating those past obligations. I have chosen to do this because I can, and because, as a highly trained healer, I am here to make the world a better place. This is my bid to do that, but make no mistake - if there can be another way for you, than this one of mine, try to take it before it is too late. ",

            "answer_text": "I can so relate to you right now. You are not alone. It\u2019s common, but it's not normal. So many kids feel the need to cover up their family's dysfunction. You need to know this: No matter what has happened or what you've been told, the abuse in your house is not your fault. And it is not your job to cover or clean up your parents' messes. In my case, we (the kids) were actually encouraged on a regular basis to conceal our family troubles especially from extended family. They were called \u201cprivate family matters.\u201d In addition, I was motivated to keep up the facade because I was embarrassed and ashamed. As for whether you\u2019re ok: the constant emotional and psychological turmoil that is going on in your house has probably had some kind of effect on you. Just watching your dad berate your mom can be a pretty traumatizing thing, let alone if he's directed his fury at you. If you can, you should try to get some therapy to deal with your feelings right away. Whether or not you can do that, you really should find someone you can really trust to talk to about your home situation (probably shouldn't be your Mom, as she feels bound to him and will be unlikely to fully see your point of view). I know it doesn't feel right to talk about your family's shame, but you shouldn't have to carry that knowledge alone. Share your burden with someone you trust. Bottling your feelings can make you ill. It's not wrong for you to wish that your dad (the abuser) would leave already and stop hurting your mom. You just want peace in the house. That's perfectly understandable and normal. As soon as you are of age, you should leave this toxic environment. Although you might feel like you\u2019re protecting your mom by your presence, you cannot save her from her own choice to stay with this man. You're doing the best you can with what you've got. Again, none of this is your fault. If you want to talk some more about your situation, feel free to message me. I'm happy to help. ",
