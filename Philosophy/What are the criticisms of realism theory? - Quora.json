            "answer_text": "From Google (the first paragraph below): Realism (in philosophy) about a given object is the view that this object exists in reality independently of our conceptual scheme. In philosophical terms, these objects are ontologically independent of someone's conceptual scheme, perceptions, linguistic practices, beliefs, etc. That means for this philosophy objects exist in the word whether we are there to sense their presence or not. The evolution of our earth began way before we came to be on it as homo sapiens . So clearly that reality existed before our species did. It makes no sense to my mind that when homo sapiens first evolved that existing physical reality changed. And we know that our perceptions of the world can fool us. In other words we have visual illusions. So our perceptions cannot be relied on to give us an accurate sense of reality. This fact also supports realism in philosophy. In short I don\u2019t know of any strong arguments against this philosophy. ",
