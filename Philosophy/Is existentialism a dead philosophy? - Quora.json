            "answer_text": "Question: Is existentialism a dead philosophy? Hardly. Firstly, existentialism is a relatively new school of philosophical thought. It emerged largely in the late 1800s, more recent than many major philosophical schools that remain popular today (i.e. utilitarianism, Kantianism, etc.), and it has grown particularly after the advent of World War I, World War II, and has become a key idea adopted by many individuals after many of the more recent wars, especially Vietnam and the Iraq War of 2003. My cousin served in the American military during the initial invasion of Iraq and afterwards basically adopted nihilism. For me, he is a case study for how war can change a person\u2019s perceptions on reality, up to the point of making them think that nothing matters. Existentialist thought will always exist so long as knowledge of human suffering and education on history continues to be offered. Secondly, philosophical schools of thought do not tend to die out. They can dissipate, but they do not typically die out. The only one that I can think of which one can say with certainty has died out are some of the ancient Greek philosophies, mainly those such as the Atomists, and that is mainly because we now understand the atom and can confirm that they were partly correct. I cannot think of many schools of philosophy which I have heard to be dead. Even ancient ones, such as Solipsism, have been espoused from people that are acquaintances of mine. Thirdly, existentialism is one of the most discussed philosophical concepts to date. It is prevalent in philosophical discussions of postmodernism, where the ideas of modernism have been challenged as being illegitimate, and even in post-post modernism. Outside of this, it has been such a popular idea that large bookselling companies, such as Goodreads, has dedicated entire sections to the topic of books on the topic which they can sell: Best Existential Fiction. Lastly, existentialism is even prevalent in modern culture, especially in America and Europe. Some of the most popular films in the 2000s have had existential themes in them. Just to name one example, The Dark Knight and, by extension, the entire trilogy itself, has been incredibly existential. The Batman in Batman v. Superman was essentially a nihilist who was ready to abandon all of his previous moral values and kill a sentient being out of nothing more than supposing him to be a threat. Logan featured a protagonist who coped with the thought and fear of death while simultaneously trying to search for purpose in his actions.   Rick and Morty, one of the most popular cartoons of all time, has its main theme as existentialism and whether or not anything truly matters in the vast universe. Heck, even shows meant for children and teenagers, such as Adventure Time, grapple with major questions of existentialist philosophy. One of their episodes is even titled What is Life?, where it features a robot accidentally created by the Ice King who must choose between being loyal to Finn, who has treated him kindly, or the Ice King, who wants to use him as a servant. It quite literally has a being, now endowed with sentience, trying to grapple as to where his loyalties should lie. Aside from this, the character of the Ice King himself is an existential mess.   If all of this doesn\u2019t demonstrate that existentialism is alive and well, then I am not sure what does. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are my concerns. Existentialism was, to a large extent, born in an era where existentialism blossomed shortly after WWII, in an age where the last two generations had fought in world wars, the world was coming to terms with things like the Holocaust and nuclear arsenal, and the Cold War brought an even greater apocalyptic sensibility. For further clarification: What I mean by \u201cdead\u201d was simply the obsolete usages of existential tenets. If anything, I find existentialism to be very practical in its academic value. But nobody seems to be spouting any modernized rhetoric regarding existentialism. I mean\u2014 it seems surreal to me. Outside of Academia, nobody seems concerned with existentialism. (Perhaps a few) Personally speaking, I never found existentialism to be outdated, not in any sense. It seems that only a few \u201cpractice\u201d existentialism in their daily lives. I understand the whole concept of numerous philosophies evolving over time\u2014 thus, establishing an academic wave of novel subjects and concepts. This, of course, renders past philosophies in a bit of a bind\u2014 this causes departments of philosophy to re-analyze and re-adjust their understanding of philosophy entirely. Existentialism, on the whole, does not seem \u201cdead\u201d as some would dictate; I firmly believe that existentialism never waned at any point. I think, for the most part, it got incorporated into another philosophical framework or cultural thing. My issue here is that the nature of existential topics seems to have disappeared from the popular light in academic philosophy. The relation of the 'self' to the world seems to be largely replaced by monumental amounts of postmodern philosophy. And I'm rambling\u2026 again\u2026 I hope this is coherent\u2026 I don't know\u2026 ",
