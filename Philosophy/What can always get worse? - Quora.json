            "answer_text": "Uncontrolled fear. If you live in fear unchecked or unchallenged. It can slowly eat at you creating a spiral down into a pit of despair. Turning you into the very monster you fear. This is why I usually try to advise people not to live in fear. You can have vigilance and wariness. But never have fear outside of a moment where it\u2019s needed. If you live in fear of walking the street by yourself. You need to face that fear and attempt to overcome it. Fear makes you unpredictable and turns you into a risk. If you\u2019ve ever been on a flight with someone who is afraid of flying. They will always act differently each time. Some will sit ramrod, some will be jittery, some talkative, some will projectile vomit. But every now and again they will snap and go off. Putting everyone around them at risk. So what can always get worse. Your own fear. If you leave it unchallenged it will only grow. ",
