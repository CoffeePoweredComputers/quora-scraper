            "answer_text": "Salam Firstly, new discoveries have confirmed that some parts of ancient Greek sciences are not scientifically true while none of the scientific sayings of the Qur\u2019an has been denied by significant and true scientific discoveries. (I mean that scientific sayings of the Qur\u2019an do not contradict the true scientific findings) Secondly, I want to ask a question that how could it be historically possible that an unlettered man was able to collect ancient Greek science. And how could it be possible for him to reorganize this science and use it in his book? In actuality, from the beginning of the revelation of the Qur\u2019an such allegations have risen from the people who have rejected the Qur\u2019an. They do not want to affirm the Qur\u2019an as a divine scripture, so they have been seeking human origin for its content. Indeed, what they have developed as arguments are not based on reality rather based on assumption. The history does not confirm any direct or indirect connections between the Prophet (S) and the scholars or scientists of his age. The Qur\u2019an clearly expresses its contemporary opponent\u2019s statements in this regard. When we compare them with modern scholars\u2019 justifications we see that how they are similar to each other: \u0648\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0630\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0643\u064e\u0641\u064e\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0647\u064e\u0630\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u0651\u064e\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0641\u0652\u0643\u064c \u0627\u0641\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0646\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0647\u0650 \u0642\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064c \u0622\u062e\u064e\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e \u0641\u064e\u0642\u064e\u062f\u0652 \u062c\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0638\u064f\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064b\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0632\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064b\u0627 \u0640 \u0648\u064e\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0637\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0648\u0651\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e \u0627\u0643\u0652\u062a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627 \u0641\u064e\u0647\u0650\u064a \u062a\u064f\u0645\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0649 \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0647\u0650 \u0628\u064f\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629\u064b \u0648\u064e\u0623\u064e\u0635\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064b\u0627 And the disbelievers say, \u201cThis is naught but a lie that he has fabricated, and another people have helped him in it.

            "answer_text": "Look, be logic. Few things in the Quran were known before. The Greeks had tons of theories. Some turned out as right in modern age, others as wrong. The prophet Muhammad was an illiterate. He had no education at all. If he would have copied the knowledge from the Greeks, why did not he copy the mistakes and errors too? And how would he have been able to correct the things, which were wrong from the Greeks? And why does the Quran mention things, which are neither among the Greeks theories, nor in the Bible. Just be logic and do not seek unnecessarily for coherent evidences. ",
