            "answer_text": "One of the most piercing criticisms of Kantian ethics, in that it meets Kant on his own ground rather than beginning by attacking the foundations, is the objection by Hegel that Kant's Universal Maxim or Categorical Imperative conveys no content and thus offers no ethical instruction. \"Act only according to that maxim which you would will to be a universal maxim,\" Hegel says, is reducible to a simple principle of non-contradiction of the form \"One cannot do both x and not x.\" Such a principle can only tautologically illustrate what is logically contradictory, not what is ethical, which for Hegel is why the Categorical Imperative seems to allow as morally valid some fairly bizarre maxims such as \"Everyone except me should be treated as a means rather than as an end.\" Otherwise, most criticisms of Kant's ethics more fundamentally attack his Platonic emphasis on reason as the ultimate arbiter of morality, which is of course itself dependent on the belief that morality is a static, rational phenomena describable in terms of absolutes not unlike the laws of physics. The list of philosophers, social scientists, and other thinkers who have come to disagree with this characterization of morality is a long one and includes Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Sartre, Wittgenstein, Ruth Benedict, and many others.  Among these thinkers, even those who might not identify as moral relativists, there is a mistrust of morality as a phenomenon with a wholly rational basis. Nietzsche and Wittgenstein, for example, both picture morality as being a kind of aesthetic, or at least like aesthetics: judgment is involved, but judgments in ethics and aesthetics may not be wholly rational and in any case do not generally proceed from rigid starting principles or laws and are not reducible to any such laws. Thus, while it is possible to evaluate morality, it is not possible to prescribe it on any completely objective basis. For Nietzsche, the basis of a given set of morals is genealogical rather than transcendental in nature: morals have histories and stand in relation to the societies from which they spring, and it is in this way that they derive their force and normative power--not from being somehow imprinted in the stars, as Nietzsche says Kant would have it.

            "answer_text": "From Hegel: If there is a transcendental noumenal world to which we can have no access whatsoever, but which somehow underlies the world as it appears, then how do we even know that it exists? Hegel concluded that the phenomenal world was the real, and only, world.Hannah Arendt takes up this discussion in Life of the Mind, which begins with the conclusion that everything that appears is meant to appear because \"The mind, no less than the senses, in its search -Hegel's Ansttengung des Begriffs - expects that something will appear to it\". What do we do with scientific instruments, and dissections, other than to force things into appearance which previously did not appear. When we force things, such as electrons into appearance we not only prove, to some extent, that there is noumenal \"world\", we also reinforce the separation of the noumenal and the phenomenal, because what we see with scientific instrumentation is actually phenomenal, we never see the electron itself. Additionally, and perhaps this clarifies both Kant and Hegel, is that what is real is what appears, appearance is existence according to Kant and Hegel, but where Kant goes wrong is his insistence that the noumenal world is more real than emergent reality.
