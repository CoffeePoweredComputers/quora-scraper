            "answer_text": "The word \u201cmetaphysics\u201d means literally \u201cbeyond the physical\u201d. Metaphysics goes back thousands of years, back at least as far as the ancient Greeks in the West, and similarly around the world. The pre-Socratic philosophers sought to identify substance (literally \u201cthat which stands under\u201d), an unchanging reality that went beyond the superficial and changing appearances of the physical world. Plato focused on the soul and the intelligible world of eternal Ideas and Ideals (eidos), beyond the world of the 5 senses. Aristotle called metaphysics the study of being qua being, the nature of being itself. Metaphysics is closely related to ontology, which answers the questions \u201cwhat is there?\u201d, \u201cwhat exists?\u201d, \u201cwhat is real?\u201d. Metaphysics is ancient and foundational. You could even call it \u201cradical\u201d in the literal sense of radix as root, also in the popular sense of radical as shocking and disruptive of the status quo. Therefore, I\u2019m not sure in what sense one might call metaphysics \u201cadvanced philosophy\u201d. Popular metaphysics in more recent times dates and derives from the American transcendentalists, e.g. Ralph Waldo Emerson, through revivals and spiritualism of the late 1800s to early 1900s, to the New Thought religions (Unity School of Christianity, Science of Mind, Religious Science) introduced in the early 1900s, to a fascination with Eastern religions and philosophy, many schools of intuitive unfoldment and personal transformation since the mid 1950s, Paul Tillich\u2019s focus on God as \u201cthe ground of Being\u201d in mid-20th century, to the revolutionary ideas and culture of the1960s, to \u201contological design\u201d-type colloquia, to the current wave of interest in Ascension and multi-dimensional realities and presence. Those are a few highlights that come to mind. Popular metaphysics at what I call the \u201cstreet\u201d level has been bastardized and watered down in service of ego, reassurances, worldly ambitions, and sensationalism, all of which you can find online, in bookstores, and metaphysical groups worldwide. There are degrees of seriousness and rigor across the different expressions of metaphysics \u2014 from the academic and religious, to superficial and cliche\u2019 street metaphysics, and everything in between. The upside to much of street metaphysics is that what its followers lack in academic rigor and spiritual discernment, many of them make up for that in heart and compassion. Ancient metaphysics and popular metaphysics may not look much like each other, but they\u2019re related. Both academic and popular metaphysics are about ultimate reality beyond the physical and the five senses. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cAdvanced\u201d ? Metaphysics is the highest branch of Philosopy. There are good metaphysicians and bad metaphysicians. I would consider a good metaphysician intellectually advanced. But what distinguishes a good metaphysician from a bad metaphysician ? This is for you to decide. The reality is that Reality itself is a metaphysical concept. What is reality? If you know, please inform us so we can quit doing Science and Philosopy. In 2012, Tom Sietas set a new world record for holding his breath under water (22 minutes and 22 seconds). Some people have claimed times of over 24 minutes. Would you agree that these people have advanced technique over other swimmers to some extent or another? By way of analogy, metaphysicians are those who can hold their breath much longer than the average bear. Metaphysicians can penetrate the surface water of mere appearance and swim to deeper depths of reality and explore the metaphysical under-structure of reality itself to some extent or another. You can consider it advanced if you wish but it is simply the deeper knowledge of the field in general just like any other professional field of knowledge is a deeper understanding of the field in general. Metaphysicians penetrate reality in order to comprehend the metaphysical under-structure of things in general. Before Man went to the moon , he had to do so metaphysically via the mind. Man had to theorize and experiment within his own metaphysical mind before the actual reality of landing on the moon was possible. The mind itself is metaphysical in nature. All perception is a metaphysical abstraction of mind. Man is a boiled frog metaphysician to some extent or another. At least most men are. Man is a natural born metaphysician by default of the metaphysical nature of reality itself. The universe is the metaphysical given and, metaphorically speaking, it's turtles all the way down. The fact is that we have no choice but to philosophize and presuppose something about the nature of reality and existence itself. We all beg the question of reality itself. All worldviews have no choice but to beg the question of reality and hold to some metaphysical narrative concerning things believed about existence itself. For the purpose of sanity, God had to create reality with a natural appearance. Man has to have the appearance of a stable environment. But what happens when you put any piece of matter under a microscope? It ultimately disappears into nothingness. Quantum Physics was forced into Science because Newtonian physics could not account for what science was finding at the micro level. The quantum world is a garden of metaphysical theoretics. God has been speaking to Man via religion and Philosopy for thosands of years. Heraclitus, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle speak volumes to this very day. But Man has been blinded and deceived by a multitude of modern conveniences. Mans progress is, ironically, his own curse to some extent or another. We have entertained ourselves into a blind stupor and the life of mind is like an incomprehensible foreign language to many. And the reality is that there is much foolishness in academia today which is the result of the metaphysical confusion within postmodernism. The problem with philosophy is autonomous thinking in general. Autonomous thinking will never transcend the infinite gorge of metaphysics. This is humanly impossible. No matter what Science or any other fields of knowledge ever discover, you cannot outstrip the theoretics in any realm of thought or fields of knowledge whatsoever. Hence, metaphysics is an eternal science simply because the universal onion only gets bigger with each new discovery. For every layer of the universal onion that Man pulls back in discovery, ten new layers spring up with even more philosophical questions to be resolved. The only thing we actually find behind the universal onion is more onion. Ultimate Reality belongs to God alone and always will. For God alone is ultimate reality and all else is created. The only escape from the metaphysical abyss of speculation is if there is any truth to the reality of Divine revelation. Apart from the reality of God, Man is left to the metaphysical abyss of his own imagination. There is no escape from this reality. There is no escape from the metaphysical abyss apart from the reality of God. Metaphysics is the eternal albatross locked round the neck of Philosopy. And the blind metaphysics of Man will ultimately lead to his own destruction. Simple history and especially the history of war and politics reveals this. Much more to this but you would do well to contemplate it further. The metaphysical waters run deep and wide. We have no choice but to swim the metaphysical waters of reality, existence and our own human experience of being in the world. May we all learn to swim well or pay a heavy price for our ignorance.
