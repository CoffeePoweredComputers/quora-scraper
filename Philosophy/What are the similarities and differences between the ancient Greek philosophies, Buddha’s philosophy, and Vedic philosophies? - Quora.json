            "answer_text": "This is going to be quite long considering the nature of your question so bear with me. It's known that the contact between both of these cultures were seemingly none up until the conquest of Alexander the great but still the PARALLELS between Greek and Indian cultures were evident even back to the Pre-Socratics days; be it in literature, mythology, and philosophy and so on. This has been stressed often since the days of English philologist Sir William Jones, who drew an elaborate and forced comparison between the Indian philosophical systems and their supposed counterparts in the Greek schools. Sir William Jones, Works, Vol I (London: for JohnStockdale, 1807) ,pp.360-361. Jones compares: Gautama (logician) with Aristotle, Kanada with Thales, Jaimini with Socrates, Vyasa with Plato, Kapila with Pythagoras, and Patanjali with Zeno. Recent scholars have restated some of the evidence as well, notably S. Radhakrishnan, and attention is being increasingly directed to the channels by which Indian influence reached Greece and vice-versa. There seems to have been an early and common stock of primitive beliefs about the heavenly bodies and the face of Nature generally in both of cultures. For example, in the Aitareya Brahmana there is a passage describing the nocturnal journey of the Sun back to its starring point, which may contain in primitive form the legend which appears in the works of Stesichorus and Mimnermus, of the Sun's traveling over the ocean in a cup. Mimnermus says: \"For a delightful hollow couch bears him over the wave, a couch forged by the hand of Hephaestus, made of precious gold, winged, which bears him sleeping over the water's surface, hurrying him back from the land of the Hesperides to the land of the Ethiopians.\" Here historians say that by\"couch\" Mimnermus meant cup. Another minor but interesting coincidence is that while India had Saptarishi roughly meaning seven sages, and there were Seven Sages of Greece too, of which Thales of Miletus were one of its sages. And it's likely they existed almost in same time period. In both Greek and Hindu poetry, rivers are constantly personified as gods, and the form of sacrifice. Prescribed in the Rigveda is very similar to the simple ritual of Homer-prayer, sprinkling of grain, burnt offering, tasting of flesh, and dedication to the gods. 'These agreements,\" writes Radhakrishnan, \"indicate that the two peoples must have been in contact at some early period, but neither possessed any recollection of those times and they met as strangers within the Persian Empire.\" In dealing with pre-Socratic thought, we constantly find ourselves in an atmosphere more akin to that of the Orient than to that of the West. As few historians have pointed out, the apeiron of Anaximander is almost exactly the Hindu nirvikalpa, the nameless and formless, called Aditi, the unlimited, in the Rigveda. Moreover,this Aditi which is nirvi-kalpa, is ordered by the immanent. Just as in Anaximander an immanent dike ensures that all things shall eventually return to the apeiron whence they came: \"From which all things take their rise, and by necessity they are destroyed into these; for all things render just atonement to one another for their injustice according to the due ordering of time.\" In the more imaginative view of the Upanisads, we find that a personal god, Prajapati (\"lord of creatures\"), draws forth from himself all existing things, or, in mother passage, divides himself into male and female and produce all creatures by this self-division. One might adduce here the similar Chinese doctrine of Yin and yang, the principles of expansion and contraction by which the world is formed from chaos. Empedocles stems to be expressing similar idea or, rather, combining it wth the equally ancient doctrine of primordial strife, also found in the Upanisads: \u201cI will tell you a twofold truth: at one time it increased so as to be one out of many and at another it parted so as to produce many from one. For twofold is the creation of mortals and twofold their decline. The union of all things causes the birth and destruction of the one, and the other is nurtured and flies asunder as the elements grow apart. And then elements never cease to be continually exchanged coming together at times under the influence of love so as to become one, and being separated at other times through the force of strife.\u201d Heraclitus shares two fundamental doctrines with 'the early schools of Buddhism- That fire is the primary element andthat all things are momentary and pass away.It seems almost too great a coincidence to imagine that two such striking and radical doctrines should have arisen independently in two places at about the same time. Here the confusion of Indian chronology and the obscurity surrounding the life of Heraclitus are great obstacles, but it is quite certain that the floruit of the Buddha was in the latter part of the sixth century, and that he adopted many ideas from earlier schools. Traces of the belief in fire as the primordial element occur as early as the Rigveda, and are treated philosophically in the Upanisads. The Buddha, like Heraclitus, chooses fire as the most mutable of the elements to represent his metaphysical principle of becoming, and has a long discourse in which he compares the existence of beings to the candle flame that is renewed every instant. Here one thinks of Empedocles: \"Hear now how fire when separated sent up the night-produced shoots of men and lamenting women,\" and of Heraclitus: \"No god nor man ever created this world which is the same for all, but it was and is and ever will be everlasting fire.\" Again, the Buddha uses in the same discourse the analogy of the river which is never the same for two moments but is sustained by ever-new waters, a sentiment echoed in Hetaclitus, \"Ever different is the water for those who step into the same rivers,\" and by the famous saying quoted by Aristotle, \"It is not possible to step into the same river twice.\" Probably refers to the same belief in the momentariness of existence, \"The sun... is new every day.\" For the Buddha, the fundamental principle of existence was the immutable dharma (law) which decreed that every smallest action and word earned its reward, not an ounce more or less. This principle obviously dates back to the Upanisads or earlier, but the Buddha was the first to enthrone it as the ruling power in the universe, a universe completely free from the tyranny of gods. Heraclitus may be thinking of dharma in : \"So we must follow the common principle, for that is shared by all,\" for obviously this common principle must be a universal law. We meet it again in: \"For wisdom consists in one thing, to know the principle by which all things are steered through allthings\" (or \"on alI occasions\"). These opinions of Heraclitus are expressed in short, pithy, and difficult sayings which remind us very much of sutras. The epistemology of Empedocles presents several features which resemble those to be found in the Upanisads or in the various Hindu systems. For instance, according to the Samkhya doctrine, the world as the object of perception has the five tanmatras (roughly, \"subtle elements\") , and each of these is perceived by something corresponding to it in ourselves. Which is Empedocles' own doctrine as well, he being in fact the first Greek to propound a thorough theory of sense perception: \"For by earth we perceive earth, by water water, by air divine air and by fire destructive fire.\" Anyone who studies the Vedic theories of perception and cognition as set forth in the Nyaya, Vaisheshika, and Samkhya systems and then turns to the fragments of Empedocles cannot help but be struck by the overwhelming similarity of their theories. Empedocles is keenly aware of a sort of \"fall of man\" and affects to remember past births as plant and animal, boy and girl. From which he is now in exile, the way by which the original bliss may be gained, is by asceticism, the Hindu method. He advises meditation, for by this means all truth shall be revealed and even supernormal powers attained. In the end, the soul of the righteous ascetic regains its divinity--a counterpart of the Hindu belief in reincarnation and Moksha. See, in particular, Empedocles,: \"At the end they became seers and bards and chiefs and physicians among mortal men, and finally they blossom forth as gods highest in honor.\" There may even be an echo of the monism of the Upanisads in Empedocles, which, like many other features of his philosophy, seems to have been mediated through Orphism. In the Upanisad I.7 we find a list of the qualities of the One, which has resemblances to of Empedocles as quoted above.  A distinct tradition of mysticism runs through Orphism, Pythagoras, and Plato which is as unlike anything in Greek thought as it is like the Hindu mysticism of the Upanisads. There is a distinct break with rationalist humanism and with the healthy unreflecting extraversion of the seventh and sixth centuries. we have a complete shifting of emphasis from the physical to the spiritual, from the temporal to the eternal. Reality is not now what is perceived by the senses but what lies beyond them. The soul or consciousness lives an independent life and is in itself the only true reality. Orphism and Hinduism have much in common. Just as the brahmins kept the belief of the shamans or medicine men of the Vedas that man could become a god, but attempted to achieve this union not by drinking the intoxicating soma but by abstinence and ascetic practices, so Orpheus purified the old Dionysiac religion and substituted asceticism for drunkenness. The aim of Orphism seems to be the liberation of the soul from the chains of the body, and this is to be achieved by asceticism alone, but man must pass through many lives before he achieves final freedom. This is very far, indeed, from genuine Greek religion of any period, but almost exactly the predominant view of the Upanisads. Even the metaphors in which this conception is clothed are the stock Hindu and Buddhist metaphors-the wheel of life in the Upanisads, appears as the \"sorrowful weary wheel\" of Orpheus. It has been remarked that the aim of Orphism, the realization by man of his identity with God,would have appeared blasphemous insolence to a sixth-century Athenian. In the details of Orphic abstinence we again come across familiar practice. The avoidance of flesh and fish is due to the doctrine of transmigration, and in the Orphic abstinence from animal sacrifice there seem to be traces of the primitive taboo which, according to the latest evidence, gave rise to the caste system and to the doctrine of ahimsa (non-injury or reverence for life). Indeed, it is a striking feature of Orphism that it inculcates friendliness to all creatures and not humans alone. Again, the Orphic cosmogony is different from that of Homer and Hesiod. Instead of having Ocean as the origin of all things, we have a world-egg an idea common in the Vedas; we also have the soul's journey after death toward final purification. The evidence here is very tentative, since chronology often fails as a guide, but once again the parallels are highly suggestive. In Pythagoras, too, there are many parallels to Hinduism, but the evidence has been differently interpreted by different scholars. All I can attempt is a brief recapitulation of the evidence. A fundamental doctrine was that \"we are strangers in this world and the body is the tomb of the soul, and yet that we are not to escape by self-murder; for we are the chattels of God who is our herdsman, and without his command we have no right to make our escape.\" The belief in transmigration is mistakenly attributed by the Greek historian Herodotus to the Egyptians and was apparently taken over by Pythagoras from an Oriental source; along with this came the prohibition of the slaughter of animals and the vegetarian diet. The doctrine of purification by ascetic practices and by theoria (contemplation) seems familiar. Even the secrecy of the doctrine and the refusal to commit it to writing reminds us of the very meaning of the word \"Upanisad, a \"confidential communication\" And the separation of the disciples into two grades in Pythagoreanism. The mathematikoi (inner circle) and the akousmatikoi (outer ring of listeners), reminds us of the two stages of instruction given by the Upanisads, in the latter of which was found the esoteric doctrine of becoming one with the Supra-sensuous Being imparted by the Brahmin teacher to his pupil-not a sentence of this secret doctrine must be uttered before members of lower castes. Incidentally, bearing in mind these similarities between the Brahmin teaching, Orphism, and Pythagoreanism, one can hardly resist the speculation that in the Upanisads and in the doctrines practices based on them we may have a clue to the Greek mysteries. Did they originally inculcate simply the attainment of immortality by ecstasy in contemplation? It is interesting to find attributed to Pythagoras the distinction of the three lives, the apolaustic, the practical, and the theoretic, used by Aristotle in his Ethics, and the attempt to base these three on the predominance of one or other element in human nature. This is the very core of Hindu speculation on the caste system which bases the rationale for its efficacy on the correspondence of the three castes to the three constituents of the human soul, sattva (that which gives the highest bliss),rajas (that which impels to activity), andtamas (the earthly, represented by the appetites). No one can read any of Plato's dialogues without being struck by his frequent stress on the complete independence of soul and body and his equally significant insistence on the fact that the soul does not come into its own until the body is quiescent. His view of reality is not the ordinary Greek view; the philosopher has supersensual vision and recalls the heavenly vision of former innocence when it was itself pure and not enshrined in the living tomb of the body, like an oyster in the shell. The soul becomes truly itself only when it is troubled by no pain or pleasure, but is in so far as possible alone and takes leave of the body; for when it avoids contact with the body it can reach out toward reality and attain truth. Having attained this transcendent calm, it dwells immortal and changeless, having ceased from its long cycle of wanderings; thus the truth is always in our soul, which is immortal and has been reborn many times. So, according to Plato, concrete existence is a phantom of reality, and the ordinary man is not truly awake but is like a somnambulist in pursuit of phantoms. We also have the tremendous simile of the cave in the Republic, which is a pictorial form of the Hindu doctrine of Maya (illusion), though in the dualistic system such as in the Plato's cave, the idea of maya is replaced by that of mere Appearance. As in the Upanisads, we find in Plato the Absolute Principle, which appears as the Idea of the Good in the Republic, and as the Demiurgus the personal God and creator of soul of the universe, in the Timaeus, and these two ideas exist side by side. Again, in the Republic we find the principles of logistikon (reason), thymos (spirit), epithymia (appetite), as the basis of the whole structure, and these are bodied forth in the clams of society which are worked out with a rigidity that cannot fail to remind us of the Indian caste system. There the Brahmins, or priest, were supreme, by virtue, curiously enough, of their possessing magic formulae which enabled them to achieve union with the Absolute, but originally their hid strict duties to other class. Being enlightened, more was asked of them and they were expected to give guidance in all ranches of life. Then came the kshatriyas (warriors), then the Vaishya (businessmen), and finally the shudras (artisans). Of course, Plato had no room for outcastes but he keeps the order of precedence of philosopher, warrior, and artisan. In the Republic, as in Hindu society, caste and class are rigid--it was difficult for the Greek and impossible for the Hindu to change from one to another. In the Republic the guardians perch uneasily on their pinnacles, fenced round by diverse prohibitions, and it would explain a good deal of the artificiality of the fourth book if Plato were trying to introduce a form of caste system about which he had probably heard or read. Perhaps, the Hindu caste system originally came into being for the reasons which Plato professes, namely, stability and eugenics. Thus, it was natural that for Plato as for the Brahmins, philosophy should be a mediation on death, and the trial of Socrates is, of course, ideal for the communication of this conviction. It is strongest in the Phaedo, as for example: \u201cIt seems to be that they who are the true votaries of knowledge have escaped the notice of the rest, namely, that they practice nothing else but how to die or meet death.\u201d Pure knowledge is held to be the exclusive trait of those who have passed beyond this life: \"If pure knowledge is not possible in the body, then one of two things follows, either knowledge is not to be obtained at all, or, if at all, after death.\" It is thinking of this kind which leads, on the one hand, to the nihilism of the Buddhists and, on the other, to the theory of relative states of reality, which Plato share with the loftiest Hindu thought. In common with Indian philosophers, he is unable to give any consistent account of how the universal is embodied in the particular. This very deficiency is one of the most striking resemblances between Plato and Hinduism. Hindu philosophy is absorbed in the relative reality of various states of consciousness. First comes dreamless sleep which approaches nearest to nirvana, then sleep itself, and then the waking state, but the Upanisads refuse to ascribe more than a relative reality even to waking consciousness, for who knows when it may be sublated into something which has been the same relation to it as it does to dreams? Hence, their important doctrine of maya (illusion). We find this in the Theaetetus: \"Nay, I go further, and say that if we are half of our lives asleep, and the other half awake, in each of these periods our minds are convinced that whatever opinions present themselves to us, these are really and certainly true; so we insist on the truth of both alike.\"  These coincidences of thought and language, each small in itself, amount to quite a formidable total. As to the problem of the way by which Indian influence reached Greece I have no new solution to offer and fall back with others on Persia as the intermediary. Of course, after the time of Alexander the way lay so open to Oriental influence that parallels become much more frequent and less remarkable. I've drawn my examples largely from those Upanisads which Hindu scholars agree in considering the earliest and which must have been in existence before the fifth century BCE, as they are quoted in writing demonstrably of that date or earlier.
