            "answer_text": "Whatever its flavor\u2014liberal, conservative, moderate\u2014contemporary Christianity has been changed by exposure to Taoism and other eastern religions. No church, at least in this country, can escape the influence of the 19th C transcendentalists and their heirs, who, in turn, reflected certain tendencies of Eastern thought. Mainline protestant religions are occasionally upfront about their debt, just as conservative groups are upfront about their resistance. Emerson and Co. rarefied the Christian pilgrimage, purging it of what few icons Protestantism had preserved. They streamlined the pilgrimage, removing all characters and events except the Individual\u2019s enlightening and transforming encounter with Infinity. Whatever church a person attends, I would argue that in mainstream American life, a generic romantic transcendence, connecting Universe and Individual in love and truth, and returning the individual to the person he was \u201ccreated to be,\u201d remains the omega point of spiritual progress. Some fairly liberal Christians practice a religion which even more closely resembles Taoism than it does older, more myth-embroidered forms of Christianity. Such a Christian, who can also be called a Unitarian, would view the Bible and most dogmas of the church as a catalog of symbols and guideposts which, like anything else in the world, has the power to place a person on the right path. The church exists to interpret nature in religious terms\u2014just as all people do. The orthodox story of salvation, with its stained-glass imagery Moses parting the Red Sea and of Jesus harrowing hell and triumphing over death\u2014this would provide the Taoist Christian more use as a parable than as a historical account. More conservative American Christians, though they might admit resemblance between the Taoism and Christianity, they nevertheless approach Christianity with a narrow biblical historicism that can seem either naive or insincere. For instance, though they might admit an analogue between God\u2019s Sovereignty and the Tao; or between Grace without Works and the Wu Wei, the sensibility remains quite different. The traditional Christian is imaginative without suspending disbelief but by being faithful. What he or she imagines is a dynamic relationship with a personal God; a dynamism, pictured in terms of many generations who live and die under the protection of a God; who know God\u2019s love, God\u2019s anger, God\u2019s punishment, God\u2019s intercessory sacrifice, just as they would know a family member\u2019s. Christians worship a God who can be incarnated as an individual and who existed as a man; they believe in bodily resurrection; of Jesus Christ eats a cheeseburger, his breath smells like onions. God is not merely a disembodied ground; God is personal (and you might say anthropomorphic). In effect, Christians pray\u2014converse with God\u2014rather than meditate. They aren\u2019t just the universe listening to itself, they\u2019re individual prophets talking with an individual God. This individuality is important\u2014it persists into an afterlife. And the Christian imagination, though it recognizes the parabolic function of scripture, is also literal and historical: if it were not, God and Jesus would lose some of their peculiar vividness and become merely the shimmering \u201cLife\u201d of transcendental mysticism. By embracing the miraculous, Christians hold on to a primitive, and disreputable, vitality; and at the same time, by admitting the difference between miracles and nature, can call themselves modern. When we speak of Christian \u201cRealism,\u201d we still mean a Christianity that retains a belief in the miraculous, but that copes with the miraculous through parodox: \u201cThe cross appears foolish to the wise, but to us it is the power of God.\u201d Eastern Christians, who have for a long time practiced Hesychasm and embraced a more full-fledged platonism than western churches, perhaps resemble Taoists more closely than western Christians. But everywhere in Christianity, all gradations of influence by Taoism. ",
