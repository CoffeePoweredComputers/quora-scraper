            "answer_text": "You\u2019re using technical terms in their everyday sense, and that\u2019s where the confusion is coming from. The phrase \u201cSomeone to observe\u201d, makes me think that you think that quantum mechanics cares about consciousness to \u201cmake an observation\u201d. It doesn\u2019t. Particles observe each other all the time with no scientist watching. So events can totally unfold with \u201cno one observing\u201d, but less so with \u201cnothing observing\u201d. Time, though is an illusion. There is 4 dimensional extent; that\u2019s real. But the notion that the future doesn\u2019t exist, and springs into being from nothing moment by moment is false. Our sense of the \u201cFlow of time\u201d is an evolutionary adaptation. It\u2019s like the tree falling in the woods. You can bet that it produces a shock wave in the air (a real phenomenon, just like 4D extent), but without an animal it will in fact not produce a sound (a perception, like the passage of time). So now you get to pick your definitions, and thereby your own answer! ",

            "answer_text": "The correct answer is, \u201cno\u201d. Time is not a \u201cthing\u201d in the sense that we normally think of time. Time is a construct, a concept, that allows us to understand the changing of the universe. We know that \u201ctime\u201d has passed because we can deduce the past, but if there is no one to observe \u201ctime\u201d passing, then the construct of \u201ctime\u201d does not exist, and therefore it cannot pass. That being said, in the scientific sense, there really isn\u2019t any \u201ctime\u201d to begin with - there is only \u201cspacetime\u201d. So in that sense, yes, the universe could could go on changing and entropy could go on growing, with or without an observer - but the concept of time as we think of it would be irrelevant, without minds.

It is a silly theory, but it allows for one to present the idea that 13.6 Billions years of evidence could be created at an arbitrary instant called last Thursday and we would never know the difference. Here is one screwy example of this theory, www The Church of Last-Thursday. ",

            "answer_text": "As an astronomer, I assure you that we can see back in time - when the Universe was 380,000 years old, it emitted CMB. And we can construct its history from that era to present with great accuracy. (In fact, we can go much further back, to 1 second since the Universe was created.) This is because of the fact that light takes certain time to reach to travel. The Universe is homogeneous and isotropic - meaning it looks same at every direction, and no place is special. However, Universe looked different when it was younger. You go 12 billion years ago, and there are almost no galaxy. The metallicity of these galaxies is also different compared to the current ones.
