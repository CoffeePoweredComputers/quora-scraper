            "answer_text": "phrases like \u201cI want, I will\u201d are phrases of desire, we all have them, they are one of the most intrinsic motivators if not THE motivator for the human species. if we have no wants, no dreams, no I wills, well, we end up just sitting waiting for death, ask yourself if that is the Buddhist way? to me, nope. and remember, when talking Buddhism we are talking about an ancient tradition. what bhudism, and by extent, pshychology is really about is understanding ourselfs, our stressors and what is getting in the way of moving forward with life. the simpler the desire the better. the flip side, or the updated version in my eyes is stuff we have. all the stuff we have like \u201cI have this computer, I have this phone, I have this and this and this and this and this and this\u201d all occupy parts of our brain, and a lot can clog the system rather fast.. it\u2019s best to know the self, or who you are as apposed to who I am and your own \u201cstuff\u201d you own and possess. this can be as simple as making sure everything I own operates smoothly, all the batteries are fully charged at all times, everything has a place(there is a fantastic book called getting things done), the bed is used for sleeping, the computer is used for working and video games, make sure the phone is charged at all times, the reason is because we don\u2019t have any cognitive strain on \u201cwere did I put that, were is this, oh I forgot to do that\u201d, however, knowing who we are is the best. the problem with desire that we don\u2019t know we want is the desire we don\u2019t know we want might not actually have anything to do with us making sure what we have fits ourselfs and our own desires and pure pursuits. such as, I\u2019m a photographer and need to make a website, if I wasn\u2019t a photographer their would be no reason to make a website. a desire could be to make a website but for what purpose? if it doesn\u2019t fit the reason for having a thing for ourselfs, then we should let go as to not clog up space in our mind. this goes for all household clutter. if your like me you have a basement that is full of stuff from the past, one of my \u201cI will\u2019s\u201d that has been in the back of my mind for near 20 years is cleaning that place up, for 20 years I\u2019ve had a cognitive load I didn\u2019t know I had until I started cleaning, just 4 days in and I feel so much lighter on my feet.

            "answer_text": "In a way that is correct. Not all desire are bad. If you are in a burning building and you desire to get out, I do not think that the Universe will take it against you who is just wanting to survive. Desire is Form. Form is an aggregate to attachment. Attachment leads to Suffering. Suffering leads to more causes of suffering. Desire to be free is not Form it is an Aspiration. The Foundation of Wisdom is adhesion to common sense. Not your sense. Not my sense. But Common sense. Common denotes setting an idea against accepted norms or general accepted statute of order and propriety. With this you should use Malice as standard to peg your Desire against, and see if such Desire is malicious. The whole Universe is created by Consciousness. You are also Conscious of all things Consciousness created. All creation responded to Consciouness hence created. What make you think Universe cannot be smart to realize your heart's truest Desire?
