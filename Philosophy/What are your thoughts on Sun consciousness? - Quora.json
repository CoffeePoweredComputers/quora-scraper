            "answer_text": "The sun is not a huge hydrogen bomb. It is not nuclear explosions which drives the sun. Who claims this oversimplify a complex construct of electrodynamics and plasma. Nuclear fusion is inside the sun \u201cjust a byproduct\u201d. The real process is electrical in its nature and not yet fully understood.The sun recycles most of its own material.Instead of burning all of its \u201cfuel\u201d, the sun seems to collect energy from huge \u201celectric rivers\u201d. It seems to work as a collector (or capacitor) of energy instead of just a battery that consumes its energy.Solar bursts seems not to be random. The burst is electrodynamic. Watch how it looks when a solar flare comes out of the sun. The exit points opens and close accordingly, like a rocket engine controls its own output and vector. Rupert Sheldrake has made a good point: if the sun is able to control its trajectory by controlled solar flares, this invalidates the dark matter hypothesis.There is a untold war going on between materialism (consciousness is only a epiphenomena and free will an illusion) and idealism (consciousness as foundation of physical reality). This shapes cosmology and makes it the playground for the worldview games. Every paradigm is based on cosmology, what we can observe and predict. Despite their many fails materialism is still mainstream, but it lose territory every day. Theories like that of Sheldrake are indeed more inclined towards idealism, but he miss the point of idealism and base instead his theories on pantheism. Personally I prefer Bernardo Kastrup\u2019s explanations of pure idealism, though Sheldrake seems to have understood some of the nonlocal and immaterial mechanisms and his morphic resonance theory is based on the \u201csimilar principle\u201d (see also homeopathy and memory of water).I don\u2019t believe the Sun has a \u201creal consciousness\u201d. It is only a construct inside the collective consciousness, representing a physical counterpart of something bigger. God is still the one consciousness which is bigger than even heavenly heavens. He knows every star by name.Economics and politics shape scientific paradigms. Once global economy is collapsed, real science will get a updraft.",

            "answer_text": "Friends, In cosmic context,in reference to our solar system,where our earth is member to family,our sun is most conscious cosmic body. As a man on earth,what we know about sun is just outermost physical aspect of sun and that is too,not in toto,as,our pat dog can't know his master -a conscious gigantic being. Under influence of consciousness of sun,its all family members i.e.all planets,including our earth and its moon too,have came into existence and go on growing,to be like sun-to be conscious as sun is. A man is made like self developing organism/being as he has consciousness which can exert freedom/freewill ,whether to grow further in his own individual consciousness to be like sun or not. Sun consciousness bears mystery of creation-creation on mega scale,as,consciousness gets transformed into something called psychic thing which in turns into physical things on quantum scale,in forms of energy particles and interaction between particles. Same phenomenon of creation is viewed in a man,on microsome level,where,consciousness of a man gives birth to thoughts-psychic stuff-which in turn,creates something called physical things,in association with consciousness of sun. This is how,sun is worshipped for its conscious by men since ancient age. Consciousness of a man gets pulled by consciousness of sun,called Saturn movements and psychic stuff-mind-of a man gets pulled by moon,called lunar movements. Esoteric science believes that sun is fundamental basis of all its members,including earth and we humans on earth,as,it is consciousness of sun,which is original/fundamental raw for creation. It is somewhat mysterious to know,that,consciousness of sun is responsible for further physical,psychic and conscious growth of all its planets and earth is to grow as like as our todays sun and moon is to grow as like as our today\u2019s earth. All organic lives on earth is used by consciousness of sun/intelligence emerged out of consciousness,and he is only man who has enough growth of his consciousness to have freedom/freewill,to grow further in his own individual consciousness to be like consciousness of sun/to be sun and come out of this gigantic scheme of cosmos. thanks Q guru ",
