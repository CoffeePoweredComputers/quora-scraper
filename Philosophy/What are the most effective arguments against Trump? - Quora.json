            "answer_text": "I don't think there are \"effective\" arguments in the sense that anyone is listening who is already for Trump.  There is a perception about what he will do and the media and many ranters or supporters continue those things.  If, by now, people haven't been convinced, no argument is going to work to change their minds (conventionally). To beat Trump, you have to let all his verbal abuse fall off your back.  Let him make all the claims he wants and just take the ones you need to take to prove a point about him or that supports your narrative.   If he says you are \"playing the woman card\", ask him what he means.  If you want to push that, form the question into rhetoric that he can't win with like \"are you saying that, as a woman, I haven't the same rights as men to be ambitious or to expect equal opportunities and equal pay for equal work?\" If he says \"the Chinese are raping us\" ask if he understands what the term rape means and maybe he can \"explain it to us poor, simple women\", then ask why he uses so much Chinese labor in his clothing line. If he talks about the wall, ask \"so, Donald, how are you going to get enough people to work at the low wages you pay if you cut off immigration?  How do you explain to all the children why you made their parents leave the country?  What will you do with all the children left without family?  Are you going to find a way for Foster Families to take up the slack?  If so, are you going to address the fact that, right now, there are over 100,000 children in the Foster system without a permanent home?\" Ask him direct questions that you've already gotten answers for \"what is your plan for Iran?  I understand you want to take away the agreement we have in place so you can put in sanctions again.  That was mainly what I was doing in my time at State - are you saying you agree with me?\" The only problem with arguing with Trump is he may just whine and not show up at a debate because a strong woman scared him.

            "answer_text": "The ones that I can see as working:  His history busting unions and undermining labor laws. The effects of his numerous bankruptcies on the communities impacted by them.Failures in business. Not being able to control debt. Losing the west side of Manhattan to the Chinese.Corruption in his involvement in the Bridgeport, CT casino development.Offshoring jobs and avoiding taxes.Use of undocumented immigrants in his construction projects, and migrant work visas at his properties. Screwing over disabled veterans by trying to revoke their vendor licenses. Not  donating to 9/11 victims or first responders. Not donating to veterans, including the money collected from the fundraiser on the campaign trail.Paying himself for election expenses. Making money off of his supporters' donations.Failure to release his tax returns. What's he hiding? Refusal to release his college transcripts. What's he hiding?Secretly a Hillary Clinton plant to help her win the election. Donations to Hillary. Public statements supporting Hillary. Basically, use his strengths against him. His followers are largely attracted to conspiracies, and he's painted a very clear picture of what the enemy to the United States looks like. And it looks a lot like him. Just hammer that home until people start to get it. The key is to sustain the attack until the perception starts to spread. The Republicans were trying to be cagey and just hint at things in debates and leave the attacks for advertisements. That's not going to work when Donald is taking up all the free media and can simply deflect the attacks at his leisure. Particularly when he's made \"the media\" an enemy, and so supporters are naturally distrustful of any ads they ma see. Paint him into a corner and don't let up. Demand answers, to his face, in a public setting. And don't let him weasel out of giving them. Fact check him live. Make him explain himself. Hold him accountable.  ",
