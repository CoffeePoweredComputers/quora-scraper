            "answer_text": "Utilitarianism redefines the concept of good and therefore answers a different question to that originally posed.  In effect classical utilitarianism makes good synonymous with happiness.  It leads to the uncomfortable conclusion that if a happiness drug, with minimal side effects, could be discovered, it would be good if everyone took it.  Someone might suppose there might be long term negative effects, but that muddies the water rather than resolves the problem. Negative utilitarianism that aims to minimise harm is more promising.  Whereas it makes sense to ask of something that causes happiness to inquire whether the thing might be good, it hardly makes sense to ask of something that is harmless whether it might be bad.  Rather than tell us what to do, negative utilitarianism tells us what not to do, this could be considered a weakness. Whatever the type of utilitarianism the danger in practice is that it can lead to arguments whereby unpleasant means can be justified in terms of hypothetical ends.  Utilitarianism can provide cover for tyrants. I do not think that Kant ignores what you describe as 'well being', it is simply that he concludes that universal application takes precedence, yet behind this there does seem to be an underlying assumption of moral worth that you could say amounts to a rather metaphysical overall 'well being'.  In any case, I think Kant believes that there has to be some sort of Deity or metaphysical end that holds it all together. Universal application carries a presumption of equality that can never support a tyranny.  The worst that can be said of universal application or the Golden Rule, however it is formulated, is that it is hopelessly idealistic, which is not much of an argument for not aiming in that direction.

Aristotles definition is far better than just physical happiness.Act utilitarianism destroys justice and rights.

That is being honest and maintaining promises and contracts.Rule utilitarianism provides at least some check on issues of justice.",
