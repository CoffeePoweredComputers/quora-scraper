            "answer_text": "Don't change your appearance just because you want to make friends. Remember that all the friends you had in high school abandoned you just because you wouldn't fall in love with a stalker that was two grades below you. Enjoy wearing your studs and being punk rock and just ignore what people think about you.You don\u2019t have to take any type of relationship advice if you don\u2019t want to. Most people aren\u2019t demisexual anyways. In the end, the only thing that matters is how YOU feel about something going on in your relationship.Don\u2019t commit the foolish act of having one night stands if you\u2019re pro-life. It\u2019s the same as bullying someone while telling people that you\u2019re a pacifist.Never stop practicing your boxing skills. One day someone will try to assault you over a little thing. This is the perfect opportunity to let them know they\u2019re not as valuable as they think they are.Always try to find ways to improve yourself. You don\u2019t want to end up living in a desert for your entire life, do you?Never show an ounce of weakness to anybody, especially if they\u2019re paranoid enough to carry a knife with them 24/7.Be kind to people out in public if they return the favor. If they don\u2019t, don\u2019t take it so seriously. You already know that if they decide to practice boxing one day, they\u2019ll cry after the first hour of joining the gym.During an argument, never hold back against someone who you know is incredibly crazy. They won\u2019t.Don\u2019t let people pressure you into thinking a specific way or having certain beliefs about certain situations. Most of those people have an inferiority complex anyways.Don\u2019t feel bad for people who expect respect just because something bad happened to them, like being forced to exercise.Never let anyone make you flinch. Everyone\u2019s a crybaby deep inside their subconscious.Stop thinking so much before saying what you think. There\u2019s no kind way of saying \u201cwomen who have abortions are murderers\u201d, or, \u201cTrump supporters also support incest because Trump molests his daughter\u201d.Save the planet as much as you can.For the love of God, stop hesitating to press the \u201cSubmit\u201d button.Write more answers on Quora.",

            "answer_text": "To me, being a man means being a gentleman. All gentlemen are men, but not all men are gentlemen. Keeping the above in mind, here are my 10 laws of manhood (in no particular order). Always send a thank you card when you receive a gift or someone does something special for you. - Send the card out quickly, within 24 hours of the kind act or gift. Include a handwritten note. Never post anything negative on social media. - Trashing someone or something in front of others just isn\u2019t classy. While I think of it, just avoid social media altogether. Have a real flesh and blood life. You won\u2019t regret it. Be straightforward in your intentions. - People deserve the truth. Don\u2019t leave people hanging and never selfishly use someone to your benefit. Never blame others for your unhappiness or your failures. - Take ownership of your emotions. You are only as unhappy as you make up your mind to be. If you fail, keep at it until you succeed. If you don\u2019t succeed, maybe what you are trying to do isn\u2019t for you. Adjust course and try something else. Never quit. - Ever. No matter what. We fail when we allow ourselves to. Decide what is important to you and dedicate every fiber of your being to it. Always tip at least 20%. - Your waiter/waitress/barber, etc., they work hard and will appreciate your recognition of their efforts. You don\u2019t need a calculator. Just take 10% of the original bill (tax included) and double it. When in doubt, round up. If you can\u2019t afford it, you shouldn\u2019t be there enjoying that meal or service in the first place. Stand up for what you believe in, and stand up for others if an injustice is being done against them. Develop a firm handshake and look a person in the eye when you are shaking their hand. - You can tell a lot by the way a person shakes your hand. Use your handshake to project the confidence that you feel inside. Don\u2019t drink so much that you get violent or physically ill. - That shows that you lack self-control. You should be well past that stage by now. Realize that every situation does not require an assertive response. - Sometimes it is OK (or appropriate) to be passive and content in the knowledge of your abilities. ",
