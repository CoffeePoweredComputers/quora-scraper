            "answer_text": "Where else would \u201cmeaning\u201d come from? \u201cMeaning\u201d is a word. Words are created tools of thought and communication. Individuals give meanings and usages to words. The more concurrence, specificity, and accuracy in the definitions the clearer the thought and exchange of information possible with the word. For example, \u201ctwo\u201d is quite well defined, \u201clove\u201d isn\u2019t. To answer any question first begins with establishing the meanings of the terms (words often) involved. Secondly, it must be established and agreed on what will be accepted as legitimate evidence to collect for answering the question. Without establishing those two steps, whatever anyone proposes as any answer to any question is open to denial, confusion and distortion. Consider your question. If I said the meaning of your existence was established by \u201cGod\u201d, are you accepting my \u201cword\u201d? What\u2019s the evidence? How do you verify or prove it? How about saying the purpose of a hammer is to pound things. But, I have a special, sentimental hammer I use as a paperweight. The purpose, meanings of the word, design, function and usage is all controlled by me and explanations must be provided to others for clarity, communication,understanding and concurrence. If you pick evidence to establish something that it is impossible to gather or agree upon you can only have agreement through emotions, traditions, and aligning opinions, never incontrovertible \u201cfacts\u201d. So, yes, anyone can impose whatever meaning or meanings on their existence they wish. They are as correct as anyone else is, until, the necessary steps are fulfilled and agreed upon. ",

            "answer_text": "Well sure. It\u2019s what senscience is about. Being self aware. If you are aware of your own conscience, code of ethics, integrity, sense of honor, power, humility,heart and willingness to be open, you give meaning to your own existence. As in, can there be more to me than what I see in the mirror? Noticing who you are in the world gives meaning to your existence. it doesn\u2019t have to be what you do, but how you do and what you notice from it. Also \u201clisten to your universe.\u201d What extra sensory are you aware of and how does it guide you? Saying it just is - is great, but it is often based on knowing what the perimeters are and what your depth is to be in acceptance of yourself and others. Is that meaningful to you? Can it define your existance? Its your life. In the end was it a life well lived? ",
