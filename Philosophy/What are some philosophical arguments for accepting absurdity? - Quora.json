Everyone poops; therefore, everyone is an experienced pooper. Nothing is more absurd than to have to poop waste out of one\u2019s butt; therefore, everyone should be able to agree that humans have learned to accept the absurdity of pooping. It may be the best philosophical argument for accepting absurdity that exists among humans (and, if animals could reason, they would have to agree, too).  ",

This is what\u2019s known as a type of paradox: a seeming contradiction that, upon deeper reflection, turns out to be no contradiction at all. ",
