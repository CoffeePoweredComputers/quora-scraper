            "answer_text": "Donnie Haflich has left a few good ones. One which is missing, in my opinion, is BBC\u2019s In Our Time, hosted by Melvyn Bragg. Its episodes discuss the key ideas and key thinkers in the domains of philosophy, history, science, culture, and religion. Each episode is carefully directed by Bragg to ensure his guests (who are usually professors in the relevant subject) don\u2019t go off on tangents or lose the viewer\u2019s interest; no programme is more than 45 minutes. For that reason I find In Our Time to have more serious, enjoyable, and informative discussions than Partially Examined Life (although I still really enjoy the latter). ",
