There is no way to causally link two indeterminate processes without compromising the indeterminacy of one of them. A coincidence of indeterminacies is the most you could hope to prove, but prove how? As the philosopher Richard Double put it: \u201cThe question of why quantum indeterminacies should occur just when we manifest libertarian free will strikes me as unanswerable.\u201d ",
