            "answer_text": "Hardly accurate. Let\u2019s break this down. The Satanic Bible has nothing to do with atheism. Atheists do not believe in God or Satan or any other deity. Atheists don\u2019t have a \u201cbible\u201d or adhere to a mythological belief system as Christians, Satanists and other religions do. Frankly, atheists find believing in invisible, all powerful beings with no proof of their existence to be rather silly. God and Satan are no more real than Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy (I welcome any evidence to the contrary). That being said, Satanists believe that Satan is just the opposite of God. The anti-god if you will. Also, Satanists don\u2019t kill babies or sacrifice humans (that would be Christians, read the Bible). They\u2019ve never started a war over their beliefs (again, that would be Christians, Crusades anyone?). In fact if you actually read the Bible, you will find that Satan himself is only responsible for killing about 8 people whereas God has killed millions. So who\u2019s more benevolent? Nihilism is the denial of, or lack of belief in, the reputedly meaningful aspects of life. Satanists don\u2019t deny science or want their followers to be ignorant sheep. Those are certainly meaningful. In that respect they are the opposite of many Christians. If you want to talk about hedonism, read the Bible. Start with the Song of Solomon. Nietzsche said \u201cGod is dead\u201d. I assume that is why you mentioned him. That is not what Satanists believe. Satanists believe that God exists in the same way that Christians believe Satan exists. Satanists just play for a different team. Finally, the Satanic Bible is not an \u201canti-religion tome\u201d. This is a ridiculous statement since Satanism IS a recognized religion. It is merely another religious tome like the Bible, the Koran or the Tora, all based on mythology. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that is nearly correct. The works of Nietzche in the form that they influenced Satanism, Nazism and the aspects of pop culture that are best left as relics of the past are not the original words of Nietzche. Nietzche\u2019s sister who was friends with Hitler changed some of his manuscripts to be more in line with Nazi ideology. Her brother believed that ideology a problem and that if you tried to reduce the complexities of life down to a single principal it wouldn\u2019t work. One of the documents which inspired the do what thou wilt doctrine, is the Will To Power. Frederich Nietzche wrote this in a delirious state brought on by his crippling illness and trauma related to a failed attempt to woo a woman who didn\u2019t want him. He tried to reduce everything to the concept of Power. He later saw this as a waste of time and energy and used his manuscript as scratchpaper for shopping lists. Here is where his sister got from, and to impress Hitler she changed it significantly. Satanism is basically a live and let live kind of thing if you are talking about the Anton LaVey version. However, it\u2019s a if you try to correct me, even if it is because you care about me then you are my enemy (fittingly Satan means enemy.) It is built around the idea that man is just an animal who can\u2019t control his actions. It is essentially a materialistic and deterministic worldview. Anton\u2019s brother was a gay study scientist and this philosophy is behind the things he published to promote the born this way mantra. ",
