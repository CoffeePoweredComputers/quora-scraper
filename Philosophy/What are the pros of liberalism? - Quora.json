            "answer_text": "Liberalism initially was the philosophy of liberty. It posed the problems and solutions to bring more freedom to a societies members. The US Constitution was the greatest example of liberalism which man has seen. It stated that all men were created with equal rights. The continual implementation of that document would be the truest sense of liberalism. However, the term has been altered and redefined by the progressive \u201cliberals\u201d, which are really communist and socialist ideas. Liberalism is not really a philosophy in itself. In all political systems you will find conservative and liberal views relating to that philosophy. You can find liberal communists and conservative communists. You can find liberal democrats and conservative democrats. As an example, regarding the US Constitution, the original liberals worked to ensure all men had equal rights, including blacks who were held as slaves. The conservatives at that time were those who wanted the laws to stay as they were, maintaining slavery as a legal institution. Today, the conservatives are the ones striving to increase individual freedom for all by maintaining and protecting the constitution while the \u201cliberals\u201d attack and chip away at the Constitution with an end goal that actually will reduce rights for all. Identity politics is a way to target certain groups and reduce their rights, such as \u201cthe rich\u201d. Liberalism is a vital force if it is actually working to enhance and protect the rights of all men, not putting one group or person above any other group or person. Or imposing an impossible \u201cequality\u201d based on what one has. You could also look at it in reverse. Who\u2019s rights are being reduce by the actions of a person or group. Just because a person or group operates under the moniker of Liberalism does not mean they are truly liberals. ",

            "answer_text": "In pretty much every society today, some people are considered inferior to others, and some activities are considered more important than others. Conservatives make a point of preserving these ultimately arbitrary distinctions, and reactionaries usually try to enhance them. This causes the following inefficiencies: Wasted human potential. Because the inferior people are invested in less by society (through education, health care, whatever) and because they are not allowed to rise as high as others (and thus their ideas and abilities may not be allowed to flourish).Resources spent in enforcement of inequality. It takes time, effort, and manpower to enforce laws/customs/agreements that keep certain demographics of people disadvantaged against their wills. Those resources would otherwise get used in another manner in an equal society.Industrial immaturity. Disfavored activities will generally contribute to the economy less since they are kept out of the legitimate business sphere. This tends toward lower productivity, higher graft, and lower investment in making higher quality/margin products.Liberals tend to strive for equity, where people are treated in a manner so that they tend to become more equal over time, and all activities are judged in objective manner and not through the lens of tradition. So, over time, a liberal society naturally minimizes the three inefficiencies above, leading to more self-actualized people, a government apparatus that is streamlined and transparent, and a more diversified and productive economy. While conservative and reactionary societies can pull this off in specific contexts through focused attention, in a liberal society it emerges on its own. ",
