            "answer_text": "Yes it does. True beauty depends on a lot of aspects like inner beauty, natural beauty (that without gobs of makeup) and how one acts. There are a lot of beautiful women on the outside but the insides and the way they act are very ugly. The key is to be true to your inner and outer beauty. Find it in being nice to others, being genuine in your interactions and finding how you are truly beautiful. ",
