            "answer_text": "I would say that it is a skill. First, it is a theory . Once you understand the theory you can begin to use it to identify real life situations in which the theory seems to apply. The more you do this, the easier it becomes for you . You will be able to perceive insights in Social functioning of groups, organizations , etc. In ways others cannot .

None of the prior comments apply to this viewpoint except for Brian Van Dine\u2019s. ",
