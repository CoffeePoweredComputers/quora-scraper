            "answer_text": "The most significant influence is tribalism: my tribe vs rival tribes (the tribe could be political party, ethnic group, nation, religion, sex, or any arbitrary designation of something in common. Next is the person\u2019s fundamental view of humanity: Collectivist or Individualist. In brief, Collectivists consider the group to be of primary importance and individual humans secondary at best, existing to serve the group. The is attitude is probably instinctive and goes back several million years among primates. Tribalism is inherently Collectivist. Individualists consider each human to be equally important, of primary importance, and groups are created by individuals to serve themselves and each other. Individualism rejects tribalism. My experience is that political views are rationally derived from either Collectivism (tribal or non-tribal) or Individualism. ",
