            "answer_text": "Telepathy is possible but it is NOT communication from one mind to another. This is the official scientific position on telepathy, as stated by: John VanValkenburg, answer.. \u201cNo. The human brain does not contain the ability to transmit or receive signals. It does not have the ability to metabolize the amount of energy required.\u201d This view is based on the following assumptions: that materialism is all that there is, that the human is a meat robot, and more generally all life forms are machines, that the mind and consciousness are emergent properties borne out of brain activity and that each person has their own mind, so there are many minds. Telepathy however is a fact. It can be demonstrated unequivocally and has been observed by many billions of people world wide. So how is it that science can discredit it? The answer is that they do experiments based on the assumptions above. For many years they used double blinding in all experiments on telepathy, saying that the experiments had to be double blinded to be scientific. And they have used a well known magician to champion this to the public. This is wrong. Experiments need to be conducted so as to best test the phenomenon, so they need to take care that the right the right conditions apply. Telepathy requires relationship. Okay, so in recent years they have done experiments with relationships, but here again they have monkeyed with the conditions. I explain this further in this answer Kyrani Eade's answer to How has the scientific community reacted to the phenomena of ESP and PK? and show illustrations as to what is involved in telepathy. The reality is that telepathy requires moderately strong to strong relationship. And the reason is because telepathy requires a moderately strong to strong mental entanglement, which arises with strong relationship. When the right conditions applies, telepathy is guaranteed. This is seen most dramatically in foul game play, You can see my video on ESP (telepathy and foul game play in this answer: Kyrani Eade's answer to Why is there no proof of extrasensory perception?) This is something, which everyone should be made aware of, because it can mean the difference between not only being cheated or not, but being mislead as to suffer serious harm or not. And there is independent evidence that there is only One Mind, not many minds. I give the reasons in this answer: Kyrani Eade's answer to Is it true that the only thing that separates mankind is the mind, everything else can be found in a pig or horse? I have link one of my videos,in this answer: Kyrani Eade's answer to How do I prove the existence of people other than myself philosophically? in which I explain how non-locality/ entanglement gives a scientific basis for ESP and telepathy.
