If the situation has to deal with a person, philosophy is used to try to read minds, but I don\u2019t care what anyone is thinking why should I waste energy and time on what they are thinking when I am already experiencing what I\u2019m thinking and what I\u2019m doing and what I\u2019m saying and what I\u2019m going to do. Philosophy in my opinion is an act witchcraft. ",
