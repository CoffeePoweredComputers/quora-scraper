            "answer_text": "Of course, I would say it is one of the most discussed theme in 18th and 19th post-Kantian philosophy and in contemporary philosophy of science. However, \u201cperspective\u201d is a rather vague term. At a general level, I think it can either mean \u201cone\u2019s own subjective experience\u201d or \u201ctheoretical background\u201d. If we are talking about the first of these meanings, Kant is well known for his discussion regarding experience and knowledge in the Critique of Pure Reason. Kant wanted to find a solution to David Hume\u2019s argument regarding causality. According to Hume, causality is not something that exists out there in the world, but rather something that someone infers when two events often coincide. Thus, causality appears to be subjective in nature. How then can knowledge of causal relations (and other aspects of reality) be possible? Kant admits that it is true that what goes around us is conditioned by how we perceive the world, but it is precisely because humans share a universal set of perceptual faculties that objective knowledge of reality is possible. However, according to Kant, we never have knowledge about reality itself. Knowledge is rather defined with respect to the experential perspective humans have on it. I would expect that any epistemologist who followed in Kant\u2019s footsteps in the 18th and 19th century agree to this general idea. If we are talking about the second of these meanings, it is a pretty common theme in 20th century philosophy of science that scientific knowledge is conditioned on some set of theoretical and value-laden assumptions. Thomas Kuhn is well known for his notion of \u201cparadigm\u201d in the Structure of Scientific Revolution, but other names that come to mind are Henri Poincar\u00e9, Willard Van Orman Quine, Bas van Fraassen, Bruno Latour, Helen Longino, and the list could go on. You might also look at papers in feminist epistemology and/or Thomas Nagel\u2019s book named The View From Nowhere (The View From Nowhere: Thomas Nagel: 8601400916162: Books) for discussions around this theme. There might be disagreement regarding how exactly and to what extent a theoretical background affects our knowledge and beliefs regarding reality, but I am under the impression that basically every philosophers of science today agree with the idea that there is an important connection between the two.
