Cynics are the \u2018I\u2019m gonna stop giving a hoot\u2019 folks. Think about the very extreme non-conformist lifestyle Diogenes is said to have taken upon himself, and it made him constantly bitter or reactionary to people with differences. There\u2019s a reason we use \u2018Cynic\u2019 the way we do in the modern. It isn\u2019t an entire distortion of the older meaning. A Stoic would never let themselves get so carried away on account of others. Stoics know they shouldn\u2019t personalize every action of others, and that we are only ultimately each responsible for our own ethics. That is all anyone can be when all is said. ",

            "answer_text": "No. He was a Cynic. Stoicism was, however, heavily influenced by Cynicism, as Zeno of Citium was a Cynic before founding the Stoa and drew heavily on Cynic ethics. Stoic ethics in general might be seen as a moderated version of Cynicism, allowing for preferences among externals where Cynicism permitted no luxury beyond the bare necessities of survival. The Stoics often praised the Cynic lifestyle as \u201cthe short path to virtue\u201d, but did not view it as necessary. Stoic Logic and Physics, on the other hand, are unrelated to Cynicism. All that is to say that Diogenes of Sinope might be seen as in some capacity a forebear of Stoicism, but he was neither a Stoic nor a proto-Stoic. ",
