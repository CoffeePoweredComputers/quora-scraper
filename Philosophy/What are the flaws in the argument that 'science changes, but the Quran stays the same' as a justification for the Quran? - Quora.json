            "answer_text": "Actually none. Check out any scientific information from the Quran for coraboration with known scientific facts and compare it yourself. 9 Astonishing Facts in the Quran that will Amaze You There are many clear signs that the religious book of Islam, the Quran, is the word of God and we have many reasons to support and validate this claim: There are scientific and historical facts found in the Quran which many people were unfamiliar at the time, and have only been discovered recently by contemporary science.The Quran is in a unique style of language that cannot be replicated, this is known as the \u2018Inimitability of the Quran.\u2019There are prophecies made in the Quran and by the Prophet Muhammad Sallalahu Alahi wa Sallam which have been fulfilled.The following are some facts found in the Quran: Origin of LifeWater is essential for all living things. We all know that water is a basic need for life but the Quran makes a very unusual claim: \u201cWe made every living thing from water. Will they not believe?\u201d (Quran 21:30) In this verse(Ayah) water is pointed out as the origin of all life. All living things are made up of cells. We now know that cells are mostly made up of water [1]. For example, 80% of the cytoplasm (basic cell material) of a standard animal cell is described as water in biology textbooks. The fact that living things consist mostly of water was discovered only after the invention of the microscope. In the deserts of Arabia, the last thing someone would have guessed is that all life came from water. IronIron is unnatural to the earth. It did not form on the earth but came down to earth from outer space. This may sound weird but it\u2019s true. Scientists have found that billions of years ago the earth was stuck by meteorites. These meteorites were carrying Iron from distant stars which had exploded. The Quran says the following on the origin of Iron: \u201cWe sent down Iron with its great inherent strength and its many benefits for humankind.\u201d (Quran 57:25) Allah uses the words \u2018sent down\u2019 for Iron. It is evident from the verse(Ayah) that Iron is not an earthly material, but was sent down for the benefit of humankind. The fact that Iron came down to earth from outer space is something which could not be known by the primitive science of the 7th century. Sky\u2019s ProtectionThe sky plays a crucial role in protecting the earth. The sky protects the earth from the lethal rays of the sun. If the sky did not exist, then the sun\u2019s radiation would have killed off all life on earth. It also acts like a blanket wrapped around the earth, to protect it from the freezing cold of space. The temperature just above the sky is approximately -270oC. If this temperature was to reach earth, then the planet would freeze over instantly. The sky also protects life on earth by warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night [3]. These are some of the many protective functions of the sky. The Quran asks us to consider and ponder up on the sky in the following verse (Ayah): \u201cWe made the sky a protective ceiling. And yet they are turning away from Our signs!\u201d (Quran 21:32) The Quran points to the sky\u2019s protection as a sign of Allah. The protective properties of the sky were discovered by scientific research conducted in the 20th century. MountainsThe Quran grabs our attention to a very important characteristic of mountains: \u201cDid We not make the earth a resting place? And the mountains as stakes?\u201d (Quran 78:6-7) The Quran indicates that mountains have deep roots by using the word stakes to describe them. In fact, mountains do have deep roots, and the word stakes is an accurate description for them. A book titled \u2018Earth\u2019 by Geophysicist Frank Press explains that mountains are like stakes, and are buried deep under the surface of the earth. Mount Everest, the height of which is approximately 9 km above ground, has a root deeper than 125 km. The fact that mountains have deep \u2018stake\u2019 like roots was not known, until after the development of the theory of plate tectonics in the beginning of the 20th century. Expansion of the UniverseAt a time when the science of Astronomy was still primitive, the expansion of the universe was described in Quran: \u201cAnd it is We who have built the Universe with [Our creative] power and keep expanding it.\u201d (Quran 51:47) The fact that the universe is expanding was discovered in the last century. The physicist Stephen Hawking in his book \u2018A Brief History of Time\u2019 writes, \u201cThe discovery that the universe is expanding was one of the great intellectual revolutions of the 20th century.\u201d The Quran mentioned the expansion of the universe even before the invention of the telescope! Sun\u2019s OrbitIn 1512 AD the astronomer Nicholas Copernicus put forward his theory that the Sun is motionless at the center of the solar system, and that the planets revolve around it. The belief that the Sun is stationary was widespread amongst astronomers until the 20th century. It is now a well-established scientific fact that the Sun is not stationary, but is moving in an orbit around the center of our Milky Way galaxy. The Quran mentions the orbit of the Sun: \u201cIt is He who created night and day, the Sun and the Moon, each floating in its orbit.\u201d (Quran 21:33) The Quran would have been wrong according to astronomers just a couple of decades ago. But we now know that the Quranic account of the Sun\u2019s motion is consistent with modern Astronomy. ",

            "answer_text": "As a justification for the Qur\u2019an, it is mind-bogglingly counter productive. Yes, \u201cscience changes\u201d over time as new evidence is discovered and new theories are tested, but the point is that science is a process of gradual improvement. If the Qur\u2019an states something as a fact that is later discovered to be untrue, all you are left with is proof that the Qur\u2019an is not a holy book inspired by a perfect God and that it is instead the work of imperfect men who didn\u2019t know much about the universe and our place in it. I mean, seriously, when the Qur\u2019an was written, people didn\u2019t know much about embryology. And, as a result, you have passages in the Qur\u2019an such as the following: Man We did create from a quintessence of clay. Then we placed him as a drop of sperm in a place of rest, firmly fixed. Then We made the sperm into a clot of congealed blood. Then out of that clot We made a fetus lump. Then We made out of that lump bones, and clothed the bones with flesh. Then We developed out of it another creature. So blessed be Allah, the Best to create! (23:12-14). That doesn\u2019t appear to be even remotely similar to how actual embryology is now known to work. What about the role the ovum plays in all of this? What spot of congealed blood? And why does it say the bones are created first and then covered with flesh when we now know that the fetus is covered with flesh before bones develop? [And no, I really don\u2019t care that one particular famous non-Muslim embryologist out of many gave a speech claiming that it was an accurate description after he was paid a lot of money by the Saudi government to do so.*] Since that time, of course, people invented microscopes and could actually see what was going on and, as a result, science now knows a lot more about the subject than it did back then. So, if anything, the fact that the same nonsense has been repeated in the Qur\u2019an for centuries despite the fact that we now know it to be incorrect, is just proof that it was never a divine or \u2018perfect\u201d book to begin with.  * For reference, see the following: Dr. Moore is notable as the only embryologist directly quoted by Islamic sources in an attempt to prove embryology as described in the Qur'an is scientifically correct. In the 1980s he accepted an invitation by the Embryology Committee of King Abdulaziz University to produce a special 3rd edition of his most successful book \"The Developing Human\" specifically for use by Muslim students in Islamic Universities. He was financially patronized by the Saudi royal family for the use of his name, and for no real additional work. The textbook he delivered to the Saudi Universities that commissioned the work is titled, \"The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology with Islamic Additions.\" The base textbook was work that Moore had completed years before. He did nothing new for this new edition. The \u201cIslamic additions\u201d are actually the work of an Abdul Majeed al-Zindani, so it alternates chapters of standard science with Zindani's \"Islamic additions\". The result of Moore's and Zindani's collaboration is not an academic book and subsequent editions omit and contradict the \"Islamic additions\". Reverting back to his previous description, they basically admit that the embryology in the Qur'an is a repetition of Greek and Indian medicine. \u2014 Dr. Keith Moore and the \"Islamic Additions\" Of course, you are free to attack this information as scurrilous, biased or otherwise unreliable as you see fit. But one thing nobody seems to dispute is the initial statement that Dr. Moore is the only embryologist who apparently ever said anything about embryology as described in the Qur'an being scientifically correct. Which is the point I originally made. When one (and only one) expert out of many thousands voices an opinion that supports your belief, it takes an extreme form of confirmation bias to think that actually means anything. ",
