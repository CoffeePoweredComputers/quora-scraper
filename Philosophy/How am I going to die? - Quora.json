People can just die out of the blue, of old age, of diseases, etc. Even though you can't tell, there are predictions. Here are some factors that could attribute to your death. 1# Do you smoke? 2# Do you drink? 3# Do you do drugs? Those are three basic questions, though if you do one of those three things that puts you at a greater risk of dying from these things. Even though those are huge factors there's other factors. For example\u2026 Do you have diabetes? Do you own a vehicle? Do you do dangerous things? To be specific if your diabetic that puts at a risk of dying from diabetes, if you own a vehicle that means your at a greater risk of a vehicle accident, and if your a daredevil that puts you at a greater risk of dying from daredevil things. So really there's no way to tell, but there are factors that could predict your death. ",

I\u2019m just saying that whether it is consciously or sub-consciously the mind and body will keep trying to avoid ceasing to function and ceasing to exist for as long as possible if given the time, energy, and opportunity. As for what is going to cause YOU to die, besides imperfection, I am not a psychic BUT, even if I knew how you will die, I would not tell you. Up until you actually die, how it will happen can change. So my suggestion would be \u2014\u2014- DON\u2019T LOOK FOR THAT ANSWER. ",
