            "answer_text": "The most common name for the problem the question addresses is the ad hominem fallacy. It literally means \u201cTo the man.\u201d This means, in a debate format, that someone attacks the other debater\u2019s character or motives, rather than the argument\u2019s merits. An example would be \u201cYou have no right to oppose abortion. You\u2019re a man and will never be pregnant.\u201d The merits (or lack thereof) of opposition to abortion do not hinge on whether I can or cannot get pregnant. If a woman with a functioning uterus and ovaries argued against abortion, the personal attack would be inapplicable. Other common ad hominem attacks center on someone\u2019s socioeconomic standing or what they stand to gain by supporting or opposing a law or policy. Whether someone personally stands to gain or lose something is immaterial, in most cases, to the argument\u2019s validity and soundness. ",

            "answer_text": "A \u201cPersonal attack\u201d fallacy is formally called an \u201cad hominem\u201d fallacy. Typically it refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. A simple form is \u201cYou cannot believe what person X has just said, because person X (is a bad person, based on some anecdote)\u201d Several examples are provided at: Ad Hominem Examples ",
