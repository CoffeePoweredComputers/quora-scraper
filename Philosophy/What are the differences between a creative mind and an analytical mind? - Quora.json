            "answer_text": "Although the greatest accomplishments in either field of activity require both, they are fundamentally almost opposite in nature. Analysis versus synthesis. Analysis means \u2018taking apart\u2019 and depends especially on conscious discriminating judgment and methodical activity. Creativity is a kind of synthesis \u2014 seeing things as related which may not be related in any literal or analytic sense; therefore creativity requires suspending analysis \u2014 at least in the phase of inspiration \u2014 and analysis requires suspending creativity \u2014 at least in the crucial phase of making distinctions and classifying things. In other phases of activity, they can improve each other\u2019s results. For example, after you compose an inspired melody, it is helpful to figure out what time signature and key you\u2019re written it in if you want to finish developing it into a fuller piece of music. Or after you analyze a problem, if you then allow yourslf to chew on it non-verbally (sub-conscious incubation), the results of your analysis may provide the groundwork for a creative insight (e.g. the \u2018discovery\u2019 of the benzene ring).
