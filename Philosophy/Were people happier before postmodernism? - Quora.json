            "answer_text": "Most people have no idea what postmodernism is and certainly no notion of when it might have started, so really what you are asking is are people happier today than in the past? It seems not. But this is not because of the likes of Foucault, Derrida, Lacan, Baudrillard, Deleuze, or even myself (yes, I consider myself to be a strategic postmodernist, but more poststructuralist). We should be a lot happier than our ancestors. We are fitter, healthier, living longer, more prosperous, protected and peaceful lives, have the world at our computer tips, are able to travel most anywhere, have better educational opportunities, are more knowledgeable than at any time in history. The vast majority of us can shower regularly, drink fresh clean water, afford a decent meal, and own a form of transport. Plus we can find love and sex on the internet. So why are we not happier? I have no idea and nor does anyone else, though we can speculate. Yuval Noah Harari speculates on this conundrum in his book Sapiens (2015, Vantage, pp.421\u2013444). He suggests that modern capitalistic post-industrial society has created \u2018alienated individuals who feel threatened by the power that impersonal state and market wield over our lives\u2019. We have more individualisation than ever before and consequently, more agency and opportunity to pursue existentialist ideals. But it has come at the price of fragmented communities, the loss of the nuclear family and the rise of what I discuss in my book, Toxic Masculinity, as the \u2018super solo society\u2019. For the first time in its 200,000 year history, humans are liberated and freed from the basic needs of survival. Seems to me the next step in humankind\u2019s journey is to learn how to be happy with it. ",

            "answer_text": "Studies show that liberals in general are less happy than rightwingers. Leftism is today mostly resting on regressive post-modernist \u201cthinking\" (read=feeling). Leftism rests on fear of the other and envy of the other and therefor controlling and taxing the other. Rightwing thinking rests on personal liberty, belief in oneself, a more positive outlook on reality and life and other people. So its not about when, but WHO is the happier. As a buddhist, I also see the karmic perspective. When you help people in the rightwinger way, with your own money, creating business, makin peaceful deals - it gives you good karma. But, when you steal other peoples money, keep a lot for yourself, regulate and tax(hinders) peoples business and lives, you get bad karma. The saying goes to help the poor, but exactly how many trillion do you need to help the 1% not able to help themselves. Socialism and social-democracy are mostly lies created out of envy and fear, and then manifested through leftism. \u201cBad\u201d karma comes from 1 wanting to do bad things, 2 knowing what you do is bad/understanding the situation, 3 doing the bad things 4 and being happy with doing the bad things. The full extent of the karma comes togehtehr if all 4 are in your mind. Many are spared the worst consequenses of this karma, because they may not know that what they are doing(leftism) is bad. Many socialists and social-democrats will only get karma from # 3. ",
