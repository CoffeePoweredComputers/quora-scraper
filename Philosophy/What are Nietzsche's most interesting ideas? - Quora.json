            "answer_text": "For me, the most interesting ideas I found in reading Nietzsche so far (Thus spoke Zarathustra and Beyond good and evil) are the ones related to the will to power. The will to powerNietzsche looks at human beings - not from a moralistic point of view, as most other philosophers did or do - but beyond that. He sees humans for what they biologically are: living creatures. The most basic instinct of all living creatures as he sees it, is the will to power. The will to power as Nietzsche uses it, does not mean political power, although it may be an expression of it. What Nietzsche means by the will to power is the natural will to survive. It\u2019s the main force that all living creatures possess, it\u2019s what drives them: the will to live, the will to facilitate their lives by influencing their environment. Homo sapiens is no exception in the animal kingdom, it is like any other animal driven by that same will.Philosophy is an act of the will to powerOne of the ways in which humans can influence their environment is by spreading their ideas. Spreading ideas is a way in which we can influence the thinking of others. The way in which people think, influences their behavior. Humans are social creatures. How others behave can be either good or bad for us. Again, not in terms of morally good or bad, but beyond. In terms of survival. The behavior of others can facilitate and prolong our survival, or it can obstruct our survival. What philosophers do when they spread knowledge, is trying to achieve conditions which are good for their survival (and the survival of those who think like them). Therefor philosophy is an act of the will to power.Old philosophy has been an unconscious act of the will to power: it has been deceivingWhat separates Nietzsche from the western philosophers before him, is that he studied the genealogy of philosophy, the history of philosophy, and he searched for the psychological reasons behind the act of philosophizing. He shows that philosophy since Plato has been deceiving in two ways: 1) Motivationally and 2) Linguistically 3.1 Motivational deceptionOne of the key searches in philosophy has been the epistemological search for truth. Nietzsche sees the search for truth in the history of philosophy since Plato not as a way to actually achieve truth. (According to Nietzsche we are always bound by our personal perspective.) But as a way in which humans have used reason to convince others and themselves of their personal intuitive truth. What old philosophers have done is create systems in which they would be better to survive. They have translated their ideal world in moral terms and posed guidelines for people to be deemed good according to their personal value systems. Thereby meeting the natural wish Nietzsche beliefs people to have to either lead or obey. Philosophers like Plato and Kant have stated \u2018morality\u2019 - the belief of what is good or bad - to be a priori given. Either because they assumed a metaphysical reality behind the one we live in (like Plato), or they believed truth to be part of reason (like Kant). One of the popular ideas in western philosophy has been the ascetic idea to suppress one\u2019s natural urges. Suppressing one\u2019s sexual desire for example and feeling guilty all the time has been viewed as good in Christian society. Nietzsche goes beyond the moral question of good and bad, and asks himself why humans need truth at all? Why it is that truth is more comforting than uncertainty? Again, Nietzsche\u2019s answer lies in human\u2019s natural will to power. Believing something to be true, and being able to act according to what is \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018right\u2019 feels empowering. It helps us to be able to live with ourselves. Most people are easily convinced of their own righteousness. Philosophers less so. They ask more questions. They need better reasons to be convinced that something is true. And they are more clever in deceiving both others and themselves of the truth of their intuitive feelings of what is morally right - which are in fact emotions. 3.2 Deception of languageOne of the ways in which philosophers have been able to deceive themselves and others is by the seduction of language. Being conscious of the structure of language and its influence on our thinking and reasoning is a very important realization Nietzsche helped spread. Language has, as Nietzsche states, a subject-predicate structure. Descartes was able to convince himself of his own existence because the languages in which he thinks (for example Latin and French), consist of a grammatical \u2018I\u2019. \u2018Cogito\u2019 (latin for \u2018I think\u2019) presumes a subject \u2018I\u2019 who does the act of thinking. This grammatical issue was convincing for Descartes to be sure of his own existence. But is in fact a part of our language system.New philosophy will be a conscious act of the will to powerSo. Knowledge is power. Spreading knowledge is in a way always an act of our natural drive: the will to power. Believe in a metaphysical reality or in absolute truth is self-deception. Reasoning and language have their pitfalls. Nietzsche hopes and believes a new kind of philosopher will arise, one that will overcome the question of what is good and bad (not by not caring what is good or bad, but by actually overcoming and accepting both the \u2018good\u2019 and the \u2018bad\u2019 of himself, and in that way truly understanding and accepting himself - and through himself the rest of humanity) so that he won\u2019t need to lie to himself as the old philosophers have done. In that way the new philosopher would be deemed a free spirit. One that is in touch with his natural self. What the new philosopher says, would be a conscious act of the will to power. The new philosopher will not make claims based on moral grounds, he will not claim to have the truth, but he or she will in a clever way seduce others in following his or her ideas to make the world a better place for both him or herself and those who are similar.",

            "answer_text": "Well, to my dismay, it seems that the majority of our answers here are for a different question, namely, \"what are Nietzsche's most popular ideas?\"   Unfortunately, the question, \"what are Nietzsche's most interesting ideas?\" brings in complications where the word \"interesting\", as we all know, is terribly vague and can lead to subjective temptations. So for my response, I'll just reword the question, \"what do you think are Nietzsche most philosophically useful ideas\"? The ideas I personally find the most interesting are: (1) the \"drive\" concept (2) the notion of \"power\" as a second order drive (3) the concept of a \"will\" (4) the notion of \"perspectivism\" I find Nietzsche's \"drive\" concept to be especially illuminating because of its both critical and explanatory power.  For example, some philosophers have thought that our intellect is able to stand back and reflect on our motives.  But Nietzsche's insight is that when our intellect reflects and chooses among motives to act on, this deliberation is itself being guided by drives themselves.  So it is basically drives deliberating about other drives through the medium of the intellect.  In Daybreak 109 we see this clearly.  In this aphorism Nietzsche discusses six methods for combating the vehemence of a drive, but then he says that this process is itself guided by other drives of which the intellect is only an instrument.   Next, I find Nietzsche's notion of \"power\" to be especially useful.  Since we have drives that each seek an aim (e.g. the reproductive drive seeks sexual reproduction or e.g. the hunger drive that seeks nourishment), what these drives all hold in common is that in seeking a particular primary aim they also seek a general secondary aim, namely, power.  According to Paul Katsafanas, we can use Nietzsche's philosophy to understand power as the constitutive aim of action (this means that power is the general aim of all action).  This is vital in order for us to be able to draw normative authority (from this notion of power) and understand how it is that Nietzsche's seems to prefer one moral system over another while remaining consist with his claim that \"there are no moral facts\" (TI VII: 1).   Now, although Nietzsche seems to rule out the possibility of a free-will, saying that the free-will requires the absurd condition of being self-caused (or causa sui), Nietzsche also rules out the un-free-will.  What this means is that although our will isn't free, it's still not the helpless victim of other causes; no, the will itself, though not free, has a role of its own to play, just like anything else.  That is why Nietzsche says that it is all a matter of \"strong and weak wills\" (BGE 21).  He also provides a naturalistic analysis of the will, saying it is composed of thought, feelings, and our drive's affect (BGE 19). Lastly, Nietzsche's notion of perspectivism, built on the idea that drives each offer us moral perspectives (and the idea that 'all of our perceptions are permeated with moral values'), combats the notion of an indifferent subject that could have unmediated access to the world (GM III: 12). So here it is: the ideas I find the most useful in Nietzsche are the \"drive\" concept for its many insights, including its ability to give us a naturalistic picture of reflective agency and its ability to develop a coherent picture of perspectivism, the notion of \"power\" as a second order drive for its ability to generate normative authority (as discussed by Katsafanas in his essay on constitutivism and his forthcoming book), and finally, the concept of a \"will\" for its ability to preserve the role of the agent, all the while remaining within a naturalistic philosophy.
