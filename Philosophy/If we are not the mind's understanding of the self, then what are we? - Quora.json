            "answer_text": "The question is not fundamental enough and hence not logically precise enough; it is further reducible. There is simply no \u2018we\u2019; upon investigation, one will find that there is only \u2018I\u2019. Upon further investigation, one will realise that this I is also naught. What then remains is the Unameable which is beyond the ideas of knowable and unknowable, and beyond speech and silence. Since everything is reduced to It, especially including what incessantly pulsates as \u2018I\u2019 in waking and dream states, the Unameable is given the name, Self. ",
