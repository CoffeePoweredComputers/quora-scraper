            "answer_text": "I have long considered casual sex to be immoral. Unfortunately i have often participated in (them) and in the end deservedly got burnt for it. Im still suffering the emotional and undoubtedly the reputational reppurcussions even late into adulthood. Here is why i believe it is the utmost folly to engage in sexual relations with a person whom in your heart of hearts, you do not truly desire a long term relationship with. I argue that one is in actuality, telling another person that they do not measure up. One could ask oneself, why would you NOT want to be in a long term relationship with a person you happen to find sexually desireable? What is wrong with this person that you would absolve yourself of any responsibility for their emotional welll being? I believe there are no ifs and buts when it comes to excusing what is (all-to-often) ethically questionable behavior. I strongly believe the poison is hidden within the actions of the partner with the most power in the relationship, the party who is least emotionally attatched (and here i speak as a former sinner). You can always rationalize your actions by stating that you are not ready for a commitment and you can claim to show that a given sexual partner isnt interested in anything either. Experience (mine) shows that this (generally) doesnt work. People seek love even and perhaps especially when they profess to not be doing so. I believe you (should) only enter sexual relations when your reasonably sure of your commitment to another persons long term wellbeing. I believe you cannot have your cake and eat it too. I do not especially care for conservative or religious thought, definitely not the forces that would reverse let say, abortion rights or womens rights in general. But for centuries people have wisely dealt with sexuality as something emotionally risky and potentially destructive, not a frivolous pasttime to be enjoyed casually. As a polically left leaning individual i say that its nobodys business what you do in private but as a pragmatist i say that common sense would suggest that it is fundamentally irrational to take a casual stance on sex, otherwise, why should we insist or care about exclusivity once we have found that perfect somebody with whom we wish to settle down with? I am heavily influenced by the late roger scruton (from my own amateur take on his philosophical work)..and more recently \u201cesther perel\u201d so i aim to modify or inject nuance to my response over time.. If i seem overly sceptical toward casual sex it is only because i have developed a keen sense for the limitations in communication between\u201dconse ting\"parties. Talking about stuff does not necessarily make issues more transparant, an idea i borrow from systems theory developed by niklas luhman. ",

            "answer_text": "From what I've witnessed women can't handle casual sex. Maybe it's the oxytocin but from what I've seen, they always want more. I'm so fed up from playing pseudo therapist to 4 female friends who think they can handle casual relationships when they obviously can not. They are always secretly hoping it'll turn in to a real relationship. Never happens. After their casual sex encounter they are utterly devastated when the guy doesn't call back or doesn't call back fast enough. Even when he does call back, they soon come to feel used and objectified because now it's just a booty call and the guy won't take them away for the w/e-what? More therapy, punctuated by another sexual encounter that's is hotter than ever because there's so much at stake (fragile desperate ego) and of course the woman is a wreck, she's dropped 10 which she's happy about. Only to be followed by a massive depression. I gently say, \"maybe don't sleep with the guy on date one\" to which they indict me for being \"puritanical\" and not understanding because I'm married.  I'm not a Puritan. I say \"please, hit it w/ an entire football team if you handle it emotionally\" but the key here is you CAN'T handle it emotionally. They lie to men that they don't want a relationship because apparently that's dating suicide, and try to act like they don't care when inside they're dying. I think it's immoral (for them) to dishonor themselves and to deny their true nature. As a friend who cares, I feel like a casualty from their self-denial & poor choices. ",

            "answer_text": "If all parties in the relationship are truly comfortable in it, then no. It is believed that sexual relationships became \"regulated\" after the conception of inheritance.  Until then, no one cared about lineage and children were raised in the group.  After then, powerful people (usually men) insisted on knowing that children were actually theirs.  The only way to guarantee that was to insist the women that bore a man's children were virgins, and only had sex with him.  As these men organized they created rules, laws and then religions to create a culture where women who wanted to be in a stable relationship had to follow the rules and get married to one man and only have sex with him.  Men, of course, could marry as many women as they could afford. As cultures evolved, and with the rise of the middle class, it became the norm for a man to have just one wife.  But as in the past, most marriages were arrangements between families.  Marriages were rarely only between two people who are in love.  As cultures continue to evolve, couples marry because they decide to, while still wanting the combined families to approve. In modern times, as many women can now enjoy a stable life without the financial support of a husband, they may choose to enjoy one or more casual relationships before they get married.  In many places, there still may be people outside of the relationship that disapprove.  In that case, those in the relationship will need to decide if it is pleasurable enough to withstand the disapproval. ",

            "answer_text": "Love is love. People in different societies have different standards and expectations in a relationship therefore different morals. In ancient Rome, orgies were very common. In some Muslim countries, it\u2019s considered understandable if you have up to 4 wives. Morality is transitional and differentiated. If you want casual relationships, don\u2019t worry about morals, just as long as the person you\u2019re dating knows that you\u2019re not super super serious(which is usually a good thing), go for it. For me, I don\u2019t see why casual relationships should be deemed immoral. For one, it should allow a person to grow and better know what kind of person they are really attracted to, and be more sure to become a partner for life. Why should anyone have to settle on the first or second or third lover? ",
