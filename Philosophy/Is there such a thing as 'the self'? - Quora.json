            "answer_text": "To me, truth is relative. The concept of \u2018self\u2019 must be understood depending on the contexts that you refer to. The \u2018self\u2019 does exist at the social and political levels because we have a culture that allow us to understand that as truth but this truth is a shared, relative truth. At the philosophical or biological levels, the self becomes something that can be shared with the whole universe. For instance, our physical body is made up of chemicals (e.g. proteins). This means we don\u2019t actually exist because our whole body can only be there because of the food we eat and the water we drink. Without these, we disappear by turning into some kind of fertilisers maybe for the plants and insects. We require energy from the outside world. We pass our energy to outside world as well. This interexchange eliminates the notion that we are a unique entity. So, the self only exists at the surface levels but at the deeper levels, there is no such thing as the self. But no one can tell you which levels of truth is more truthful because no one can really understand how this universe functions. ",

            "answer_text": "Sure, but the fact that you are asking this question indicates you have had an interesting experience which led you to question what the self actually is. Your experience doesn\u2019t need to be challenged, but your desire to think about it can use some support so I recommend reading Descartes\u2019 Error by Antonio Damasio. ",
