            "answer_text": "No.  In broad general terms we have two big divides:  Social Issues: Should being gay be legal? Should abortions be legal? Should pot be legal?  Economic Issues: What is the role of government? What is the best way to solve problems like homelessness, unemployment, and poverty?  In each category there are different views, and different extremes, as well as plenty of moderate positions.  But labeling all Americans as agreeing with seven randomly chosen politicians is not accurate, much less useful, in understanding the questions at work. ",

            "answer_text": "It's one among many semi-useful perspectives on how we're divided.  In particular, I think it might be better than the standard social/economic \"quadrant\" model.  If you were to plot everyone's political beliefs in a multi-dimensional space, it would immediately be apparent that people are not evenly distributed throughout that space.  The natural clusters that form are never regularly shaped or equidistant from one another.  That's why every discussion of the quadrant model seems to devolve into quibbling over what the lines mean or where specific individuals should be placed.  Identifying specific points within that space might well be more representative of reality than drawing lines, and there's value in making those points memorable by attaching them to names as well. On a slightly different topic, I think the standard \"social vs. economic\" model is actually quite harmful as it separates people who have much in common and lumps people together who are quite different.  For example, people's beliefs about war/security vs. privacy are often quite separate from their beliefs about equality and justice.  To the extent that \"pro-business\" means anything at all (who's anti-business?) there's still an important distinction between pro-big-business conservatives and pro-small-business libertarians.  By highlighting certain distinctions and suppressing others, it encourages people to support parties and candidates that might not really represent their interests.  At least the \"point\" model, not being limited to two dimensions, avoids that problem. ",
