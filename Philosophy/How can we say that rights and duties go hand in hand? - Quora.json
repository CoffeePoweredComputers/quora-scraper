            "answer_text": "This statement that \u201cRights and duties go hand in hand\u201d is as true as the statement that \u201cThe sun rises in the east.\u201d Rights are legal, social or ethical principals of freedom that people are entitled for by a governing body, whereas duties are responsibilities or obligations of an individual, by the governing body, that are required to done by the said individual. Rights and duties are two sides of the same coin. For example, Right to Equality is a right, which means no discrimination will be done to anybody on the basis of caste, religion, gender, place of birth, etc. But, often it is seen that we ourselves discriminate between people based on various factors. And many times we discriminate people even on the basis of their appearance. Even UNICEF conducted a social experiment last year in which people discriminated with a small child on the basis of that child\u2019s appearance.[1] So, by doing this discrimination on an individual level, we are snatching the Right to Equality from the persons who are being discriminated. Take another example, Right to freedom of speech guarantees that we can express ourselves as we want. No one can stop us from doing that. But it is our \u201cduty\u201d to see that the above right is implemented in an apt way. Freedom of speech doesn\u2019t means that one can say things that hurt the sentiments of others. We must make sure that in the quest of following our own rights, we don\u2019t undermine the rights of other people. So, it is our duty to make sure that we don\u2019t violate the rights of other people in our society. Hence, rights and duties always go hand-in-hand.
