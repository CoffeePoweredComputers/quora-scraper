            "answer_text": "\u201cIf you are arrested, in addition to your right to silence can you just relax your body? Not resisting the police, but not helping them either.\u201d If the police tell you to stand up and you just sit there, or if they stand you up and you let your legs buckle under you, you are doing what is called \u201cpassive resistance\u201d \u2014 assuming you don\u2019t have a medical condition or injury which prevents you from standing on your own. If they tell you to put your hands behind your back, but you leave your arms hanging limp at your sides, you are resisting \u2014 assuming you don\u2019t have a medical condition or injury which prevents you from putting your hands behind your back. So, no. You don\u2019t have the \u201cright to just relax your body.\u201d That is called \u201cresistance\u201d and may result in additional criminal charges against you. War story alert: I was working one night and backed another police officer who was arresting someone for domestic violence. While we were escorting the arrestee out to the squad car (both of us were holding his arms because he had been actively resisting for a bit), he suddenly went limp and started to fall to the ground. The other officer got pulled to the side suddenly and ended up with a severe muscle strain in his back. The arrestee actually said something like, \u201cGotcha!\u201d while the officer writhed in pain on the ground. When all was said and done, the arrestee ended up with an additional 30 months in prison for the stunt, as it resulted in a significant injury to the officer. The defense attorney tried to claim that the arrestee \u201chad a fainting spell,\u201d but the jury apparently didn\u2019t believe that. In short, Dear Questioner, no. You don\u2019t have a \u201cright\u201d to relax your body. Passive resistance is still \u201cresistance.\u201d ",

However, your lack of cooperation will be noted and will not endear you to the officers. I would suggest not doing this. While they probably won't be abusive, they won't be gentle either. If you get hurt, your non-compliance will be noted and your injuries will be on you, unless you can prove unnecessary roughness, which is a hard sell. Comply and haggle in court. ",
