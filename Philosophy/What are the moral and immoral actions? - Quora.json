            "answer_text": "a nonmoral action is one that does not break the \u201crules\u201d of society. For example, there are two grocery stores: which one do you shop at? Your choice is a nonmoral action. I think maybe you might be asking about immoral/amoral actions. Immoral actions would be something that breaks the laws or religious/social rules of a society. (And sometimes, an action can be immoral according to one code but not another. For example, playing card games is legal (if you\u2019re not gambling) but it might be immoral at your church. Amoral actions are done with complete indifference or ignorance of the rules of a society. For example, a child might tell someone they are ugly, or they might steal something because they think it\u2019s pretty. A sociopath might do something without any concept of right and wrong. However, some philosophy of the greater good must be considered. For example, it may be immoral to speed\u2026.unless you are driving someone to the hospital.It may be a nonmoral decision which grocery store you shop at\u2026unless you are aware that one company mistreats its employees.It may be immoral to lie\u2026unless you are saving someone\u2019s life (for example, people providing refuge to Jews during WWII, or in the US, providing refuge to fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad).It may be immoral to kill\u2026but would it be moral to kill Hitler in 1939?

            "answer_text": "Q: What are moral and nonmoral actions? I\u2019d argue that there\u2019s no such thing as a nonmoral action. Actions without any moral implications do not exist. But first let\u2019s define morality. You can say your morality comes from religion or wherever else, but for most all people it just comes down to well-being. Whether actions bring about positive or negative net well-being determines the morality/immorality of the action. You can think about well-being roughly as happiness, but it\u2019s a bit more nuanced than that, encompassing a wider range of human values. Every action (or inaction) no matter how seemingly inconsequential, has an effect that can be measured by the amount of well-being it produces. This is obvious on the macro level, but maybe not as obvious in day-to-day decisions. Take, for instance, choosing between cereal and toast for breakfast. It can be hard to see how something as insignificant as this can have any moral implications, but consider that both choices have implications for your well-being: in the moments that you\u2019re eating the breakfast and in the future consequences of that choice, such as the nutrients your choice will give you and how that will affect your day. Some day, we may even be able to give well-being integer values by monitoring the brain activity of those involved in the action. This would allow us to analyze choices by simply looking at the numbers. ",
