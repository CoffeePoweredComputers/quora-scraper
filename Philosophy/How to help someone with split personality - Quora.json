            "answer_text": "The best thing you can do to help someone with DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) is to accept them as they are, alters and all. Their alters first appeared due to prolonged trauma during childhood, and it is best to not ask about the trauma unless they say they are comfortable enough to talk about it. Most people with DID are triggered by their past and would rather not talk about their past. Also accept that certain alters take the front because another alter (or the host) was triggered by something that may have contributed to their traumatic past. Never purposely trigger someone with DID. Love and accept them for all that they are. ",
