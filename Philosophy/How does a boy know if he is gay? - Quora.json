But the real question is, \u201cHow does he know?\u201d You think, perhaps you might be gay, when\u2026 You are eleven, and you think that you will someday have a boyfriend and be happy\u2026You are in the locker room, and you easily overcome the taboo against staring--can\u2019t stop staring, in fact\u2026You date a girl, finally, at fourteen--and after kissing her you think, \u201cThis is what everyone thinks I should want,\u201d and you are close to tears.You\u2019re fascinated with your best friend and terrified to tell him\u2014to tell anyone\u2014because of what they might think\u2026You are tired of lying, of faking, of beings something other than you\u2026You stare at the beautiful pictures, wishing over and over again that you could just\u2026But then you close the magazine.Yeah. That\u2019s when you think you might be gay. And then, at some point, you give yourself just the slightest bit of permission\u2026 You reach out and touch a boy's hand, and he smiles\u2026Or the day when a special person's lips come towards you, and your eyes actually close\u2026And feel his hands on you and you are on fire, and it\u2019s so warm that you stop thinking at all for just a moment\u2026And for just that moment--for the first time--you stop feeling the fear that has been with you for what feels like forever.And you think\u2026Maybe I am, and it's going to be OK.

            "answer_text": "For me I think the start was when I was about 12. This is when I first started pleasuring myself. I pretty much only thought of girls but just as I was about to jizz I\u2019d think about another guy in my class. Though I never thought I was gay or whatever because of it. This continued until maybe like 2 months ago when my dormmate and I were alone for the final period of that day. The other guys were outside playing tennis or something so it was just us two for the next several hours. I can\u2019t remember fully how it built up but we ended up talking about sex stuff and how often we would jerk off or the last time we jerked off and what we thought about to the point we ended up jokingly miming it to each other until one of us said something like -\u201cI bet you like that, don\u2019t you\u201d -\u201dY-yeah\u201d -\u201dHow about you show me how you do it\u201d So it ended up with one of us (I\u2019m not saying who started this) masturbating until the other started doing it. After that the other guy started doing it to me. I didn\u2019t feel awkward about it or try to resist it since it had been ages since any of us were able to masturbate to us being in dorms. Eventually we ended up sucking each other off until we both jizzed. At that point I knew none of us could call each other \u2018straight\u2019. ",

Body image led to fitspo, Fitspo led to muscle pics, Muscle pics led to bulge pics, Bulge pics led to nude pics, And nude pics led to porn. By this point I was pretty sure I was gay. This chain of searches and hyperlinks was led by some kind of guiding force. I call it \u201chormones\u201d. I don't think there was a time where my attraction for guys faltered or changed. It was a constant in my life. ",
