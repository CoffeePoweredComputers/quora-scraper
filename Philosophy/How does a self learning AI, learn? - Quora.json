            "answer_text": "depends a lot on the algorithm however clustering algorithms start with a single category then keep adding till the point that adding more categories makes the data fit worse. with k means this means start with one centroid point, measure how well clustered the points are i.e. the standard error, then move the centroid so the data fits better i.e. less error, once the centroid fits try one more and repeat. Eventually you will arrive with a set number of centroids with very low error. self learning basically just means an algorithm that can measure it's own inaccuracy and correct for it. ",
