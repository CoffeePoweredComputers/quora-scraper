            "answer_text": "Is the law of the excluded middle always valid in logic? No. There are always undecidable sentences and statements independent of any particular set of axioms, and there are other options. As with all axioms and postulates, excluded middle is an option, not a necessary and eternal truth. Aristotle and many other logicians considered it a necessary law of thought, but this has long been disputed even in the West. Buddhist logic considers the possibilities TrueFalseBoth True and FalseNeither True nor FalseNone of the aboveIn modern times many other logics have been created. I studied with Fred Fitch at Yale, starting with the system in his book Symbolic Logic, which explicitly excluded Excluded Middle. It accepted sentences that are neither true nor false, and allowed such sentences to be constructed explicitly. He considered the Russell set, the set of all sets that are not members of themselves.  R is a set in SL; it does not exist in ZFC; it is a class in NBG, so that it is forbidden to be an element of itself, and there is no contradiction. It follows in SL that R\\epsilon R \\iff \\neg R\\epsilon R so that a contradiction would follow immediately if  were either true or false. It exists in a third state, neither one nor the other. In this system, that third state is not given a name. Various names are used for comparable states in other logics. There are many-valued logics of numerous kinds, and also fuzzy logics. Many-valued logic - Wikipedia In logic, a many-valued logic (also multi- or multiple-valued logic) is a propositional calculus in which there are more than two truth values. Traditionally, in Aristotle's logical calculus, there were only two possible values (i.e., \"true\" and \"false\") for any proposition. Classical two-valued logic may be extended to n-valued logic for n greater than 2. Those most popular in the literature are three-valued (e.g., \u0141ukasiewicz's and Kleene's, which accept the values \"true\", \"false\", and \"unknown\"), the finite-valued (finitely-many valued) with more than three values, and the infinite-valued (infinitely-many-valued), such as fuzzy logic and probability logic. Fuzzy logic - Wikipedia Of course, I also studied various other systems of logic and set theory, including Quine, New Foundations; ZF(C); NBG; transfinite proof theory; and more. I have not gone deeply into model theory, sheaf theory, or topos theory, each of which provides many more options. I have also studied the standard algebraic structures, plus non-standard/hyperreal numbers; surreal numbers; and again more. We find that  is necessarily true in the standard real numbers but is just one option in several of the extensions to the reals with infinities and infinitesimals. One can extend ZFC and NBG in a variety of ways, of which the most interesting to mathematicians working in such areas are the numerous large cardinal axioms. ",

            "answer_text": "Question originally answered: Is the law of the excluded middle always valid in logic?  Well, what does \u2018valid in logic\u2019 mean here. Valid in which logic. Classically, i.e. in a classical logic, it is. Constructively, in a constructive logic, it is not. In a fuzzy logic, it is not. In a possibilistic logic, it is not. In a probabilistic logic it is not. To be more explicit, if I write the law in a second order logic (for reasons of ease of expression), as: then that proposition is not true in all possible models of all logics, which is what I think you are actually asking. The question \u201cBut is it true\u201d, requires defining what \u2018true\u2019 even means, and this notion of truth, however you choose to define it, lays at the basis of the concept of validity. Validity is defined as \u2018truth in all possible worlds\u2019 also sometime called \u2018necessary truth\u2019. And a single counter-example (here, a single world in which it does not hold) suffices to answer the literal question asked with a resounding: No! The proposition does not hold in all models of fuzzy logic for example. Underlying this question is perhaps the false notion that there is but one universal all encompassing logic. That there is but one notion of a proposition. But some small time spent perusing the written works on logic, will quickly denude you of that idea. The topic of logic is so much more subtle and interesting. ",
