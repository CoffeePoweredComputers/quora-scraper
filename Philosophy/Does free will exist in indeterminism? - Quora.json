            "answer_text": "Question Asked: \u201cDoes free will exist in indeterminism?\u201d Answer: While it is not a technical component of Indeterminism, people who ascribe to Indeterminism also tend to assert that Free Will Does. Indeterminism is a paradigm that posits that not all events are wholly determined by antecedent causes. As such, Indeterminism rejects the notion that the universe is truly and entirely governed by Determinism. While it is not a technical component of Indeterminism, people who ascribe to Indeterminism also tend to believe that (i) many, but not all, things are governed by the laws of cause and effect (i.e., Newtonian Determinism \u2014 as contrasted with Metaphysical Determinism), (ii) Free Will Does not exist, and (iii) that which is not governed by the laws of cause and effect is entirely \u201cRandom\u201d (i.e., a quantum mechanics concept). Because such people tend to reject both Determinism and Free Will, they tend to take no position on Compatibilism or Incompatibilism \u2014 viewing the issue to be a waste of time because it compares and contrasts what they view to be two false constructs. Indeterminism does not posit that all activity occurs without a cause. For example, Indeterminism recognizes that a golf ball travels from a golf tee to a place on the fairway more than 100 feet away as a result of being struck by a golf club. But, Indeterminism does posit that not all activity of the universe is governed by the laws of cause and effect. For a more detailed explanation of these concepts, see Bruce Silverstein's answer to What are the differences in the concepts of determinism, free will, compatibilism, incompatibilism and indeterminism?  Causal Determinism \u2013 We Are Compelled to Be Free ",

            "answer_text": "Yes!!! Since \u201cindeterminism\u201d is a human construction filled with a false premise and human boundaries. It\u2019s kinda\u2019 like saying \u201cDoes Texas exist because it is not illustrated on this badly formed map\u201d. The \u201cmap\u201d(Indeterminism) or mapmaker (Philosopher supporting Indeterminism) does not determine if Texas exists or does not exist; the Facts speaking to and about the State/Territory of Texas\u2014 whether supporting or not supporting\u2014is the logical avenue to follow proving or denying the existence of Texas. Perhaps a investigation is needed by you to figure out if \u201cIndeterminism\u201d(the map) is a myth or whether it is real and accurate??? I, for one, would put Indeterminism and Free Will in a place\u2014left and right\u2014and study the origins of each determining the authenticity of each claim. Only then, I believe, by a deep search, could you EVER come close to a honest decision because\u2026Indeterminism and Free Will cannot coexist as acceptable answers in our Universe. Thank You!!! Hope this helps?! ",

They would both be completely impossible in determinism. Free will is our ability to perform intentional actions. ",

Human behaviour (and animal behaviour generally) needs to be effectively determined if we are to be able to function. Whether you agree that this is consistent with free will or not is a matter of definition. ",
