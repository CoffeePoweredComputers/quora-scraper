            "answer_text": "Did you know that some infinities are bigger than others? Whaaat? Let\u2019s prove it as conceptually as possible. But first, some easy basics. Two sets are said to have the same cardinality (size) if there is a one-to-one correspondence between them. In other words, two sets have the same size if there is a pairing between them with no elements left over. Here\u2019s an example:  You can tell that X and Y have the same size because they each have four elements, which implies that there is a pairing between them with no elements left over. However, the above example involves finite sets (i.e. each set contains a finite number of elements). Let\u2019s try to show a one-to-one correspondence between two infinite sets. Don\u2019t let the word \u201cinfinite\u201d scare you. It\u2019s still pretty easy. Here\u2019s an example:  N and E are infinite sets because their elements are endless. They don\u2019t stop anywhere like X and Y in the last example do. However, they also have a one-to-one correspondence. Notice how they both start at zero, and for every element in one set, there\u2019s a parallel element in the other set to pair up with it. So even if this goes on forever and ever, N will still have the same number of elements as E. Their elements will always be able to be paired with none left over. So the thing to take away from that is, since there is a one-to-one correspondence between sets N and E, those sets have the same size, by definition. Therefore, those infinities are considered equal. One last thing to know. A set is considered to be countably infinite if its elements can theoretically be counted. For example, I\u2019m sure that if you had the time and sanity, you could count 1, 2, 3, 4\u2026 all the way to infinity. If, however, you aren\u2019t able to do that for a certain set (we\u2019ll get to that later), then that set is considered to be uncountably infinite. Just remember that. Done with basics! Now for the part you\u2019ve been waiting for. We\u2019ve shown two equal infinite sets, but that\u2019s not very interesting. Most people think that infinities are always equal. So how can we show that two infinite sets are not equal? Consider the infinite sets R(0,1) and N, where R is the set of real numbers between 0 and 1, and N is the set of natural numbers. So we have: R(0,1) = {.1, .2, \u2026, .9, .01, .02, \u2026, .99, .001, .002, \u2026, .999, \u2026} N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \u2026} When looking at these two sets, it seems like you could pair up each element without having any left over because they\u2019re both infinite sets. But in reality, there doesn\u2019t exist a one-to-one correspondence between the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 and the set of natural numbers. Therefore, those infinite sets are not equal in size. How do we prove that, you ask? May I present to you, Cantor\u2019s Theorem. We\u2019re going to use a proof by contradiction to show that R and N don\u2019t have the same size. In other words, we\u2019re going to initially assume that they do have the same size, and then complete the proof by contradicting (thus invalidating) our assumption. So, we\u2019ll assume that R and N have a one-to-one correspondence. In other words, their elements can be paired with none left over. There\u2019s our initial assumption. Now let\u2019s contradict it. Cantor\u2019s Theorem has a diagonalization method to show that R doesn\u2019t have the same size as N. It basically says: Give me any list of numbers between 0 and 1 that you want.No matter what, I can give you a number that\u2019s not in the list.It\u2019s easy, stick with me. I\u2019ll do step 1 with some random numbers between 0 and 1: .4592.9603.0101.8238Now, I\u2019ll do step 2 using the diagonalization method. Start with the number on the top left corner of the list, and also take all of the numbers that lie diagonally to the right of it. So from the above list, I\u2019ll take 4 from the first number, 6 from the second, 0 from the third, and 8 from the fourth. All you have to do now is add 1 to each number, and put them together to get a number that\u2019s not in the list (read step 2 again). Alright, so we have, 4+1, 6+1, 0+1, and 8+1. When you put them together, you\u2019ll get .5719. And indeed, .5719 is not in the original list. You can try this with any combination of numbers between 0 and 1, and you\u2019ll always get a number that\u2019s not originally in that combination. So what does that mean? It means that there\u2019s no way to count all of the numbers in the infinite set R. There will always be a number that\u2019s not in your list. That means that R is uncountably infinite. And what about N? It\u2019s already apparent that you can count 1, 2, 3, 4\u2026 all the way to infinity. Thus, N is countably infinite. We have an uncountably infinite set R, and a countably infinite set N. Since R will always have numbers beyond what you can count, that implies that R has a bigger size than N. We have contradicted our initial assumption. R and N do not have a one-to-one correspondence. And since R and N are infinite sets, we have proved that some infinities are indeed bigger than others. In fact, there is an infinite number of infinite sets, and you can always find a bigger infinite set. Wow! So, yeah. Not really a practical application or such. But you know what, it\u2019s practical in that you can now go blow other people\u2019s minds. Friends, family, and strangers don\u2019t stand a chance against the wicked sorcery that you now possess. Have fun with that! ",

            "answer_text": "Database programming. Actually, for database programming we don\u2019t just use set theory but the algebra of sets in general, close to the sigma-algebra. Ideally, databases would instead use Relational Algebra, but implementations usually come somewhere in between. However, you cannot use either until you understand sets first. In fact, as a programmer, I use mathematical containers a lot. Bags, Sets, Mappings, Queues, Stacks, etc. Sets are mathematically the smallest (simplest) container-like structure I know that can be used to describe everything I do for proof purposes (as most mathematicians will find). They are not an end-all-be-all (I find Types to be closer, but still lacking); however, sets are useful whenever I need to work with a situation that asks a question: \u201cIs this included or not?\u201d. Furthermore, sets and set theory are really a starting point to proof-based math, and more specifically, understanding set theory is a foundation to combinatorics, which is a foundation to probability theory, which is a foundation to statistics. Therefore, for most people who use statistics, the real life application of set theory is to prepare them for statistical analysis. Of course statistics works on huge collections of data, and you cannot understand the data without understanding the collections. In general though, most mathematical fields have been built up from set theory first. That includes building up proofs as to why addition of numbers is commutative and associative, etc. ",
