            "answer_text": "For me, politics means to do anything that helps in the growth of targeted people. Ask yourself, you believe in what type of causes? e.g. you believe in Dalit upliftment, women empowerment, elderly care, minority security, etc. Do not chose more than 4 causes because you would not be able to follow more than that. Suppose you chose women empowerment then see that if women in your company are paid equally to men or not. Do they get physical security? Is their toilet facility for them or not? Do they get equal opportunities like men or not ? Suggest ideas for women development to your organization. Stand-up whenever their rights get violated. This would make you a leader of women empowerment. The same strategy is used at higher level by political parties. ",

            "answer_text": "Politics in my evolving point of view represents conflicting views and promoted agendas. They are in conflict and if you like Hegel like some do, then there should eventually be a synthesis of these two opposing views. Don\u2019t see that likely. All I see is hostility, shaming, and shameful behavior. Animals get it. They don\u2019t spend their energies in conflict. They spend > 90% of their energy in pro social behavior. They belong to and promote their group. They don\u2019t trigger conflict in an anti social activity. Groups are selected for according to group theory. I\u2019m a fan of Darwin although not a fan of being violently selected against. I\u2019m more a fan of the kings peace. Internal strife is no way to run a company, army, or country, unless of course you want to spend your weekends walking the streets in protest. says a lot.
