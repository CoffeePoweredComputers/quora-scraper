            "answer_text": "I regret what I never said to my grandmother before she died. Dear Grandmother: Fuck you. Fuck you, for the bullshit you put me through. I don\u2019t care that you\u2019re my grandmother, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a good person. That means you are the mother of one of my parents \u2013 a job you didn\u2019t even do very well. You were a narcissist, an abuser, you showered favoritism on one of your children and abuse on the other two, because of a mistake that YOU made. You made everyone else pay for YOUR misdeeds. And you tried so FUCKING hard to force everyone around you to accept YOUR methods, the things and people YOU loved. I\u2019ve not forgiven you, you know. I still remember what you said to me that made me feel this way. The one thing you said that probably saved my life and kept my head above the water on the abuse you showered on me. My mother nearly DIED in a car accident, she flipped off an overpass, fell twenty feet straight down at sixty mph, landed on the top of her fucking head. Thank GOD she survived that with minimal damage. Hell, the brain damage she suffered hasn\u2019t affected her as bad as it should have, she just has some issues with controlling her emotions. You made the mistake of telling a five-year-old that \u2018Mommy had a bad wreck. She almost DIED. She was coming up for your birthday when she had it.\u2019 My five-year-old brain put two and two together, got five, and told me \u2018You nearly killed Mommy. If it weren\u2019t for YOU, then Mommy would be okay!\u2019 Years and years later, you\u2019d fail to tell me you called her to come up two weeks early from work so you could go on a cruise, and she was only driving in that blizzard because of your selfishness. But that\u2019s not what you said to me that drove that wedge between us. That same summer, when I was six, you wanted to go visit your favored child in Maryland. I didn\u2019t want to. I was afraid. What if mom died? What if I wasn\u2019t here and she came after us and got into another wreck and died? I told you I didn\u2019t want to go see my cousins, I wanted to stay with mom. Well, what about Aunt Angie? SHE wanted to see me, let\u2019s go see Aunt Angie, then! Oh, I bristled. See, that woman terrified me as a child. I don\u2019t know why, she was nice enough, in the way you\u2019re kind to the small child of a person you dislike, but I guess I caught on quick. I\u2019d never liked her, and I told you that. I thought it the perfect argument against you. \u2018I don\u2019t WANT to go see Aunt Angie! I DON\u2019T EVEN LIKE AUNT ANGIE!\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know why you don\u2019t like Aunt Angie. She loves you more than your mother ever can or will.\u2019 I hate you for that. I hated you for that. I lost all respect for you at that moment. You were never a person I loved after that. Hell, I didn\u2019t even like you after that incident. You weren\u2019t my grandmother anymore. You were the woman who spent years mentally abusing me, dragging me down, coddling me to the point of helplessness, telling everyone how I\u2019d be so much worse off if you hadn\u2019t generously taken me in from my mother who \u2018lived in squalor and poverty\u2019, never telling them that you told her if she didn\u2019t make me stay with you, you\u2019d call child services and tell them anything they needed to hear to have me forcefully removed from her custody. I suffered in school for years, harassed and bullied, even two or three teachers in all those years taking some personal grudge against me, and of course, it was all my fault. YOU\u2019D been a teacher, and NO teacher would EVER play favorites. You know, like how you, as a mother, NEVER played favorites. You forced me to attend religious services I never wanted to attend, forced me into tight dresses and stockings while every other kid there was in jeans and t-shirts. I was bullied there, too. I grew disillusioned with religion after that and am a proud atheist, thanks to you. You would force me to overeat at every meal. Wouldn\u2019t let me up from the table until I\u2019d eaten EVERYTHING you\u2019d made, even if it was clear it was a meal for three or four people. If I\u2019d tell you I wasn\u2019t hungry, you\u2019d cry and wail about how I was so cruel to reject this from you, how you just wanted to make sure I was properly fed, and if that didn\u2019t work, you\u2019d suddenly turn angry and scream at me how much money you\u2019d spent on it. Sorry, that wasn\u2019t my problem. Then, when I began to gain weight from your tactics, you began to shame me for eating so much. This never stopped your overfeeding me, or your methods when I\u2019d say I wasn\u2019t hungry. You know, it\u2019s almost like you were TRYING to make me gain weight so you COULD shame me. You got me close to 300 pounds (thank GOD most of it now muscle, so I don\u2019t look anywhere NEAR my actual weight) and would buy clothes for me that were sized medium, with the occasional large thrown in, then would shame me for needing larger sizes. Let\u2019s not forget the underwear incident, when I was 16 and you bought a g-string for my birthday. I opened that in front of my friends, who laughed. When I told you I didn\u2019t want it and you needed to take it back, you bristled, complained about how much you\u2019d spent on me, and that I had to wear it, because \u2018All the popular girls your age wear these!\u2019 Then you got mad when I presented it to you that night cut up with scissors. Not my fault you refused to return them when I said I wouldn\u2019t wear them. My OCD impulses came in because of you, there\u2019s far too many to list here. My anxiety came in because of you. Because you\u2019d always use the same excuse that people were laughing at me and talking about me if I did anything you didn\u2019t like. Even when I was a small child. People don\u2019t care, as long as said small child isn\u2019t throwing a tantrum. I wasn\u2019t throwing tantrums, I was raised better than that, thanks to grandpa. Your actions towards me as a child has helped foster my spiteful attitude, my lack of fucks given towards people I dislike, and a lot of the dislike I have for my immediate family. I got a job to spite you, especially when you screamed at my mother to make me quit immediately, because I would be working with boys. Your reasoning was \u2018They\u2019re going to rape her!\u2019 No. There was no \u2018They may try to rape her\u2019 it was \u2018It\u2019s GOING to happen! Everyone with a penis is going to rape and kill her, it\u2019s only by the grace of God if she comes home safe!\u2019 Every. Time. I was 20. She tried to make my mother force me to quit work when I was 20. I still lived with you and grandpa, because someone needed to be there as you were getting old. For him, I did it out of love. I hate you. I still hate you. I stayed with you until you died because it was the right thing to do, not out of any sense of love or loyalty. I got you everything you needed, I called 911 each time it was necessary (though I probably caused some concern with my distinct lack of care towards you when I did). After my last surgery you were alive for, you repaid me by taking away my pain medication and forcing me to manage having a double breast reduction surgery through the intense pain. Why? Because Aunt Angie said I would probably overdose on the pain meds and kill myself. You let that woman talk shit about me. You let her tell everyone what a fat, lazy, disgusting blob I was. She\u2019d been doing this since childhood. You KNEW about it. You KNEW she was degrading a child and wouldn\u2019t do anything about it, because \u2018It\u2019s not the right time to talk to her about it\u2019. And you wondered why I grew to hate her. And you. But, I never came out and told you how I felt. I never told you \u2018I hate you\u2019. You knew, because you\u2019d always ask why I did. And I would look you dead in the eye and lie to you. \u2018I don\u2019t hate you, nanny. Why would I?\u2019 You knew I was lying. I knew every time I said it that you knew I was lying. And I kept doing it. I was there because, honestly, I trusted myself to not screw you over in old age. I hated you too much to screw you over. You weren\u2019t worth the effort it would take. I didn\u2019t trust anyone else to not. And then you died one stormy, April morning in 2016. The kind of stormy where by 10 in the morning, it still looked like night. A thunderbolt struck so close to the house that it rattled everything. I was laid up with my ovary dying, unable to move because of the pain, needing help to get to the restroom. I called 911 when mom asked me to, and I suffered through seeing every member of the family you loved and adored and did everything for come in and ransack everything. I probably deserved them trying to literally kick me to the street that same morning, with a dying/dead ovary, unable to walk without vomiting because of the pain, but of course I\u2019m going to be pissed over it. Luckily, the one beacon of sanity \u2013 ironically, one of Angie\u2019s children \u2013 made them let me stay until my surgery was over. Made sure nothing in that house was actually removed before my things were taken out, because of Kellie\u2019s greed. But they all acted so pissed when I refused to attend your funeral, three days after my surgery, when I was still stapled up from a wound identical to a C-section. And, really, I\u2019m sad I didn\u2019t go. Because this is everything I would have said to them, and to you. My only regret about your death is I never looked you in the face and said \u2018I fucking hate your existence.\u2019 ",

            "answer_text": "Not valuing the time I am blessed to spend with my family. I am 26 and still live with my mom. I live with my brother whenever he is home from university. Until my parents separated - when I was 16/17 - I lived with my dad. I have time and time again failed to hold onto each word of every conversation, churn over what my family are telling me about their day and give heartfelt and useful feedback, think about the tranquility of a meal together, live in the moment during special occasions/holidays/vacations. I have had more uninterrupted time in a peaceful environment with my parents and sibling than - I would reckon - most people on this earth are able to enjoy. I have told myself that part of the reason I am not rushed to move out - maybe I\u2019m lying to myself - is that I want to further my relationship with my mom as it transitions from \u2018parent-child\u2019 to \u2018adult-adult\u2019, but, truthfully, I can\u2019t say I am putting the effort into doing so. I tell myself I hate routines but day in and day out, I come home, am in the same indifferent mood, mumble the same things, show the same ambivalence in conversation, and maintain the same emotional distance and engage the same guardedness. Again, and again, and again. And I am devastated when I realize I was gifted and wasted so much time with the people that keep my heart beating because I refused to confront my cognitive and emotional confusion.Being too embarrassed and ashamed of things going on in my head to seek help. This is directly related to, if not the sole cause of #1. For years - I remember it began when I was 15 - I have been bothered by thoughts that have popped in my head. Often they play on a loop. And once one of these thoughts wafts into my consciousness, I become a shell of myself. Every ounce of my brainpower rushes to that thought and initiates a frantic and - always - futile attempt to understand and explain. What made me think that? Why did I think it? What does it mean about who I am? Am I a bad person? Would I be capable of something like that? Helllpppppppp I\u2019m losing my sh** over here! Only - at least to my knowledge, since rarely anybody asked if something was wrong - I have been very successful at showing no outward sign of distress. I took my cognitive dissonance and jammed it as far back into the recesses of my mind as I could. I wanted to keep up a normal appearance so I could avoid anybody\u2019s attention. I didn\u2019t want any human connection. In those moments I felt like a freak. Sometimes a monster. If I could have worn a sign that said, \u201cStay away. Some real weird sh** is happening in my dome right now and I don\u2019t want to infect anyone,\u201d I would have. But instead, I would just go thru the motions. \u2018Life\u2019 like this is exhausting. It\u2019s an endless headache. It\u2019s endless anxiety. Eventually, whatever thought was bothering you fades away. And you rush to live, live, live. I\u2019m normal again. My head is clear\u2026I\u2019ll go ha\u2026\u2026.\u201doh fu** what was it that was bothering me earlier? Oh, right. Yeah. That. Great. Now it\u2019s back on my mind.\u201d And so the cycle is restarted. And with every instance, I\u2019d become a little more withdrawn, a little more socially awkward, a little more unsure of who I actually was, a little more sure that this confusion and sensation that I was not in control of my own mind would never end. Fortunately, recently, I came across a phenomenon called \u201cPure-O\u201d, which describes strictly the \u2018obsessive\u2019 component of OCD. Apparently, I\u2019m not alone in having disturbing (Intrusive is the term used by others) thoughts that I can\u2019t rid myself of. Understanding that the brain is an incomprehensibly complex machine that can churn out anything (sensible or otherwise) and that my thoughts don\u2019t have to correspond with my values, desires, or actions has helped me to be more at ease if something seemingly absurd pops into my mind. Not forcing myself to not think about certain things actually lessens the amount of times odd things pop into my mind. I wish I had found other cases of this long ago so I wouldn\u2019t have felt so strange and alienated myself at times, thereby sacrificing potentially memorable moments or rewarding relationships.Being a people-pleaser and putting others best-interest before mine . I\u2019m noticing a thread here, cause this regret is connected to #2 just like #2 was tied to number #1. Wow. I must have such an analytical mind, noticing trends like these. Anyway. Pleasing people. I believe the common belief is that people try to please others for their affirmation, attention, \u2018friendship\u2019, or the worth they believe they can infuse into their self from the other person\u2019s approval. This has mostly not been the case for me. I\u2019ve typically not felt a lack of inherent worth and realized that the only person whose approval I really need is my own. So, my people pleasing has always a method of avoiding confrontation. Or an awkward interaction. But here is where the plot takes yet another twist; it\u2019s not that the confrontation or awkwardness would bother me. Instead, I would feel bad for the other person. If someone is in the wrong, I can stare holes through them and not feel awkward at all. If I have nothing to say, silence bothers me not. It\u2019s actually a blissful state. But I always avoided standing up for what was actually in my best interest because I didn\u2019t want to create a situation where I had to call out the other person for disrespecting me, taking advantage of me, or being unintelligent about something. Pathetic, right? I agree. Where #2 wields some sway in this unproductive habit is in the way being a mental mess made me want to avoid all \u2018unscripted interactions\u2019. Remember, I was just trying to crawl my way through the day, go through the motions, and avoid - at all costs - anyone saying, \u201cDude, you seem like you have a bunch of shit going on in your head? Are you okay?\u201d So, naturally, I never felt well suited for a potentially confrontational scenario where I needed to take a stand on principal, explain clearly why the other party was in the wrong, and look them sincerely in the eye with the full force of my conviction in my words. I didn\u2019t want anyone looking into my eyes. And my conviction was buried beneath a shitload of cognitive trash.Thinking About Action Way More Than Acting. I can\u2019t hide behind the excuse of never having any sense of what the wisest choices are, and what I need to do to move closer to my goals. I consider myself lucky that the intuitive voice within me has always spoken loudly, clearly, and at all the appropriate times. But my trust in my own intuition has often faltered. Additionally, sometimes, emphasis on sometimes, I have ideas that I think are progressive or unorthodox, ideas that could change the world in the areas where humanity is currently in a slump. But, I churn them over again and again in my mental free time, thinking about how I\u2019d develop and implement them and what satisfying endeavors they\u2019d be. And then, instead of just diving in and learning to break things down into small bites, I overwhelm myself and do nothing at all.Imaginary Spotlight Syndrome. \u201cI know everyone is watching me right now. Oh God. I need to look like I\u2019m totally competent at my job. I must give off nothing but, \u201cthis shit is a breeze\u201d vibes. Maybe even notes of, \u201cyeah, this is what I do for a living but I also have many other interests and passions! I swear, I\u2019m not a monomaniac! I also swear I know what that word means!\u201d In other words, I often hold the assumption that people are: 1) Looking at me 2) Actually paying attention 3) Taking their brief insight into me and extrapolating it to build a comprehensive ( but really incomplete and inaccurate ) profile of who I am. In reality, it\u2019s doubtful most people do even one of these things. It\u2019s even less likely that they do all three. Moreover, it\u2019s not likely if they do all three that they draw the conclusion that I\u2019m a dull, unintelligent, unremarkable person. Lastly, if they do draw such narrow conclusions based on so little information, why would their opinion be valuable to me anyway?Mistaking Actual Fatigue for Laziness For the last ~10 years, I have depended on a mentality that might be best phrased as, \u201c Not Exhausted? You don\u2019t deserve sh**.\u201d Worked all day and angry about how much effort it\u2019s taking to keep your eyelids open? GET YOUR ASS TO THE GYM. Enjoying a laid-back Saturday with your mom? GO CUT THE GRASS AND CHOP FIREWOOD! Reached a sensible pause in the book you're reading since you could peacefully dose off right now? READ UNTIL 10 MORE PAGES. THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WISE PEOPLE AND EVERYONE ELSE YOU BRAIN ATROPHY ENABLING PRICK. I love challenge and I love knowing I can always go a little farther than I thought. But I\u2019m inept at letting tiredness sometimes get the better of me and realizing that time spent healthily resting is still productive.Altering my Behavior to Fit In. I have always thought that my reason for doing this was two-fold; one part not wanting to draw attention to myself by being the \u2018unique\u2019 person in a group and one part not wanting to make someone else uncomfortable at the prospect of not being able to relate to me and feeling uneasy. Part of this is almost subconsciously engrained in me because some of my childhood years I spent living abroad. When I\u2019m immersed in different cultures, my intonation and accent shifts. My facial features probably begin to mimic those of the people I\u2019m around. It\u2019s a way of connecting with someone. Of creating commonality. It\u2019s a little superficial but the intention is benevolent. These minor quirks are not what I regret. What I have a problem with is when I begin to change the substance of my personality. Or when I don\u2019t stand firmly behind my beliefs by not commenting on things which I don\u2019t agree with. Or by feigning interest in things only avoid the group\u2019s scrutiny. For example: If someone energetically asks how I am, I see nothing wrong with matching their vibes by enthusiastically replying, \u201cPretty good! For reasons bla bla bla!\u201d But if I\u2019m not actually pretty good, I should just reply, \u201cHonestly, not too good! For reasons bla bla bla!\u201d I can match the value they are placing on the interaction but I shouldn\u2019t change the substance of what I\u2019m saying. If I do, I\u2019m kind of changing my personality. Another example, maybe someone says, \u201cDude, isn\u2019t Chris such a dumbass for not taking that job and making $100,000 a year!?\u201d I might be thinking, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think anything about his decision was dumb. He realized work would take too much of his family time and realized no amount of money could compensate him for it. I think what he did is admirable and worthy of emulation by more guys.\u201d But, since I don\u2019t feel like having the spotlight on me for beingNot Caring Enough About What\u2019s Going On In My Family Members\u2019 Lives My brother started his last year of college about 3 weeks ago. He returned to his dumpy frat house on a Friday, so I decided I would go spend the weekend with him and joined him that night after work. Since I was with him for his first 3 days back, I thought it would of a clever way to commemorate his last year of undergrad studies. I thought, \u201cI\u2019ll call him every day and - even if only for 5 minutes - ask what happened during his day.\u201d It seemed a decent way to show how I appreciate that he\u2019s well on his way to building a life and also an opportunity for him to reflect on his final year. Guess how many days I honored my supposedly clever idea? Two. Maybe 2.5 since I briefly thought about calling on the third day, about a nano second before I fell asleep. I do genetically ask my dad what\u2019s going on with him at work but sometimes the jargon he throws out is somewhat esoteric and would require an amount of inquiry that a lot of times I\u2019m unwilling to construct. I know the most about my mom\u2019s day-to-day since we live together and see the most of each other. But even so, I reprimand myself often for not thinking of sufficiently evocative questions to let her share what currently means most to her.Wasting MoneyBeing Overly Consumed With My Regrets",
