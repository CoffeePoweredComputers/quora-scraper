            "answer_text": "I\u2019m going to make a few presuppositions. First, the victim dies after falling asleep, silent and sudden. I won\u2019t bother with the details on how. Second, I am forced to make a choice. I can\u2019t not decide. On one hand, I can choose death for myself, certain about who exactly would be the ones to be pained and affected by my choice. On the other hand, I can choose death for someone I don\u2019t know, uncertain of who I\u2019m making suffer. With the latter choice, there is a lot more variables to deal with. Who are they close with? Who care for and spend the most time with him? I don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s like so I don\u2019t know how his friendships are. I don\u2019t know his qualities, his flaws, what makes him likable, the things he\u2019s done, how he thinks, etc - for better or worse. I know nothing. And because I know nothing, I\u2019m ignorant of him, who he\u2019s influenced, and those who care for him. I can choose certainty, along with knowing who exactly I\u2019m hurting. Or uncertainty, ignorant of who I may have hurt and in what ways. Despite my choice, somebody will feel guilty. My family may feel guilty and sad, dwelling on how they might have been able to prevent my death. Or I\u2019ll carry that guilt with me as I move forward in life. The family and friends of the stranger in a similar place to mine in the previous scenario. I certainly do value who I know now more than who I don\u2019t. And I\u2019ll probably feel more awful harming those I value instead of those I\u2019ve never encountered. Besides, I don\u2019t know if who fell to the grave before me was liked or not. If he was cared for. It\u2019s possible he may not have, though I don\u2019t deny other possibilities. I\u2019d rather choose uncertainty, where it\u2019s possible that this person was in a bad spot instead of choosing a scenario where you are certain of who and how you\u2019re hurting those you care about. The best choice doesn't always have to be the right choice. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019d have to ask myself some questions. First, do I love myself? Second, do I like my life as it currently stands? Three, if I hate my life more than I love myself, does that mean I love someone else\u2019s life more than my own? Fourth, do I see the strangers\u2019 death, or vice verse? Overall, none of those questions matter, but it matters as to how I was raised, the morals and values that were instilled in me long ago. I was raised in a military family - both grandfathers served, my father and his brother, multiple other uncles, my brother, and multiple cousins served, as well as I. My dad retired from the service and went into law enforcement. I wasn\u2019t a religious man growing up, but I\u2019ve come to terms with it (religion). What all that means in conclusion is that we may be strangers, you and I (or the unknown person that I have the option to let die), but if it came to the fact that I had to lay down my life so another may live, I have been well prepared in doing so. In closing, found In the Bible, John 15:13 states quite clearly, \u201cGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\u201c Now, again, we may not know each other now, but I believe sooner or later, we will meet - be it this side or the other of the veil of death is unknown, but we will, and we will all be friends. The same goes for that stranger that I will die for so that they may live. ",
