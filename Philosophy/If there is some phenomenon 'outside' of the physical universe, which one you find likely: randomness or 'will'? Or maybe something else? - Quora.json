            "answer_text": "Randomness with limitations. The way a random number is both random and non-random. 243909150972380235022359823925987 for example. (typed without looking). Looks random. Yet, there are only ten different \u201ccomponents\u201d. Each a non-random reflection of one another. Hardly random. Where is 7/15ths? Or B? Those would add more randomness. So. Go with \u201cstructured randomness\u201d as opposed to \u201crandomness\u201d.  Absolutely 100% not \u201cwill\u201d. It is not possible wiithout violating common sense. And no evidence supports suspecting so. Except for people willing to wish it might be so that their will has power over more than their very limited carcass. (very limited, is not an insult. its just saying, you aren\u2019t going to be hand making stars and plants). The Green Lantern is JUST a movie.  Well. I should say, is JUST a comic book, and movie, and cartoon, and probably some books too. Not just a movie. But you get the point, right? \u201cWill\u201d works on your body. To move it. That\u2019s what \u201cwill\u201d can or will do.  That whole \u201coutside of ourselves\u201d connection, you know, harnessing the forces of the universe\u2026  or manipulating things with our mind, or tapping into some unseen energy, (like the yellow rays from the Sun)\u2026.  Are things we think about for ENTERTAINMENT. Mixing up the difference between reality and Hollywood/imagination/fiction\u2026 is the shortcut to becoming delusional and disconnected from the world. Better to stay grounded. ",
