            "answer_text": "As yourself, how do you relate to Immanuel Kant? Oh, hey, he\u2019s one of the immortals. He\u2019s Immanuel Kant. He\u2019s right up there with S\u00f8ren Freaking Kierkegaard. And honestly, most people would be like \u201cWhat are you nuts? Kant\u2019s way above the Keek!\u201d But I stand my ground. Kant is in rarefied 1st-tier realms, chatting in amiable low tones with Sartre, Descartes (who really seems slumming a bit, somehow). Lesser figures like Hegel, Heidegger and Chomsky crowding and milling around, wanting some of the glow to rub off. Nietzsche of course dignifies no such gatherings - and there\u2019s a conspicuous absence of ancient Greeks, who tend to think the young people make much of too many nothings, but whatever. \u201cWait!\u201d You protest belatedly. \u201cChomsky\u2019s not dead!\u201d Well of course he\u2019s not dead. What\u2019d\u2019ya think I\u2019m describing up there, heaven? No, it\u2019s a sort of eternal empyrean realm of immortal thought. Works of the mind that stand outside of time and for all time, and so their workers are present as a sort of handy distillation or go-by. Like docents, basically. Our puny conception couldn\u2019t manage to take it in otherwise. There you go. So that\u2019s how I shall-we-say conceptualize Immanuel Kant and his ilk. PRETTY HIGHLY. I give most of those thinkers \u201cthe nod\u201d - which is my highest accolade I\u2019ll accord to any thinker. Some I\u2019m still waiting for them to show me something, true, but I\u2019ve heard whispers and hints, reports from people whose minds I trust: there\u2019s something to this one. Good stuff there to be dug, and even if my first few sallies bounce off undented - blame the translation! That\u2019s what I do. It\u2019s so cool when after failed tries, some great thinker catches loose and \u201csinks in\u201d (somewhat; partially of course). Suddenly you get what they\u2019re on about. As yourself, how do you relate to Immanuel Kant? Quite right. The question. As myself, relating to Kant, I relate myself as a sort of\u2026well, no die-hard adherent, no maniac fan. But an appreciator. I\u2019m a big admirer of the name he\u2019s made for himself. I assume he wasn\u2019t born with that - it\u2019s fantastic, I love it (ed: nope, appears to have been his from the get-go): Immanuel Kant. Great for puns! And I\u2019ve read some of his stuff I thought was damn well-done, and other stuff where I sort of just scream-chortled and said, \u201cGWAAAAAAN!\u201d \u201cCome on Manny, you can\u2019t be putting yourself on as well as us, can you?\u201d In those cases I blame the translation. But I assure you: in every case where a thinker of huge repute comes charging through clear, lucid and bold in prose you can readily relate to I credit the translation (unless it was native English). I am no one-sided critic of translators! Praise is the better part of criticism, and I give it where due. It\u2019s a wicked-hard thankless job. Thank you, translators. Yeah. Basically I relate to Immanuel Kant with a sort of simple and dazed gratitude he came into the world, and did what he did, and give what he gave. He gave us Immanuel Kant. I\u2019m glad he bothered. Like I said, I\u2019m not the hugest most dedicated fan or devotee, but some of what he\u2019s done I liked. Regardless of my own, it means a lot to me that he did it. Because it\u2019s meant a ton to so many others as well. In ripples and waves of counter-expanding circles crossing each other, some of those others have meant worlds to me. Ultimately I relate to Immanuel Kant as homo sapiens sapiens, equal in moral authority to any one, equal in dignity and human worth to every one. Non-ultimately I relate to him as a dead guy. One of us who has been, and done, and gone. Yet as in the beginning of the answer, so too now I relate to him as one of the immortals. Because he gave thought to the world in such forms as still live, vital and worth engaging with. ",
