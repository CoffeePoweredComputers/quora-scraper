            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s assume that you are not nihilistic enough to believe that you do not even own your own body. (For the full nihilist who believes that he is simply an ambulatory carbon collection that belongs to the most violent, psychopathic thug, we\u2019d have to start at a more fundamental level.) Given: Self-Ownership:You own your own body.  Ownership: What \u201cownership\u201d means here is that you have the full and exclusive right to control your own body \u2014 to decide the who, what, when, where, how, and why for your body, as long as you respect other\u2019s equal ownership of their own bodies.  Right: What \u201cright\u201d means here is simply: The ethical right to use violence to enforce. Thus, my right of self-ownership simply means that I may ethically use violence should someone try to violate my ownership of my own body. (This does not mean that I will use violence, that my use of violence would be effective against overwhelming force, that violence would be permitted by my rulers (e.g., legal), nor that violence would be prudent. It only means that violence would be ethically permissible.)  Derived Prohibition of Chattel Slavery: Now, my body has a limited life-span, produces a finite amount of energy, and can endure only a certain amount of wear and tear before it is useless. The time my body lasts on this earth (my life-span), the amount of wear and tear my body endures, and the energy that my body produces are the outputs of my body. As I have ownership over my body, I retain ownership over these outputs of my body. Only I may decide how to use up my body\u2019s lifespan, its physical embodiment, and my body\u2019s energy. This is how we derive a right to, for example, not be the chattel slave of some master/ruler. A master/ruler wants to tell the chattel slavel how to use his body. However, as the full and exclusive owner of his body, only the man who would-otherwise-be a slave may decide how he will use up his own body. Now, the master/ruler might argue, \u201cI am not taking \u201cyour body\u201d; I am simply directing how your body ought to labor.\u201d But only the most nihilistic of us would not see this trick for what it is. The master/ruler is dictating how the chattel slave must spend his body\u2019s lifespan, how he must degrade his body, and into what project he must expend his body\u2019s energy. Those decisions, however, are his \u2014 because he is the full and exclusive owner of his own body. Many people will only focus on the violence that the master/ruler threatens to initiate on the body should a chattel slave not obey his master/ruler, and they will argue that it is this infliction of harm on the body that is the only reason for why chattel slavery is against human rights. And I admit that it is a gross violation of one\u2019s body to have it be (nonconsensually) injured by any thug. But the violation of human rights that prohibits chattel slavery occurs well before the body harm penalty is inflicted \u2014 the attempt to steal the lifespan, the physical composition, and the energy of that body is the ethical violation of your self-ownership.  Derived Prohibition of Retroactive Slavery: Now, most of you (at least since the late 1800s) have been educated in human rights enough to reject chattel slavery out-of-hand. (Well, except for certain classes of involuntary servitude to your rulers like \u201cthe Draft\u201d or \u201cNational Service\u201d or \u201cReporting your income to your rulers\u201d or \u2026). Even though you may not know why, you have been indoctrinated into an emotional rejection of chattel slavery. But, I hope you have followed the logic so far as to the why chattel slavery is evil, because we are getting to the place where most people get ethically confused. The outputs of one\u2019s body \u2014 your lifespan expended, the wear-and-tear on your body, and your body\u2019s energy consumed \u2014 remains yours even after you have stopped laboring. You see, we have very clever masters/rulers today who trick you into not associating the product of your body with its labor. You see, they will condemn with you that the violence against you to force you to labor directly for them would be \u201cslavery\u201d, but they will insist that laboring yourself, and then them stealing whatever your body produced, is not slavery whatsoever. Let\u2019s see if their claim holds water\u2026  Let\u2019s say that a master/ruler wants a People\u2019s Farm, where he can grown the best tomatoes for his ruler table. Here are four ways that he can obtain his farm: He expends his own body\u2019s energy (and that of people who voluntarily agree to help him).This is certainly the ethical option. He owns his own body and may use it up however he chooses. And if he chooses to use up his body to clear some unowned land and build with his own body a farm, that would be his choice for his body.The land that is now enhanced by his labors \u2014 it contains the land itself, but more importantly, it also contains part of his limited lifespan, the wear-and-tear of his body, and the energy that his body produced. He \u201cowns\u201d the land, in that he still owns his body\u2019s outputs that it took to find the land, to clear the land, and to build the farm. When he \u201csells the land\u201d, he is not selling the land per se; he is actually selling the part of his body now embedded in the land.He directly enslaves your body.This is the chattel slavery option, where he clearly (even for nonlibertarians) violates your self ownership by directly taking your body\u2019s lifespan, its wear-and-tear, and the energy your body produces as his own to direct to build his farm.(And we have already argued that this is a clear violation of self-ownership.)He steals your farm after you have built itNow, we get into his plausible deniability scenarios. In this third case, he tries to skirt around the obvious, logical violation of self-ownership which is chattel slavery by waiting until you have labored to find the land, to clear the land, and to build the farm. He then swoops in and claims the farm for himself.He\u2019ll claim that in this case, he is not violating your self-ownership like he would be if you were a \u201cchattel slave\u201d, even though he ends up with just the same amount of your body as his own as if he forced you directly to labor for him.It always amazes us libertarians how effective this slight of hand is on nonlibertarians. The master/slaver will argue \u201cYou don\u2019t own that land\u201d and therefore he may take it as his (or, more often, \u201cas the \u2018people\u2019s\u2019\u201d, although he controls it as \u201cthe people\u2019s\u201d steward) without your having any ethical right to object. But what he is hoping that you ignore is that the outputs of your body are inextricably embedded into the land. It is your body\u2019s depletion which made the land valuable, and It is the theft of your body\u2019s outputs that is the violation of your self-ownership.That he lay in wait for your body to complete laboring to build your farm and then stole it to make it his farm, versus stealing your body to directly build \u201chis\u201d farm, is a methodological difference of no ethical consequence.As you can see from this, all the master/ruler is doing here is retroactively turning you into a chattel slave. You labored on what you thought was your farm, and then he stole it (often with threats of violence) as his. The result is the same as if you had been violently forced to labor your body for him. I hope you can see by the logic offered so far that only the first method of acquiring the farm is ethical \u2014 in that only it respects the self-ownership of all the people\u2019s bodies. The second method (chattel slavery) directly violates your self-ownership, and the third method (retroactive slavery) violates your self ownership but hides it by a time delay. Because both #2 and #3 are violations of self-ownership, no matter how cleverly hidden, they are unethical. (See our Given.) It is from this argument that stealing and extortion are proven violations of human rights. But it\u2019s not the the theft of the property as much as it is the theft of your body that is embedded in the property. And you should note that it doesn\u2019t matter one bit who steals your body, what costume he\u2019s wearing, how many people are in his gang, or what he imagines will be the benefit \u201cto the people\u201d of his theft. He is violating your most fundamental human right \u2014 that of your self-ownership \u2014 by stealing the part of your body (lifespan, wear-and-tear, energy) that you used up to produce whatever he stole.  Derived Prohibition of Free-Range Slavery: However, there is a fourth method for the master/ruler to get his farm, and this is another level of indirection which seems to seal the deal for nonlibertarians to accept rulers\u2019 ultimate ownership of all their property. 4) He steals the output of your body when you labor on other projects and then trades your body\u2019s outputs for his farm. In this case, he is hiding his theft of your body \u2014 not just by hiding chattel slavery behind retroactive slavery, but by hiding it again behind what I call \u201cfree range slavery\u201d. Here, you need not even have to have been using up your body to build a farm (which he would then later steal). You see, theives riding out of the hills to steal one\u2019s farm and then setting up, having parties in it, and gorging themselves, is just too close to \u201cobviously wrong\u201d, that even nonlibertarians who don\u2019t worry about ethics might start objecting. Instead, the master/ruler uses one more level of indirection \u2014 he steals whatever it is that your body produces, and he trades that which he steals \u2014 which remember contains your body\u2019s lifespan, your body\u2019s wear and tear, and your body\u2019s energy \u2014 for someone else\u2019s labor to build his farm. Now, to the nonlibertarian, the farm looks just like case #1 \u2014 the master/ruler had ethically traded his body\u2019s labor for it fair and square. But the embedded body that he is using to trade is yours, taken nonconsensually. You may have labored on a painting, or on a fence, or on a computer program, or on helping a sick person get well. But then you made the mistake of storing the value of your labor temporarily in money. Your idea was that you would use the temporary storage of your labor into money to facilitate trading the value of your labor for the labor of someone else who created something that you really wanted (e.g., food, or shoes, or a trip to Bermuda). But because you have made the value of your used up body so tradeable, you have also made it much more stealable. And it is this part of your body that the master/slaver steals. And because money looks so different that your labor does, you forget that all that the money is is the stored labor coming from the limited resource that is your body.  Via these indirections, the master/ruler does not violently force you to use up your body directly for his farm (chattel slavery), nor does he need to wait for you to expend your body to create a farm and then violently steal it from you (retroactive slavery). Because we use money to temporarily store the value of our expended body, the master/ruler can steal parts of your body no matter which project you labor on, and then redeem your money for the expenditure of someone else\u2019s body to build his farm. However, note that the master/ruler is still stealing the product of your body even when he is stealing your money: he is stealing your body\u2019s time on earth; he is stealing your body\u2019s wear and tear; and he is stealing your body\u2019s produced energy. He is just hiding your chattel slavery behind two levels of indirection: Retroactive enslavementFree-range enslavement. TL;DR So, a \u201cright to property\u201d is not a fundamental right: it is a derived right from your fundamental right of self-ownership \u2014 from your ownership of your own body. Owning property is continuing to own that part of your body that you expended to create that property. Someone taking your property without your consent \u2014 no matter who he is and no matter what his grand plans are for it \u2014 is a violation of your ownership of your own body: the thief is stealing your body for his own purposes \u2014 he is in effect enslaving your body. And the indirections they throw in there to confuse you does not change the fact that they are at the end of the work day, trying to get you to accept being their (time-delayed, free-range, chattel) slave.

            "answer_text": "If a tree falls and nobody is around, does it make a sound? Let's consider a different natural right; freedom of association. This is another natural right derived from self ownership. Obviously, if you own your body then you can interact with others in any, mutually agreed way. However, what if you were literally the last person alive. Obviously you'd still be entitled to free association but there would be no mechanism to actually exercise that right. Do you actually have free association? Suppose the right of private property was limited to unicorns. The only thing you can own are unicorns but you can have as many as you like. Do you have any property rights? A communist might claim, sure, you have private property rights. Unfortunately, there is no private property for you to acquire. We own everything collectively. Try as you might to trade your labor for property, you'll find nobody who can trade with you because nobody individually owns anything and the group won't agree to sell anything to anyone. The Pope is perhaps the richest man in the world who owns nothing. He has a job for life, clothes, food, cars, homes, but he doesn't actually own any of it. He couldn't sell it or destroy it on a whim. Everything around him is the property of the church. The Pope has the right to private property but he has no private property nor any mechanism to obtain private property without first quitting the church. In this way, a communist can justify the morality of their commune. They are not denying your rights. They are merely eliminating every possible mechanism for you to exercise your rights. Yes, private property is a natural right but that does not imply it's actually possible for you to obtain private property\u2026 or a unicorn. I am a Georgist. It's like saying, \u201csure you have the right to privately own land, but none of this land is ever for sale.\u201d ",
