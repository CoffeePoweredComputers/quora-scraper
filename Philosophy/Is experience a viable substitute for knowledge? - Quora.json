            "answer_text": "Yes, it is, although not all knowledge is experience. For example, when you see that a desk is in front of you, you know that that desk is in front of you, and when you see that a car hits a passer-by, you know it. In these examples, visual experiences imply knowledge. But note that it is a common-sense way to understand the word \u201cexperience.\u201d If one is seriously influenced by empiricism or idealism, she might object that the above experiences are just something happening in our mind. Thus she might say we cannot reason the states of the external world form experiences in our minds. If so, she is a skeptic. But even if she is right, in the above situations we still have one kind of knowledge (since those experiences present some states of our minds). ",

            "answer_text": "Experience is a form of knowledge. Although having both hands on knowledge and continuing to learn by means of classroom, books, etc. is also a great thing. Knowledge is so valuable and learning is so important. The person that believes they know most or all is the fool, but the wise person knows they really never know enough. The other part about this is that knowledge casts out fear. I don\u2019t mean just random knowledge but knowing more about the things such as your field of expertise or in something that scares you. The more you know about something the more you can break it down into tolerable steps. ",
