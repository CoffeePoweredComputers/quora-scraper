            "answer_text": "A proper answer to this question must address three facts: \u2018Caucasian\u2019 is a very wrong term that should be dropped from common usage asap, unless in context when you refer to Georgians, Abkhazians, Laz, Chechens, Ingushes, Ossets, Circassians and other peoples who happen to currently live or ore known to have originated from the Caucasus mountain range. Some of these people, when immigrating to the USA, might not be classified as \u2018caucasian\u2019, which will sure make them scratch their heads.At no time in recorded human history there was any nation, except, maybe, some remote island, with a perfectly homogeneous population.There is evidence that Greece and Italy were diverse in ancient times \u2014 though not exactly in the sense we understand \u2018racial diversity\u2019. The afore-mentioned \u2018Caucasian\u2019 peoples are not in any way related to the people we call \u2018ancient Greeks\u2019 or \u2018Helenes\u2019 (which are not exactly the same as \u2018modern Greeks\u2019) and the \u2018Romans\u2019. There two other peoples there in the Caucasus which are somewhat related to the ancient Greeks and Romans: Armenians and Kurds. The peoples we call \u2018ancient Greeks\u2019 and \u2018Romans\u2019 were, actually, a small conquering population that settled on regions formerly occupied by other peoples since time immemorial. They succeeded into making their language dominate (which means they were numerous enough and successful enough in their enterprise), but there are some signs that they never fully displaced or exterminated the former settlers. Both Greek and Italic city-states were based on similar institutions inherited from the Indo-European settlers that settled the Mediterranean rim more or less the same way they settled the Middle East and Northern India. These institutions, in both places as well as in India, evince a social structure based on inherited privilege and racial castes. In Greece each city-state had a threefold separation of population. In Athens, for instance: The free men, which included the citizens, descendants of the city\u2019s founders (eupatrid\u00e6), the plebeians (geomoroi) and the working class (demiurge). Citizens were further divided into aristocrats (aristoi), knights (hippeis) and farmers (zeugit\u00e6);Foreign free men (metics), who were recognised as legitimate citizens of other cities, but had no civil rights outside their birthplace;Serfs (thetes), who had no rights and were not recognised as citizens of any place.Serfs didn\u2019t belong to any of the tribes (phylae) which had a recorded tradition. Since the recorded tradition was probably that of the free ruling class, it is implied that they didn\u2019t come with the invaders and were not of their same ethnic stock. However, in later stages of Greek civilisation, free men were reduced to serfdom as punishment for high treason, while a succession of political reforms granted serfs some power. In Rome a similar social order existed: Free men, further divided into patricians and plebeians;Allies and privileged foreigners;Serfs (the word \u2018slave\u2019 is anachronic in this context).It is known that the higher the social class, the \u2018whiter\u2019 a person was expected to be. In Imperial times, Roman women would bleach their hair using ammonia and their skin using leaded preparations so they would be more valuable as potential spouses for patrician men. Known patricians often took pride on using nicknames that referred to their fair features, like Ahenobarbus (wine-coloured beard), Rufus (red-haired), Albus and Albinus (white), Fabius and Fabianus (named after a white bean, Vicia faba), Lactantius (milk), Livius (pale), Lucius (\u2018light\u2019, may refer to \u2018fair-haired\u2019) and many others. This may hint at a perceived notion that the population was not homogeneous and that light skin and fair (or ginger) hair was a feature to be found mostly (or exclusively) among the ruling class. Both Greeks and Romans later encountered other peoples of Indo-European descent, like, mostly, the Gauls and the Germans, and these were described by both the Greeks and the Romans as exceedingly \u2018fair\u2019 in appearance, which suggests that miscegenation had already homogenised the populations of both Italy and Greece by the time they met these other peoples. The elements compounding to said miscegenation are not entirely known to us because very little is known about the autochthonous peoples of Europe, as they left no recorded history. However, even without them, there would be plenty of miscegenation between the Indo-European invaders and peoples like Phoenicians, Egyptians, Carthaginians, Cretans, Cypriots, Iberians, Numidians, Libyans and Illyrians. In early times, the caste system prevailed and denied access to higher positions to anyone of lowly birth. But social reforms and the changing economic situation blurred the lines between patricians and rich plebeians as well as between poor plebeians and serfs. It eventually became possible to buy your way up, sometimes by way of getting \u2018adopted\u2019 by a patrician man. And the Romans eventually granted citizenship to all provinces (or to the higher classes of every province). This whole strongly suggests a situation in which a sparsely populated region (because agriculture and husbandry had not developed enough among the locals to afford high density) was settled by invaders who spoke a different language and were physically different (at least in hair color and skin tone). In the following 2,000 years this situation changed a lot. ",

            "answer_text": "Greeks and Romans were anywhere from Mediterranean to dark brown. Males were traditionally represented dark-skinned, and women fair-skinned. But not \u201cCaucasian\u201d for sure, because Caucasian is an invention of the last couple of centuries. In general it is extremely wrong to apply modern categories of race and skin color to ancient times. For example, Greeks praised fair-skinned women (because that meant they did not leave the house much, i.e., they were likely rich and chaste), but scorned Persians for having pale skin (because they never took off their clothes out of shame \u2014 for Greeks it was a matter of strength and health to walk around naked on the sun). Google \u201cFayum portraits\u201d to get an idea of how people of antiquity looked like. ",
