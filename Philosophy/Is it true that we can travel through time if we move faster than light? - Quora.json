            "answer_text": "Ya\u2026\u2026.that\u2019s absolutely true. You have just heard!! What are you waiting for ? Just read it! And you'll find it much more interesting than just hearing about it! Let's begin here. First of all , let me explain you what time dilation is? And how does it works. Before 1905 , time had a completely differnt meaning from the one which we have today. Newton gave his laws of motion. Newton gave emphasise to the relative speed and motion. In accord to Newton , time is same everywhere and for everyone. It is like a \u201cconstant\u201d which is same everywher and for evryone. According to Newton , the time on earth is exactly the same as the time on jupiter , time on pluto and even the time on any other planet in any other galaxy far away from us. Newton considered space as a different arena and time as an another . But during the first decade of the twentieth century , Einstein dismantled the rigid absolute structure that Newton had erected , and built his own tower , synthesizing space and time in a manner that was completely unanticipated. When he was done , time had become so enmeshed with space that the reality of one could no longer be pondered saperately fron the other. Yes that is the theory of Relativity. Now consider a space and time graph of a stationary object. I would show a rough graph.  This is the graph. Now one thing to be noticed here that whatever i will explain that will be \u201c relative to something\u201d. Means the \u201c stationary object \u201c is at rest relative to something. Ok. Keep that in mind. Coming to the point. Consider the graph. The straight line , parallel to the time axis shows that the body is not changing it's position with respect to the space but it does that with time. Means all the motion of the body is due to its movement in time. When the object starts to move , it changing its position relative to some thing. May be relative to space. Now the motion of the body is not all because its movement in time but also in movement with space. This creates the time dilation. To understand this let's take an example. Suppose there are two.people Max and john. Max is sitting at the bench and enjoying a cup of tea. While john is standing still. Notice that both are at a distance to each other. Since both of them are at rest relative to each other , the only motion they had that is all of movement in time( Consider the graph) . Now what would happen if John starts moving towards Max? If this happens , john would make a proggessive motion in space and time relative to max. Motion of john would not be the motion with time but now \u2026..his motion will be with both space and time together. He would feel nothing with him. Everything will go as it is use to be with him when he was at rest. The question is what would happen if Max ( at rest) would observe john in motion? He would observe that the time on John's watch ticks slower than his own watch. He would be blundered surprised. He would see that the speed of john \u2026\u2026the speed of everthing he posses slows down with the exact same amount. This creates time dilation. ( Actually this never happens. The example is given to make you clear with the concept of time dilation.) Actually I can not hide the fact that it do happen but the effect is so so so so so minute that we would never experience it. Thus moving objects prefers time dilation. Now, whatever did I write that is for simply moving objects. You would wonder as you have heard that only objects moving with the speed of light posses time dilation but that's not(only) true. Moving objects posses time dilation. Hence it can be concluded that as the speed (of an object) increases , the time dilation also increases ( in accord to Einstein's special relativity). Thus at a speed equal or more than the speed of light (theoritically which is not possible ) the time dilation is maximum. Hope this would work out. I have written the answer in a laymen language. You will easily understand it. Please correct me where i am wrong. Thank you!!! ",

            "answer_text": "If you are running at more than the speed of light, you cannot slow down to below the speed of light. You can send signals backwards in time, but you are not necessarily moving backwards in time. If you are running at less than the speed of light, there is no way that you can speed up to more than the speed of light. This makes communication between faster than the speed of light particles and slower than the speed of light particles difficult or, more likely, impossible. Mathematically, this would look like communication between imaginary time and real time. A really strange interpretation of faster than light movement is that it is the *cause* of electrostatic and gravitational force. Where does the energy come from to power gravity and magnets? Graphically, the standard relativity story looks like this:  If you are traveling at more than the speed of light, you are outside of the past and future light cones. You are a tachyon. I find it a little bit interesting that the tachyon lines intersect with the \u201chyperspace of the present\u201d. Ordinarily, we can\u2019t instantaneously communicate (interact) with objects at a distance from us, making questions about interaction with tachyons moot, but quantum entanglement makes some of those questions valid. Graphically, a more liberal interpretation of relativity looks like this:  According to what we think we know, tachyons don\u2019t exist because we can\u2019t measure them and if they could send signals backwards in time in a way which would affect the present, this would cause a bunch of paradoxes. Whenever you encounter a paradox in science, you should take it as an indicator that there is something about your theory which is probably wrong. I don\u2019t think that the appropriate response to a paradox is to tie your mind in a knot and suspend disbelief for the sake of your precious theory. Many things that we think about relativity are not actually paradoxical when we properly understand the constraints on the theory: What is the solution to the ladder paradox in special relativity? -Kirsten Hacker ",
