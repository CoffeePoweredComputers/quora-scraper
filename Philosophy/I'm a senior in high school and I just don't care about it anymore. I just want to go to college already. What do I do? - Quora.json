            "answer_text": "Haha, I totally understand how you feel.  I am also a graduating Senior and I occasionally catch senioritis-- a strain of carelessness and apathy in school characterized by missing assignments and tardies. Here is something that may hopefully add insight to your perspective on the last few months of High School. You're almost done, but that's not the same as being done. In fact, you're only almost done with High School, but you're never through with learning. After High School, you're going to start learning not for the sake of a grade, but for the sake of yourself. Learn to learn better. Be interested and engaged, that will make all class time pass by.Set new goals. Here's how I perceive it-- when I go to college, I get a brand new opportunity to remake who I am. \"What skill do I wish I had possessed in High School?\" That's what I'm going to start working now with this time to become closer to who I'd like to be (for example, I'm trying to read much more so that I will be more cultured and insightful when I reach my first college seminar)Have fun. Spend some more times with friends. Or try making new friends. It's still not too late to participate and explore your interests.Endure until the end. Do not slack off and let your grades slip the last year of High School. You worked too hard to achieve this much, you need to end just as strong as you started, no longer for colleges or teachers, but for yourself. When you expect more from yourself, you start gaining more from your efforts.That's what I have so far. Enjoy yourself! You've done well and buckle up for a new journey! :) Good Luck! Chris Lin ",

            "answer_text": "I graduated a year early and while others went to their senior high school year, I was in college. Much happier with a more mature group of friends. Had goals. I really didnt care about high school life.. I picked up my diploma from the school office the summer after 11th grade and never looked back. My life started once I got out of high school and started college. That is just my story. There were several others that did the same thing. Did we regret not going to senior prom? Nope. Did we regret not having a group graduation? Nope. Pep rallys..who cares. School sports? Not really, we were busy working part time jobs and taking college courses. No student loans no debt for me and a few others. We were motivated and thankful we did not have to sit through another year at high school. Some feel more comfortsble moving on. No one is right or wrong\u2026.just what was comfortable for different students. ",
