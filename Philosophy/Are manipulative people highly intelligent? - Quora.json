            "answer_text": "Of course not. We are all born manipulative. Toddlers present behaviours that in an adult would be called manipulative. Manipulation is purely a basic reflex. The most you can say is that people who are not manipulative have a flaw called empathy, if you want to see it that way. Manipulating is very simple. You smile and complement a lot when others behave in a way that it is convenient for you, and you get seriously angry when they do something that it is not. Avoid compromise, and never see something from the other\u00b4s point of view. It\u2019s really important to constantly play the victim so it seems like it is someone else\u2019s fault. If someone calls you out on your game, you scream and say they are attacking you and being mean. And although you never see things from the other\u2019s perspective, always complain and demand that everyone sees things from your side. There, you have achieved manipulation. Smarter people tend to be less manipulative because they voluntarially contradict their personal bias, and make an effort to look at the bigger picture. The result is that a lot of times, because of this empathy and comprehension they end up finishing last. But if manipulative people are not smart they always think they are the smartest. Certainly we al tend to over rate our own intelligence but manipulators loose sight of reality. Manipulative people always lie a lot, creating the most implausible and pathetic lies, expecting others to believe. Of course, most of the time, others realize they are lying, but no one likes confrontation, so everyone pretends to believe or just ignore. The result is that the manipulators get this feeling that they are some kind of masterminds, and dive head first on their lying rampage. Another common trait for manipulators is never letting anyone pointing their failures, blocking it the most aggressive way. But when something comes up, they\u2019ll easily say \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you said anything?\u201d. Again, it\u2019s someone else\u2019s fault. Eventually, others get fed up and move away. They will just move on to manipulate someone else, and they keep on moving. At some point, they realize that everyone around them moves away. Even then, they still feed the need to blame others, so it\u2019s common for them to start making vague accusations to no one in particular. You have probably stumbled upon some vague sentences on facebook as : \u201c some people don\u2019t deserve our attention\u201d, \u201cI should have learn not to trust everyone\u201d. But while some manipulators get lost in personal intrigue others thrive in business. These are slightly different as they embrace their manipulation techniques. They face their cognitive dissonance by describing everything as a game, and any behaviour is acceptable as part of the rules. Lying, failing to pay or to keep a promise, intrigues, bullying or exploiting someone in despair is all part of the game. There are actually a few famous books on how to be a total jerk. The most famous one is \u201cRich Dad. Poor Dad\u201d. It\u2019s written as a self-help book, and throws a few ideas about investment, but is mostly just a manual about not having ethics. It actually says you should make ridiculous offers, and those who take it serious are failing to understand that it\u2019s just a game. The name of the book refers to the main character ignoring his very intelligent and responsible dead who never made a fortune, to follow an uneducated millionaire who takes joy in exploring and tricking his employees and everyone around him. This book should be enough to answer your question, as it describes how smart people are constantly manipulated by those who are less smart but much more manipulative. Another book on this topic is \u201c48 laws of power\u201d, which just describes 48 ways of manipulating others for personal gain. The author calls it \u201claws\u201d to give the feeling that it\u2019s the only way to go about it. To pretend that honesty and transparency are not an option, being a jerk is just a consequence of nature. You will never find a manipulative technique that requires any intelligence whatsoever. ",

            "answer_text": "Manipulation is a skill just like software development is a skill. It's a science and an art at the same time. It's the science of understanding human behaviour and involves controlling perceptions. I.e. you know what you want the person to think so you lead them towards that by controlling their thinking. It's a learned behaviour. It's what marketers do. Being misleading, dishonest, generally corrupt, and knowing who to weed out are part of the toolkit. That's how organizations are built. That's how Steve Jobs got kicked out of his own business. Manipulation doesn't spring from good character. But then again you don't need good character to climb whichever ladder you are climbing. You need skills that will help you reach your power and popularity goals. Manipulation is one of em. Is that smart? if that's what smart means to you, then sure. Some people may have moral and ethical concerns with it and may have a difficult time sleeping at night. But then again, you don't need morality to climb up whichever ladder you are climbing. You need skills that will get you through. Your own brand and image is way more important than the clown working on your team. I've been around manipulators and my observation is that they: - Talk a lot, like a lot. And often about other people, their work, their personal life etc.- Like to be everywhere, all kinds of groups, love to socialize and connect so they can build their *power network*- Endlessly talk about what they've done, doesn't have to be world class.- Love to impose authority whenever possible and often times forcefully, like goons.- Will steal ideas and take credit for it. I personally don't consider these people worthy of respect. Manipulation has deep roots in insecurity. It can help reach goals and so some are ok with being manipulative. Manipulative behaviour can be hard to see. It will appear normal. It really takes a sharp eye and observation to catch it. Once you catch it, cleanse yourself from the company of these people. They are grossly toxic. ",

            "answer_text": "No. . It takes no brains to manipulate ppl for your own selfish desires. Although it does take low functioning empathy if any to follow through and manipulate ppl knowingly for your own benefit or really at all. . It takes a pretty dumb person not to be able to look at things from another's perspective and realize that ppl do not like being manipulated because who wants to be manipulated? I think it's not a smart thing, it takes no skill. . But realizing that would take a smart person. So ppl who manipulate ppl are weak and would typically not get what they desire otherwise\u2026 it's like a toddler. . The only way they can communicate is by crying. It's not being manipulative as a toddler by any means but ppl do get this backwards which is weird but because this is their only form of language. . But you take a grown adult who cries because they want something out of someone, I mean come on. These ppl simply can not verbalize or Express it in actual words so they go round about it in ways that get ppl to do what they want them to do because they are usually not credible enough on their own for ppl to listen to them because they are probably known for lying extensively. . They havent figured out how ppl can work in a healthy way yet with actual communication (I assuming they speak in words) so no they are not intelligent. anyone can be manipulative and we all are at times but the kind I think you might be talking about are not emotionally nor intellectually intelligent.. They are reverting back to what toddlers do but they are grown. What's smart about that besides getting something they want the easy way. . Do it the adult way. . And if you cant do it that way then realize what you are doing and why you cant do it that way. . I bet they cant do that. . Does that sound like a smart person? They might realize why they may get something they want but they still feel ashamed\u2026 insight ppl Insight is 100x more complicated and and takes much much more skill than learning what is acceptable and lying to meet those standards. ..hell a kid could do that. . Where is their actual understanding and perspectives (like real perspectives) not just what is acceptable and unacceptable lol again a kid can do this. I'm terribly confused where that is being interpreted as seeing different perspectives??? We all can freaking do this.. Knowing what someone likes? I know what ppl like. . But am I going to lie to them and say this is exactly that if it isn't? No. They will see that it isn't and they wont like it and I'm not stupid enough to believe everyone is dumb and naive enough to not see it. . Nor do I believe that anything of the sort is nice. . What's smart is actually developing this said thing to be what YOU KNOW someone would enjoy and actually creating just that.. Then it would not only be for their own benefit but the person they are trying to help. . We can help each other and also help ourselves. . How is this such a hard to understand concept? Because ppl are lazy and lazy ppl are not smart. They just lie and do nothing. . It takes nothing to do that??? If we all did that we'd all die lol smart? Okay.. They are definitely not the reason we as a whole are alive and well. If anything they are everything that is wrong with the world but they just simply can not see beyond their own freaking perspective\u2026 If you call this a skill you definitely need some insight.. they aren't great observers. . Half the time they would see that ppl just go along with them because usually whatever they are saying or doing is so absurd that ppl have no idea what to say and dont want to make the stupid ppl feel bad. . Or should I say worse than they already do to even be stooping that low to have to do those things. They have no choice because they are dumb ",

Cultivate that capacity for \"negative capability.\" We live in a culture where one of the greatest social disgraces is not having an opinion, so we often form our \"opinions\" based on superficial impressions or the borrowed ideas of others, without investing the time and thought that cultivating true conviction necessitates. We then go around asserting these donned opinions and clinging to them as anchors to our own reality. It's enormously disorienting to simply say, \"I don't know.\" But it's infinitely more rewarding to understand than to be right \u2013 even if that means changing your mind about a topic, an ideology, or, above all, yourself. Keep pushing: Teamwork and Collaboration: 14 Tactics to Get You Better Results Know who you are When people tell you who they are, Maya Angelou famously advised, believe them. Just as importantly, however, when people try to tell you who you are, don't believe them. You are the only custodian of your own integrity, and the assumptions made by those that misunderstand who you are and what you stand for reveal a great deal about them and absolutely nothing about you. Expand your presence Presence is far more intricate and rewarding an art than productivity. Ours is a culture that measures our worth as human beings by our efficiency, our earnings, our ability to perform this or that. The cult of productivity has its place, but worshipping at its altar daily robs us of the very capacity for joy and wonder that makes life worth living .

            "answer_text": "Manipulation - Let\u2019s see what it is first. Manipulation, usually mentioned, is doing something because someone else had convinced you to do it, which benefits him/her (*notice there is no phrase \u201cbut not you\u201d) Manipulation is done by someone to achieve their ends. And they use the common phrase \u201cthe ends justify the means\u201d to justify what they have done. Are manipulative people smart? Not necessarily. They have enough experience and skill to connect the dots to make you do something that you might not have done earlier if they didn\u2019t manipulate you to do so. Let me illustrate : Watch these 2 sentences carefully. If you liked what I have written, please hit the like button or follow my blog (website)If you liked this, you will definitely like this awesome other post I have written. Check it out and if you like it, follow my blog (website)What would you choose if this was there on the site you were reading? You\u2019d most probably choose option 2, right. Why? Because he\u2019s giving you more than what you\u2019ve got. Look at it in a different way. He\u2019s convincing you to make a decision that is in his favor rather than what you\u2019d have done. This is kind of a manipulation. It is done in his favor. These are harmless manipulations. If the article is good, you\u2019d feel that he had influenced you. That is the small difference between those two words. The after taste. Manipulation makes you feel bad about yourself, but influence makes you feel good. Coming back to the question. Manipulators are smart, skilled people. Probably, the definition of smartness might not apply to them. But they have an idea of what to do to make you do something that they want. It might be in their favor or not. They know which switches to push on your remote control. That\u2019s why they are smart. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly. A successful manipulator has a high-level of metacognition, which, I\u2019d argue, most, and by most, 90% of the people I met, altough very good in their fields, don\u2019t have. The brain of the manipulator is swift, creative, adapted and he can be called very intelligent. The best manipulator(s) I\u2019ve seen are these who can create situations in, which, if they get discovered or someone smells something, they can go back and find a reasonable argument for what they\u2019ve done and they\u2019re believed. This is the cherry on the cake of manipulation - to have bridges to fall back onto, should something go wrong. Unfortunately, manipulators who are in the making do one fatal mistake, which, I\u2019d argue, is the opposite of what an intelligent person would do, albeit, remember, they\u2019re on their way up there: Thinking that they\u2019re always in control. In order for successful manipulation to happen, one has to not push it too hard and has to always assume that the person that\u2019s being targeted is aware of your manipulation. Also, don\u2019t ask this question to everyone and everywhere, if you say things such as \u201cpeople can be manipulated\u201d, they\u2019ll retaliate with a hearty no and tell you that you\u2019re a bit full of yourself.

There's no fucking excuse and I'm tired of hearing people coming to their rescue when they should be rescuing themselves and the rest of us from those vile people by just not taking their side. There's a reason bully's exist and it's because people are so fucking stupid and sympathetic to the bad guy and completely disregard the ones that are getting fucked with for no reason. It annoys the fuck out of me! Edit: I was reading my answer that came from a place in my life where I was getting torn apart by manipulative people and that's where all that anger came from. My answer to the question is yes and no. Manipulative people are smart at deceiving people to get what they want but stupid because that just adds to their misery in the end. It's the type of smart that's not really good for any reason other than getting what they want while destroying themselves and others in the process. Too smart for their own good (and other people's good) and only smart in the wrong way. If they were really smart they would be able to make it through life without being parasites. ",

People who are great at observations and know certain patterns of people\u2019s reactions have the potential to manipulate people. Based on their observations to a certain stimuli, fear, threat, or make someone buy something, a person can observe all that to create a method to gain something from that someone without having them know. For example, when soldiers walk in marshes to attack or sniper someone, they can manipulate their enemy to think that they are not there by the clothing they wear, the twigs on their bodies, etc. that make them look that a bush from far away. Simply, manipulating is an act of deceiving someone to think of something as not harmful when actually, things are used against them and can harm their mentality, etc. Another example is when magicians create illusions and understand certain weaknesses of the way we see plus our attention spans. If a magician wants to perform a disappear trick, they will need to do it real quick plus diverting the audiences\u2019 attention. Same goes for pickpockets. Pickpockets know that if someone is not looking, they can take something because you don\u2019t feel it and that the things out of our viewpoint become invisible. In that case, this video would demonstrate that: The art of misdirection | Apollo Robbins  Brain magic | Keith Barry  In conclusion, you don\u2019t have to be smart to be manipulative. All you have to do is to be observant. The more you are observant, the more you will learn and catch what makes people react and what fools people. ",

            "answer_text": "If you consider skill at manipulation to be a form of intelligence, then the question answers itself. Those who don\u2019t consider adeptness at manipulation to be a form of intelligence might be enforcing their own emotional biases. Being able to manipulate others requires a certain degree of social intelligence at the very least. It also requires a clear understanding of cause and effect within the very complex sphere of social behavior. Manipulative behaviors may call upon a high level of skill in communication, acting, deception, subversion, fabrication, etc., depending on the specifics of the given situation. Those activities all call for a high level of intelligence to pull off successfully. So yes, I\u2019d say that being manipulative is itself a form of being smart (assuming that by \u201cmanipulative people,\u201d you mean \u201cpeople who are good at manipulation\u201d and not \u201cpeople who attempt to engage in manipulation regardless of whether or not they\u2019re any good at it\u201d.). I\u2019m not saying anything of whether it is moral or productive to be manipulative, because that\u2019s not what\u2019s being asked here. ",

In time becomes an acquired skill, like any other skill; some of us focus on achieving a great career out of our practiced profession (a certain skill), manipulators focus mostly on manipulating, is some sort of a niche in their brain and in time becomes nature, they manipulate like we breathe air. Focus on learning how to manipulate and you will gain yourself a skill, regardless of your IQ. Kids can do it, anyone can do it, is human nature. ",

It takes a larger brain capacity to be a skilled manipulator because you're creating several different scenarios and outcomes prior and during a conversation with the person you're trying to manipulate. We have high emotional intelligence- in the sense that we understand the makeup of personalities and people and easily figure out what makes a person tick or lust after. But In terms of raw intelligence or IQ it varies. Being manipulative is not an easy task. For, you are only a true manipulator if you can manipulate people without them knowing or caring that you are. It's an art and a skill that takes time to master. ",

Even in difficult times, people will look at them with suspicion and never believe them. So once upon a time the manipulative skill misconstrued as smartness & shrewedness, once encouraged & wondered by others will become a burden at a later stage. ",

Actually, they usually only share pertinent information about themselves. Your guess is as good as mine about how accurate what they say is, but I digress. I would think if they were constantly talking about themselves they wouldnt be able to commit to any disinformation about their personal experiences that could make a situation beneficial to him somehow. That just seems like poor strategy to constantly talk about yourself and the things you've done in the past. That, would actually open yourself up to be manipulated because you had over shared. ",
