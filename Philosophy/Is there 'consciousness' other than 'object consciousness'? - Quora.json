            "answer_text": "Answer not your terms, since about consciousness, science has only hypotheses and no demonstration. \u00ab Is that consciousness is reduced to the 'consciousness of something' or not? \u00bb is a subject of disagreement between philosophers and scientists. Your version of the question intends to reduce it even further, to objects. It is easy to answer yes, for example giving a conscience to the intrauterine foetus, which is certainly devoid of objects. Here's a more complicated answer: Start from the minimum to the notion of consciousness, and avoid the trap of dualism, as 'I am conscious of...' which appears already an 'I' which one cannot say the origin. the minimum for a consciousness is to experience.Support to this felt need. There is something that feels.Is it necessary that this something has representations of what is foreign? Not necessarily. Here we are already beyond the minimum limits for establishing the existence of a conscience. Thus, there is a consciousness without objects, or even representations. The more sensitive question, that we have deliberately ignored in the previous paragraph, is: \u00ab Is there a consciousness without support? \u00bb Let's drop any esotericism, which takes us away from the scientist. Is consciousness linked to specific neurons? Complete brain? The entire body? At the presence of its environment? You guess that can put a little Yes in all these suggestions. This gives us an indispensable preliminary to answer: what we call 'consciousness' is a variety of states. Formed by one of them, consciousness is unable to recognize: there is nothing else to watch. Consciousness can recognize these states only that if it built representations for each of them. That is, there is a difference between 'consciousness in the state of a relationship with an object' (composed exclusively of the relationship with this object, pure feeling) and 'consciousness of an object' (introduces a representation between the object and which contemplates; in the contents of consciousness we detached a level of observation). Complicated. However this approach has a major advantage: it allows to connect to the neuroscientist view of the brain, which defines consciousness as higher integration network between different nerve centers. My adaptation in 'Diversium' is to see this network as a layered conceptual hierarchy rather than as simple conjunction of mental functions. In this stratification, you have a repeated sequence of a level of representation and another that observes and evaluates it. So, you have the beginnings of a 'consciousness of something', that grows as the observation levels accumulate and result in feeling extremely complex we have in 'full' consciousness. Have I lost? The concern is that it is difficult to explain rationally how it can exist a consciousness that is not 'of something', without falling into mysticism. If you understand the above, finally here's your answer: The great diversity of states of consciousness comes from what they are composed. Some of these elements are strongly stratified conceptually, others very little. For example if you focus your feelings on the image of a close person or a pain in your body, you perceive well that the former is much more heterogeneous than the second. Among the objects occupying your consciousness at the office, the chair you sit on takes up very little space compared to your smartphone. If you manage to rid your consciousness of all its elements strongly stratified and connected (that are striving to make people who meditate), this does not completely empty it, of course. Still, the presence of the body. This is imperative and very little stratified, as you know when you take the urge to go to the restrooms, or if you have suffered severe pain (acute sciatica, peritonitis...). Still, the presence of mood (emotions never vanish completely). Still, the presence of non-focused integrative neural network activity. 'Non focus' means 'no retro-control conscious' representations. They freely occupy consciousness. They are not 'seen'. In fact the conscience without 'consciousness of' is above all putting in the shadow the left prefrontal cortex, headquarters of the self-assessment and the attention to the world. This gives pre-eminence to the emotional, bodily areas, at rest; thoughts are freed from the individualism of representations and external events, strongly stratified. This is the origin of the collectivist feeling of fusion to the \u2018whole\u2019, occupying consciousness who meditates.Standby of 'which observes' to make way for 'which experiences\u2019. ",

            "answer_text": "Thousands of expert meditators over time have reported that in deep sleep, when there are no dreams, no objects perceived whatsoever, that they have had experiences of being aware. This is known in Tibetan Buddhism as the mind of clear light. If you experienced it, would that be a proof for you?  One could say: in this case, the objects are there, the person is just not perceiving them. But what is the difference then between a person in deep sleep and a corpse? Both do not experience the objects that are there; however for the clear light meditator, something else is happening. What is that something else? I think this question must be answered experientially rather than experimentally, but until then, here's a treat for you: I would point you towards the magisterial writings of Franklin Merrell-Wolff, particularly The Philosophy of Consciousness Without an Object, and a companion book, his experiential journal Pathways Through to Space. I first found the latter many years ago in a little bookstore in Delavan, Wisconsin, after my grandmother's funeral. I read it in the back seat as my parents drove us away, my sadness slowly being lit up by Dr. Wolff's otherworldly and profound vision. Take a look at him. Maybe you'll see something:   Years later I hiked up Mount Whitney looking for an abandoned ashram he'd built of stone with his students. There was a forest fire burning on the other side of the mountain sending up great plumes of smoke. Though I thought I might get into trouble, I had to go check out the stones he'd placed and fast-paced it up the trail. Awesome site. You can go up there and search for consciousness without an object and you might just find it. No lie.  These days non-dual teachings and teachers are a dime a dozen. Dr. Wolff was Stanford- and Harvard-trained mathematician and philosopher who left to pursue a spiritual path he had to discover brick by brick, given that it did not exist in America in 1915. His writings demonstrate the brilliant mind of a pioneer who had absorbed Western philosophy but had to go deeper. Though I personally went on to immerse myself in the teachings of the Tibetan Vajrayana, I will always admire the Herculean efforts Wolff made and his lyrical, penetrating, economical prose. Romantic in feeling and Transcendentalist through and through, here is a genuine American sage who dug deeply into your question.  ",
