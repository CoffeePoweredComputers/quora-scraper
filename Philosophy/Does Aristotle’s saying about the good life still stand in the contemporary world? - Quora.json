            "answer_text": "True faith, the real foundation of goodness, came into the Hellenic world from the Levant about two thousand years ago. From this viewpoint, upheld in Scriptures, the Hellenic philosophies and religions were a kind of preparation for people to receive the greatest gift. From that point on, the fate of their nations and cultures hinged upon how they related to this cultural and spiritual infusion. In today\u2019s world, we face the same issue, and the same dichotomy. We are always standing at the crossroads, both in our personal moral lives, and in the public life and national life, between a \u201cHellenistic\u201d or world-centered philosophy, and the \u201cHebraistic\u201d or God-centered philosophy. The same dualism extends into modern science also, as science is both a contributor and an expression of culture on the whole. Medieval Christians formed a synthesis incorporating Aristotelian philosophy with Christian faith. Though despised or taken exception to in many ways, there are certainly lessons to learn from such saints as Augustine and Aquinas, for they constructed a model balance between Hellenism and Hebraism. The basic position of Graeco-Roman culture was \u201cMens sana in corpore sano\u201d \u2014 \u201cA sound mind in a sound body.\u201d Christian culture took much of what was good from Hellenic culture, including such great writers as Vergil, Ovid, Seneca, and of course the old sages, Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. We have a predecessor of the \u201ctrinitarian\u201d concept in the triangle of \u201ctruth, beauty and goodness\u201d or \u201cThe True, The Beautiful, and the Good\u201d \u2014 perhaps a far cry from Clint Eastwood\u2019s spoof in \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d!

            "answer_text": "Hell, yes it does. You can save yourself a lot of time and effort if you will just throw away all the current self help books on your bookshelf and get a copy of Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics instead. But, if really want to do yourself a favor read Plato\u2019s Apology as well. The latter is Plato\u2019s account of Socrate\u2019s defense at his public trial in Athens in 399 B.C. There is much to learn from Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle \u2014 as many people have discovered for themselves for the last 2,400 years. There is a reason why those books have never gone out of print. ",
