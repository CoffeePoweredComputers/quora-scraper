            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t say there are any cons, per se, but it is possible to read his novels without getting too deep into his philosophy. The Stranger is a quick read, and you might wonder how and why he\u2019s describing what sounds like an ordinary day in such detail. Don\u2019t put the book down yet. Keep reading. By the time you get to the last page, it will make sense. The Plague is possibly the best disaster novel I\u2019ve ever read. Yes, better than The Road. Even though it all takes place in just one city, people are just as dead, and you get all the tropes. Anyway, have fun! ",

            "answer_text": "Whoever tells you there are cons about reading Albert Camus is lying. Though I would say if you have trouble reading philosophy essays or large books, you might have some issues with some of his work. For exemple, his novel The Plague is truly great but it can seem long to read for some people (the first time I read it was during my first year of high school and I must admit I skipped pages at some point).But otherwise, Camus\u2019 work is so interesting and you will learn so much from reading it that it\u2019s worth at least trying. If you want to start with something that is easy to read, I would advise The Stranger or The Myth of Sisyphus. ",
