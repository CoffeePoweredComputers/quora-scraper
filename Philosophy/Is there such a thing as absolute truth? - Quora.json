            "answer_text": "Here\u2019s my admittedly biased answer I posted to a similar question: Only new ideas get much air time these days, so there\u2019s a good chance many won\u2019t read this to the end. If you\u2019re really interested in learning what truth is, though, read on. Although this is not a new idea, the fact is that truth can only be found in God. Here\u2019s why\u2026 Truth #1: Absolute truth exists. Truth cannot be relative, according to logic. For anyone to claim that truth is relative (\u201cThat\u2019s your truth, but not mine.\u201d) requires that person to make an absolute judgment: \u201cNo truth is universal\u2026 except for what I\u2019m saying right now.\u201d But the statement \u201cAbsolute truth does exist\u201d bears no such contradiction, Q.E.D. Truth #2: The creator of all things is truth. The only thing which can claim to be absolute truth is that thing which is greater and more substantial than all other things in the cosmos. Assuming there was a creator of all things, that thing must be greater than all created things, since nothing could have existed before that creative force. For any thing to be able to create everything else, it must have always been self-existent, since no thing can create itself. Any concept of truth\u2014i.e., how every thing in the cosmos operates and relates to every other thing and the creator\u2014must be based on the standards of the creator of all things. Since that force created all things, it sets the rules. Truth #3: God is that creator. The God of the Bible has revealed himself to be a person, not simply an impersonal force. He has shown man the importance of taking moral choices, and has given him the ability to distinguish good from evil. This concept of complex morality is not exhibited in the animal kingdom. The idea that man is simply the product of the strongest animals which survived cannot account for how man has any sense of morality. The biblical account of creation and a creator does account for it by simply stating that God\u2014the moral center of what man calls right\u2014put the concept in man when he created him. Truth #4: God established a code for man to be able understand the moral standard by which God has decided to judge all men (the Mosaic Law). No man is good enough to keep to such a strict standard, however. In other words, God set the rules and man failed in keeping them. So God substituted himself (in the form of Jesus) to take the punishment we have all earned by our immoral choices. The substitution did not eliminate the moral standard, but satisfied the punishment that standard demanded. Truth #5: Believing that Jesus is your only hope of being justified before God, and allowing him to show you how to begin taking right choices, is the essence of being a Christian. As it has been said, Jesus didn\u2019t substitute himself for us to make good people better, he died on our behalf to make dead people alive again. To quote the X-Files, the truth really is out there. You can read it for yourself in the Bible: a very old book with old statements\u2026 of truth. ",

            "answer_text": "You've stumbled upon one of the most difficult predicaments in philosophy. To cover this in depth would require many dissertations, and you could wrestle with this topic for your entire life without a satisfactory answer. For this reason, I won't attempt to give you any kind of definite answer. One thing I would like to point out, however, is the distinction between \"absolute\" truth and \"objective\" truth. \"Absolute\" truth, as you indicated, means truth that is unchanging, final, and unqualified. \"Objective\" truth, on the other hand, means truth that isn't dependent upon a subject's perspective, but upon the object from a disinterested point of view. Furthermore, one could speak about something as being \"universally true\" of both an object and a subject. This means it applies to every single particular case. Although many might argue that an \"objective\" and \"universal\" truth is necessarily \"absolute,\" this isn't necessarily the case. One could make a claim about objects that holds universally, but does not hold without qualification; that is, isn't absolute or ultimate, but depends upon the particular method of inquiry, the subject matter sought after, the current scientific theories, or the particular historical situation. The laws of physics are fairly uniform throughout most of the universe, but then you've also got the uncertainty principle which mucks up your calculations when you're working on a small enough scale so maybe 'absolute' is the wrong word. On the other hand, even quantum mechanics could conceivably be expressed as an equation, so that even if the exact values of some of the variables are unknown, maybe we can still be certain of the relations between them. Whether or not any of this counts as 'truth' is another matter altogether ",
