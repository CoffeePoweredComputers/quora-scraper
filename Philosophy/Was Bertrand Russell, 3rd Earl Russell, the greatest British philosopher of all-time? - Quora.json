            "answer_text": "Edit: this question was changed to say \u201cthe greatest British philosopher,\u201d so I will modify my first paragraph a bit\u2026 To consider him \u201cthe greatest\u201d would put him ahead of Locke, Berkeley, David Hume, Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart Mill, among others. Ironically, Russell himself, looking back at his life (and the relative failure of logical positivism) would not have ranked himself quite that high. I have no doubt he would not have ranked himself ahead of David Hume, for example, whom Russell put at the highest ranks of all philosophers, ancient or modern. In the opinion of some \u2014 myself, included \u2014 he was one of the greatest, maybe the greatest, explainers of philosophy of all time. His History of Western Philosophy is considered by some to be the outstanding one-volume work on the subject ever written. I would concur with that assessment. In general, he was one of the greatest essayists who ever lived. He was given the Nobel Prize for Literature based on the essays he wrote for the general public. His great ability in writing prose for the layman and the \u201cintellectual\u201d alike\u2026 which was virtually unmatched\u2026 was to take complex matters in history, philosophy, and ethics (& occasionally science and math) and simplify them in a way that made most writers on the subject look unnecessarily obscure and inept by comparison. For example, he could reduce 1,000 pages of Hegel to about five pages, and do it so convincingly that you\u2019re left with the impression that he really did justice to Hegel in those brief five pages. Earlier in his career, he had hoped to contribute original ideas to the philosophical underpinnings of mathematics\u2026 and in the philosophy of language. He believed, at least early on, that through linguistic analysis (Analytic Philosophy) all the classical problems of philosophy could be de-obfuscated, simplified, and thereby solved. Later in life, he backed off, realizing that the linguistic-analysis project was not entirely successful, that there were still messy questions. His hopes for Principia Mathematica \u2014 a long book working out a purely logical basis for all the foundations of math \u2014 was dashed to some extent by Kurt Godel\u2019s Incompleteness Theorems, which doomed the \u201cformalist\u201d project to an extent. Still, there are plenty of people who think that Russell did important work in these areas, and that work still has influence among Anglo-American schools of thought. ",

            "answer_text": "Lord Russell was primarily a philosophy professor; he understood the philosophers and taught them. A very learned man, he also wrote the epic Principia Mathematica with Alfred North Whitehead, also a philosopher and mathematician. He greatly aided and supported Ludwig Wittgenstein, a real philosopher. Great English philosophers were John Locke, George Bishop Berkeley, and David Hume. Under them, I would place Sir Francis Bacon, Whitehead, and Russell. There\u2019s a whole slew of lesser lights and philosophy professors who added valuable criticism and commentary to the Great Conversation. ",
