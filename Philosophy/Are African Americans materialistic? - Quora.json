            "answer_text": "Yes, but it\u2019s due to a lack of material as opposed to an abundance. as an anecdote, i\u2019ve never lived in a house that my parents owned, my parents didn\u2019t have a vehicle to grant me when I entered college, hella student loans, my network was barren, and I didn\u2019t know how to network cuz autism and introversion. so. I really, REALLY like having money. To contrast, my friend\u2019s family lives in a building that they own, his father provided the art direction for an insanely popular trivia series, and his mother designs for IKEA. They\u2019re loaded. They\u2019re also extremely sweet people (when they\u2019re not flexing their financial muscle). My parents had loads of financial anxiety exacerbated by a son who had a rich white friend who never wanted for anything. His parents could work from home and order in whenever they were too busy or too tired to cook. My parents had a combined yearly income north of 130,000$. It took me years before I realized what killed all that money, and it was the comorbidity of student loans, entitled family, and incidentals that bled away my- i mean OUR household funds. Nah, but really. Black Americans have a lack of owned property, and a lack of any real social mobility save for our most exceptional youth. and even then, they have to John-Henry their way thru an entire decade before their contributions can elevate their immediate family. I been fucked up so :P ",

            "answer_text": "Primarily the descendants of Free African Americans and those who have maintained more of their African traditions, e.g. Geechee/ Gullah are not materialistic and exhibit a communal welfare work ethic. However, the descendants of slaves and the illegitimate offspring of slave masters are more prone to Eurocentric behavior/values. Therefore, they are more envious and avaricious; which is a detriment to unity in the African American community. This is why the upward mobility experienced by other ethnic groups and immigrants eludes the African American community. The divisiveness created during enslavement, \u201chouse nigger\u201d vs. \u201cfield nigger\u201d, light skin vs. dark skin, Muslim vs. Christian , blue-collar vs. college-educated prevents a basis for forming a united front!
