            "answer_text": "I\u2019d say it\u2019s normal to a certain extent. While there are definitely teenagers who are more existentially-disposed than others, I reckon all teenagers think existential thoughts. It\u2019s almost impossible not to as a teenager when you\u2019re at that point in time where you\u2019re trying to figure out your future, your place and purpose in the world, and usually feeling pretty nervous about it. However, there are many kinds of existential thoughts, the frequency at which you think said thoughts, and the impact they have on you to take into consideration. For most teenagers, I\u2019d imagine the most common existential thoughts concern their purpose and questioning who they are as individuals but these rarely manifest in barely-even-quarter-life-crises. Not to say there\u2019s anything wrong about having existential musings about, say, the future of mankind, the human condition, the meaning of life or lack thereof, or the end of the world. But these types of existential thoughts are likely less common among teenagers and only some will be inclined to think them. For example, I take sick pleasure in speculating how the world will end but even imagining this greatly upsets my sister, who\u2019s never been one for existential thought and seems to find existentialism uncomfortable. Then there\u2019s the impact of chronic existentialism. It\u2019s relatively normal for teenagers or otherwise to take existential thoughts, contemplate them, and then put them down so to speak. On the other hand, if they keep recurring, make you anxious, and/or if you find yourself spiralling into existential dread or ennui, that probably isn\u2019t particularly common and certainly not healthy. In any case, I\u2019d suggest not worrying if it\u2019s normal. Painful and unsettling though they may be, existential thoughts can be great to have if only because they keep you cognizant of the difficult things, challenge you to ask tough questions, and help you become more self-aware, which is a fantastic thing as a teenager. So keep on thinking. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, it depends on the teenager. An affinity for considering the greater mysteries of life and the universe is certainly an admirable trait. Although, I can personally attest to the consequent dangers of a life spent mostly in your own thoughts. Musing on existence is a fascinating pursuit, however you must not forget to take action and seize the day! ",
