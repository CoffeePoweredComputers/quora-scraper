            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A.    Ezra Luckcock has provided a link that is bound to give you better and more comprehensive information than I can.    Idealism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)    However, to tide you over for the moment, I will attempt a short answer.  Idealism, the belief that all things and events are mental in character, has at least one great strength:   it eliminates the problem of things-in-themselves.    The problem is as follows:    If all of our knowledge comes from our perceptions, and our perceptions are distinct from the things we believe that we perceive, how can we ever know anything about the world as it exists beyond our perceptions?    In other words, how can we know things-in-themselves?    This is a long-standing philosophical problem, which idealism addresses by claiming that there are no things-in-themselves.    What we call objects and events are, according to idealism, constellations of perceptions, leaving two kinds of things in the world, perceptions and perceivers.    One possible problem with idealism is that it makes a needless mystery out of why our perceptions conform to the notion that we live in a world of beings, things, and events that exist independently of our perceptions.   For example, even toddlers assume that a toy, once hidden in front of them under a blanket, continues to exist under the blanket even when it isn't being perceived.   And sure enough, if the toddlers lift the blanket, the toy will be there (unless their caretaker is an evil-minded party magician). Idealist Bishop Berkeley addresses this problem by acknowledging that there IS a world external to our perceptions, but that since a world external to any perceptions is not a coherent concept, the external world must be the percept of a Great Perceiver, God.  Another possible problem with idealism is that it makes the problem of other minds even more acute than it otherwise would be.    From a realist perspective, one could argue that another being with a brain like mine would have perceptions sufficiently similar or homologous to mine to allow for communication, which could serve as evidence that another mind exists.    But from an idealist perspective, the \"other brain\" is just a constellation of my perceptions, so how do I avoid solipsism, the conclusion that I am the only perceiver?    The young Bertrand Russell's logical atomism proposes that the \"sense data,\" which, along with facts about the relationships among them, make up reality, exist in six dimensions, thus allowing all people's perceptions to constitute a whole.    In this scheme, the self is a logical fiction--a constellation of perceptions itself!    So much for solipsism. ",

            "answer_text": "Idealism (esse est percipi) is false for two reasons.  1) It is self contradictory to claim that reality is a product of a mind. This is because Idealism rests on a description of something based in reality (a mind) so it already presupposes Realism.  2) There is nothing to validate the argument that reality is a product of our experience. Because there is no evidence to show that something manifests itself or de-manifests itself based off of our experience.  ",
