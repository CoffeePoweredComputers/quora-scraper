            "answer_text": "Depends on which part. If you are talking about the old testent jesus would be deemed a false prophet. He doesn't meet the the 6 major messianic prophecies of Judaism while at the same time adding concepts that have to place in judaism such as blood sacrifice for atonement which the messiah doesn't have to do. The Jewish messiah doesn't need to be crucified, he also misquoted old testament and made false prophecy,resurrected from the dead for the sins of the world, or is a deity. So jesus is deemed a charlatan by jews. As for christians, they see him as a God co equal and eternal with the son and holy spirit which died for the sins of the world. You pick which part of the bible you choose to believe and you choose which you want to distort. ",

            "answer_text": "Jesus is God Himself. According to the Bible, God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. \u2013 John 4:24 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. God revealed Himself as Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: \u2013 Deuteronomy 6:4 13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? 14 And God said unto Moses, I Am That I Am: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you. \u2013 Exodus 3 6 Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his redeemer the Lord of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God. \u2013 Isaiah 44:5 5 I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: 6 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the Lord, and there is none else. 7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things. 8 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the Lord have created it. 9 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands? 10 Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou? or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth? 12 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded. Through out the Old Testament and similarly in Jewish Torah and Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), God reveals Himself as one and there is none beside Him. There is no doubt there is only ONE GOD \u2013 The true living God. In the new testament its described about Jesus , 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 The same was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. 4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men. 14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. 17 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. 18 No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him. John 8 57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? 58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. John 10 24 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. 25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father\u2019s name, they bear witness of me. 26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: 28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. 29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father\u2019s hand. 30 I and my Father are one. 31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. 32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? 33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. 34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? 35 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; 36 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? 37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. 38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. 7 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. 8 Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? 10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. 11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works\u2019 sake. 2 John 9 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son. 22 For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: 23 That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. 24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. There is only One God \u2013 One being in Three persons \u2013 The Father , The Son Jesus Christ and The Holy Spirit. Three persons, but one God. Can a man at the same time be a Son, a Father and a Husband? A man is the Son of his mother. The same man is a husband to his wife. The same man is a father to his child. But He is still the same person, but three different roles. -> We can understand this applicable for human beings. As of God, HE is infinitely superior than human beings. He is our Creator. He is one being and existing in three distinct persons \u2013 The Heavenly Father, the Son and The Holy Spirit. 1 John 5 7 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one. Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created. If you are sincere to know if there is a real God, pray if there is a true real God to reveal Himself to you. God Himself has promised - Jeremiah 29:13 13 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. If interested, read the Bible with an open mind praying to the true God to reveal Himself to you. You can start with the new testament, Gospel of MARK and then Gospel of John and then the other books of the New Testament. Let the true God, if it be Jesus or Allah or any other God, let the true God reveal Himself to you! I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. \u2013 John 8:24 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. - Acts 4:12 In my case, I realised Jesus is really God and He is whom He says to be.
