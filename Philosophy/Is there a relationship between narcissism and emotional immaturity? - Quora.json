            "answer_text": "Generally yes. I would suggest though that Narcissism can and does runs in families, I know because my adoptive dysfunctional family (patriarchy). functioned this way, I was the black sheep, (trouble maker) the child who held the mirror up to the family. My Mother developed learned helplessness to cope with their tactics and would feign a headache when I challenged My two brother\u2019s & Father on their behaviour, as the wolves circled she would disappear to leave me to their male dominant/Narcissistic interrogation their justification was consistently used to protect \u201cthe family\u201d & used throughout my late teens & young adult life, to cover for their arrogance, selfishness & misogyny along with their inadequacies as people. There was a high level of codependency when I was young, which bloomed into a Narcissistically weird relationship between my parents as I grew up. Even both Grandmothers recognised there was an issue I still have no real descriptor\u2019s on what happened even all these years later. I come from a family by their own admission do not do emotions, so I suggest that the two are connected because to be empathic toward others, a high level of emotional maturity needs to be employed, I managed to escape at quite a young age, and literally had to relearn how to communicate and walk in an other\u2019s shoes, and really listen to people, to learn not to dismiss people, not to get caught up in aggressive ego boundary testing engagements, not become caught up with my minds own understanding & clever contribution to the conversation, all these things were common in our family, and in our interactions. The male patriarchal belief sat around, not apologising for their behaviour, (that was what Mum or their wives were there for) I believe that the most important aspect of mental & emotional balance and effective communication skills, at a truly human interactive level, a person must have emotional maturity, without this their capacity to truly love, is stymied. This can cause an individual no end of pain, they may find themselves in an unfulfilling, or lopsided relationship, where one party is holding back and the other is either rescuing or giving and getting little in return. So at some level Narcissism may be seen as being abusive, but in many families I would suggest it is so \u201cnormal\u201d, that until children realise there is something wrong, it doesn\u2019t register as being abnormal, until they see how other families/couples operate. This is usually the tipping point for many young people as something is noted or seen as not being quite right, my father terrified me as a young child, but I was unable to articulate it until I was in my late 30\u2019s early 40\u2019s. So many of the immature, and childish behaviour is used to cover serious personality flaws. ",

            "answer_text": "Maturity develops in lockstep with our reasoning ability, but narcissists have a dysfunctional reasoning ability that inverts the process of reasoning. Reasoning comes from considering information outside of ourselves and drawing rational conclusions from them from a reasonable position. Narcissistic reasoning reverses the process. The unreasonable position comes first in the form of false convictions created by lifelong prejudices or impervious narcissistic truths. Then outside information is forcibly twisted or mutilated into the shape that fits their false convictions. In even worse circumstances, outside information is outright pushed away or rejected. Reasoning does not come from fiction we invent or conclusions we desire, it comes from accepting reality as the basis of our thinking and going with whatever appears most sensible. It requires frequently changing our minds to adjust to new information. Doing it this way builds our capacity to reason. Narcissists have never learnt to do that, so they have no capacity to reason, only the capacity to argue and prove themselves right and to find fault with everything else. This requires no accommodation to new information and no alteration to false convictions. Narcissists confuse argumentation and fault finding with reasoning and mistakenly believe themselves reasonable. But this is not reason, it is merely virulent cynicism, the ability to come up with cons for everything and pros for nothing, a ready reason to repudiate everything and everyone they encounter, a compulsive narrowmindedness that makes them contemptously discount rather than pause to consider. It is merely an imitation of rationality meant to conceal their underlying irrationality, namely their conviction that everything is stupid and bogus. And so they went through life never considering many things, things like others have feelingsothers are persons with their own reality and preferencesothers don\u2019t like to be treated in a way that suits only the narcissisttheir wrong conclusions upset othersBeing like this, they learn nothing new in life and subsequently never grow, because there is nothing worth learning since to themselves they seem to be wiser than anyone else. It\u2019s as if they promptly erase everything and everyone from their minds constantly, and that\u2019s the reason why you feel you don\u2019t exist to them, you were erased. Narcissists are often described as 10 year olds inside, this can be produced by erasing everything experienced past the age of 10. The only things that don\u2019t get erased are their false convictions. But that\u2019s not all, a state of senseless fugue arises from having minds made mostly of erasure, a mind made mostly of chaotic severed wires and senseless disconnected nonsense interspersed with false convictions drifting around, and maybe that\u2019s where the word salad, responsibility erasing, and gaslighting come from. There is so little truth and understanding in the narcissist, because everything inside is so disconnected. And maybe that\u2019s why it feels so stressful dealing with them, we feel their chaos impinging on our mental order, on our sanity, as if order and sanity does not work in this shared space with the narcissist because they are trying to erase making sense. So their inability to reason maintains a state of immaturity that postulates that reality is whatever they want it to be, and whatever they disapprove of is bogus or stupid. That is the basis of their immaturity. ",
