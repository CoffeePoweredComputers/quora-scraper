            "answer_text": "In no way. It is flourishing in America, for example. It used to be called Communism, or Socialism, or Progressivism, or Liberalism (many of these still thrive openly) or Fascism, or now AntiFa, which is Fascism pretending to be against violence, but violently: it was militarism in the service of the utopian dream, aka Nazism, which is pretty much like American Exceptionalism guiding the Military Industrial, Banking and Penitentiary Complex, and Guantanamo, and undeclared \u201cwars\u201d all over the place, except legally, through Congress, after their approval: this is all pretty Radical, revolutionary, damn the Constitution, we are doing all of this in the National Interest, naturally, so fall in line or get thumped. Is this not the American Way ? The left used to be, \u201cProtect the workers from the exploitative Capitalists:\u201d it has now morphed into, \u201cProtect every imaginable minority, or, in the case of women, the highly privileged majority, from the exploitative evil \u201cThem\u201d who must be blamed for everything: the rich 1%, who in fact are a majority of women, but let\u2019s just blame old, white men. Never let little fact get uin the way of a good slogan. I hope you like this answer better than the ones that went before. Peace. ",

            "answer_text": "NO! It is having to reform itself, basic healthcare, social security/pensions, public schooling, helping the disabled, all need a new framework within the modern age. Public schooling has reached a point, that, at least at the elementary level, people who can are fleeing it. Everyone wants health care but the costs of a nationwide system would jump the tax rate from 22 per cent of GDP to greater than 40 percent, that is politically a reach to far. Social security/pensions needs some work, but with a little adjustment can be maintained securely, for the next 75 years, if not done, in less than 10 years they will begin to be cut, though there is enough to always pay 73 percent of what was promised. The biggest problem for the left, is the fact that they have left the working class behind, ignored them, and put all their faith in helping immigrants, people of color, and anything or any one who seems less than a part of whatever the current establishment is. This has cost them what used to be their bedrock and base. Until they wake up to those they have left behind, and whose banner they once proudly carried, they will continue to become more marginal to the political scene, ignoring the colleges and their major donors, Hollywood, and liberal bastions that are pushing the working class out of themselves due to the high cost of living there.
