The people complaining about how unfair the patriarchy is are foolish, as \u201cthe patriarchy\u201d is the only thing keeping them from freezing to death each night. The people proud that \u201cour white anglo-saxon forefathers built this world\u201d are also foolish, as they have done exactly nothing to deserve any credit for what others who happened to have similar skin colour have done. The world is tragic, wonderful, rank with evil and bursting with love. None of that was your fault, but the future is your responsibility. ",

The planet was created by natural forces at some point after the universe began. Much, much later, life (Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae and Animalia) got going and shaped the world over millions of years to what we see today - a process that is still going on and will continue long after puny humans go extinct.
