            "answer_text": "Do they answer with the truth or only what they believe is true? Frankly, in the latter case there is no worth in administering it to anyone who has a lot of false beliefs. Which means you\u2019d be administering it to someone who has mostly true beliefs\u2026but if their true beliefs lead them to refuse to answer questions \u2018truthfully\u2019 then perhaps it\u2019s better that you don\u2019t use it on them either. If it makes the recipient answer questions with the truth regardless of what they happen to believe, then the recipient ceases to matter. You can administer it to something capable of answering questions very quickly, hook it up to some method of asking them as many important questions as fast as possible, and get all the truth you can get in 24 hours. I suggest administering it to a supercomputer hooked up to a large array of file servers pre-loaded with all the questions we can put to it in 24 hours and a very large array of redundant storage for all the answers it can give in that time.

Even when we have video evidence, documentary evidence and internet evidence of what he is saying is a lie, he STILL FUCKING LIES. We give him the truth serum and make him do a 24 hour press conference live on every TV channel that will carry it. Every other program is preempted. He gets toilet breaks every two hours, and a ten minute lunch break for a sandwich, and ten minute tea break for another one. Apart from that - he has to answer every question he is asked, no matter the subject. And when he says something that is demonstrably not true, we ask him to prove it. That is the what you do with a 24 hour truth serum. Why would anyone do anything else? ",
