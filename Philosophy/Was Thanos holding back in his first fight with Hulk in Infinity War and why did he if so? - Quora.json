            "answer_text": "He was holding back, and Ebony Maw explains it. He tells Cull Obsidian to \u201clet him have his fun.\u201d Thanos enjoys a good fight, and if he used his full strength eight away, he would\u2019ve ended the Hulk immediately. But he recognized the sheer strength of the Hulk and wanted a fun fight, perhaps to test his martial arts capabilities. He let the Hulk beat him up a bit before using his boxing skills to promptly and decisively knock him out. ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely and he still whooped the Hulk in about 60 seconds flat. He had the power stone but didn\u2019t use it so he definitely held back. He didn\u2019t feel threatened by the Hulk so much so that he didn\u2019t even consider using power stone which he had at the time. ",
