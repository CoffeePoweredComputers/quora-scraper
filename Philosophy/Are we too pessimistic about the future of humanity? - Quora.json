            "answer_text": "There is certainly much to worry about, for example:1) Nuclear weapons, plus the threat of new bio-weapons, robot soldiers, etc. We can adjust to many things, but not to a major nuclear war. That would be game over.2) Climate change and the speed at which we are using up Earth's resources.3) Overpopulation. This is a major problem and one that doesn't get anywhere near enough attention. The ever-increasing population is itself a main cause of climate change and environmental disaster. 4) Mass migration. The birth rate has actually dropped in some places (especially Europe), but in Africa it is booming. When climate change hits, that booming young population is going to head north to Europe. In the coming decades Europe is going to be swamped by African and Muslim migrants. And that will mean major uphevals, and possibly violence. The sudden, mass movement of people always causes tension, and sometimes war. Unfortunately, it is going to be a big theme of the 21st-century.5) Religious fundamentalism. Organized religion is a huge problem. The sooner we replace it with secular humanism the better. But pessimism itself can be dangerous. If we convince ourselves the future will be terrible, it will be. We'll make it happen! So here are a few reasons to be optimistic:1) It is difficult to imagine a war between any of the major powers. Take Europe, for example. Europeans spent centuries tearing the continent apart in bitter wars. And yet it is impossible to imagine countries like Britain and France fighting each other today, or Germany and Italy, or Spain and Portugal. It is also hard to imagine Argentina, for example, fighting an all out war with Brazil, or Japan invading China. Thankfully, there seem to be more sensible, civilized people in the world than ever before. And there is less aggressive nationalism (nationalism let me repeat, not patriotism or national identity - you can be patriotic without being a nationalist).2) The rise of China. I'm not so pessimistic about this as some people. The Chinese are a very patient, calm, civilized people. There is no reason why China should end up in a cold war with the USA. Hopefully, the Chinese will gradually move towards some form of liberal democracy as well. 3) The slowing birth rate. There are FAR too many human beings on the planet. It's just insane. And the population is still growing. However, the birth rate is dropping in many places, such as Europe, Korea, Japan etc. We just need the birth rate to slow and drop EVERYWHERE - especially Africa.4) Technological progress. We have made amazing progress in the last century or two, and there is no reason why that progress shouldn't continue. Within the next few decades (assuming we get control of the birth rate), we could eradicate extreme poverty everywhere in the world, begin to colonize space, destroy cancer and many other horrible illnesses, and slow and even halt the ageing process (the first person to live to 200 has probably already been born).5) The rise of India. I'm a big admirer of the Indians - they are an extremely intelligent and impressive people. I live in the UK, where Indians make up the largest minority group. Many of our doctors and university professors are Indian. So long as the Indians don't fall for a stupid, ugly nationalism, they could be a real force for good in the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Probably but out of ignorance. We don\u2019t know enough about WHAT\u2014- of all of it\u2014- to ignore, or in the words of whoever first invented the phrase: \u201cW T M I\u201d. e.g. Vitamin E is good for many but not everyone, a killer for those with Blood thinners. Sorting that out will take a lot of time. Dosing is all-important but who is going to figure it out? There is no Russia Collusion in the election. But the democrats who lost big insist on keeping this lie alive, and concocting insane schemes like getting the AG to break the law by revealing information in the report that is sacrosanct. The pessimism arises out of the seeming contradictions, people not realizing that all governors must keep their voters in a constant state of fear in order to retain mastery over them, to control them, like any control freaks that seek to minimize or totally eliminate opposition. Silence it if they can. ",
