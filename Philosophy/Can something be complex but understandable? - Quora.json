            "answer_text": "Of course. Complex is not the same as complicated. A smart phone is complex, but not complicated for the average user. Mechanical clocks have a complex mechanism, but they are not conceptually complicated, just a lot of gears. On the other hand, unfolding a deck chair can be complicated even though it is not a complex mechanism. So complicated and understandable are sort of opposites, they refer to how difficult something is to use or understand. Complex more refers to the structure, and how many pieces and details it has, not how hard it is to understand. ",
