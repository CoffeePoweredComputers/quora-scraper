            "answer_text": "Wow. What content. Before we wander into this one. Let me just say, I have seen people report excellent results with the \u2018boy-care\u2019 regiment, which is just soap and water, basic shampoo, nothing fancy, just clean; no odd hair chemistry, defoliating, clarifying creme, detoxifying lotions or whatever. Onward. So, fascism is not the opposite of capitalism. Fascism is the opposite of socialism, according to their own manifesto. Communism is the approximate opposite of capitalism. Understand that there are two commodities in societies: wealth and power. Left - right is a spectrum of distribution of the wealth we make together. Left is wealth to the many (communists, collectivists), right is wealth to the few. Capitalism and fascism (corporatism) favors far right economic ideals - wealth to the few elites. Up - down, is the spectrum of distribution of the political power a large group produces, again from many to few. Anarchism at the bottom, with only power over oneself and Authoritarianism at the top, with kings and dictators controlling all. Materialism is a philosophical position that asserts all is matter. That even our thoughts and feelings are produced by physical materials, like brains, not noncorporal spirits and ghosts. Being Materialistic, is to be preoccupied with material goods, wealth and possessions. The opposite would be munificent or altruistic. So, no being altruistic does not make one inherently anti-capitalistic. There are many examples of wealthy philanthropists giving away most of their fortune, to aid humankind. Though, some do seek to salve their guilty conscious over the means they used to become wealthy and to compensate with kindness. ",

It will show you where the is the political compass if you are more a visual person. You will see that any kind of Authoritarianism is Fascism regardless whether it is falls between Communism on the Left and NeoLiberalism on the Right.  Looking at the political compass below, you can see why people call Trump and Pence Fascists. They are clearly at the Authoritarian end of the Libertarian/Authoritarian spectrum. That any US Citizen could vote against Liberty makes me scratch me scratch my head.  Research shows that most US Citizens are social democrats but the Democrats (See Bernie Sanders, the very moderate collective libertarian in the green square). What that means is Bernie and most Americans would not like to see babies die from hunger on US soil and people working three jobs not still having to live in their cars. Most people don\u2019t like the corporatocracy dominating the US and doing so very unfairly. However, the Democrats are funded by the corporatocracy, so they will never let him be a presidential candidate. You need to be in the blue square and the closer to the top right to be on the ticket for the Dems to keep their funding. Now the fun part\u2026. You can take the test and see where YOU fit on the political compass. The Political Compass Have a great day \ud83d\ude42 ",

Now, if you want the government to force the population into complying with your belief with no checks and balances from the population or a constitution, then you could argue this align with some aspects of fascist behavior. Also note that fascist countries can be capitalist. ",
