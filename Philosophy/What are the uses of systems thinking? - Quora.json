            "answer_text": "Here's my answer.Systems thinking is when a person takes a Systems view of: everything.   One explanation of the systems view is here: A Taste of Systemics (shame some of those images are broken...) Systems Theory has also been called a `Theory of Everything'.Two great books on it all:StoryAlity #70B - The Systems View of Life: A Unifying Vision (Capra and Luisi 2014) andPrinciples of Systems Science (Understanding Complex Systems): 9781493919192: Economics Books @ Amazon.com  It (systems thinking) can be seen as an answer to questions of ontology and epistemology. (Where: Ontology = `What exists? / What is real?' And where Epistemology = a theory of knowledge, i.e. `How do we know, what we know?'). So, it's useful, when we come to ask questions like:- How does everything work? - What causes stuff to happen?- If you wanted to change something, what would you have to do?- (etc)i.e. In the systems view, the universe is a system. And it is a system which contains within it, lots of other systems:   So - How do all these things work? See: Systems Theory. (eg von Bertalanffy, Laszlo, Capra & Luisi, etc) Key concepts in systems thinking, are: (1) a system, (2) its environment, and (3) inputs and outputs.    (There are a few other key concepts, as well. See the links below.) On Systems Theory and Evolution StoryAlity #70 \u2013 Key Concepts in Systems Theory, Cybernetics & EvolutionStoryAlity #70B \u2013 The Systems View of Life: A Unifying Vision (Capra & Luisi 2014)StoryAlity #70C \u2013 Systems Philosophy (Laszlo 1972)StoryAlity #70D \u2013 The Evolving Self (Csikszentmihalyi 1993)People are systems. (And we each are composed of: systems. e.g. about 20 or so. e.g. skeletal system, circulatory system, immune system, nervous system, etc)Also - Atoms are systems...   A cell is also a system...   (from: Capra & Luisi 2014, p. 130)  Our evolved human psychology (and also the psychology of all animals) is a system... (composed of smaller systems)   Then - for culture, there is the systems model of creativity, which explains how new knowledge and cultural artifacts happen. (in both Science and the Arts and Language - and in anything in culture, really)   General systems model of creativity (in the Wiley Handbook of Genius, Csikszentmihalyi 2014 \u2013 in (Ed:) DK Simonton 2014, p. 538)  And so - everything works, via Systems Theory - and including, the 3 laws of holon/partons (which are 3 laws of physics and 3 laws of evolution.) StoryAlity #100 - The Holon-Parton Structure of the Meme - the Unit of Culture (and Narreme) ie - How does evolution work? See: Systems Theory. StoryAlity #70C \u2013 Systems Philosophy (Laszlo 1972) So, in this view (the systems view), when thinking about anything, we see how (or - aim to see, how) every action maybe has effects on, various multiple related and even component systems (of which - we as people, and families, and organizations, etc) are: a part. One good thing about it is, in considering (say) Ecosystems, we also think a lot more, about how, pollution (and, say human-caused climate change) are probably: our own fault, and maybe, how we can possibly change (or fix, or solve) that.  i.e. Systems Thinking seems to be: a closer approximation of reality than any other way of thinking about: stuff. i.e. Everything. Or, any other ways of doing stuff. (There may be better ways, but, we just haven't found them yet.) An `opposite' (or `alternate') view to Systems Thinking is - something like `Cartesian Dualism' (from the renowned old dead French guy, Rene DesCartes) who seemed to mainly think in `binary opposites' (eg, like: on/off, hot/cold, mind/matter, etc). But that (DesCartes) was a long, long time ago... and Science has had a lot better ideas since then, about how Reality really works. Everything seems to be: systems. Thus: the systems view. And systems thinking. Evolutionary Psychology (as a domain of knowledge) also shows why, most people simply tend to think in terms of, those old, simple `binary opposites' (eg `yes/no', `on/off', etc). i.e. It's just: easy, and frankly a bit lazy, as we evolved to do it in that way. To survive and replicate, as a caveman (or: woman) back in the Pleistocene Era - you don't need to really understand `systems' at all, you just need to: run away from a tiger, or, whatever.  But these days - the systems view of life (and culture - and - everything) is more and more necessary - or, who knows, maybe we'll all kill ourselves, accidentally. eg: Climate-change, pollution, etc! Systems Thinking (ie systems theory) also has been integrated into Systems Biology, and into many other domains of knowledge - but it's taking a long while to get integrated into the Arts/Humanities/Social Science. Mainly as, it's just easier to stand back and go: \"Whoa - gee whiz, everything (e.g. society, culture, technology, etc) is all so complex! What a mess! So - maybe, we should all just use Continental Philosophy (ie really old, outdated ideas, like say DesCartes, or Foucault, Derrida, etc) and `postmodernism', where, you don't ever need to use Science, or any `tricky stuff' like Systems Science, nor, generate any genuine usable effective knowledge, to actually fix stuff, and to solve problems?\"  But, thankfully - the consilience movement is trying to integrate systems thinking into the Arts/Humanities/Social Science. StoryAlity #71 - On Consilience and Creativity...But - hey, maybe the `Postmodernists' are right, and maybe it's not important, if we all live or die, or, whatever? Maybe, if we just ignore the world's problems, they'll all just `go away by themselves', or, something. ;) Anyway that's my take on Systems Thinking, Systems Theory, the Systems View, and also, Systems Science, and also, why it's all, probably, important or something. - Also, as an aside - one important implication is: If the systems view is right, then, since Systems Theory explains Evolution (in both biology and culture) then it probably means that, Popper (and DT Campbell's) Evolutionary Epistemology (1974, etc) is also right. i.e. There are lots of epistemologies - but, if the systems view is right - then all epistemology is, in fact, just: Evolutionary Epistemology. And all else is just shadows and dust. `...SHADOWS AND DUST!!!! ' * CheersJT * as yelled by, Oliver Reed, in the movie, Gladiator (2000) PS - Both shadows and dust can be explained by: Systems Theory. (Seriously.) ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m not an expert in it, but my experience with systems thinking is that it\u2019s an understanding that where you have a lot of elemental interactions that influence each other, you have to look at what constraints or behaviors exist in the parts in order to have at least a minimally accurate understanding of why the whole is producing the results it does. If you want to change the outcomes, you likewise have to change the constraints or behaviors of the parts. That\u2019s assuming you can account for all of the variables (the parts, and their constraints/behaviors). A problem that you can run into (which we are informed by in system thinking), particularly with natural systems, but also with artificial ones (for ex. the complex AI systems we have now) is their complexity; the fact that our knowledge base has not accounted for all of the parts/constraints/behaviors, and so our understanding of what actually drives a system can be either wrong, or limited, such that any attempt to change its behavior deliberately is unlikely to reach desirable outcomes, even though we can see discernable effects from the system that either benefit or harm us. This is why science is necessary when dealing with chaotic, complex systems, so we can see what we know, and discern what we don\u2019t know, so that we can assess the risk of doing something vs. doing nothing, and do a cost/benefit analysis on that risk. It can also include a design perspective, where people attempt to challenge the fundamental assumptions of some system design schemes to achieve different goals, by rethinking what a part is in the system, and then what it will allow and disallow, or more broadly, what rules it will follow. On Alan Kay\u2018s suggestion, I\u2019ve looked a bit at what Ludwig von Bertalanffy has written on this. I thought \u201cPassages from \u2018General System Theory\u2019\u201d (\u201cGeneral Systems Theory\u201d by Ludwig von Bertalanffy) was great on the subject. (I\u2019ll have to read the full text, as these are just excerpts.) Kay had a nice synopsis on some sources he\u2019s read on the subject at Alan Kay's answer to What are the best resources for learning systems and networks according to Alan Kay? ",
