            "answer_text": "Kant confidently presented erroneous proof that space and time are a priori intuitions and academic philosophy has confidence in Kant even after two centuries. For details, please see my following quora answer: Khuram Rafique's answer to What is a simple explanation of space-time in Kant's philosophy? I have analyzed Kant\u2019s ideas of space and time in my upcoming book \u201cDescriptive Knowledge, Mind and Reality; a case of Epistemological Realism\u201d. I am copying here the relevant portion of this in-process book:  Now let us look at the idea of sensible world i.e. the world of appearances to which according to Kant, forms of space and time are supplied by human mind and what forms are supplied by mind, mind has knowledge a priori of those aspects of sensible world.[i] This idea though started in Inaugural Dissertation but took its ultimate shape in The Critique of Pure Reason and it is contradictory to Inaugural Dissertation\u2019s early idea that sensible thing is the one which is known receptively as it comes before senses. In section III of Inaugural Dissertation, Kant put forth a number of arguments to show that ideas of time and space are either subjective or unreal or something else so only possibility is that these ideas are intuitively provided by the mind to the sensible world. In Critique of Pure Reason, he would say that since forms of time and space are supplied by mind to sensible world thus mind knows a priori those aspects of sensible world which are supplied by mind itself. This book is not intended to acquire bulky length so here we cannot analyze all the points provided by Kant about nature of space and time that support his claim that forms of space and time are provided to sensible world by the mind. Let us take only first point about time and first point about space for our analysis. The translation of first point about time as mentioned in paragraph 14(1) of the Inaugural Dissertation is quoted below for the ready reference. \u201c14. Time (1) The idea of time doesn\u2019t come from the senses but is presupposed by them: it\u2019s only through the idea of time that the things encountered by the senses can be represented as being simultaneous or successive, so don\u2019t think that succession generates the concept of time! When time is defined in terms of a series of actual events happening one after another, that\u2019s a very poor account of it. That little word \u2018after\u2019\u2014how am I to understand that if I don\u2019t already have the concept of time?\u201d[ii] My opinion is that idea of time is an advanced concept. But sub-conscious level apprehension and resultant timely body movement through physical hurdles is a basic ability which exists not only in humans, it exists in animals as well. To deal with time with regard to ongoing sensory events, humans and animals do not need concept or idea of time. Only to make or adjust planning for the rest of day, humans need to know exact time of present moment and here again no definition of time is required though it is an advanced level of dealing with time. Many animals and birds realize time to go back home location without knowing concept or definition or even idea of time. Succession may not generate concept of time but succession of hurdles in way of an animal and resultant behavior sufficiently tells that factor of time in outer reality is sensed and apprehended by animal through sense perception. Things do come before and after in the way of animal and animal deal with those successive things in respective succession and without knowing idea of the little word \u2018after\u2019. It is through relating to various sense experiences that eventually human mind would derive the idea of time. Humans need proper definition of time when they are, let\u2019s say, making a sophisticated time related machine or for the purposes of philosophical debates or in the context of scientific theories etc. Time is a relation between physical things. Time does not exist in physical things but exists in their behavior and in their mutual interactions. Behavior and mutual interactions of physical things or motion of things are duly perceived by mind and coordinated timely body movement can be instigated by mind through motor nerves. Mind does not supply form of time to sensible world rather mind is able to perceive factor of time in behavior and mutual interactions of physical things. General feeling of passage of time i.e. psychological time also exists in mind but either this ability develops itself with passage of sense experiences or in most basic forms, it is connected with requirements of instinctive framework. This ability also cannot be supplied by mind to sensible world. And the translation of first point about space as mentioned in paragraph 15(A) of the Inaugural Dissertation is quoted below for the ready reference. \u201c15. Space (A) The concept of space is not abstracted from external sensations. I can\u2019t conceive of something x as located outside something else y except by locating them in different places in space\u2014and this includes the case where y is myself. So the possibility of external perceptions presupposes the concept of space, and doesn\u2019t create it. Thing in space affect the senses, but space itself can\u2019t be derived from the senses.\u201d Well, I cannot so conceive because this is what I have not seen or learned from perceptions of external reality. I cannot conceive this in mind; but this does not occur in outer reality as well. I accept as a matter of fact that mind is able to conceive many such things that do not actually occur in outer reality. For example mind is able to conceive an ant which is larger in size to elephant. But in the given scenario there is a hidden loop that in order that I may be able to conceive something x placed at any place in space, I first need to have sense experience of something x, place and space and then I will not be able to conceive that something x as located outside something y except by locating them in different places in space. This particular case pointed out by Kant is an example of principle of contradiction which we have already seen in section 1.5 of this Chapter and then in Chapter 5, we shall see in details that self-contradictory concepts cannot be imagined by mind. Like a square circle though can be written in words but cannot be conceived or imagined by mind. Another property of self-contradictory concepts is that they also do not physically exist in external world though they can exist only as descriptive concept. Likewise two physical objects such that one is not contained in other are not physically in same location and neither they can be imagined or conceived to be at same location. They can only be conceived or imagined being placed at different locations. And again concept of space is an advanced concept which mind may not be able to directly derive from senses. But humans and animals are able to behave in accordance with spatial locations of objects of interest to them which mean that with passage of sense experiences eventually humans would derive the concept of space. In section 1.5 of this chapter we also had identified that if we accept principle of contradiction as innate of mind then in next step we would tend to claim that outer reality is also constructed by mind. And here we see Kant trying to do exactly the same thing. But those who consider principle of contradiction as innate of mind just because mind is not able to perform an impossible task such as conceiving two different objects such that one is not contained in other as placed on same location then they also should take inability of mind to see view of sun which is less than 8 minutes old as innate of mind. In the next step, they should take fixed speed of light also as innate knowledge of mind. Furthermore, self-contradictory things are also incapable to be drawn on paper except as illusory tricks which should indicate that principle of contradiction is innate principle of drawing paper and that form of space is thus supplied to sensible world by the drawing paper. By examining only two example points, we have seen the level of arguments through which integral characteristic qualities of external reality (may be only \u2018sensible world\u2019) have been denied and mind is assigned unreal extraordinary powers. Irony of the situation is that these faulty results are still the central theme of philosophy[iii] even after lapse of more than two centuries. We may ask here why there is need that mind should supply forms of time and space to sensible world? Do things in themselves not contain time in their behavior or mutual interactions? Had 4.5 billion years not passed on this earth before the emergence of human consciousness that started supplying forms of time and space to sensible world? Was earth not revolving around sun before first emergence of mind on its surface? If we suppose that things in themselves do possess time in their real behavior or in their mutual interactions and that spatial relations also exist in objective reality then in first step they are kept hidden to senses so that sensible world may not itself contain time and space. In the next step mind would intuitively supply forms of time and space to sensibility and a sensible reality would be reconstructed in this way. But with the objective to hide time and space from the view of senses it is necessary that all movement of objects also may be kept hidden to senses. In the end, not only the forms of time and space but spatial movement of objects will also be supplied by mind to the sensible world. The same real world would be converted back to a representative sensible world and objective achieved so far is an unnecessary display of active involvement of mind through which not only a priori knowledge of sensible world would become possible but also with so extraordinary abilities of mind, pure rational knowledge would acquire exalted status and metaphysics will be legitimized despite not being provable through sensory or empirical knowledge. In case objective reality is devoid of space and time then reality is also devoid of any physical movement. Under these conditions, reality would be consisting of one single object which is placed at one single and unchanging location. In this case, not only forms of time and space but actually whole of sensible reality would be a creation of mind. Add to this tasteless objective reality the spices of absolute being, perfection, timelessness etc. and we get a sister philosophy of Parmenides\u2019. Zeno\u2019s paradoxes would then provide a sound logical basis to this second assumption that objective reality is devoid of motion, space and time and not to the first assumption that senses would only reconstruct already complete objective reality. Now Kant, in Inaugural Dissertation, paragraph 14(iv) has employed an argument to show that time is a continuous quantum. Almost the same argument is famously known as Zeno\u2019s paradox which after showing ad infinitum continuous divisibility of distance in space concludes that no distance can actually be traversed in reality and that the dynamic reality as portrayed to us by senses is deceptive and unreal. There are no distances in objective reality that can be traversed and thus reality is static, devoid of space, timeless, and absolute etc. Kant has employed the same argument with emphasis on time only but excluding the final conclusion and also without making acknowledgement reference to Zeno; perhaps he does not want to categorically deny the legitimacy of sensible world as Parmenides did, to which Zeno assisted through a series of rational arguments based paradoxes. For Kant, sensible world in itself is only partially incomplete and this deficiency is removed instantly as mind will intuitively supply forms of time and space to it and since mind knows a priori all what has been so supplied; thus not only possibility of a priori knowledge has been created in some way, the superiority and legitimacy of metaphysics also has been established which does not depend on sensory knowledge but comes from sound rational knowledge that could have a priory grounds as well.

            "answer_text": "Kant presents his proofs in the section of the Critique of Pure Reason called Transcendental Aesthetic (\u00a7\u00a7 2\u20136). He fashions two arguments each for the apriority of space and time (that these concepts are not drawn from experience) and also two arguments for space and time being intuitions (individuals, single entities) rather than concepts (general representations). You can read these very brief arguments yourself, here I only summarise or explain the gist of them. I also only give the arguments for space, as the arguments for time are analogous.  First apriority argument:We do not generate the representation of space from perceiving several things separate from each other (a posteriori). On the contrary, to be able to represent any things are separate from each other to begin with already requires the representation of space. It is an a priori pre-condition of such experience, not something drawn a posteriori from experience. Second apriority argument:We cannot represent to ourselves that there is no space (absence of space) but we can represent to ourselves an empty space (absence of things in space). Therefore space is an a priori representation that underlies all experience and not something that is a posteriori derived from experience.  In summary, these arguments point out that space is a necessary pre-condition for experiencing things and therefore cannot be drawn from experience a posteriori.  First intuition argument:One can only represent a single space, and \u201cparts\u201d of space are only limitations of the same space (the left side of my visual field and the right side of it are not two spaces ontologically speaking but a division of the same space). Thus space is not made of parts, as it were, but rather the \u201cparts\u201d (points, lines, etc.) exist in it. Since there is only one unique space, it must be an intuition rather than a concept. (Recall, intuitions are representations of single things, concepts are general representations of potentially many things.) Second intuition argument:Space is represented as something that is given as infinite: space is infinitely divisible. No concept can include an infinity in itself. Therefore space is an intuition, not a concept. (This is complex, but the idea seems to be that we generate concepts by adding properties: something + alive + rational = human, human + male + unmarried = bachelor, etc. If space were a concept generated by such process of adding different \u201cspaces\u201d together, we would never reach an actually infinite space \u2013 but only potentially infinite. Perhaps a more sensible way of putting this is: we do not add kilometres after kilometres to generate the concept of infinitely large space, for we do not reach infinity in this way, but we already \u201cfind\u201d space to be infinite and divisible to as many kilometres as we may wish. That is, infinite space is a not a concept of infinitely many added kilometres but an individual intuition that includes in it infinitely many kilometres.)  Philosophical explanation of these arguments The arguments for apriority of space are reasonably understandable. It is the argument for space being an intuition rather than a concept that is commonly thought as difficult or downright intractable. One reason for this is an insufficient understanding of what Kant means by \u201cintuition\u201d and \u201cconcept\u201d. First, intuition (Anschauung in German) has nothing to do with something like intuitive grasping (\u201cI intuitively understand him\u201d or \u201chis explanation is very intuitive\u201d or \u201ciPhones are intuitive to use\u201d etc.). It is a poor translation. Kant\u2019s definition of intuition is that it is an immediate representation of a singular object. In short, an intuition is a representation of an individual, such as Immanuel Kant or Justin Bieber \u2013 or the human or the star. A concept, in turn, is a mediate and general representation of a plurality of objects. In short, a general noun, such as \u201chuman\u201d or \u201cstar\u201d. Kant\u2019s point is that the space we represent is not a concept like \u201chuman\u201d or even \u201cdistance\u201d, it is not a general representation that can refer to various different spaces, but it is a unique individual that can only ever \u201crefer\u201d to one thing: our space. A further problem is that it seems as if Kant would therefore deny that there is any concept of space and indeed of spaces, such as Euclidian and non-Euclidian spaces. This is not true: he himself speaks constantly of the concept of space. Is that self-contradictory? Not at all: all intuitions can also be ordered under concepts \u2013 but they are not thereby concepts. Although Kant does not discuss these issues as much as we nowadays would hope, it is pretty clear that for him a representation of an individual such as Immanuel Kant can also be grasped conceptually (the human Immanuel Kant is still a human as well) so that one can speak of the concept of Immanuel Kant (especially when we seek to enumerate Kant\u2019s properties, such that he was a bachelor and a philosopher \u2013 we can indeed have different concepts of Kant!). That Kant speaks of the concept of space does not therefore contradict his view that space itself is not a concept. Similarly for different spaces: Kant would have no problem with defining mathematical spaces and ordering them according to various properties, for his point was not about such (conceptual!) spaces but about the space we represent when we experience spatial things. Our space is unique and singular, an individual and not a general concept, whereas we can certainly think of different kinds of spaces. (He would, I think, point out that we cannot represent non-Euclidian or 4-dimensional spaces to ourselves like we do our own Euclidian 3-dimensional space \u2013 we can do so conceptually, symbolically, and analogically through mathematics but not intuitively through perception.) Additional, indirect arguments Finally, Kant gives also indirect arguments for space and time being a priori intuitions, namely through geometry and mathematics. It is one of the most unfortunate misinterpretations of Kant that these indirect proofs have so often been taken for the real or even only proofs. This is just not true. Kant argues in addition to the direct proofs presented above that only space and time being a priori intuitions would explain the fact (or what he took as the fact) that geometry and mathematics are synthetic a priori sciences. Nothing else, he thinks, can explain it. It has provided a too-easy mark for philosophers to just say: well, they aren\u2019t, so Kant\u2019s theory of space and time must be wrong. A non-sequitur (literally the fallacy of denying the consequent, for those interested in the logical side of this). There is first of all much more to Kant\u2019s claim that meets the eye and second, even if Kant were wrong about geometry, his arguments for space being an a priori intuition still stand independently and should be refuted directly.

            "answer_text": "He does not prove this, but he has some strong arguments. His definition is as follows: any knowledge that is thus independent of experience and even of all impressions of the senses. Such knowledge is entitled a priori Kant\u2019s line of thinking could have been influenced by previous statements that needed some more support. This would result in following reasoning: Mathematical propositions are synthetic.Geometry, is a body of a priori synthetic knowledgespace as an a priori intuition will guarantee point 2)Of course, there is no possible way to describe space and time without using concepts of space and time. These concepts are thus by definition intuitions. As mathematical models like geometry (that Kant wants to classify as a priori knowledge) are based upon these intuitions, they could be nothing else than a priori intuitions. Kant\u2019s argument for a priori space goes like this: In order that I can represent certain things as being next to each other, or even far away from each other, the concept of space is required, and I could not ever derive the concepts of \u201enear\u201f or \u201efar\u201f without already presupposing the existence of space. Kant\u2019s argument for a priori time goes like this: neither coexistence nor succession would ever come within our perception, if the representation of time were not presupposed as underlying them a priori. Kant sums that up once more saying: we can conceive of time and space with no objects in either, but we cannot think of objects as not being in space and time. Space and time are therefore \u201cthe condition of the possibility of appearances, and not a determination dependent on them.\u201d This only means that all spacial concepts are interdependant and that all temporal concepts are interdependant. For our perception, space and time are a priori intuitions. Theoretically, it is however not excluded that space or time could be emerging as effects of quantum gravity. For our perception, space and time will however remain a pure form of sensible a priori intuition. ",

            "answer_text": "In my reading, Kant must first presume that Space and Time are apriori intuitions, to begin and proceed with his theory. However \u2014 after he has proposed his doctrine of Transcendental Logic, within his Table of Categories \u2014 Kant will justify his doctrine of apriori Space and Time. Following Locke and Hume, whose empiricism Kant sought to answer, Kant attempted to merge their empiricism with some traditional idealism. Kant\u2019s Transcendental Idealism began with the Transcendental Apperception (the Self, the unity of all possible perception; similar to the Cartesian Cogito). Next, Kant\u2019s Transcendental Aesthetic, consists solely and only of Space and Time. The Self must have Space and Time in which to locate anything at all. Thus, Kant did not deduce Space and Time from the Self\u2019s existence \u2014 Kant presumed them, so that he could move to his next stage, Transcendental Logic. Here we find the Table of 12 Judgments and the 12 Categories which outline the 12 Basic Thoughts that anybody can think. Namely: QUANTITY: Unity, Plurality, TotalityQUALITY: Reality, Negation, LimitationMODALITY: Possible/Impossible, Existence/Nonexistence, Necessity/ContingencyRELATION: Substance/Accident, Cause/Effect, Agent/PatientHere is where Kant justifies the realities of Space and Time. One cannot have these Judgments and Categories (that is, one cannot even think) without Space and Time. For example, take the Category of RELATION. Substance and Accident are recognized only in Space. Then, Cause and Effect are recognized only in Time. Finally, Agent and Patient are recognized in a combination of Space and Time. In this way, Kant justifies the apriori intuition of Space and Time by logical induction (rather than deduction). ",
