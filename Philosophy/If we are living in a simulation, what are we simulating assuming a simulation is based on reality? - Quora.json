            "answer_text": "The reality we perceive may be simulated. If so, it may have nothing at all to do with \u2018real reality\u2019. Just like a VR game: like Myst, or Warcraft, or whatever. However you want to assume this simulation is, indeed, \u2018based on reality\u2019. If so the obvious guess is: it\u2019s based on the world of our \u2018master programmers\u2019 - the people (or person) who created / programmed our simulator, and cursed us with it. How similar is their world to the one they\u2019ve stuck us in? You might think it\u2019s impossible to even speculate, but, believe it or not, the question has some meat to it! We can actually make informed guesses, based on low-level facts such as QM and physics in general; and also high-level facts such as the types of society we experience. But it would be too much trouble at this time to get into it. Let me know if you\u2019re interested in pursuing this difficult topic further. ",

            "answer_text": "It is a not s simulation but something like it, and simulation (matrix the movie) is used for easier understanding this Truth. This phenomena called Universe is a manifestation of the Eternal Awareness that is manifesting Awareness to individual Consciousness, in which turns to identification of mind/ego, physical bodies. The rule of thumb that whatever is observable cannot be you . So who are you? The Vedic philosophy posits that this Eternal Infinite Awareness is the Subject(observer) and all else are Objects(observed) thus unreal. Your consciousness is part of this infinite awareness. Now, what goes on with the Infinite Awareness that is all encompassing visible and invisible realms, you ask? Imagine no time or space, NO INDIVIDUALITY, not being OR non-being, this is not existence in your mundane understanding of existence, because you do not exist YET you are. This cannot be put into words because as soon as it is written, it becomes untrue, speculation at best. \u201cI am dreaming of your, dear questioner and you are dreaming of me\u201d. Knowing this is liberating to which you start realizing that the best approach to (this dream of) a Life is not yo give a shit! ",
