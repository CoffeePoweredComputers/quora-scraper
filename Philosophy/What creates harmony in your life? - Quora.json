            "answer_text": "You can get various answers to this and harmony in the mind or with others or friends put different dimensions on any answer. What might create harmony for one individual might actually hurt someone else\u2019s harmony. The gangster Al Capone believed killing his competition created harmony for him and his thugs. Killing Jews created harmony among the Nazi party. For a large portion of the word the \u201cstate\u201d insists on harmony within the state and uses fear to achieve it. So don\u2019t be surprised  when someone pushes a dogma of harmony that is escapism or conformity or a time out. Conflict resolution may have many paths but harmony with your spouse or family member or neighbor or even your own conscience requires some aspect of the peaceful fruit of righteousness a concept becoming more foreign ever day in secularism. In my life I made the commitment to pursue righteousness found in the Bible\u2019s message of first being a peace with our creator through a savior Messiah not by my own efforts. It is a legal cessation of hostilities. But the comes the peace of the creator in growing in a relationship that involves understanding how two can walk together in this path of life. One that necessitates growth on my part and setting apart stupid from what is extremely profitable. But I continue to grow in harmony on the journey. I receive a lot more blessings in this than I deserve. A lot more compared to others and I am almost embarrassed by it. Here I am a leading scientist engineer and reconciled with my weaknesses and strengths along with friends and family. Not that I am perfect but I can forget what lies behind and press forward on to what I have been called to in this life. ",

            "answer_text": "Right now I don't have harmony. Been out of work with an injury for almost 6 weeks. So my stress level is high. I have minor day surgery to repair my arm on Monday. So short answers after that. I will be picking left or voice texting. But I probably hang out mostly on youtube send VLive have a bunch of shows to catch up on and let's not forget Webtoons. It used to be Music and Quora slong with my children that gave me harmony. ",
