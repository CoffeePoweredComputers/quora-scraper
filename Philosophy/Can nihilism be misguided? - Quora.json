            "answer_text": "Sure. If you grew up in an organised framework of meaning, and became disillusioned with it, read some constructivism or cultural relativism and realised it was all a social construct, and oh my, everything is a social construct, and oh my there is no intrinsic meaning in the universe, just the cold light of dying stars and infinite freezing void in between them\u2026 And if you then went and jumped off a building as a result: that would be misguided. Think instead of someone you love, past or present. Then see how particular and accidental that love is. If it\u2019s your parent, they could have died when you were younger; the egg could have been hit by a different sperm and produced someone else; you could have died before term. Do the same if it\u2019s a sibling or child. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s your beloved partner. There are a hundred way you could have never met them. Or maybe they could have already been partnered. Or you never had that special time which caused you to fall into love with each other. That love you have of a particular person is the product of a thousand accidents. It\u2019s what\u2019s called \u201ccontingent\u201d. Then there\u2019s Universal Love, Timeless Love, Cosmic Love. Not love of any particular human, just a vast universal abstraction. Compare the value of the two objects of love. Which keeps you warm at night? Which warms your heart. Which are you most afraid of losing? Which leads you to be happy when you see them. Particular love is real and powerful. Universal love is imagined and powerless. Life meaning comes from the particular, not the universal, and it\u2019s only because have been raised to value the universal that we sometimes fail to see that. Why have we been so trained? Because that training makes us better organisational employees, church-goers, state-citizens, and soldiers. There\u2019s nothing wrong with any of those institutions or roles as long as we don\u2019t drink the Kool-Aid they\u2019re selling to recruit you. The ultimate response to finding out that both love and meaning are particular and contingent should not be \u201cI must go jump off a building\u201d, but rather \u201cthank goodness.\u201d Because particular and contingent also means that you can do something about it.

God can manifest himself or herself to every living human being and proclaim our purpose tomorrow. I kinda doubt this will occur so, for now, I\u2019m going to stick with nihilism. ",
