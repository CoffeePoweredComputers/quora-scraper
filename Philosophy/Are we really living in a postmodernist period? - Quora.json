            "answer_text": "Not yet. Postmodernism, if the name is taken literally, would refer to the phase of history that comes about after modernity. The problem is that we haven\u2019t left modernity behind yet. What we call the \u201cpostmodern\u201d period, the period we now live in, is not really post modern at all. This is not what comes after modernity. This is the terminal phase of modernity. It would be more accurate to call it late modernity. I\u2019ve written on this at length in other places, but in a nutshell: we spent about three centuries carrying out the Enlightenment project before the whole thing began to go south with two World Wars showing us that no, our technological progress does not imply any sort of moral or social progress. In fact, the latter two notions are not really valid notions, at least not in the same way that technological progress is. The idea that we\u2019d have a scientific age in which mankind would be perfected is just silly at this point. The social sciences are instruments of institutional control primarily and investigative enterprises only by accident. The Enlightenment brought us material prosperity through natural science but it only gave us more powerful means. The ends we were aiming at during the Enlightenment were nonsense. If you want to see this in action, watch the debate between Chomsky and Foucault. Chomsky represents the optimistic faith in progress of a modernist thinker, and Foucault represents the post-modern cynic. I fall more in line with Foucault when I watch that debate, although I do not share his goals or his politics. What we\u2019re seeing now is the realization that the values and goals of Enlightenment \u2014 basically, everything about it outside of the whiz-bang natural science that gives us cool gizmos to do stuff with \u2014 were quixotic if not totally senseless, but this realization is taking a long time to sink in, a long time to penetrate. The intelligentsia figured this stuff out nearly a century ago and still understand it in a kind of detached intellectual way, but we have yet to see the social consequences play out. For example, people still take the word of psychologists as the last word on certain things because psychologists are \u201cscientists,\u201d which you wouldn\u2019t expect to happen in post-modernity. The people who have had this realization have, I think, been trying to do damage control for the past century. The idea has been to preserve things like egalitarianism and liberal democracy in the face of postmodernism, but the cost of keeping liberal democracy after the death of modernity is beginning to show its face and I think that people will reject it. Of course, you\u2019re not supposed to say that out loud, and even suggesting it is a kind of heresy, but that\u2019s late modernity for you. ",

            "answer_text": "Periods, eras, ages\u2026 They all seem so neat in hindsight, but I\u2019m skeptical about the veracity of classifying the modern (Western) world as \u2018postmodern\u2019, or as anything for that matter, and if you\u2019re familiar with some central tenets of postmodernism as a philosophy then you\u2019ll probably conclude that \u2018postmodern\u2019 philosophers would be, too. First off, the word \u2018period\u2019 here must necessarily reflect a time but must also, if we\u2019re to be consistent, reflect some geographic location. In this case I would assume the North Atlantic, I.E. Europe and the United States. I make this distinction because I live in China, and there is nothing postmodern about the 500 million rural inhabitants of this country (a number which well exceeds the population of the United States).  In fact, you can likely name well over 100 nations in the world that have not been affected by postmodern philosophy at all. To say that Thailand or Tuvalu or Uzbekistan are constituents in our \u2018postmodernist\u2019 period would be ridiculous, and I doubt anybody would attempt to do as such. Which leads us to an assumption implicit in our ideas of \u2018eras\u2019 or \u2018periods\u2019. They\u2019re always localized, and with their localization there comes a weakening of their dominance and deflating of their prevalence. This becomes even more apparent with something like, say, postmodernism as opposed to something like \u2018the stone age\u2019, where every bipedal on the planet was united in their lack of sophisticated tools (and if we have to define connections between disparate peoples by what they lack instead of share then we\u2019re on shaky ground anyways).  Most people don\u2019t even know what the hell \u2018postmodernism\u2019 is. Philosophers can\u2019t agree on a unilateral definition, and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy posits that coming up with one is impossible and maybe a little bit superfluous (which is ironically in line with postmodernist thought with it\u2019s hefty arguments against universality both crediting and discrediting it at the same time).  I like postmodernist philosophy quite a bit, but to say that our world is stewing in the cultural and philosophical mishmash of its doctrine would be simplifying things and leaving out a significant portion of the Earth\u2019s population (at least half, if not more). Besides, the philosophy sometimes goes too far and leaves out the role that biology plays in shaping our decisions and worldviews. It leans towards the \u2018cultural construction\u2019 view and the cultural relativist perspective, which breaks down under scrutiny and really becomes a little ridiculous if you actually study and understand biology and evolution. The amalgamation of our caveman brains, expanded societies, and fancy toys rolls the ball forward just as readily as the gruel of uncertainty espoused by postmodernist ideas. Besides, any ideology complicated enough that even the man who coined the term wouldn\u2019t call himself a postmodernist is going to be misunderstood. The layman, outside of the ivory tower, does not give a damn about postmodernism or it\u2019s literature and likely doesn\u2019t even think about it. That\u2019s not to say the doctrine isn\u2019t sometimes prescient in its descriptive mode, thus giving the idea of a postmodernist \u2018period\u2019 some kernel of truth, if only by an objective analysis of social trends which happened to be nominated as postmodernist. However, with its jargon and nearly impenetrable wall of assumptions that don\u2019t always line up then it would likely be ridiculous to say that postmodernism is the shaping force instead of simply the label for forces that had arisen independent of the doctrine. It is rather ironic that my skepticism regarding systems, such as the classification of \u2018eras\u2019, would probably bode well with postmodernist thought. That\u2019s no justification, though, because it\u2019s very hard to have a system of beliefs that is skeptical of it\u2019s very epistemology and justification for existence, i.e., a skepticism of general systems and especially of the universality of reason that would serve to justify knowledge arrived at using that particular epistemological channel. So, to sum up, maybe some of us are living lives informed and constructed in some way by postmodernist thought, but the ubiquity of such is questionable. Also, we should remember that the canonical \u2018postmodernist\u2019 texts of thinkers like Derrida are actually pretty old and the discipline or ideology or whatever you call it hasn\u2019t lately had a posse of philosophical proponents willing to take up the torch.  Postmodernism\u2019s influence has always been, just like its texts, uncertain, murky, and hard to figure out with regards to meaning, mostly because meaning for them is moot so why even try to incorporate it? Yet, common people still see meaning and purpose and strive to use reason instead pondering how we can\u2019t know anything for certain and rising complexity and blah. . That\u2019s not likely to change soon, and especially not in the non-western world. ",

            "answer_text": "What we are living in is a world or period in which there are multiple \u201cworldview\u201d systems \u2014 that may always have been present \u2014 but which are now brought into contact through the nearly universal availability of communication media. This has engendered increased complexity and cross-mixing between ideas. In earlier years, postmodernism resulted from the exposure of members of intellectual elites to multiple world views, and a consequent effort to synthesize them in theory. Later, as media became not just universal but also interactive and participatory, exposure to and the \u201cuse\u201d of multiple worldviews became a feature of everyday life for a large proportion of the population. This need for the general population to deal with and define themselves in terms of multiple worldviews has been called context collapse: A large body of research argues that self-presentation strategies vary based on audience. But what happens when the technical features of Web sites enable\u2014or even require\u2014users to make personal disclosures to multiple audiences at once, as is often the case on social network sites (SNSs)? Do users apply a lowest common denominator approach, only making disclosures that are appropriate for all audience members? Do they employ technological tools to disaggregate audiences? This results in a climate that is substantively different than postmodernism, and has been called metamodernism. See What is post-postmodernism? This includes the incentive for people to mix and match \u2014 or should we say mash \u2014 available ideas and world views into custom-assembled personal mashups. But we need to keep in mind that all previous worldviews continue to exist and to have their communities and exert their influences, including tribalism, religious orthodoxies, scientific and rationalist views, and so on. How can we understand the admixture? The disciplines of sociology and history have been reluctant to do much theorizing in this area, probably because it is complex and highly speculative, and hard to defend academically in the required fine detail. Two contenders are spiral dynamics (see also images) and integral theory (see also images). These are over-ambitious \u201ctheories of everything\u201d and tend to be unclear about whether they are focusing on the historical development of cultures or on the psychological (and spiritual) development of individual members of those cultures.

            "answer_text": "We absolutely, certainly are. Our ideas about what\u2019s natural have undergone a major shift, and there\u2019s no going back. That\u2019s a big chunk of what postmodernism is about. Think of all the groups that are challenging traditional ideas about their status and rights. We used to believe that of course women wanted to have babies, and wait on their husbands, and let men make all the important decisions in government, business, and other fields. When women started demanding the right to vote, people were shocked. It wasn\u2019t natural. It was threatening. And they were right: the world was changing. In our postmodern world, people constantly challenge assumptions about what used to be accepted without question. A big news story this week is a perfect example. A Pennsylvania grand jury has just issued a damning report about the coverup of more than a thousand cases of sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests. The report noted that in the past, police were reluctant to prosecute priests who abused children. The Catholic Church was a sacred institution. Its leaders were the protectors of morality for all of us. Obviously the way they were handling the issue was the right one, and it wasn\u2019t for us to ask questions - or so the thinking went. There\u2019s been a major shift in the way we view the world. In the past, many people thought that government, religion, and other institutions were there by a sort of divine right. You didn\u2019t pull back the curtain to see what was going on behind the scenes. Today we no longer believe that those organizations are special, that they have an unquestioned right to exist, and that they always serve the best interests of their constituencies. Yes, we do live in a postmodern world - and there\u2019s no going back. ",

            "answer_text": "Are We Really Living in a Postmodernist Period? We were from about 1983 until about 2011. Postmodern ideology dominated western civilization during that period because it was well financed; not because it was consciously chosen by a majority of the people; not because it was insightful or accurate or meaningful in any way. (Who were the financiers and what was their agenda?) However, something has radically shifted from the postmodern status quo since then. A new civilization-defining paradigm seems to be shaping up. It\u2019s too early to tell exactly what it is, because these things are only identifiable retrospectively. We will soon collectively look back on the postmodern era much like the postmodernist movers and shakers looked back on the modern era. They remain completely blind to the counterarguments, dishonesty, reactionism, and other problems with postmodernism\u2014still framing it as a cogent response to modernism, and the \u201conly right way\u201d of thinking, which is itself a red flag that betrays a lack of circumspection. Notably, they don\u2019t deny their reactionism (framing postmodernism as a response to modernism), and don\u2019t realize their pet ideology represents a failure to seek the golden mean or align with objective natural reality, as all reactionism does. Of course not, for postmodernist movers and shakers hold that there is no truth or right, and that there is no objective natural reality. (Meanwhile, the underlying biological, physical, and metaphysical nature has not changed one iota over the intervening years.) The falsity of postmodernism is obvious to science-minded, philosophical, truth-seeking, justice-minded, and awakening people. Some of us already are looking back on postmodernism with satisfaction through our rear-view mirrors. Its blatant errors have come home to roost, and none too soon. The postmodernist establishment is in denial and dragging their heels, of course, for they have invested their lives in lies. But, fortunately for humanity, the megatrends are no longer under their control. The next era of human history, I suspect, will involve a massive leap in human consciousness, with or without significant advances in technology. It will be a time for rediscovering our individuality, and defending our individual intellectual sovereignty from the abuses of exploitive collectivism. Dominant collectivism was a tactic of the powerful few for selfish purposes. Postmodernism was for compliant collectivist groupthinkers, blind to and complicit with their own enslavement. The sloppy thinking promoted by postmodern ideology made us more vulnerable to mental enslavement and barbarism, for without a keen understanding of truth/reality, you can easily be fooled by propagandists, and without a honed moral compass, you contribute to the erosion of civil society, which serves only the covert slave masters. The \u201cawakening of humanity\u201d, which many are talking about, is fundamentally an awakening to the errors of inherited unexamined manipulated culture, including postmodern ideology, and an initiation into thinking for ourselves. Once humanity is liberated, we must find the determination to begin to see with our own eyes again, and align with objective natural reality again, and never to allow ourselves to be enslaved again. With the greater consciousness to come, which seems to be an inevitable trend, I think these goals are easily within reach. The coming years will be very interesting. Let\u2019s make our contributions more conscious and intentional this time, so as to transcend the current dystopia caused by postmodern thought and create a better world together. ",
