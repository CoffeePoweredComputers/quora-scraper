            "answer_text": "Straight from define:transcendental number - Google Search\"In mathematics, a transcendental number is a real or complex number that is not algebraic\u2014that is, it is not a root of a non-zero  polynomial equation with rational coefficients. The most prominent  examples of transcendental numbers are \u03c0 and e.\" Lemmie provide gloss on that:The important piece of the definition is a transcendental number is one that could not be readily obtained by any ordinary algebraic process. Examples of some ordinary (not transcendental) numbers:[math]1, 9, \\sqrt {2}[/math] I can get \"1\" by (for example) subtracting four from five:[math5 - 4 = 1[/math]. I can get \"9\" by (for example) multiplying 3 by itself:[math]3 \\cdot 3 = 9[/math] I can get \"[math]\\sqrt {2}[/math]\" by solving: [math]x^2 = 2, x \\nless 0[/math]. But what of \u03c0?  Although it is defined to be the ratio of a circle's Circumference to its diameter (e.g. [math]\\frac {C}{d}[/math]), there is no algebraic process (although there is an iterative formula) that can be used to get the value of \u03c0. So too for e.  Although I think getting into a detailed discussion of e's whackiness may not be a good idea right now.-- Furry cows moo and decompress. ",

            "answer_text": "A transcendental number is a complex number which is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. For example, [math]\\sqrt{2}[/math] is not transcendental because it is a root of the polynomial [math]x^2 - 2[/math] and [math]i[/math] is not transcendental because it is a root of the polynomial [math]x^2 + 1[/math]. It turns out that \"most\" numbers are transcendental (the set of transcendental numbers is uncountable, and the set of non-transcendental numbers, otherwise known as algebraic numbers, is countable), but it is often difficult to prove that a particular number is transcendental. Some particular transcendental numbers are [math]e, \\pi[/math], and [math]2^{\\sqrt{2}}[/math]. In many cases we simply don't know whether a number is transcendental, such as the numbers [math]\\pi + e, \\pi\\cdot e[/math], and [math]\\gamma[/math] (the Euler-Mascheroni constant). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_number ",
