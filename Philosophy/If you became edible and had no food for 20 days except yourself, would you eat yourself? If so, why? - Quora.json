I would try to forage something to eat, and failing that (and having water) I\u2019d just live off my reserves. I\u2019ve got a decent amount of fat on my body, and I know that I could easily last for 30 days with only water. I\u2019d obviously be unhealthy, and unhappy about it, but why would I eat part of my body as food, when the lasting damage, trauma, and potential infection would clearly affect me for the rest of my life, when my body has adaptations to survive without food for a long time? Technically, my body would start to eat itself, without my mouth having anything to do with it. ",

            "answer_text": "Technically, I am edible right now (though I wouldn\u2019t cooperate!) People in survival situations - for example, stranded in mountains after plane crashes - have sometimes resorted to eating the passengers who didn\u2019t survive the crash. However, I wouldn\u2019t try to survive by eating myself. Left to itself, a starving body will draw on its own fat and muscle to stay alive. That would be a much safer tactic than cutting or gnawing pieces of myself off and swallowing them; first, it avoids the immediate dangers of blood loss and infection; second, if I\u2019m rescued or find regular food somehow, a half-starved body will rebuild itself. A body that has had chunks of muscle removed can\u2019t grow them back. ",
