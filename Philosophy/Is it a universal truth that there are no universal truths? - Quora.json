            "answer_text": "If there is a distinction between truth and universal truth (and I'm not sure there is a meaningful distinction), then the focus of inquiry in responding to this question should begin with the question of the meaning of the adjective 'universal' in the context of deconstructing the meaning of 'universal truth'.  It is assumed that the questioner is asking about the set of all true statements that would be construed as being true for all observers (intelligent beings that are apprehending this philosophical question) at all times and locations.  While it is true to say that I, Kipp Elliott Watson, am alive, this is a statement that was not true a century ago.  This true statement is thus not a universal truth.  This true statement could be modified to clarify that I, Kipp Elliott Watson, am alive in the year 2012 somewhere on the planet Earth and as modified could be offered as a universal truth.  However the universal truth of this could be denied by skeptical observers as surely as the 9/11 tragedy, the moon landing, or the holocaust is denied by others.   What about the mathematical statement that two is greater than one?  Is this a universal truth?  It is, but merely by mathematical definition and convention -- hardly a source of meaningful significance.  When we talk about universal truths, I assume the questioner is speaking of true statements that have a significance that transcends matters of mere definition and convention, properly the dominion of the skeptical observer. It is a truth to say that there is a set of true statements.  Whether there is a subset of true statements that are universally true is a question that can be interpreted in differing ways by different observers (or skeptics).  This, by itself alone, suffices as a universal truth.  Thus, it is not a universal truth to say there are no universal truths. We've all heard of the Cartesian refrain, cogito, ergo sum. In a similar vein, the fact that a question even exists entails the fact that a process for arriving at a meaningful answer exists.  How we choose to answer questions like this defines the essence of who we are. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that there are certain universal truths. There are many examples but I will present just a few for the sake of brevity. 1) It is a universal truth that life exists. Even if it exists nowhere else than on Earth, life exists in the universe.2) It is a universal truth that opposites exist. Positive and negative, darkness and light, Yin and Yang, true and false, etc. etc....3) It is a universal truth that paradoxes exist. Consider the original question: Is it a universal truth that there are no universal truths? If it were true that there are no  universal truths, it would be universally true that none existed. Therefore universal truths must exist.These are my thoughts on the subject. I would be interested in hearing other thoughts on this question. ",
