            "answer_text": "Donald Trump shows a number of signs of being a Sociopath. He lacks empathy. The central characteristic of Sociopathy is lack of emotional control. Trump loses his temper all the time. He has turned it into must-see TV. He has turned dysfunction into entertainment. So is Trump a Sociopath? Well, not exactly. He shows a number of characteristic behaviors that are in line with that of a Sociopath. So what is the distinction here? Some may seem subtle but they are important. A diagnosis is not meant to be used as a slur or an insult. That is why the word Sociopath is an outdated term. A term picks up negative baggage and eventually it is discarded. In the mental healthcare field, we do not refer to people as a diagnosis. We use people\u2019s names. When Donald Trump calls people names, he is being abusive. Him being an abuser does not allow us to be abusive to him. We can point out facts such as him calling people names is being abusive. The purpose of a diagnosis is to help someone. Trump has a job and a source of income. His business dealings are suspect - that makes him a crook. What\u2019s the best way to describe Donald Trump? It\u2019s as if Adam Sandler made a movie about a reality TV star who ran for President and won. That is not mental illness. That is Hollywood. Trump has embraced the dark triad but not so much in a clinical sense, but more as a form of entertainment. He crafted a public persona of being a businessman who fought dirty and won. A lot of it was smoke and mirrors. So Trump is a unique combination of dysfunction, entertainment, business and politics. Is he mentally ill? That\u2019s part of it, but it is not all of it. I meet clients who are bossy and want to do things their own way. If they had a million dollars, they could get away with acting that way. But many of the clients I work with have very little money. Any extra cash that get they spend on cigarettes and soda. Trump has money. We\u2019re not sure how much. He may have been deeply in debt but he had his own private helicopter so he had some substantial sources of income. Trump is delusional and the biggest lie he tells himself is that he is fooling people. But he has fooled millions of people. Or millions of people are willing to go along with Trump\u2019s reality for now instead of other versions of reality. Trump has had other people around him - General James Mattis, Rex Tillerson, Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, Kellyanne Conway, Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, Corey Lewandowski, Mike Pence, Mitch McConnell and on and on. Certainly, many have left or are in jail, which is a testament to how difficult Trump can be. It has not been a good fit for him to go from being a shady, crooked businessman to being President. Is Trump mentally ill. Yes, to some degree. But many people have some degree of mental illness and are still able to function and have a job. FDR was in a wheelchair but could function as President. Some people hate FDR. They think he was a Communist. My dad hated FDR. Trump has certain mental deficiencies. Maybe from doing cocaine or other drugs while partying in New York in the 1980s. Maybe those deficiencies made him think he could do business with crooked Russians and not go to jail. Rudy Giuliani and others protected him. Others are still protecting him. The main purpose of a diagnosis is to know what code to put down when you bill the insurance company. A diagnosis is not that important. The issue is rather getting someone working on goals that are meaningful to them. Trump is still in campaign mode. He has never settled down to governing the country - except to try to dismantle the government. Is Trump mentally ill? Yes. But mildly so. He can function in his own way. I\u2019ve seen worse. On a scale of 1 to 10 with ten being the most severely mentally ill, I would put Trump at a around a 3. And part of it is he chooses to use his dysfunction for various purposes - for entertainment, for pleasing Putin, to distract people from his real agenda of purposely being an incompetent President. Does anyone in their right mind think building a wall is going to solve the immigration issue? Actually \u201cBuild That Wall\u201d was put into Trump\u2019s campaign speeches so he would remember to bring up the subject of illegal immigration - and it caught on. Trump is mostly a dumbass. Mild mental illness is part of the mix. Without sitting down with someone for an extended period of time it is difficult to know what is hard-wired and what is an act. Trump seems to know where the edge of the cliff is. That\u2019s not to say he isn\u2019t mindful of Putin\u2019s agenda to cause chaos in the US. Do I think Trump should be removed from office? Yes. But not because of mental illness because that is difficult to prove. But because he is a bad man. He is unfit to be President for a number of reasons. He is not working in the best interests of United States. He is incompetent. He is malicious. He is way, way too cozy with Putin and Russia\u2019s agenda. He ignores climate change and thinks it is a hoax. He has children torn from their families on the southern border. He is blocking common sense gun control legislation, He is corrupt. He is abusive. He lies, cheats and steals. ",

            "answer_text": "No. He\u2019s a narcissist. Superficially similar, but not the same thing. A \u201csociopath\u201d is someone with antisocial personality disorder. Here are common symptoms for antisocial personality disorder according to WebMD: Lie, con, and exploit othersAct rashlyBe angry, vain, and aggressiveFight or assault other peopleBreak the lawNot care about the safety of others or themselvesNot show signs of remorse after hurting someone elseFail to meet money, work, or social dutiesAbuse drugs or alcoholSome of that fits Donald Trump. Lie, con, and exploit others? Check. Act rashly? Be angry, vain, and aggressive? Definitely, at least in words. But Trump famously doesn\u2019t touch drugs or alcohol. I\u2019ve never heard stories indicating that he\u2019s physically violent or aggressive (well, one story, but that\u2019s not a pattern). I\u2019ve never heard of him disregarding safety. If he\u2019s broken the law, it wasn\u2019t blatant. Now, how about this set of symptoms: Having an exaggerated sense of self-importanceExpecting to be recognized as superior even without achievements that warrant itExaggerating your achievements and talentsBeing preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mateBelieving that you are superior and can only be understood by or associate with equally special peopleRequiring constant admirationHaving a sense of entitlementExpecting special favors and unquestioning compliance with your expectationsTaking advantage of others to get what you wantHaving an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of othersBeing envious of others and believing others envy youBehaving in an arrogant or haughty mannerDING! We have a winner. Those are the symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder, and they fit Donald Trump like a glove. A very special glove. ",
