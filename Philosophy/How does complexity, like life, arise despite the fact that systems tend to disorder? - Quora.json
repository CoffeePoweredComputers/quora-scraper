            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cHow does complexity, like life, arise despite the fact that systems tend to disorder?\u201d \u201cSystems tend to disorder\u201d over longer time spans because change happens, and the odds of a change providing more appearance of order are generally lower than the odds of a change providing less appearance of order. This type of question can be misinterpreted to be about the well known but not well understood law of entropy. It says that a closed system tends to disorder, and the effect is like what I describe in the first paragraph. I\u2019ve never seen a closed system, though physicists and chemists build approximations of closed systems to perform some experiments. The earth is certainly not a closed system. Energy is flowing into almost all earth systems from the sun at a prodigious rate, and energy is leaving the earth for space all the time. While that energy hangs around on earth, anything is possible, including life and complexity. ",

            "answer_text": "Living organisms consume food, convert the order in food to disorder, and send it back into the universe. By doing this, they both obey the second law of thermodynamics, and also maintain the order in the cells of their body as long as they are alive. Life on earth could have formed due to the flow of protons (proton gradient) between alkaline hydrothermal vents and acidic sea water in the bottom of the ocean. I think that there could be some connection between the creation of life on earth and the second law of thermodynamics, though I am not sure about what that connection could be. ",

            "answer_text": "Order and complexity are not polar opposites. Also, they are ambiguous. The words have no objective meaning. Here is a counter example to illustrate what I mean. It is not the only example that I could think of. A series of independent (i.e., random events) according to some definitions is highly complex. The series of independent events is surely more complex than a correlated series with the same type of event occurring repeatedly. Compare the integer set 321741 is surely more complex than the integer set 111111. Now which of the two sets of integers is more complex? Which of the two sets is more ordered? Without formal definitions of order and complexity, there is no objective reason to tell. I at least can argue both ways. How about you? <spoiler> Here is more information: I chose 321741 mearly by \u2018collating\u2019 \u03c0 and the Neparian constant e. I chose 111111 merely by repeating the \u2018simplest\u2019 integer I know. Of course, simple is just a matter of opinion. Now which is more ordered or complex? ",
