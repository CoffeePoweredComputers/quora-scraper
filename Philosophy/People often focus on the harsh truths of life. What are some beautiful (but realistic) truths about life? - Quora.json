It doesn\u2019t even require an answer because everyone who reads it will start asking themselves this question, and pay more attention to the Beauty around them. Wonderful! Some time in the future I hope you will see on the shelves a book called \u2018Bridges To The Heart\u2019. I wanted to write about the precious chance moments we share with others (often total strangers); the moments that literally peel away the barricades we build around our hearts. \u2018Bridges\u2019 reminds us of our similarities rather than our differences, and illuminates my belief that humanity just wants to live in Beauty and Love.
