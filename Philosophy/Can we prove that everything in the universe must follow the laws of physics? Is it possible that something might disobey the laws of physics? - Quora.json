            "answer_text": "Of course you can\u2019t actually prove anything in science. All scientific theories are essentially provisional and open to revision when/if contradictory evidence comes to light. Indeed a good definition of what lies outside of science is any system which does not allow for disproof. However, that said, what science does assume is that the universe is ruled by one set of laws. However, that does not, in principle mean that the \u201claws\u201d (which I quote as there are no such things as laws of physics; there are just theories) which we have derived so far are necessarily the last word in the matter. It might just be that the \u201claws\u201d we have derived so far are special in the sense they only apply in that specific form to \u201cour\u201d part of the universe at this point in time. However, what we would then do is seek to derive a more generalised form of theory whereby \u201cour\u201d set of laws is simply a sub-set. On example of this was the \u201cphysical law\u201d which pertained as to spatial geometry. Inherent in Newton\u2019s theory of gravitation was that space was Euclidean and that time progressed at the same rate for all objects. That made perfect sense from the experiments and observations that we possible at the time. It explained, within the limits of the technology available at the time, the motion of the planets and moons. It was thus a perfectly reasonable definition of a physical theory or law. However, doubts started creeping in, firstly with the observation that the measured speed of light appeared to be constant. Then there were discrepancies with the orbit of Mercury that couldn\u2019t be explained using Newton\u2019s theory of gravity. Eventually these discrepancies were resolved with Einstein\u2019s Special and General Theory of Relativity respectively. What we found was that the apparent \u201claws\u201d of physics that worked very well locally (and sill do for most purpose) of Newton\u2019s theories of gravity and motion were simply a special case (or approximation) of those more generalised theories. So it might be with the current \u201claws\u201d (or theories) of physics that we have derived to date. Perhaps these are just a local approximation to a more general set of \u201claws\u201d which apply across the wider universe. However, before going too far into the idea that what we have derived is \u201cjust\u201d a special case of wider rules, I would say that the sciences of astrophysics and cosmology are seeking to look to see whether the theories we have devised to date are generalisable to the whole universe. For example, do they apply to the time just after the \u201cbig bang\u201d and can they explain the phenomenon we see by (effectively) looking back in time? Can the laws explain phenomena such as pulsars and quasars? Can it explain the motion of galaxies? Is this all compatible with the \u201cstandard model\u201d of quantum mechanics? Are our observations consistent with the speed of light always being constant? These investigations have, indeed, indicated that our current physical theories are incomplete. For example, there is that mystery of the apparent missing mass in the universe which astrophysicists call \u201cdark matter\u201d. Then there\u2019s the apparent accelerating expansion of the universe, the cause of which has been labelled as \u201cdark energy\u201d. These don\u2019t fit into the current accepted theories (or \u201claws\u201d) of physics, although there are many suggestions. However, the principle remains that physics will still seek to produce a single set of theories (or, ideally, one \u201cgrand unified theory\u201d) which can \u201cexplain\u201d (strictly speaking, model mathematically) all these phenomena. So there will be \u201cone law to rule them all\u201d, to slighly paraphrase Tolkein. nb. this also leads into theories of parallel universes which (in one incarnation at least) broadly asks whether the rules that apparently apply in our universe are the only possible ones or might there be any number (indeed an infinity) of self-consistent universes, all acted out according to their own rules of existence. To what extent this law that essentially states all possible self consistent universes must, in some sense, exist is actually a common law, who knows? ",

            "answer_text": "It is an assumption of science that the universe is lawful. This means that it is possible to do science. If the universe was only a lot a random stuff happening science wouldn\u2019t work. Science looks at the evidence and find things that are happen consistently. If there was just random stuff happening this would not work. (It\u2019s a bit hard to see how a universe of random stuff happening would work either.) Scientists come up with ideas of how something works then they - and others - check it out against existing and new evidence. If the idea doesn\u2019t fit the evidence it is either thrown away or modified. That way scientific laws improve over time, with better ideas and more evidence. On the other hand, we can\u2019t prove any law of physics. Proof is actually not a part of science. Proof is something we get in closed systems, in particular in mathematics. We simply don\u2019t have the capability to check that a law of physics applies everywhere in the observable universe so the universe is not a closed system. In a sense, the laws of physics are guesses. Initially there might not be much evidence, but as the evidence stacks up, you reach a point where it is crazy to believe otherwise. Science relies on evidence, not proof. We can rule things out with contrary evidence, but we can\u2019t rule them in. For example, we believe that every electron in the universe has the same rest mass. We certainly can\u2019t weigh each one individually. That\u2019s just how it is. We do know that if the masses were different in different parts of the universe, atomic energies and chemistry would be different in different places, and we would see this in radiation received from distant galaxies. We don\u2019t. In fact, the mass of an electron is so well tested and correlates so well with a bunch of other physics, that if some evidence for electrons with a different mass turned up, physicists would immediately look for other explanations. I\u2019d bet they\u2019d find that the data was wrong too. The mass of an electron is \u201crock solid\u201d physics. Rock solid science, but not proven. So, we simply cannot prove that the laws of physics apply everywhere. Science assumes that we can get to the correct universal laws with enough thinking and testing, but there\u2019s no absolute proof. But proof or not, the program does seem to be working. ",

            "answer_text": "Although it seems like a logical conclusion to jump to, I would not adhere to Physics. Because \u201cPhysics\u201d is not defined. If you mean \u201cPhysics\u201d as something that Universe follows then yeah, By the definition it is proved that everything in the universe must follow the laws of physics. But if you mean \u201cPhysics\u201d as a set of rules and knowledge that we have developed, then NO. There\u2019s only one thing that scientists around us are looking for. New things that disobey our pre formed theories. Science as we know is made by breaking theories and making new ones as we get the evidence in the process. So, as long as we discover the Ultimate truths of the Universe and become gods we can\u2019t say that everything in the Universe follows known physics. By the way, we will never find out every single truth about Universe? Why you ask?.. Because of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems. If I had to explain it to a lay man, I would say that every law of physics has its own assumptions. You would have to prove those assumptions to be sure that your laws are laws. Now to prove those assumptions you would have to make further assumptions ( postulates ). This cycle would continue for ever because there is something that you always donot know in this universe. But if you are religious, you can always assume that universe follows your sacred books. PEACE ",

            "answer_text": "It is an assumption that gets checked all the time. In fact it is rather surprising that the \u201claws\u201d of physics are so uniform across the entire cosmos as far as we can tell. It is entirely possible that CP violation, for instance, might have the opposite sign in different regions; people have written papers on the energy stored in the resulting \u201cdomain walls\u201d, but no such phenomenon has ever been detected unambiguously. (Which is a good reason to go looking for one \u2014 instant Nobel! ;-) But here\u2019s the thing: suppose we find a region where some \u201claw\u201d is different; the \u201claw\u201d instantly adapts to take the region-dependence into account! To take a particularly unlikely example, if we found a region X where Newton\u2019s \u201cuniversal\u201d gravitational constant was G\u2032=0.66741\u00d710\u221210G\u2032=0.66741\u00d710\u221210 m33 kg\u22121\u22121 s\u22122\u22122 instead of G=0.66742\u00d710\u221210G=0.66742\u00d710\u221210 m33 kg\u22121\u22121 s\u22122\u22122, Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation would immediately become Newton\u2019s Revised Law of Regional Gravitation: \u201cUse G except in region X; there, use G\u2019.\u201d That may sound weaselly to a lawyer, but the nice thing about Laws of Physics is that we don\u2019t just make them up; they are dictated to us by the facts. Therefore they are instantly revisable when new facts present themselves. That\u2019s how science is supposed to progress. As I said, the surprising thing is that this happens so rarely! ",

It is a typical layperson mistake to take the names in science literally and this question is a good example of that. The word \u201claw\u201d must not be taken literally, that is just a name which does not imply or prove anything about the nature of the laws of physics. The word \u201claw\u201d does not mean for example that the concepts \u201cobey\u201d and \u201cfollow\u201d apply here. The laws of physics are a description of how things \u201care\u201d, how things behave and how things can behave. This is not a matter of obeying or following. Things are things and cannot decide to be not things anymore, unless this kind of shape shifting is part of their \u201cthingy-ness\u201d which would make that shape-shifting part of the law that describes them.

The 1st \u201claw\u201d of thermodynamics - aka conservation of energy - explains energy cannot be created or destroyed, only change in form. This is not a legal definition, it is nothing to be \u201cobeyed\u201d or \u201cdisobeyed\u201d. It\u2019s a general principle which guides physicists when they study physical reality, that is all it is. Regarding the word \u201cprove\u201d you must be thinking of math proofs. There is no such thing in science as proof. In science there is testing, verifying and falsifying. ",

However the laws that we write down are just our best assessment of what those laws actually are. We have up to now been very lucky that our abilities to explain what we observe has not been far behind our observations. Of course perhaps this is the other way around and our observations have not been able to keep up with the laws that we have written and it may be just a matter of time before experimenters are successful at finding holes in our theories! For me as long as science keeps making things better for humanity (and perhaps other beings) then a step at a time is ok. ",

More precisely, if the Laws of Physics are written in English or some similar language then taken all together either they are self-contradictory or there is some situation that they do not cover. This remains true however the Laws of Physics are rewritten as long as they are written in a language with a finite character set and include basic arithmetic. The proof relies on Kurt Godel\u2019s Incompleteness Theorem. Godel provided a mathematical proof which is equivalent to the following: \u201cAny theory written in a finite character set and including basic arithmetic is either inconsistent or incomplete.\u201d \u201cTheory\u201d means a set of statements regarded as axiomatically true and rules for generating other true statements from them. \u201cInconsistent\u201d means there is a statement that the theory calls both true and not true \u201cIncomplete\u201d means there is some statement whose truth is not determined by the theory ",
