            "answer_text": "\u201cMaterial\u201d is most often used to mean things that are made of something we can bump into or touch, hypothetically at least \u2026. so, on Earth, that would be stuff made of atoms. You might also say that something that can\u2019t be touched because it\u2019s too small is nevertheless \u201cmaterial\u201d rather than \u201cabstract\u201d, using \u201cmaterial\u201d as an adjective. An electron could be claimed to be material, in the sense of being composed of matter, or being a fundamental unit of which matter is composed. \u201cPhysical\u201d is poorly defined but is generally used to mean things that can be described, in principle, using space and time coordinates. \u201cGravity\u201d for instance, or light, may be described as physical entities. They can be dealt with by physics, and in this case are not so complex (\u201ccomplex\u201d in terms of the level of interaction of many different entities) that what you might call higher-level sciences (e.g. chemistry) have to be used to analyse them. Light is usually not really thought of as a material substance, and gravity clearly isn\u2019t material in most senses of the word. Yet both tend to be regarded as physical, because they affect physical things and can be ascribed coordinates in space and time. Light and gravity exist somewhere, and in some period of time. Numbers are abstract entities, even if they are used to deal with and understand physical entities, so they are abstract and not material or physical. There\u2019s no room full of numbers and you can\u2019t hold a number. You can only hold a representation of a number, or some set of objects that we can use a number to describe. To get into what might strike some as philosophical nitpicking, it\u2019s quite unclear whether anything is actually physical, since our notions of physical things are really abstractions held as thoughts in our minds. That these abstract mental models correspond to things that exist independently of us is a popular strongly-held belief in the world as a whole. Things that are held to be physical may still be replaced by alternate interpretations of our experience that involve different entities, and this has happened with gravity, but even scientists well-versed in the theory of relativity like to still hold on to the notion of gravity as a practically useful notion. The concept of gravity itself replaced earlier ideas, particularly Aristotle\u2019s idea that everything just had a natural level that it tried to reach. When Newton introduced the idea of gravity, he faced opposition from people who argued that it was not \u201cphysical\u201d since it involved action at a distance with no proposed material mechanism, and is invisible. As for \u201ctime\u201d and \u201cspace\u201d, are they physical? They are not material. Then again, they are dealt with by physics and they seem integral to the physical world, from our point of view. Usually we want something to exist within both time and space in order to describe it as physical, but there is considerable disagreement about that. Is a thought physical? As we experience thoughts, they exist certainly in time, but not in space. However, they appear to correlate closely with brain activity, and brains are physical, therefore many people argue that thoughts are physical. If so, the thought of a number is physical, even if numbers aren\u2019t physical. Personally I feel it\u2019s better to say that thoughts are not physical, no matter how closely they may correlate with brain activity. We experience brains as firmly physical and can actually hold a brain, but we can\u2019t hold a thought in our hands and a thought does not have a size. Whether a thought is located in space or not depends on whether you think the close correlation between brain activity and thoughts means that we should regard thoughts as physical on the basis that brains are physical.

            "answer_text": "There is a little difference between physical items and material items. Physical items are items which are subject to laws of physics irrespective of whether they have mass or energy. Material items are items which are subject to laws of physics and are made of mass (matter). All material items are physical, but not all physical items are material. Rock is a physical and material item. Light is a physical item, but not a material item. According to Mass\u2013energy equivalence principle (derived from Einstein\u2019s Special Relativity theory), mass and energy are interchangeable, and hence material items and non-material physical items are interchangeable. There is a big difference between physical items (like rocks) and abstract/non-physical/mathematical items (like numbers). Physical items are items which are subject to laws of physics irrespective of whether they have mass or energy. Abstract/non-physical/mathematical items are items which are not subject to laws of physics but are subject to laws of mathematics. Physical items and abstract/non-physical/mathematical items are not interchangeable. This is as per my current opinion and understanding. ",
