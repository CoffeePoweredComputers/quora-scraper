            "answer_text": "I believe youths are most energetic component of society. They have fresh minds, new hopes, and new dreams. But on the other hand, they lack experience, they are new to the real world. Youths age range lies from 15\u201325. Court considers people of ages less than 16 or 17 or 18 (depends on the state), as a minor or a juvenile, reason being this age is still an immature stage of life. I believe if youth is investing their time and energy which is either illegal, disastrous or can cause harm to any section of the society, they should be stopped immediately. If they are growing, building something which is legit and could be helpful either to them or to someone else, they should not be stopped. They have all right to chase their dreams and reach the heights of success. ",
