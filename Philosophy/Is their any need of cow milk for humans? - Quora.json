We don't need to eat apples, we could get those vitamins from other sources, but we like apples. Same thing. Name any specific food, and I'll tell you that we don't need it. We need food, and the vitamins, minerals fibre and calories in it. What food we get this from is our choice. And we choose what we like to eat. ",

            "answer_text": "There are people who cannot drink milk and it does not contain anything nutritionally that can\u2019t be gotten from other sources. OTOH good milk, from pastured cattle (or sheep or goats) is a highly nutritious food. Milk has the advantage of being able to be made into a longer term storage form by turning fluid milk into cheese. The key is knowing where your milk comes from and how the animals are raised and treated. ",
