            "answer_text": "It depends what aspect of your moral code is at odds with general society. If you are a serial killer, for example, then my advice is to give yourself up to the police and receive your punishment or a lifetime in a psychiatric ward. If you are a married person who constantly needs to have affairs, then either be a very good liar or prepare for the inevitable divorce. If you are a politician who says one thing but does the opposite because it is politically expedient for you to do so, then no problem, just join the club of politicians. If you are a person who likes to pontificate about what is bad in the world, but then acts out much of that toxicity in their own lives, then look up the word \u2018hypocritic\u2019. If you are a CEO of a public company but who is secretly stealing money from your company\u2019s pension fund, then don\u2019t expect to get away with it for life. You will be found out. Basically, my point is this; some immoral behaviour can safely be left to the individual to deal with, other behaviours cannot - they blatantly transgress the laws of society and threaten the well-being of others. So only you can decide where you fit on this spectrum of immorality. Take comfort from the fact that pretty much every other human being is in precisely the same situation. ",

            "answer_text": "You decide what you honor. Do you honor yourself or do you bow down and become a mimic of society? Should you choose to be a mimic of what society wants, you are surrendering your right of self governance. You are stating that society is the higher organism to which you bow and genuflect. Society is the master. Should you choose to be individual, you are placing your self outside of society\u2019s collective thoughts; you are not a mimic. You are unique. The body is the flesh. The flesh is impermanent. It decays and rots. Yet, society honors the body. It places the flesh above everything and human flesh above all other flesh. It thinks itself supreme. Those who honor the body, live according to the preservation of the body. They will do anything to keep the body alive and when the body dies, it is buried rots and decays. Those who honor the mind, live according to the evolution and advancement of the mind. They will do anything to preserve the authenticity of their thoughts, their creativity, their individual personality and character, their morality and virtue. They will perfect their thinking and when the body dies, they are always remembered and this is why they live eternally. The mind cannot die. The choice is yours. (I would not choose to be a mimic) ",
