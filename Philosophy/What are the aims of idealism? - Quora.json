            "answer_text": " Idealism is a theory of \u2018reality\u2019. Which is to say that it is a way of thinking about the cosmos that is described and defended by the use of reasoned argument to affirm that the property of being \u2018real\u2019 is not limited to particular physical objects and forces. It is notable that different theories of reality are based on correspondingly different criteria for whether something is real or else merely an image of something else which is more real. Some philosophers such as Plato prioritise the persistent over the transitory. Under this way of thinking about reality, the sun, the moon, and the mountain, which persist, are considered more real than plants and animals which are transitory. The important things which persist were given \u2018divine\u2019 names because to be divine means to be eternal. Plato did not regard ideas as something that comes into existence in human brains. He regarded humans as having a special organ of perception with which it could perceive the \u2018form\u2019 of a particular thing separately from the material that instanciated the \u2018form\u2019 physically. Natural things do not present chaotic randomness. Nature presents its particulars in regular and identifiable \u2018forms\u2019. Each form is expressed in many, albeit transitory, particulars. It follows from this that the one \u2018form\u2019 is more real than the many transitory instances in which it is expressed. Other theories of reality prioritise with a different criteria, such as regarding something that can be sensed directly as more real than an idea about what can be directly sensed, which is the opposite of the way Plato thought about reality. In the modern scientific period the focus has been to find all the regular patterns of behaviour of natural things so that these patterns can be used to construct the many types of artificial objects which civilised people benefit from. The success criteria for a scientific theory is that it implies predictable changes which can be reliably be tested. It follows from this criteria that anything that is not determinable from a previous state is outside the domain of what is useful for science. It would, of course, not be rational to claim that the limited domain of the determinable is necessarily also the criteria for the \u2018real\u2019. It is not difficult to see that if the criteria for reality is limited to phenomenon that is deterministic then it would be logically consistent to infer that everything that cannot be determined is not real and only unknown. In this way an argument is made to claim that there cannot be any human free will. ",
