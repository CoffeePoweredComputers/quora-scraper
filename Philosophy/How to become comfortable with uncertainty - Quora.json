            "answer_text": "It's hard to simply become a person who's cool with uncertainty and can live in the moment. To a large extent, that's dictated by your personality. More conservative (small c) personality types are just predisposed to freak out a little when uncertainty or novelty hit their radar, and to be more comfortable with the familiar and safe. More liberal personalities (again, small l--it's not necessarily a political thing) are wired to dig novelty and unfamiliarity. It takes all kinds to make the world go around, right?  It goes back to our wiring as it developed way back in the day. The folks who were wired to not like uncertainty and unfamiliarity are that way because they were the Distant Early Warning lines of our tribal ancestors, keeping us safe by always watching the horizon for the enemy, or predators, or whatever's around the bend. The \"live in the moment\" types were the folks who traveled around, talking to people, inventing, innovating, and made life more livable for the rest of us.  So, you can see how it might be hard to just change your wiring and become the type of person who's cool with uncertainty and unfamiliar stuff, and who can just live in the moment. Gonna go ahead and guess that you've always been that way and you probably always will be.  That said, here's one way to appreciate uncertainty and change: recognize that there's not a damned thing you can do about it. Remember that change and uncertainty are the ONLY constants in this universe, and your mental attempts to resist them just increase the amount of radio chatter in your brain, driving you nuts. Take a deep breath and remember that you're but a speck of dust under the duvet cover of the universe and that when you're all gone, the universe will continue as it always has and as it always will and that that's just how it is. You are not going to stand astride the universe and bend it to your whim. You have, ultimately, a very small, very limited locus of control over the events in your life, and any attempt to expand it will be met with a swift, cosmic whack upside the head. Think about it this way: You can control some things. Go ahead and control them. You can't control everything, or anticipate everything. You just can't. Remember that, and then go have some fun. ",
