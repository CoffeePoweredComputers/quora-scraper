            "answer_text": "Usually a war is started against a weaker opponent. This causes the opposition to fight back. This opposition will usually be composed of various factions, usually with left wing leanings, who eventually will be placed under the banner of Anti Fascists. This goes back as far as the Spanish Civil War where Republicans & Communists fought on the same side (Anti Fascists). The side that starts the war is usually composed of various factions (National Fascist Party & Nazis or unregulated militias for example) who will become known as The Axis Of Evil. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve just outed yourself as a member of the latter. You now have the two opposing sides, everything else are casualties, collateral damage and refugees. You now fight and cause incredible damage to everything. I mean buildings, roads, bridges, economy\u2026 EVERYTHING! Check out the TV series The World At War, this will give you an idea. Eventually there\u2019s nothing much left except rubble. Or you could realise this is the 21st Century and accept that fascism isn\u2019t a good thing and everyone should be doing whatever they can to fight fascism, even if it\u2019s just reading the Bible (yes, the Bible is anti fascist)\u2026 Well, unless you see yourself as a Star Wars Stormtrooper, with issues. Or do you have a different fascism in mind, a good fascism? ",

            "answer_text": "Anti-fascism won on 30 April, 1945. They stopped participating in the underground. The survivors got to leave the camps. The soldiers got to go home. Other than building memorials to fallen anti-fascists, the other victims of fascism, and writing a poem, they pretty much went back to normal life. All it took was Hitler blowing his brains out. When the fascists crawl back into their holes, the anti-fascists move on with their lives.   The memorial to the murdered members of the Reichstag.  The White Rose Memorial.  M\u00e9morial de la France Combattante  The memorial to Polish soldiers and German anti-fascists.  An Antifascist apologizing for the crimes fascists committed once they gained control of a country. \u201cUnder the weight of recent history, I did what people do when words fall short. This is how I remembered the millions of victims.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that Brandt was an SPD member. Many of his colleagues are recognized in the memorial to the murdered members of the Reichstag. ",
