            "answer_text": "Epistemology is a fancy way of asking: \"How do you know that what you know is true?\" It takes for granted that there is no absolute truth. Instead there are only perspectives. You see this at work in: * Graduate school and to some extent undergraduate: preoccupied with the influence that sexism, racism, classism, and so on influence what we take for granted as knowledge.  * Research: \"The epistemological challenge is to tease out the lived experience of the subject from the sexist/racist/classist environment in which she was raised.\" * Media: abandonment of the pretense of objectivity; now you just choose your epistemological bent - MSNBC or Fox? Although I should say that some outlets are trying to return to a more balanced point of view. ",
