            "answer_text": "Absolutely! Perception is specific to every observer, what makes each observation subjective. 2 Observers might agree or disagree in some aspects of observed results - the stronger they will agree with eachother, the closer they get to the objective state of reality. Let\u2019s take a human, a bat, a rattlesnake (with infrared vision) and a small insect, then let them observe some determined process. Compare the way, in which this process is perceived by all observervers. How do you think, would a rattlesnake \u201cunderstand\u201d reality perceived by echolocation of a bat. And better, if I won\u2019t mention about the perception of a fruitfly or some other coakroach. I can\u2019t even imagine how things look like for a bug. It\u2019s like another reality within bigger reality (science calls this fractal-like). And yet, each kind of living creature need to be cosidered in physics, as a potential observer, capable to process information, collected by sensing his local environment\u2026 And now here\u2019s my question: how does mainstream science deal with such defined problem? Because now comes the funny part. Every observer has the ability, to affect the ongoing process in a definitive and objective way. Change induced by any observer, will affect in some way the reality, as it is perceivwed by all other creatures in the local environment. Change induced by observers, can be traced in the timeline of events, which were observed and recorded some time earlier\u2026 If any observer decides to affect in some way an ongoing process, it will cause a definitive change in observed reality, which can\u2019t be never fully un-done. You could possibly take a gun and kill the rattlesnake and then stomp on the insect just by accident. If any of this really happens, it will become an objective fact for every other observer. And now comes the great blasphemy - as observers can\u2019t possibly be aware of all cause/effect relations for a timeline with multiple events. Can anyone be absolutely sure, tha the death of insect, can\u2019t be in any way related to a bullet inside the reptile\u2019s head? Maybe, if he wouldn\u2019t shoot the snake, he wouldn\u2019t then accidentaly stomp on the insect\u2026 And in such case, is it even possible, to learn about the definitive truth about the objective state of reality? Somehow I can\u2019t see here too much space for actual determinism ",

            "answer_text": "It is likely. To a Christian, reality is different than to a Hindu, Buddhist or Jain. Same thing I can say about Islam or even Judaism. To a Christian, Christ was the ONLY son of God, but for a Hindu every one of us is a son of God and each one of us is a part of universal reality. To a Christian, God sent his only son, but Hindus believe there were sages sent to guide the mankind and Buddha was one of them. Buddhists also believe that there were Buddhas before Gautama Buddha and there will be Buddhas after him. Even within Buddhism, perception of reality had been different within different sects. After Buddha\u2019s parinirvana, his words were carefully dissected and analyzed. Buddha gave a broad explanation of suffering, but Vibhashika philosophers gave a long list of elements of suffering and then try to explain how these elements are perceived by our mind and then they explained how to end suffering. sautrantika philosophers later stated that the elements which are perceived by our mind are different than those which are produced at the core level. So not all elements are perceived by our mind. Then around 150AD, greatest Buddhist scholar Nagarjuna stated that the elements of suffering are constantly changing and they are not absolute elements and they are dependent on other elements and therefore our perception is in constant flux. So final results can be completely misleading if we think that elements do not change. He stated his philosophy is based on Buddha\u2019s statements that everything constantly changes. This Sunyata philosophy led to other philosophies later. One of the philosophy is Ksanika (momentary) philosophy. Ksanka philosophers started thinking about how these momentary pulses change and st what rate, and whether they affect time and space. The conclusion was that they affect time and space and that the motion is digital and not analog . To a Muslim, Mohammad was the last prophet, but soon after the death of Mohammad, new sects arose and now Islam has several sects in spite of the fact that Sunnis keep on enforcing that Quran is the word of God and Muhammad is the last prophet. Bahais, Shia, Bohras, Khojas and many other sects have arisen. So the perception of reality has changed. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they have to. Each individual is shaped by the biological, psychological, sociological domain in which their cognition is launched from. Because there are differences in all of those domains for all things, one can only be shaped the way that they are shaped. You can have identical twins, both eating the same thing for lunch, sitting side by side in sleds, sledding down the mountain at the exact same time.. one of them might have the perception that they are superman flying, their endorphins are high they feel like they are on top of the world, the other, might think, omg i\u2019m going to hit a tree and have my brains smashed out, their adrenlin and fear are up and they are deeply fearful and afraid. So yes, each has a different perception of the same physical reality. This function or feature extends to all components of emerged cognition, that is, it applies to belief and political ideations in the same way. Typically there will be a bell curve distribution of any thoughts or systems that emerge from any given population. ",

            "answer_text": "It is easy to say yes but that is not clear. The point is that the mind builds our reality by observing a consistent external environment. Other people obeserve the same reality and we can agree on a common basis evern though we don\u2019t know how they see it. Interactions with people and the world all work as we anticipate they should. So the basis for undertanding is perfect reasonable , but the underlying perceptions are potentially unique to all. Take colour for example this does not enter the eyes as say\u2026 red , it simply triggers a red cone which sends spikes of electro-chemical activity into te brain - it is the brain that creates the discriminant we call colour and we call this internal perception a quale (plural qualia). We you see in your mind may well be unique to you but it is always consistent red objects appear as your red and similar the red objects in others appears as their red so the result is consistent even if (and we cannot prove one way or the other) it is always different for everyone else.

If we look at it from the quantum perspective, in fact everyone build his own personal reality when observing it through his five senses. In quantum mechanics \"realism\" means \"notion that physical systems possess complete sets of definite values for various parameters prior to, and independent of, measurement \u00bb[1] Most theoremes and experiments falsify and rule out the existence of reality as we imagine it.[2]  When coming back to newtonian world we can consider that the perception of reality is a kind of collective construction with groups of men and women sharing similar beliefs and different moments in time. Questions as free will, morals, our relationships with nature, animals and other human beings are deeply influenced by our peers.  This said our personal understanding is based on our last recall of memories. Each time a souvenir arises in our mind he is stored back in a new version which becomes our reality. The more we are exposed to a certain reality, the stronger our convinctions about its nature. \u201cOften we don\u2019t realize that our attitude toward something has been influenced by the number of times we have been exposed to it in the past.\u201d \u2014 Robert B.

            "answer_text": "Yes, and no. Reality is the most complex system that we can possibly imagine. It is full of paradoxes. For example, everybody has about the same DNA, so this means that we perceive Reality in basically the same way. Colors, shapes, speed, sounds, food, flavor, odors, textures, and street traffic signs are basically the same for everybody. However \u2014 we obviously differ according to Taste (Style). Some people love spicy food, and others cannot tolerate it. Some people love fast cars, and others cannot abide them. Some people love opera, while others will not sit still for it. Some people love modern Art, while others mock it. And so on. Further, we obviously differ according to Economic Class. Some people are rich, and perceive the world from the perspective of the rich \u2014 wanting more and wanting to keep what they have, and to pay fewer taxes. Other people are middle class, and perceive the world through those eyes. Everybody should work. Everybody should pay taxes. Everybody should rise in education as far as possible. Everybody should take care of his or her own family. Everybody should obey the law, or submit to prison terms. Everybody should carefully guard the health of their families. Other people are poor, and perceive the world through the eyes of poverty. Where is my next meal going to come from? How can I understand the modern world and the modern economy, which gets more complex every day? How can I escape the cycle of poverty? Why do drugs and alcohol seem to be viable solutions for my situation? Where is the welfare office? This brief summary only scratches the surface, but we can rightly conclude \u2014 people share many important perspectives \u2014 and people differ sharply among many important perspectives. It\u2019s not an Either/Or proposition. ",

Anyone who doesn\u2019t, is delusional or a deviant.This would imply that perceptions are ONLY about the world, and not at all dependent on something about the self, the perceiver. But we know that every perceiver has a somewhat or very different position, exposure to different regions of our shared reality, and more than that, different interests and mental capacities for making sense of things. The meanings of \u201csimilar\u201d and \u201cdifferent\u201d are not in any way opposites\u2014 things can be both similar and different at the same time.

Thus I can only sense on the \u201coutside\u201d what's in the \u201cinside\u201d.

If their view is correct, they still must constantly be questioning everything in order to not be led astray from what is truth. Whatever anyone\u2019s perception is, they must search out knowledge. Knowledge in spiritual terms is truth and wisdom. We must gather our information from what is seen and what is unseen. This is why we should observe the world around us (that which is seen) and question everything. And then we should go within ourselves, because this is where the unseen world is. Meditation can help with this part of the journey. We do this so when everything is said and done. We discover the truth without anyone\u2019s help. That is if we always question everything and contemplate those results. ",

I can only perceive what I conceive in my awareness. This will be based on what I've been taught by my family, tribe and nation. Accepting their truth of what reality can be and cannot be, I cannot see another's \u2026\u2026unless, by a bold step in consciousness, I transform my beliefs and conceive and THEN perceive something else. Thereby, I can get a new understanding of what reality can be.

If there is a national dance, such as the Irish jig, not everyone will perform it exactly the same way because some people have longer legs & can dance faster, some drank too much Irish whiskey & can\u2019t dance much at all, etc. You get the idea. I know you were looking for a philosophical answer to this question so here it is: as I explained above with material issues, the same goes with thought processes in the mind. We might all start with same idea fixed in our minds, but our subconscious preferences/idiosyncrasies about the idea, good/bad memories, people we associate with it, & miscellaneous other things come creeping into the idea, making it uniquely OUR idea now & what we think of it. That is what makes our reality of the idea different from anyone else\u2019s reality of the idea. I hope my demonstrations have helped you. ",
