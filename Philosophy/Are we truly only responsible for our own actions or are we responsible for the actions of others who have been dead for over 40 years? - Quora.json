            "answer_text": "A good question, and I think I know how most Americans would answer (\u201cNo!\u201d or something more pungent). But I want to offer a different view. I think there are different kinds of responsibilities and different degrees of responsibility, and we may well be responsible somewhat for others\u2019 actions long ago. To explain: Different kinds: Legal responsibility and moral responsibility are not the same; you can be legally blameless and morally culpable, when a moral harm isn\u2019t illegal. Likewise, responsibility for identifiable actions is different from responsibility for maintaining or supporting behavior, and both from intentions, beliefs and attitudes. Then there is an important distinction among committing an action and enabling it. Different degrees: Some may think everyone involved in any way in some action is equally responsible, but I think there are different degrees, with some bearing more responsibility and some less. Putting this together: Obviously you didn\u2019t commit actions that happened before you were born, or now without your awareness or active participation. So you don\u2019t have the primary responsibility for those actions. But what if you benefited or profited from those actions, have accepted those benefits and profits, and refuse to make things right with the injured parties when you can? What if you refuse to consider whether you are responsible, seeking refuge in feigned ignorance? I think you still bear some responsibility for those past or remote actions (by others) due to your current actions. Also, overt action or behavior isn\u2019t the only thing for which we are responsible morally (in distinction from legally). We are also responsible for what we think, for our beliefs, attitudes, judgments that maybe only we (and God) know. So sympathy with some past wrong action makes one morally responsible for that action, even if not to the same degree as the person who actually committed it. The great example for Americans today, of course, is current responsibility for the horrors of slavery and its lingering effects in our society. I know there is a strong urge to claim immunity from any responsibility by actions of our ancestors; we all want to think well of ourselves. But whites are currently benefiting from the lingering effects of white supremacy run amok, and I think they bear considerable responsibility for making things right, or at least better. ",

            "answer_text": " Stumbling Block. Photo by Author You are only responsible for your own action according to the one who claims to be sovereign over everybody and has the final decision. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. (2 Corinthians 5:10, NASB) Anyone saying otherwise is usurping their authority and just trying to make you stumble to take advantage of you. But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you regard your brother with contempt? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God. Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather determine this--not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother's way. (Romans 14:10, 12,13 NASB) Challenging this is usually from people vexed with bitter jealousy. But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth. This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, natural, demonic. For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there is disorder and every evil thing. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without hypocrisy. (James 3:14\u201317 NASB) I do not judge anyone. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can appraise the situation. But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one.

            "answer_text": "I don't think we can reasonably be prrsonally responsible for the actions of others that occurred in the past . However , I do think that if we hold office in an organization or institution where great wrongs occurred under previous leadership , then the current leadership has a duty to deal with any present consequences of past organizational or institutional wrongs. The reason for this is that the organization or institution as an enduring entity still exists and carries along with its ongoing existence the legacy of its past . Not knowing the specific context you had in mind for your question I might make a guess that perhaps you were wondering about the conflictual issues around racial justice affecting the U.S. presently ? Many people believe that the U.S. owes the present decendents of African American slaves some form of reparations . The U.S. is an enduring entity and therefore , does carry forward the legacy of its past. Furthermore , there really is no one in the U.S. on either side of the argument that doesn't recognize that slavery was a great sin of the past. So, strictly from these observations it seems that the government does need to deal with the present consequences of this sin. However , the American government is said to be \u201cof the people and for the people . \u201c The implication is that the government works on behalf of the people and the people sanction the government . Now who is responsible - all Americans ? There are many other factors impinging on the overall conflict, but, this discussion was specifically trying to provide a thoughtful answer to your question .

            "answer_text": "Are we truly only responsible for our own actions or are we responsible for the actions of others who have been dead for over 40 years? Responsible for the actions of others dead for 40 years? I\u2019m not. I\u2019ve never been found responsible for the actions of anyone even recently dead. Or for that matter, anyone else alive - anyone other than myself. Oh, sure in certain teamwork setups, multiple people take on responsibility for a shared area. Share blame and credit as they rely on each others\u2019s diligence. It\u2019s our own actions and statements we\u2019re most naturally concerned in. Partly because we\u2019re most readily implicated in them. Where others question or challenge us on what we\u2019ve ourselves done or said, and we can\u2019t respond (or won\u2019t) - our denial of responsibility will not leave people saying \u201cOh, you aren\u2019t responsible!\u201d They\u2019ll say \u201cYou\u2019re irresponsible.\u201d It pains me to say this, but we\u2019re really only responsible for whatever we take on. Consequence is not the same as responsibility. Where we wrong others we find the consequence, either in how they treat us or how they no longer wish to treat us. In certain cases, when they appeal to law for redress. In the informal case they\u2019re free to choose whatever they\u2019ll give of themselves, and to whom. Decide what they\u2019ll take, too. And what of themselves they\u2019ll take away. Our responsibility not required. In the civil or criminal case we may be made liable to punishment. This is sometimes called \u201cbeing made responsible.\u201d It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just consequence. Consequence comes down regardless of how responsible or irresponsible we are. Point is. Tons of people don\u2019t take responsibility for what they do. They deny, excuse, justify - they refuse. They\u2019ll claim they couldn\u2019t do anything, or otherwise. Often enough, to sell their denial they refuse to do anything at all. To prove their powerlessness, they deny even the control they have. They\u2019re not found \u201cnot responsible,\u201d they\u2019re found irresponsible. But we have whatever responsibility we take on. We look around the world, see what\u2019s fair and what\u2019s tragic, and what could be better, and what we could do. We take on responsibility for what wasn\u2019t ours. We take it on. We make it ours. If nobody took on responsibility for what people forty years dead left to us, the world would have fallen apart. We take it on. We make it ours. We are responsible by right of possession. Not responsible for what was done. Responsible for what we\u2019ll do with it now. Or as we wish - not responsible. Irresponsible. Me, I\u2019m responsible for the universe. But I won\u2019t fight you for the part you\u2019ve taken on, to be responsible for. Hell, I\u2019m glad you have. ",
