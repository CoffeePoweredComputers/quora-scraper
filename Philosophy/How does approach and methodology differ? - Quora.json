For example, you may have an agile approach to develop software and under that umbrella, you have a method like Scrum that details taks and roles, but you also may have an approach on how to prioritize the backlog whithin the Scrum method. Hope it helps. ",

In software development, we have CMMi which is a methodology which tells you exactly what needs to be done and by whom and at what time. This is quite rigid and often documented somewhere clearly so that people can exactly follow that. However Scrum is an approach to a software development. It provides you a framework which gives you the freedom to follow it as per your situation. ",
