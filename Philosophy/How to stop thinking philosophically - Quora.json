            "answer_text": "I totally get where you\u2019re coming from. I\u2019m like this too. Oftentimes I over-philosophize. It\u2019s not good. You become lost in your mind and lose your presence. In this case you need to find a means to ground yourself in reality. What I like to do is: Pause and become present. Stop what you are doing, stop your chain of thought from going on and on and on. Look around you. Observe your surroundings. Take everything in \u2014 the sights, smell, feel. Use your senses. Once you bring all your attention to the present moment, you begin to see its beauty. Take in the beauty around you. It will no longer be filtered by your thoughts.Play sports, play a game, and/or exercise. These activities will keep your mind grounded in the present. Whatever you are doing becomes the only reality to you \u2014 i.e. the game becomes the only reality while you are playing it, if that makes sense. The rest of the world doesn\u2019t exist in that moment and that prevents you from philosophizing about the world and life. Even playing a board game like Monopoly has the same effect. They\u2019re also heaps fun and good for you.Do something spontaneous, fun, and light-hearted. It\u2019s important to not be too serious in life and that\u2019s a lesson I learned far too late. We need to do something spontaneous and meaningless once in a while. Go to the beach late at night with friends or family. Watch a movie. Attempt to make some different food based on a recipe. Just put on the radio and dance. Balancing your life by doing these sorts of light-hearted things is as important as the other serious stuff.",
