            "answer_text": " Very. Imagination is an integral part of the human mind that covers both the creative and learning spheres. Increasing one\u2019s imagination creates possibilities. It is considered to be the creative faculty of the mind that helps a person in process-oriented activities, such as thinking, memorizing, remembering or opinion forming. A rich imagination can enable a person to pursue and accomplish many great things. There are various ways to enrich one\u2019s imagination: Widen experiences Experience as much as you can. Exposure puts more ideas into your subconscious. Actively seek out new and very different experiences to broaden your idea thinking experience portfolio. Look for what is not easily seen Look where others aren't looking to see what others aren't seeing. Here\u2019s how: How to Be Good at Your Imagination Be able to overlook rules Rules, to the creative person, are indeed made to be broken. They are created for us by other people, generally to control a process; the creative person needs freedom in order to work. Ask\u201cwhat if\u2026\u201d Seeing new possibilities is a little risky because it means that something will change and some sort of action will have to be taken. Curiosity is probably the single most important trait of creative people. Build on others One of the misunderstandings around creativity and imagination is that you have to be utterly original to do it. Yet the truth is all creative people stand on the shoulders of those who came before. Writers learn to write by reading, painting students are sent to museums to copy the masters, while great chefs learn the already tested basics of cooking in order to create some new dish. Innovation stands on a platform that already exists. Yes inspiration is involved, those flashes of insight, the ah\u2026ha moments. Yet you start with something that already exists and takes it to another level. So relax. Let go of thinking you have to do something original. Take the pressure off. Celebrate that there is all this help available. Question everything Want to think about what nobody has ever thought? Start by questioning all assumptions. There comes a moment in time where everyone agrees with everybody about pretty much everything. For any sized organization that is focused on creating a culture of relentless innovation, hardened dogma is an innovation obstacle they must overcome. And that starts best with questioning everything, assumptions included. Pay attention to patterns Treat patterns as part of the problem. Recognizing a new pattern is very useful, but be careful not to become part of it. Observe with all senses Truly creative people have developed their ability to observe and to use all of their senses, which can get dull over time. Take time to \"sharpen the blade\" and take everything in. Add thoughts as you go. Continuous learning Both creativity and innovation are based on knowledge. Therefore, you need to continually expand your knowledge base. Read things you don't normally read as often as you can. Defer judgment Your perceptions may limit your reasoning. Be careful about how you're perceiving things. In other words, defer judgment. Let it all hang out, so to speak.

Creation is a long process, involving lots of boo-boos along the way. A lot goes in the trash. Collaborate The hermit artist, alone in his garret, is a romantic notion but not always an accurate one. Comedians, musicians, painters, chefs all get a little better by sharing with others in their fields. Mike Schoultz is a digital marketing and customer service expert.
