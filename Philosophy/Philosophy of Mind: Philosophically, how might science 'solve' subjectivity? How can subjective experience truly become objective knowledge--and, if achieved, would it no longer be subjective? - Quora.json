            "answer_text": "To a conscious being, the subjective experience is all there is. Objectivity is a sharable truth that works in the outside world. There is a nice slogan by P.R. Sarkar, the founder of the socio-spiritual cult Ananda Marga, that points it out: Subjective approach through objective adjustment. For you, the subjective approach means in religious terms, that you try to know God in all you experience. From a more psychological way of thinking, this means, that you try to see the unity in diversity. This is the synthetic faculty of mind that has neurological correlates in the brain. The \u2018I\u2019-feeling in itself is also product of this synthetic faculty, the knower who knows that you do know. Ultimately, the knower of the microcosmos, the unit being\u2019s self, can only be the macrocosmos. So one may wonder how this macrocosmos knows me. Can there indeed be a Supreme Subjectivity, a God, that knows all? Does the macrocosmos have a mind and what does that mean objectively from the perspective of science? These are obviously questions into the abstract nature of reality. Can observing behaviour ultimately let us know the subjective flow internal to the mind guiding the unit being? Philosophically I would say no, only a hypothetical God could do that. On the other hand, we could not communicate were we not to some extent able to intuit the inner subjective state of the other. This is also the stuff that makes up art, literature and other forms of human creative expression. I think we could have a bio-psychological approach, examining and cataloging he various propensities of human bodies in both their objective and subjective aspect. This requires a proper understanding of human physiology and neurology as well as systematic evaluation of the inner experience. Any future technology will be useful for that, but in the end it may still be like looking at the mechanics of a watch and wondering what time is. Empathy, intuition, common experience support the intersubjective bond between people. It would be great to look through your eyes, to be you for a while, but then, there would not be me in that moment. If I become you, there is no more me. It is the eternal mystery of separation, the gap that the flow of being in love tries to spark. ",

            "answer_text": "Talking about perspective, objective means ones that aren\u2019t influenced by personal emotion, opinion, prejudice or feeling, which is often quantifiable, measurable, and replicable. While subjective considers ones personal interpretation. People often says subjective is an arguable opinion whereas objective is undeniable truth e.g. I would say 2016-2017 is the worst season for Arsenal, this statement might subjectively different from people to people, but the objective facts is that we\u2019re down to 6th place right now \u2639. So, we can \u2018convert\u2019 subjective into objective knowledge by cross-checking the interpretation with observable facts/science? Not so fast. Let\u2019s just contemplate a little more. It is indeed, with the progressive advancement of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), human can immediately conclude whether something is undeniable truth or not; Tardigrade is toughest organism on earth, LQBTQ isn\u2019t a disease, the earth crust is currently moving in constant pace, and so on. But to make thing interesting, i should emphasize that no matter how objective science is, it\u2019s impossible to no to attract at least 2 observers. Instead science, which is backboned by observable facts from various observers, may serves different result and different interpretation. You could say, 1+1=2, and most people will certainly say so too, but another observer might say that 1+0.99999\u2026 =2, and not 1.99999\u2026. The other observer will argue and said that 1+0.99999\u2026=1.99999\u2026 and not 2. Even this kind of different interpretation happened in mathematics, that often glorified as the most objective science. In physic, the essence of objectivity is tampered by the emerging of Quantum Physic, which is so peculiar and doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2026 but still be considered as objective! It stated that the electron of an atom will existed near the atom itself, but in Quantum Physic, we could argue that the electron might existed in faraway galaxy, million light years from the atom. The fact remain \u2018subjective\u2019 from different observer, so do you still believed science is \u2018objective\u2019? could science with its arguable-undeniable truth-paradox convert something \u2018subjective\u2019 into \u2018objective\u2019? I\u2019m not even mentioning solipsism; when existing reality might be contrived by our own brain, or a particular system just like The Matrix. Everyone, perhaps, will agree that human need oxygen to survive, but what if oxygen is actually some kind of hallucinogen that generated our current reality of universe? Our consciousness? What if that death is actually the end of hallucination stage? If multiverse were true, and any universe has different value of maximum light speed, what stopping us thinking that all of our knowledge of universe is only a simulation generated by high-tech computer? Is reality the way it is? What if reality is only subjective interpretation simulate by a higher entity? This is what happen if you\u2019ve contemplated in philosophy too deep. You might even can\u2019t determined objectivity. Subjective experience is all there is, depends on how the observer observing. For me, personally, the true objectivity would be achieved if, and if only, there were no observer; when there were no more intelligent being observing universe. The true objectivity would be achieved when there were no more question like this. Ps. I\u2019m not high. ",
