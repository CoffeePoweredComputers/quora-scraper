            "answer_text": "More complex than any structure in the known cosmos, the brain is a masterwork of nature, a 3lb universe cradled between our ears having more connections than there are stars in the Milky Way. \u2014That is the most awesome reference describing the human brain that I have ever came across. Of course I revised it a little to take out the excess jargon and put together all my favorite parts. Your question is one of the greatest mysteries of science and philosophy. There is no place in the brain where electric stimulation can cause a person to believe or decide. Nobody can tell what we are thinking by measuring brain waves. We must be asked what we are thinking. We have access to our mind, we can recognize and describe what we know, remember, and think. We do not have access to our brain, we cannot tell which regions are active during particular activities. Introduction: The Human Brain explains the vast majority of the brain\u2019s activity is subconscious, but our conscious thoughts, sensations and perceptions \u2013 what define us as humans \u2013 cannot yet be explained in terms of brain activity. So, it\u2019s easy for me to understand why individuals might disconnect the two. Our brains are the physical source of our mind. Our emotions and senses are very tightly intertwined. What we hear, see, taste, smell, and touch can provide us with information on how to feel. What we feel can be heavily influenced by what our senses are taking in. Meaning that when you feel happy, something you\u2019re sensing may have an impact in that euphoria. If we have a thought or experience an emotion, it\u2019s because our brain has done something, like electrical signals crackling along a whole bunch of neurons and those neurons handing off droplets of neurochemicals. Although traveling bursts of voltage can carry signals across the brain quickly, those electrical spikes may not be the only, or even the main, way that information is carried in nervous systems. Other possible information couriers are glial cells (poorly understood brain cells that are 10 times as common as neurons), other kinds of signaling mechanisms between cells (such as newly discovered gases and peptides), and the biochemical cascades that take place inside cells. There is a big reason why we don\u2019t know all of the answers. The reason being that it\u2019s just not that simple to monitor the connections of a brain that contains roughly 80 billion neurons, each of which communicates with thousands of other neurons. A typical neuron in the cortex receives input from some 10,000 other neurons. How our minds operate and how we run our bodies, are both dependent on our brains. We know from cases of brain damage and the effects of psychoactive drugs, that our experiences are caused by physical chemistry acting on our physical neurones in our brains. Our innermost self is our biochemical self. Our emotions are physical in nature. Biological effects can have deep and profound effects on our true selves. Degenerative diseases of the brain can erode personality, brain damage can cause sudden changes in character, tumours can alter our feelings and biochemical imbalances radically swing our moods. Neurologists have delved deep into the brain and discovered that depression, love, niceness, politeness, aggression, abstract thinking, judgement, patience, instincts and memories have turned out to have biochemical causes, not spiritual ones, and can all be radically affected by brain damage and brain surgery. This is all only possible if consciousness and emotions are all physical, with no need for soul theory. If there was a soul, brain damage could not also damage our emotional feelings: but it does. Electrical stimulation of the brain causes actual desire to arise instantly. If memory, behaviour and emotions are all controlled by the physical brain, what is a soul for? Any free will it exerts is promptly overridden by biological chemistry hence why so many diseases have an uncontrollable effect on personality. Modern science proves that the idea of souls is misguided. Everything is biological.\u201d \"Emotions Are Biological: How Biochemistry and Neurology Account for Feelings\"\nVexen Crabtree (1999) Our brainstem controls the impulses that are sent to our body. Our muscles, glands, hormone secretions, skin sensitivity, organ action, heart rate and thousands of other actions are all controlled by our nervous system, which is managed by our brains. So, if we damage a part of our brain we can impair our ability to control our bodies. If we damage our medulla, our physical co-ordination can be lost, if we damage our frontal lobes, our personality can be changed. This is because the brain controls the body and emotions. The cause and effect is clear. If things happen to our bodies that we do not choose (such as the progression of Alzheimer's disease, which causes senility and dementia), we are forced to change our behaviour and feelings as a result of changes to the structure of our brain during medical procedures. Psychosurgery, including lobotomies or leucotomies, became used regularly from the 1930s for severely disrupted patients. Since then highly accurate and specific stereotactic tractotomies, stereotactic limbic leucotomies and the like have been developed, allowing the destruction of very small parts of the brain, normally locating particular pathways between one part and another in order to change specific aspects of behaviour and symptoms. For example, a cingulotomy is occasionally used against obsessive and compulsive patients by destroying 2-3cm of particular white matter. An amygdalotomy destroys the brain's neural connection between the amygdala and the hypothalamus and is normally used on patients who suffer from episodes of unstoppable violence and terror. What all this shows is that the physical structures and chemistry of the brain can control large portions of our chosen behaviours, experiences and feelings. \u201cA small amount of damage [...] might even cause rather dramatic changes in your personality. Why? Because your brain is the seat of your self-awareness, the locus of your intelligence, your compassion, and your creativity. All of your mental activities - your thoughts, emotions and feelings - and all your bodily processes are affected by the functioning of your brain.\u201d \"Understanding Human Behavior\" by James V. McConnel (1986) Neurobiologist Steven Rose pointed out in The Future of the Brain (2005), a snapshot of the brain\u2019s current state might also be meaningless unless we knew the entire life history of that brain\u2019s owner, perhaps even about the social context in which that person was raised. To understand even the basics of how the brain maintains the human intellect, we might need to know not just the current state of all 86 billion neurons and their 100 trillion interconnections, not just the varying strengths with which they are connected, and not just the states of more than 1,000 proteins that exist at each connection point, but how the moment-to-moment activity of the brain contributes to the integrity of the system since the brain has the ability to actually change its physical structure as a result of learning. Add to this the uniqueness of each brain, brought about in part because of the uniqueness of each person\u2019s life history. All of those things make sense to me. But still there are some factors to consider that only make everything more questionable. Such as Quantum energy. Quantum physicists discovered that physical atoms are made up of vortices of energy that are constantly spinning and vibrating, each one radiating its own unique energy signature. Therefore, if we really want to observe ourselves and find out what we are, we are really beings of energy and vibration, radiating our own unique energy signature -this is fact and is what quantum physics has shown us time and time again. We are much more than what we perceive ourselves to be, and it\u2019s time we begin to see ourselves in that light. If you observed the composition of an atom with a microscope, you would see a small, invisible tornado like vortex, with a number of infinitely small energy vortices called quarks and photons. These are what make up the structure of the atom. As you focused in closer and closer on the structure of the atom, you would see nothing, you would observe a physical void. The atom has no physical structure, we have no physical structure, physical things really don\u2019t have any physical structure! Atoms are made out of invisible energy, not tangible matter. Our experience tells us that our reality is made up of physical material things, and that our world is an independently existing objective one. What quantum mechanics reveals is that there is no true \u201cphysicality\u201d in the universe, that atoms are made of focused vorticies of energy-miniature tornadoes that are constantly popping into and out of existence. The revelation that the universe is not an assembly of physical parts, suggested by Newtonian physics, and instead comes from a holistic entanglement of immaterial energy waves stems from the work of Albert Einstein, Max Planck, and Werner Heisenberg, among others. So, are our minds physical or non-physical? In all honesty, I\u2019m not sure. ",

            "answer_text": "The mind is non-physical in the sense of being software, as opposed to hardware. Software in most general terms is aperiodic patterns that have a purpose or function. Thus sheet music is a type of software, not the paper on which it is written but the symbolic musical notes (in a very specific code) that are written which are interpreted to produce specific sounds. Patterns scratched in the sand with a stick to communicate information is also software, easily erased, easily copied, easily translated to a different coding scheme, but still retaining the same information. Patterns cannot and do not exist in a vacuum and must be expressed and saved or preserved in some medium. Thus a song can be saved as musical notes written on paper, it can be grooves in a record album, magnetic domains in a cassette tape or invisible variations of refractive index in a CD, but sounds the same when played. That song can also be saved in a person\u2019s wet organic memory inside her brain that she can recall and playback via her vocal chords. The songs (the patterns, not the sounds) are not physical but that pattern is expressed, transmitted, communicated and saved by physical means. Our thoughts are no different (from songs). Our mind is like an elaborate collection of software that processes incoming sensory data, recalls from memory data from past experiences, analyzes data, makes decision on to act, speak or otherwise communicate a suitable response if necessary. As the mind is expressed by the many trillion neuronal interconnections in our brain, it is lost when the brain decomposes upon death or is damaged by trauma or decease. In principle, all the trillions of bits of memory (information and programming code that comprise our mind) can be copied from one human brain to another medium (like copying a song from an album to a CD or a video from a hard disk to an USB stick) for storage and backup for possible restoration into another similar brain. Except, we do not have the foggiest idea at present how that information is organized nor how to access it in any meaningful way to copy it. Even from the tiny brain of a fruit fly, which also has a mind powerful enough to let it fly circles around you. Further, since all the data in our brain is received continuously through sensors in our body (eyes and ears mainly, but hands and feet too) and responses communicated out through \u201coutput devices\u201d like our mouth, facial expressions, fists or feet, the mind is strongly connected to the physical body. Thus even if we could copy the mind from one person it may not sit well in the brain of another body, in much the same way as the OS of a desktop is not compatible with the OS of a tablet or phone, though both might perform some similar functions. Probably this is much more than you needed to answer your question, but hope it helps to understand the concepts. ",
