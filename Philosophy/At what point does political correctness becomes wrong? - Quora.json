            "answer_text": "Certainly when it occludes the meaning of the message for purely political purposes (something good happened on Trump's watch). For example, when the Washington Post famously reported on the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the headline referred to him as an 'austere religious scholar' instead of the leader of ISIS, arguably the most brutal terrorist organization in modern times. I think few will disagree that that crossed the line. But that's an extreme example. Others innocently creep into casual conversation that all too often come across as people having chips on their shoulders. Inadvertantly using the word 'Oriental' instead of 'Asian' has gotten me in trouble on more than one occasion (with someone who was offended on behalf of the former). It disrupts productive discourse, particularly since I don't always have time to read today's addendum to the PC dictionary. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on what you think political correctness is. The term\u201d Political correctness\u201d literally doesn\u2019t mean correct in politics, rather it is acting/pretending correct for the sake of politics. It is accepting the ideas that are held by majority, inoffensive and rejecting or (sometimes violently) dismissing the ideas that are offensive irrespective of whether they are Just/unjust/Truth/lie etc. It is not wrong to be a politically correct person, unless you are aggressively trying silence politically incorrect opinions.

As such, by the judgement of that society, political correctness cannot be wrong. Only to the barbarian, that individual that rejects morality and ethics, can political correctness be wrong. In our society, that means political correctness is wrong if it undermines bigotry, racism and mysogyny. ",
