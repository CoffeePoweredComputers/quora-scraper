            "answer_text": "Aarav, Socrates did not die for philosophy, he died for what he thought was correct thing to do. People died for different reasons, from those who died for the nation, for freedom, for welfare of people, for money, for getting high to idiots who died and killed others for saving their own butt. All of them died because they thought they were doing the right thing. A person running away from a cop dying in a accident also thinks that he/she is doing the right thing. They are doing it for themselves. The person who died for a nation, at the border also did it for themselves. Themselves, as in, their thoughts. The thing that made them \u2018them\u2019. It is our thoughts that promote our actions of deliberation. These thoughts are what make us \u2018us\u2019, individuals. However simple or complex, noble or selfish a thought may seem, for that person, that is what defines him or her. So, I\u2019d die for myself. If I\u2019m not myself, I\u2019m dead anyways. And there are other schools of thought. ",

Me (reading the last few pages of James Patterson book)\u2014 bhai just 5 mins. Brother- come out you idiot. After 10 mins. World war 3 happened.  Scene 3\u2013 IGI airport, leaving for honeymoon. Husband\u2014 can we sit in peace. Me- no I need to get these books, let's go to that counter. After 1 an hour and buying some 4 books. Husband- I never knew you were going to enjoy with these more than me. Ps. I plead guilty of reading even on honeymoon. So I firmly believe I would be sentenced to death for this crime. LOL ",
