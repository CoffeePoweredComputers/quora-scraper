            "answer_text": "This is a flawed question because it asks \u201chow far\u201d we are from an abstract concept, which may or may not exist and we\u2019ll get to that. But how can you be \u201cfar from\u201d a concept? How far are we from Love? Okay, so there\u2019s the attempt to quantify a distance or time from a squishy concept but consider also the Truth is a defunct philosophical ideal reminiscent of Plato or Aristotle, perhaps. Where is Truth? How does one arrive there? If I did manage to arrive there could I bring it back with me? What sort of container would I need? The closest we have come to Truth is an ever-more precise description of the relationships between things: height and potential velocity if dropped is a simple example. But gravitation varies from place to place, and with height! Even factoring out things like air pressure and the actual geometry of the object - remember some object will actually float or sail on the air due to their geometry - if we measured at various points on the Earth we\u2019d get different answers. So it\u2019s about 9.8 m/s/s for a point mass in a vacuum at sea level. As you add layers of complexity the picture gets exponentially complicated. People often complain about the accuracy of weather predictions, but have you ever stopped to consider how complicated the weather actually is? For us to predict wind speeds and directions and chances of precipitation, and type, seven days from now and accurately is a major technological undertaking. And we can do that! People say, \u201cOh, the weatherman said it would rain today and it didn\u2019t!\u201d Well, what the weatherman said was there was a probability of rain, and even if there is 99% chance of rain and it doesn\u2019t rain the prediction is still valid. But is that Truth? No, that\u2019s a probabilistic prediction. Some things either are or are not true, for example there is a Moon. Okay, that is a Truth. But most things we would like to know, \u201cWhat will be the price of oil six months from now?\u201d is not a Truth but a probability. If you could predict that you could have insider knowledge on economies of scale and become a billionaire extremely quickly. Name one person who has done that? That there is Truth for us to somehow attain, as in some esoteric concept like Salvation or Enlightenment, is a Classical or Medieval concept we will simply have to dispense with. The truest things we have ever discovered, like particle physics, are pure probability. ",
