            "answer_text": "Yes, we are. Most of us do not consider our subconscious as part of our conscious. So that right there tells us that we are collective, that multiple entities determine our existence. So let\u2019s dive a bit. Our bodies consist of all kinds of cells. We have more bacterial cells than we do bodily cells. Scientists are just now beginning to grasp just how important our gut bacteria are to our well-being. Sure, you could argue that it\u2019s possible, with enough willpower, to ignore our stomach. I\u2019d tell you that\u2019s a foolish thing to try to do. Each of us has more neurons than exist humans on this Earth. It does not make any sense at all to consider human pan-psychism before considering how in the world it is that we are able to act independently of our minds. How do billions of neurons contribute to one mind? It\u2019s even worse. Our billion neurons have a neural superhighway called the corpus callosum. It connects our two brains together. People are born with congenital corpus callosum defects, in some rare cases it\u2019s actually not present. One person in public consciousness exhibits this, this person\u2019s name was Kim Peek and they made the movie Rain Man from his accounts. The various components of our daily, bodily existence contribute carefully to our daily existence but don\u2019t work hard for it. If we want something totally novel we can go there. But it doesn\u2019t happen by default., ",

Although it is often described and discussed in secular terms with reference to societal norms such as common belief, ideas and moral dispensation, etc. It also has a spiritual dimension; which proves, beyond logic and rationale, the existence and practicality of it. When there is dearth of rain in a region/community, Muslims get together and set out into the open to offer \u201csalat al Istisqa\u201d and, most often than not, it rains. In Christianity. \u201cYou visit the earth and water it abundantly, enriching it greatly.

In Ishmael (1992) Daniel Quinn called it a \u201ccultural matrix.\u201d We all live in it, but this perception-nurturing Mother Culture has no independent existence outside of our heads. She is made of our thoughts. She is made of our minds. She is the collective conscious of which we are a part. ",

            "answer_text": "No, I don\u2019t think so. Animals are conscious - to the degree that they are conscious - because they have to be or they will perish. An unconscious animal cannot survive. OK, hibernation means unconscious, but when the animal comes out of hibernation, they better be fully conscious or they won\u2019t pass on their genes. We collectively do not need to be conscious collectively, that is why I don\u2019t think it even exists outside of some peoples\u2019 imaginations. ",

We are absolutely linked to one another and to God through consciousness. There are endless varieties of consciousness\u2026 but consciouseness is the linking term for me. ",
