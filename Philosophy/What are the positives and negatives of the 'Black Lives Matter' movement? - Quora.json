            "answer_text": "My opinion is as follows- Positives: It brings awareness of police brutalities (especially the ones that go unpunished)It shows to others that racism is still presentIt brings the unity that was lacking among Black communitiesIt gives young persons (especially) an \"idea\" of what the Civil Rights movement was like in the 1960sIt gives young black persons something to fight forIt allows black persons to want to make a difference in their communityIt makes the rest of the world more aware of the \"bias\" police system in the United StatesA lot of celebrities are showing their support for the movement (Janelle Monae, Beyonce, Rick Ross, Lauryn Hill, etc)Through the celebrities, even more persons are made aware of the movementIt makes people take out their cellphones and want to record any negative interaction that they may have with a police officerNegatives: Lots of misunderstandingsMany persons feel alienated by the term \"Black Lives Matter,\" and feel the need to say \"All lives Matter\" so it creates a divisionMany persons don't understand that the movement is about acknowledging that Yes, all lives matter (of course), and all lives include the black persons that have been unfairly killed by police officers who walked out of the court nearly freeIt is unclear who the face of Black Lives Matter truly is. Most movements had inspirational leaders who clearly stated the objectives and motivated people, a representative that met with government officials and negotiated terms (Martin Luther King Jr. for instance). There is always a need for things like these to have a leader, someone that everyone can think of when they think of Black Lives Matter, and someone who inspires them to speak out against police brutalitiesNobody really knows what the objectives of the Black Lives Matter movement is, people ask everyday \"And what are you hoping to achieve?\" Also some people demean the stated objectives \"Are you saying that ALL black men shot by police officers didn't deserve to be shot?\"Some white persons (especially) feel hated by this movementThe movement makes it seem like no white police officer in the US cares about black people (as I said, lots of misunderstandings) and that the court system hates black people (although... um never mind)People think that the movement condones violence and is yet another way \"black persons are showing their violent behaviours\"People are saying that black people are ignoring the \"black on black\" crimes and projecting it onto the Black Lives Matter movementOne or two persons with signs saying \"What do we want? Dead cops!\" which brings an even more negative image on the movementIt forces black persons to expect a negative interaction with police officers and to be defiant at timesSome people just miss the point Blue Lives MatterRacist comments online",
