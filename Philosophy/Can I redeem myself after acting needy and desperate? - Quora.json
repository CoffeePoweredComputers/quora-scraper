            "answer_text": "Yes. You can be respectful of other people's time, energy and emotions. This means putting your needs in your court. You take care of you. When you can do that, you won't feel needy and desperate- you will have already taken care of those things that make you act needy and desperate.  When you do this your interactions will change. People won't feel like they owe you something to help balance your emotions like that. That way, you can get back to talking about things that aren't problems, or emotional drama. You can play it cool. You can just be friends. You can make new jokes and accept yourself. It will be a great feeling for you.  When you sign over all your emotional needs and cares to another person, you lose control. You put them in control, and then if they don't do what you need them to do  you get hurt. This is unfair.  Redeeming yourself has to do with strong behavioral changes and dedication to solving your own problems. The more you can demonstrate this to yourself, to your immediate acquaintences and other people, the better you will feel. Redemption can be apologies, but the strongest way to make things different is to act different.  Good luck. I have been there, it works.  ",
