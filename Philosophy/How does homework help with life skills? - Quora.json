            "answer_text": "Homework, like many things you will have to do daily, seems both boring and purposeless for real life, but since you have to do it, you should have the mentality that you might as well do it well. Don\u2019t look at homework as a waste of time. Look at homework as an opportunity to practice being organised and an opportunity to do work quickly but still well even if it is boring. Because life is filled with so many boring things that we don\u2019t want to do and homework gives you practice with dealing with such tasks from the get-go. ",

Well that maybe so but life is a college as well and if you learn unimportant stuff now, it will prove to be effective at some point in time in the life college . A lesson learnt now is easier to remember in the future rather than learning it in the harsh reality of the college of life ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Being able to read complex or dull documents and follow directions is what working life is all about. And banking life, and cooking life, and learning new things that you are actually interested in life, etc, etc. Plus, the more you learn, the more connections you can make between what you are told, and what you know, and what you know you can find out\u2014then when you are older it will be harder for people to lie to you and take advantage of you, if you are able to think critically and verify what they are saying. Study skills are actually a life skill that is not often effectively taught to people, though. ",

I ask my mom to pick me up later than when my school ends so I can get everything done before I go home because when I go home I take that time to talk with my family then quickly after that I am taken to practice. Homework Is just a big waste of time and energy that could be spent socializing. ",
