            "answer_text": "I believe it is basically impossible to not feel jealous. Or not so much jealous, I think jealous is the wrong word in a situation like that. The emotion people feel from being cheated on is not jealousy because there is technically nothing to be jealous about considering the guy or girl is a cheating scumbag and the other one is a dirty whore for sleeping around anyway. They are both pure scum. (Unless the other guy/girl really didn't know that the person was in a relationship and they actually had feelings for the person. But honestly if people sleep around just to do it they are really gross and low class in my personal opinion. I think the correct emotion would be devastated. Actually there may not even be a word in the dictionary to describe the pain that shit causes people. I've been through it. It permanently damaged me. It happened 6 years ago and I am still with the person. The reason that is, is because it wasnt an affair. He didn't even know the person and it was in the very beginning of our relationship. He wasnt sure if he was ready to settle. He forced himself to do it basically. I'm not making this up. He came and told me in endless tears right after he did and told me to punch him and begged me to forgive him told me to do it back to him. He went and told my parents he did it too. He was confused and he said it was the biggest mistake he ever made and went out of his way to gain my trust back over the years. An affair is a different story. I am so terribly sorry you are going through that. I am here if you need to talk. I would honestly kick his or her ass to the curb. Please dont hesitate to reach out to me I dont think anyone should go through something like this alone. Or at all for that matter. I'm so sorry \ud83d\ude14 dont blame yourself either. It is not your fault your partner decided to be a scumbag loser. Hang in there ok please you will get through it I promise. ",
