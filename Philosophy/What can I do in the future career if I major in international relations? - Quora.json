            "answer_text": "This is a recap of my earlier response to a similar question on Quora: As   I view it, IR is essentially a multi- and inter-disciplinary   discipline, and it offers a vast range of job opportunities to any   graduate: - international diplomacy: foreign service officer; liaison officer; conflict analyst; trouble shooter or peace maker;  - politics: intern or research assistant; policy researcher; - media & publishing: journalist; research assistant; - local government/civil service: administrator; policy researcher; project or program coordinator; - banking & finance: investment analyst; economic & political risk analyst; - UN bodies/agencies: operating officer on the ground in many functional areas as well as hotspots; - Sales & marketing: sales representative; researcher; business risk & intelligence analyst; - Public relations: account executive; consultant; - Education: teaching and/or research associate; - Global Business consultancy: intern or research associate; investment risk analyst; - Computers/Information Technology: help-desk officer; - Media & Publishing: research associate; -   Security & intelligence agencies, like the CIA, MI6: threat matrix   analyst or even as covert operative (gathering intelligence); -  voluntary, charitable and campaigning organisations: (from Amnesty  International to Oxfam to Greenpeace) as project or program coordinator  (volunteer of course); -  even self-employed as writer/researcher  or even translator especially  if you know a lot of languages - who  knows, this may put you on the  lecture circuit, get invited to be a  keynote speaker, or to an expert  panel, or even garner an unexpectedly  unusual job offer;  Bear  in mind that a lot of the job  opportunities out there will also depend  very much on your evolving  skills repertoire, PR and networking skills.
