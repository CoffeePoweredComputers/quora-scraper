            "answer_text": "Sort of. We all have good days and bad days, days where our heads are clearer and we are more efficient at thinking and days where we feel foggy-brained and dull. Sometimes our ability to think is related to health - we\u2019re better at it when we\u2019re feeling well, worse when we have a cold, the flu or are in pain. Sometimes it\u2019s related to mood, as when we\u2019re too excited to settle down and think or too worried to focus on something. So when you take an IQ test, you may do better or worse on the test depending on how you\u2019re feeling that day or depending on whether you\u2019re focused and calm or anxious, etc. And that can change the IQ score you get. On another day, your score may be higher or lower. But IQ doesn\u2019t exactly fluctuate. You may be having a bad day thinking through things, but you haven\u2019t lost intelligence that day. On a day when you seem to be flowing with insight and epiphanies, you\u2019re having a great day, but you didn\u2019t get more intelligent. Having said that, intelligence level can change over time. It\u2019s just not really a short-term fluctuation. The cognitive skills that make up intelligence can be developed. You can improve your logical skills, your problem-solving skills, your pattern-recognition skills, your sequencing skills, your strategy skills. It can take months, even years, but it will result in a higher IQ. IQ can also go down, though this is usually due to brain injuries or diseases. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It can fluctuate due to emotions, how tired you are, nutritional issues, and many other causes. Some supplements can temporarily affect your IQ. Others may have more permanent effects \u2014 but comparatively minor. Heavy drinking can decrease your IQ. Additionally, most people\u2019s mental facilities decline as they get older. Of course, the effective IQ of children increases as they get older, up to around age 26. Education does not actually increase your IQ, just your knowledge base and skills in solving new problems. That is more like sharpening a knife. The blade isn\u2019t any longer, but it does cut better. ",

            "answer_text": "Every year of education adds to IQ, and nutrition and other health inputs can; it is suspected the saturation of media exposure does, too, with all the TV, film, and online images you see. So yes but changes are more pronounced as a teen and the typical IQ test doesn\u2019t test all areas of intelligence we know about so focusing on those tested can matter. ",

As they grow older their thinking processes slow down, so they appear to be a bit \"dumber\" - but the IQ has not changed. ",
