            "answer_text": "what I think is that thought and idea  are two different things. Thoughts are developed form our daily or life experiences . Thoughts are generally philosophy, which means that they don't need any logics to prove. But when it comes to idea, I think that idea are the ways to tackle any situation in a positive or negative way, ideas are needed to be proved, means they need logic to work.Thought is like I can do the work in this way , and idea is like this is a way to do this work, what I mean is that when thoughts becomes applicable to do any work they could become idea.
