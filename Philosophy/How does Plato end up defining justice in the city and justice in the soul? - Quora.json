            "answer_text": "When it comes to the soul, it helps to keep in mind that the word Plato uses is dikaiosyne, which is better translated as righteousness than as justice. Righteousness (\u0394\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7) This is one of Plato\u2019s cardinal virtues, along with sophrosyne (sound-mindedness; temperance), phronesis (practical wisdom) and andreia (courage). The meanings of these virtues can be understood in terms Plato\u2019s tripartite division of the human soul/psyche into the appetitive part, the spirited part and the rational part. sophrosyne is the virtuous operation of the appetitive partandreia is the virtuous operation of the spirited partphronesis is the virtuous operation of the rational partFinally: dikaiosyne (righteousness or justice) is the harmonious, balanced operation of the preceding virtues.So for Plato, righteousness of the soul means a harmony gained by each part doing its assigned role well, without encroaching on the other parts. This harmonization is accomplished by the vision of the Good, which informs and directs all parts of the soul to act rightly. As for cities, we have to rely in the city-soul analogy which is the basis for the Republic. A just or \u2018righteous\u2019 city would one that operates harmoniously. That would involve each person doing their assigned work well; and this happens when each person acts in accord with Conscience (i.e., the faculty by which we see or intuit moral goodness.) ",

            "answer_text": "I tend to think if you look at the values of the ancients, notions of duty and responsibility on the one hand and balance and harmony on the other are deeply woven into what Plato was talking about. I\u2019m curious if that would include wholeness too and to what extent one could look at the Allegory of the Cave and its idealism around purpose (or Telos) for a deeper take on this notion. Plato is credited with defining justice as \u201cgiving each man his due.\u201d ",
