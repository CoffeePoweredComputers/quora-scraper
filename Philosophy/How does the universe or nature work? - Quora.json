            "answer_text": "Universe and nature are two different things. Yes Universe works on mass energy equivalence. But there are still many theories, not discovered, which may answer the working mechanism of the universe. There is this concept of dark energy which makes up the space between every mass present in the universe which we know as vacuum but there is a theory that the vacuum is not uniform. There are mass gaps. The concept of continuum fails. Also, the total entropy of the universe remains constant because the universe may be treated as an isolated system. As far as nature is Concerned, it is something that defines the specific environment for specific organism. It includes the surroundings and the life adapted to the environment. ",
