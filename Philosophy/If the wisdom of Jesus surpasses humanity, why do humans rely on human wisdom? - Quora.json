            "answer_text": "The question is not logically coherent. No theological teaching proposes either that: (A) You have no freedom of choice or (B) That the wisdom of Jesus Christ is imposed upon you. The inquiry does not show a direct relationship between Jesus Christ and yourself. If you pride yourself on what you refer to as \u201cown wisdom\u201d that is your option. Of course, what you refer to as your \u201cown wisdom\u201d has not objectively been shown to affect mankind and human history for 2,000 years either. Moreover, your \u201cown wisdom\u201d is neither identified objectively nor published. ",

So it must be perfectly natural and right to rely on your own wisdom but, equally, another person's wisdom can have something to offer, as it cooked up from different ingredients from yours. ",

Option two how can you know this wisdom is your wisdom, how do you make your choices, intuition ok is that coming from the programing of your life learning and human experiences or coming from the principles christ has hardwired into your soul guiding you in your journey with not separated just un accepting that it is guidance and not your wisdom.
