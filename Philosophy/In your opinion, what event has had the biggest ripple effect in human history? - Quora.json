I\u2019m going with the moment, two moments, actually, in which Geocentrism was disproved and Heliocentrism was proven. Oh sure, I can already hear it; \u201cThis guy! What a complete IDIOT!\u201d while furiously pounding on keyboards to remind me about the first very first Krispy Kreme donut, or the In n Out Double/Double. \u201cHow can you ignore Viagra? Or the Motorola Star Tac phone, made famous by Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire?!\u201d Alas gentlemen and ladies, I remain steadfast in my position, and here comes my reasoning. Ultimately, H.C.-ism was unequivocally proven, forever enshrined within the annals (2n\u2019s fellas!) of science by observations made by G. Galilei. It should be noted that this was only made possible by his use of a telescope, the invention of which he is erroneously credited with in virtually available reference source, but that he totally bogarted from Carl Zeiss\u2019 great-great-great-great Arab grandneighbor. G.G.\u2019s steadfast refusal to not only recant his scientific opus which, by Vatican decree under the the Urban-8 administration, and the publication of his satyrical defense of the HC model, the 17th century equivalent of a South Park episode grabbing laughs a Pope Urban 8\u2019s expense forced him to make the biggest no-brainer decision in the history of Man, between a hideous, prolonged death by torture and essentially being grounded for the rest of his life. Well, his persistence paid off, settling the controversy once and for all, unifying the scientific objectives and efforts which, around 3\u20131/3 centuries later, culminated in the achieving the first step in solving what I humbly insist is Mankind\u2019s greatest long-term priority: figuring out how to GTFO away from this planet and settle the next one before the malignant pursuit of profits renders Earth uninhabitable.
