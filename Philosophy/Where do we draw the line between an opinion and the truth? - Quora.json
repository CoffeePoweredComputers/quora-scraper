            "answer_text": "This easiest way is this when it comes to news cycles and can be ported into validating your own beliefs also\u2026  Bias is the biggest sticking point between truth and opinion - see CNN, MSNBC, CBS etc who have a \u2018base\u2019 to please and satiate and so the \u2018news' as they report it is generally slanted (heavily) toward their particular political allegiances and therefore the \u2018base' to such a degree that the news cycles ONLY have articles against say a president they don't like or a political opponent which are only skewed in the favour of the bases ear. By example, when did you last see CNN etc give Nancy Pelosi a hard time apart from Wolf Blitzer a few days back? What they're saying in a freaky unanimous fashion is that every action the people they support is completely correct and in the best interests of the base versus everything their opposition does is so incredibly wrong. Fair and just reporting is quite dead or seemingly so as the new cycles are saturated with either leaning news toward that particular base. They (The Main stream news) have directly limited the information and facts of the matter and have directly diminished your reasoning and stiffled your logic. The best example for me is I have had two separate conversations in which both people do not know each other but firmly believe that if Trump is reelected then they personally will likely end up in some sort of concentration camp because the President of the USA is apparently now a fascist. Both parties refused to look at the other side instead both accept what they're being told to think which is objectively against the grains of reality, again though as I see it. They though are being fed that information 24/7, its called gaslighting and is a tactic used by emotional abusers ad infinitum to only ever control an agenda or a narrative. Facts do matter, by example if im enjoying a conversation and state my opinion I say so.. \u201cthis is just my own opinion, feel free to disagree\u201d sort of thing as a good conversation can ensue but even then that alone can trigger someone else into a rage like output with the nuclei being your own indivdual thoughts and opinions which is odd. If I state something that I know to be true from my own research as facts and evidence exists ill also say \u201cThis is based on the facts as I see them, please feel free to check and confirm with your own research\u201d and when (as happens) that the person still has a mini meltdown as their opinion of a subject is counter to the known facts and they must be right at all costs\u2026 I then leave the conversation as the facts which are unbiased and essentially truth still don't jive with their \u2018opinion' which must be right eh? The most important thing here is that if a story peaks your interest or its in the national news then don't just simply believe the opinion your being told from an often biased view point, even if its your own regular news show you surely owe it to yourself and in the name of truth to dig a little deeper. Maybe just for now watch your favourite news/opinion show and then find the same news from a different source or opposition to bring balance to your own mind and the discussion as a whole. If we continue down this path of my opinion is better than yours and I'm right your wrong because my opinion is from a different ideology then I would say that we're all essentially fucked as a society and this is why, right now, no matter how painful its going to be, we all need to see and hear the truth as an open wound to heal from and to reset our humanities overall objectivity. If a big alien space ship actually appeared over NYC and did some ET contacting stuff, the opinion conversation is then over about whether aliens exist or not isnt it and the conspiracy theory becomes fact. Better convos ensue as we're all on the same page. If time travel was a thing and someone went back to biblical times, witnessed the flood, took photos and came back, then equally that element of theologial study becomes theologial fact. Better convos ensue again from everyone now being on the same page also. And that's the thing here, the MSMs slanted news is designed to keep you on the hook. A further example is the House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff who came out over the weekend talk shows opinion pieces to tout that recent news about a presidential candidate (JB) was all Russian disinformation and designed to throw the election. This guy would only know this in all eventualities if the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) had approved his committee to receive a thing called a defensive briefing about the subject matter. If that had happened and the briefing was as told on the biased news, that all this malarkey is from Russia then well done and kudos Mr Chairman for doing your job Sir! But no, the DNI and Intelligence community (IC) did no such thing and have said so and yesterday the FBI confirmed that they did not suspect Russian interference and so, the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee absolutely lied to the American people but critically all of these lies were spewed across the entire news platform of the democratic base to simply please the base and just before the election, nothing to see here, move it all on\u2026 the right thing to do in a free and fair press is to get Mr Schiff back on and ask him why he lied but.. they just won't do that as its not what the base want to hear and I guarantee Mr Schiff won't appear on another opposition network to be grilled about his lies. Do you see how that works? This is a massive issue for humanity and is a global threat when those in power subvert the will of the people and have accomplices in the mainstream media. We can see the outright control right now live by the breaking of that particular news story and its effect on social media platforms who have gone rogue and censored basically everyone which is actually election interference.. I digress, facts matter clearly but an opinion is just as warranted and welcomed as free thought is our right as long as both sides continually strive toward nothing but the truth so help me God. Hope this helps a little, I have no particular political allegiances except for whoever is closest to telling the truth.. by all standards and definitions as a third party witness to events unfolding in America balanced with fact based opinion, it isnt the DNC currently. I also appreciate that this goes both ways but that is also the biggest indicator of why facts and truth really do matter, you can have an opinion about the facts much like scientific research but what we get are mainly the facts stretched and skewed to only fit and justify the opinion toward the base. Madness to think how much Social Media and the MsM influence and control our lives using nothing but the beliefs of those who control such platforms. Make a stand by doing your own research and if you can, then challenging the status quo where you live if appropriate but now only armed with the truth. Peace. ",

            "answer_text": "You have confirmation bias without even realizing it. The truth is really just an extension of that native bias you hold. It\u2019s how those on the political aisle align themselves. When the opinion is something that floats in the air, aimlessly, it won\u2019t matter. It isn\u2019t the truth because it sounds stupid\u2014and it\u2019s stupid because nobody believes it to be true. When you believe that opinion, then it is true to you. When many people believe it, then that is seen as the truth. Ask yourself how many times you bait the answer to a question you are searching for on Google and you\u2019ll understand how crazy that is. You\u2019ll always look for things to add to your own framework of what you believe are correct opinions. This works in pretty much anything. The stock market, for instance, is just a widely accepted cacophony of people believing certain things are extremely valuable (the truth). When that opinion begins to change with the larger holders of stock, the stock begins to die off or deflate significantly. If you want to challenge when something becomes truth even further, listen to those you would consider most radical to yourself. Actually listen to what they are saying, look up the things they are talking about\u2014try to understand that narrative and how it forms and where it is developed from. There is no greater truth than the one formed out of independent thought. ",
