The answer is probably no. Something has to happen along the way to make these people turn bad. Of course, people can also be good; however, it is hard to answer whether or not people can turn good once again. I think that mostly something significant to them has to happen to make them turn good. Most times it\u2019s too late, though\u2026 and most times\u2026 there is no way for them to turn good once again, because they don\u2019t want to. People are not born evil. ",

Five hundred years ago, everybody knew the Earth was flat, and fifteen minutes ago, you knew that humans were alone on this planet. Just imagine what you'll know tomorrow. ",

            "answer_text": "That depends on your definition of good and evil. We\u2019re certainly selfish. The cost to save a stranger\u2019s life through the most efficient charities is estimated at around $1000 or so, but the vast majority of people don\u2019t donate to much of their income to such charities (I certainly don\u2019t). Each time we choose to keep $1000 rather than donate it, we necessarily imply that we value $1000 over the life of a stranger, so you could say we\u2019re evil based on that. However, if you look at the prevalence of disease, war, violence and genocide over history, you\u2019ll find that the general trend is downwards. The world is getting better (on average) as time goes on, so you could look at that and say humans are good. ",
