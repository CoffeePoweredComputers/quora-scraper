            "answer_text": "All true learning involves a balancing act between being open to the provided explanation and as well being a tad remote from it. This state of mind is something very few people achieve. People tend to operate in a binary state of acceptance or rejection, while the best one can do is ascribe some subjective probabilities. But there is another reason why this state of mind is difficult to achieve - and this is because of the way we are necessarily educated. This is because because most of our education - upto at least graduate school level - involves believing in what we are taught. Such implicit beliefs help us learn the prevailing theories and explanations - plus do well enough in our education to open up future opportunities. And up to a level - not absolute mind you - there are good reasons for having a reasonable degree of confidence. Because prevailing theories have been refined, adopted and modified by a group of people known as experts - and they are likely to know far more than outside dabblers and dilletantes. So for this reason most educated people - including those who believe themselves sceptics - are actually anything but sceptics: They strongly and uncritically believe in the handed down theories. These are theories from within the existing paradigm.They are strongly skeptical of competing theories from outside the establishment paradigms.But this can be carried to an unreasonable extreme - and often is. What is interesting is that sometimes real experts in a field are often not as convinced of the absolute truth of theory that outside amateurs are. Outsiders can be far more certain in their beliefs of establishment paradigms - and dismissive of other approaches. This is driven by the strong mainstream rhetoric and explanation, with an unaware purveyor not able to distinguish between where logic is strong, and where it is less so. A very good example of such an individual is a man called Michael Shermer, who published a magazine called Sceptic, and who regards himself as intellectual sceptic. His magazine though was the most boring one possible, because his skepticism was almost totally reserved for 2 above - competing theories. He usually picked easy targets - obvious conspiracy theories or cranks flouting half baked ideas. In other words, there was close to zero information content in any of his rather pretentious essays. Sherman in fact offered up passionate defense for all areas of 1, even where he was not an expert - or had much in depth exposure. Now, most people only get to the point of worthwhile critique of 1 when they have spent a lot of time within the paradigm of 1, but find that there are maybe better explanations in 2. Which have either come from themselves, or from others unsatisfied with 1. At that point, the establishment figures are extremely sceptical of 2. They may be perfectly right - with justifiable reasons. But that's not always the case, as Thomas Kuhn so memorably pointed out in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. The new theories are usually only fully accepted when the older generation essentially fades away. Then the previous 2 becomes the new 1, and the cycle repeats. The history of science itself is replete with stories and dynamics that confirm the above. Now, there are two other important points to make. First it is not easy to come up with valid and better 2. This is because those working in 1, the establishment, aren't all stupid. Maybe some are dull, but a small number are highly talented. Further, they have numbers, resources and funding to go with their beliefs. So the chances of worthwhile 2 as valid competing explanation to 1 are small. Many 2 can therefore be easily dismissed. However, those in 1 also have blind spots from engaging in group think, and there many cases of establishment thought leaders wrongly dismissing competing approaches and alternatives. The final and most important point is that most people confuse facts with explanations. When they are taught something they are usually taught the explanation foremost. For this reason they tend to think of other explanations as inherently wrong. That's the sort of skepticism Michael Shermer engages in. A true skeptic, like a true detective, is faced with two separate verifications: A. Facts B. Explanations for those facts The first is hard enough to do its own. But the latter is much harder. Because to come up with better explanations than the establishment theory one must understand the establishment theory as well as a true believer, while at the same time stand far enough away to be sceptical - especially where it is weak and inadequate. That's the way of the true sceptic - driven by a true love of learning rather than an your face show of it like Shermer. And paradoxically, such a true skeptic is likely to be labelled a crank by an unquestioning believer. Shermer, for example, is a reflexive believer rather than sceptic. His scepticism is nothing but an affectation - perhaps not even of self aware sort. Just as we must beware cranks, beware so called sceptics who reflexively dismiss all non conventional approaches. This is not a game of we must believe one or the other. It is perfectly reasonable to believe neither. By all means, do dismiss those obviously paraded by cranks, or with obvious shortcomings. But don't reflexively deny alternate theories too quickly either. Stay somewhat sceptical of all provided explanations. As Richard Feynman once said, \u201cI'd rather live with not knowing than have answers that might be wrong.\u201c Feynman's remarks apply to both establishment and alternate explanations. As befitting a true truth lover. ",

            "answer_text": "As a skeptical learner I\u2019m proud to say that I don\u2019t necessarily take any source of information as factual. This means I\u2019m more likely to access information in greater breadth and depth. As a skeptical learner I\u2019m sad to say that for the same reasons I often find contradictions in what I\u2019m learning about, due the the abundance of opposition amongst sources of information. After all, the universe is nothing if not superimposed symmetries. Every particle has an antiparticle, and every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Everything is ironic that way. In summary, as a skeptical learner, I\u2019m not convinced I\u2019ve ever learned anything.  ",
