            "answer_text": "Metaphysics is real. It is a sub-field of philosophy concerned with attempting to determine which of the most general characterizations of reality are the most logically defensible. Metaphysics is not only real; it is recognized as a legitimate field of study at the university level. The Metaphysics Research Lab Here\u2019s the kicker: everyone makes metaphysical assumptions. For example, most people believe that there are two kinds of real things: material things (i.e. things that are made of stuff that physicists can model, such as bricks and human bodies) and spiritual things (i.e. things that are made of stuff that physicists don\u2019t model, such as souls and spirits). Even dyed-in-the-wool secularists make metaphysical assumptions. The idea that science is our best model of all reality is not itself a scientific finding; it\u2019s a philosophical assumption. What is more, this assumption is not theoretically necessary for doing science. That\u2019s why, in spite of the fact that most scientists are atheists, religion doesn\u2019t make the few religious scientists less competent than their secular colleagues. Francis Collins Unfortunately, everyone from poets to book store managers seems to think that metaphysics is an umbrella term for all things spooky, like magick and alien abductions. Actually, metaphysics is more like this: Metaphysics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) ",

            "answer_text": "Metaphysics is a broad area of philosophy marked out by two types of inquiry. The first aims to be the most general investigation possible into the nature of reality: are there principles applying to everything that is real, to all that is? \u2013 if we abstract from the particular nature of existing things that which distinguishes them from each other, what can we know about them merely in virtue of the fact that they exist? The second type of inquiry seeks to uncover what is ultimately real, frequently offering answers in sharp contrast to our everyday experience of the world. Understood in terms of these two questions, metaphysics is very closely related to ontology, which is usually taken to involve both \u2018what is existence (being)?\u2019 and \u2018what (fundamentally distinct) types of thing exist?\u2019 (see Ontology). Metaphysics Metaphysics is a real field of study. It is mostly studied in the discipline of Philosophy. In fact it is one the central disciplines of Philosophy. Metaphysical consequences impact our intellectual, ethical and spiritual lives. For example, what we believe about the nature of human minds, or the bases of morality or the question of the existence of God. Therefore, metaphysics is a real field. ",
