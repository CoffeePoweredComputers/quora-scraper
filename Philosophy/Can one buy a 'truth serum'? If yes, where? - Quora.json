            "answer_text": "I don't think there is one, but some people still believe in Spanish fly, so I'm sure someone takes advantage by selling truth serum as well. There are ways to get to the truth yourself with some people. There are others though who are impervious and you're just not getting the truth out of them, no matter how their story falls apart upon questioning. I can give you some tips. When someone's story has unnecessary information, the person is often trying to make his behavior the logical outgrowth of what happened in the story to avoid more questions. When someone is explaining himself by answering questions that you didn't ask, he's usually trying to tie up the story's loose ends into a big bow to camouflage the fact that he's lying. This aspect of over-detailing the logic of an answer is especially effective when someone's giving you an excuse. 2. If I say something to you about yourself and you get really angry usually because I am right. If I was wrong, you'd just say that neutrally. But if you get all emotional about it it means you have a stake in proving the other person wrong instead of just disagreeing or letting the comment pass. I once got a text in an argument from a younger guy who was trying to hurt my feelings. He wrote, \u201cYou're just a sad middle-aged woman wishes I liked her as much as she likes me.\u201d I got the text, and immediately just said, \u201cNo I'm not. Wishing is not in my belief system.\u201d (If I can't work for something and earn it or wait for it patiently then I don't want it, I'll find something else.) The point is the \u201csad,\u201d the \u201cmiddle aged\u201d and liking him more didn't even come up. I didn't address them because they weren't true. Finally, my favorite one: playing along. Acting like you not only believe, but are interested in what someone is pulling on you, to the point of playing dumb, will bring out a human tendency in the lying person that is what you're waiting for. It seems that when people are trying to trick you, they almost always have to have that moment of self-satisfaction in which they say something that is a clue that they assume will go over your head because you're clueless in buying into what they're saying. If you pay attention to everything they say when they're lying, the self-satisfied statement won't fit in with the other information. It will be a comment, and unnecessary one, often vague and intended to not reveal anything to you. If you want an example, write that in the comments, I could go on like this forever. : ) J ",
