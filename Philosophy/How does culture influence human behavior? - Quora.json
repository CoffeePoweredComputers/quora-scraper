            "answer_text": " I once took a girl to Chuck E Cheese for a date. I was suggested this option by a successful, rich entrepreneur named Tucker Max on a podcast. The idea was that this date would be a breathe of fresh air from the standard, boring dinner dates and movie dates people go on. It would be like you\u2019re kids again and the girl would appreciate it because you\u2019re having fun and poking fun at the idea that you\u2019re adults but you can still have fun as a child. It made a lot of sense. I saw famous celebrities like Holly Hohn (the MMA fighter) going on an excursion with her buddies to a Dave and Buster\u2019s. Same type of deal. It looked pretty bad ass for these super successful people to just have fun like normal people in there. But the result wasn\u2019t as clean as expected. She was an immigrant and she didn\u2019t have a green card yet. Her upbringing and culture was not American. I forgot to take this into account as I should have. And this mattered because she grew up in a completely different culture and poorer subtext. Although the date went decently, she kept mentioning how \u201cthis was for kids.\u201d She didn\u2019t understand it. She was, if anything, embarrassed and confused as to why we were there with a bunch of other kids. Humans happen to have different cultures and different ways of living due to many factors including the financial and geographic location they were brought up in. Because of that, they interpret and see the world differently. I haven\u2019t given up on the idea of a fun Chuck E Cheese date but I realized it\u2019s more socially intelligent to taken into account cultural context first. Tucker Max is a rich, white, upper class individual and he runs in circles with equally successful people with similar demographics. Because of the American upbringing of the girls he meets, their success, and the cultural context, it works really well. It also selects for girls who can take life seriously and don\u2019t have to have serious, posh dates all the time. ",

            "answer_text": "Culture as an influence of behaviour takes the \u201cnurture\" side of the argument about influences of behaviour. culture looks at the totality of any given society's belief system, laws, mores, practices, language and attitudinal variables which makes a people unique from others. As you know, it is transmitted from one generation to the other. What happened when you are groomed in the ways of a particular culture? You start acting and behaving in ways that are seen as appropriate to such a culture. Your dress sense, grooming, language, belief system and attitude become molded to fit into that society which makes you become accepted by them. Hence, culture plays a big role in determining how an individual behaves in any given environment. Take for example, in some places, baring the breasts is seen as normal, while in some places it is forbidden. Some places allow males and females to mingle freely in public places: others do not. This has a tremendous impact on behaviour, and is evident when these persons go to a place that has a different culture comparsd to theirs. They encounter what is known as \u201cculture shock\", and it is most evident from their reactions and behaviours to certain unique stimuli which they come in contact with in a new place. So yes, culture plays a big role in influencing behavior. ",

            "answer_text": "My impression of how my culture and ethnicity effects my behaviour might not be the same as someone else looking at me. What's My Culture, What's My Ethnicity? Like many Canadians, I almost need a personal cultural-ethnic blend. Maybe someone will come up with Artificial Intelligence that can analyze your cultural DNA, and give you your own, personalized profile. I can just imagine, identify the key ethnocultural axes and then place you someplace on it. It would even be more sociologically and social psychologically interesting if you treated the cultural-ethno matrix as a means for cross cultural comparisons. What if you could identify various behavioural spectra and then assign an individual on them. For example, dear to me from my childhood, as a Judeo-Winnipeger, do you talk with your hands? Our understanding was that Manitobans of British origin considered hand talk to be offensive and inferior behaviour. (We considered them to be the \u201cBoss\u201d in Manitoban society, so we weren't going to spend much time worrying about what Winnipeg's numerous other ethnics thought.) Also, since there weren't too many other hand talkers in the Manitoba of the 1950's, you could out yourself as Jewish with just one gesture. But, some of us stood our ground and exercised our democratic right as Canadians to express ourselves in this non-verbal sort of way. If one spectrum was from, don't even lift a finger, to, not a word without hand motion, we could be assigned a place somewhere there. A complication though, these spectra would have to take account of gender differences. Do females have the same hand communication continuum as men? Also, to be fair, one would have to consider age. There are multiple times when I would like to fling my arms all over the place. However, we are nowhere near as young as we used to be. At times I feel a bit creaky. I worry that it is effecting my communicative skills. Now, here's another good one, the sports-beer versus no sports-beer continuum. The beer commercial Canadian guys are at one end. However, there is a political correctness issue about the other end. You can be a male who likes ballet and interior decorating (way better for me than an NHL game) but, as as I know from my gay bar visits, you can be just as extreme a gay man as you like, and still drink a whole lot of beer. So, this spectrum is not a stand-in for, butch-macho versus dress in drag. However, I feel that for folks like me it is definitely important. My ethnoculture treated drunks as absolute pariahs. Being teetotal was an acceptable stance in Jewish Winnipeg. I still strongly agree. I volunteer to be placed on this spectrum, at the very farthest end. I maintain that, because of the way Canadian commercials so much define street level Canadian identities, that the sports-beer delight versus utter aversion, is a meaningful one. But then, again, what would the ladies think? What would the younger generation? Are We Trying to Define the Canadian Identity? What use would we make of all this ethnicizing? Can we venture into the world of inter-Canadian personal communication? We have heard quite a bit in recent times about \u201cold stock\u201d, real Canadians. Using the multiple continua approach, one could devise socio-ethnocultural stances in Canadian society. Once this matrix had been developed, it might be possible to create a profile of the most common Canadian, from an ethnocultural point of view. Who knows what we could come up with? The matrix could have quite a lot of value in tracking changing attitudes and behaviours in Canadian society. For example, has mainstream Canadian tolerance for hand-talk changed over time? To hold extraneous variables fairly constant, you would need to define the most mainstream Canadian in Howdy-Doody Time, black and white Winnipeg, versus a mainstream Winnipeger from the present. I believe this would produce a powerful statement about shifts in Canadian society. Take this concept to the therapeutic, counselling and social service community. One can define it in percentage terms, one's personal deviation from the current, English-speaking Canadian mainstream. Say I am 75% off that norm. Wouldn't that explain a lot of my communicative and integration issues? Or, what about me trying to interact with someone who is also 75% off that Canadian norm, but in the other direction? (I tend to imagine that, that Canadian norm would likely be a somewhat conservative, hockey-beer one, but maybe a little bit of bitterness about getting bullied a lot is tainting my objective judgement. Would there actually be as much room on the other side of that norm, maybe a superfan with serious alcohol dependency issues?) I think in a situation like that there would be excellent grounds for missed communications, incomprehension and hostility. It might even seem like I am \u201cjudging\u201d my 150% opponent. But, isn't having any ethnicity and any culture means that you judge others? I catch myself judging other Jewish people. I semi-consciously have my imaginings about what a normative Judeo-Canadian is. I concede to myself that I am a fair percentage off my norm, and judge myself accordingly. A Propos of My Behaviour, Try Explaining Me to Someone Else or Maybe Just Give Up We live in a very politically correct Canada. I live in Ottawa, the very homeland of the political correctness Canadian world. I do not want to offend. I am too old to want to get in trouble. But, then you get the dissonance. You make other Canadians, who don't get where you are coming from, uncomfortable. The workplace is the most anxiety-producing place to have this issue. One does not want to have a conversation with Human Resources. But, that dissonance can happen in other environments, in academia (just as bad as the workplace or worse), in general social interaction, with the authorities, in bars and clubs (This can lead to communication in the form of a fist in the mouth!), or when you are trying to date someone and are inadvertently creeping them out. So, what can us fairly large percentage off that Canadian norm folks, do? Just, again, stand our ground and let the results fall where they may? Or, should we try to explain ourselves? How can we do this without sounding judgmental, when that is just what is happening? If I wanted to, I could re-examine my ethnocultural stances that I learned so long ago in the original Twilight Zone Winnipeg. But, I don't want to. Making those judgements is a very large part of who I am and have been since the time of Dwight D. Eisenhower. I am a thinker, at least a little bit, so I don't take it all for granted. But, I agree with much of what was taught to me in the time of the Lone Ranger. Admittedly, some of what I was taught was driven by fear and yes, some bigotry and a lot of anger in my community. I try to extract that part. But, without pointing a contemptuous and condemnatory finger at anybody, I really don't like beer-hockey, even to this day. I don't like physically aggressive, butch guys. (Well, some of that has to do with my gender position but I don't even like buff guys in the LGBT community.) If someone else notices that you are pissed off with what's going on around you, and asks why, how do you avoid making the situation worse? Do you start into a lengthy lecture about the treasured values of my Jewish Winnipeg of long ago, compared to the inferior nonsense I perceive all around me? Do I invent a set of stock, not very true answers, like, \u201cI didn't sleep well\u201d, I don't fully understand why so and so is doing what they are doing but, doubtless, it's just me not being too intelligent.\u201d, and so on. I feel a certain incentive to basically lie, to avoid what could quickly escalate into a confrontation. You never know when somebody is really, really sensitive. Or, they might perceive that you are angry about something and not saying the real reason why. Another alternative is, don't let on, don't tell them who you are and don't say anything about anything. I have to admit that, I not infrequently do this. For an ethnocultural, particularly one who is not desperate to socialize outside their own group or maybe much at all, this can get to be a habit. I Am Open to Suggestions I have framed my Answer in the Canadian context. However, I think some of the basics could apply wherever an individual has some freedom about what they say and how they present themselves. It would be interesting, in particular, for someone who I perceive to be closer to the norm, to comment. How would you like someone with ethnocultural issues to present themselves to you? Do you want to talk about it? What if that ethnocultural person is making judgements, explicit or implicit, that you don't like? Martin Levine ",

            "answer_text": "Why some countries have developed and others aren't, why some countries are unstable and others aren't, why people don't care about their country in some countries, but people do, why? Culture is the collective attribute of a group, how it reacts, what it eats, what it perceives as good or bad, what it thinks is normal or not normal. In shaping society and country, culture plays a vital role. A good culture makes progress easy and natural, a collective progressive behavior is a boon for a country. It seems that progress is automatically taking place. What shapes culture You can easily identify a culture by examining the behaviors and actions of local people in a country, observe how they react to a negative stimulus and how they react to a dishonest / unfair opportunity, put them in a situation and see how they react. It's not that this behavior is their individual responsibility, the culture plays an important role, for most people the behavior is only built automatically through experiences and events they have experienced, and they don't give serious thought to how different experiences and events shape their behaviour. Political leadership In a country, with time, the political landscape changes, and people with diverse beliefs and motivations have the power to motivate and change the thinking of a majority of the country's people, this leadership belief and motivation affects the culture for the good or the bad. People learn new habits, some strange behaviors become new normal, and bizarre changes are defined. Throughout time, these leadership changes shape the culture, good leadership induces and motivates everyone around them to achieve good habits and deliver their best honestly, affecting the behavior of nearly everyone in the country. It is also true vice versa, a bad leadership that has selfish motivation badly affects culture and encourages everyone to act selfishly and selfishness creates a bad culture, in such culture self-interest defines normal behavior and not social values.

            "answer_text": "Culture is basically a way of life. No, really, it is defined as the way of life of a group of people. It includes their beliefs, their values, their customs, their traditions, their heritage, their language, their artistic expressions\u2026etc. Most of these are practices, and all of them affect behaviour. Basically, you view the world and react to it based on your culture. This reaction can be in the form of behaviour, or could influence behaviour. For example, certain values that your culture has makes interpret the behaviour of others based on it. In some cultures, they view opening a present in front of the presenter as a sign that you are happy to receive a gift from them, while in other cultures they view it as a sign of your greed. Those values can also reflect on behaviour, it informs you whether you should open the present or keep it until later. As for ethnicity. This depends on what you mean by ethnicity. Some people confuse ethnicity with race, if this is what you mean then it should, in theory, not affect your behaviour unless your culture has certain norms regarding race (pre-Apartheid South Africa for example). If on the other hand, by ethnicity you mean a social group that shares a common and distinctive culture, religion, language, or the like (definition from dictionary.com), then it can have a profound effect on behaviour. In this definition, culture is part of ethnicity, and thus would have an effect on behaviour accordingly. ",

            "answer_text": "Our cultural upbringing carries throughout our lives. We continue to have a hunger for the foods we ate as a child. Many maintain the same beliefs as their parents had. It may include religion, dating, marriage ceremonies, and how we rear our children. If we grew up with families interested in music, reading, or art we will probably continue those interests. Those interests determine our outlook when it comes to disagreements with others and how to resolve the issue. Some have grown up with an instant physical reaction to a disagreement while others have grown up learning to negotiate solutions. Our attitudes about life, clothing, other races initially come about from the cultures in which we were reared. Of course, there is always at least one rebel in a family who chooses to take a different path. Sometimes they return to the fold of family while others may continue the new lifestyle forever. I based my answers on observing the behaviors of friends and family members for 76 years! ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a really well-known theory about how the culture of Korean hierarchy resulted in many Korean Airlines accidents during the 1990s. In Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s Outliers, he recounts the tragedy of how during flight KAL 801 crashed into a hill due to adverse weather conditions, killing 228 of the 254 passengers on board. It was revealed later from cockpit recordings that this issue had been noticed by the first officer and not the captain. The first officer then tries to get the captain\u2019s attention by politely referring to the \u201cweather radar\u201d instead of just mentioning, \u201cthere\u2019s trouble ahead\u201d. I have the opportunity of interacting with many different cultures. I guess this can be referred to as the \u201cinternational kid\u201d culture. I go to an international school, and I have friends from Korea, US, Thailand, Vietnam, UK, Australia, just to name a few places. All of them behave slightly differently in accordance with their culture, and I\u2019m no exception. I\u2019m raised in a Chinese Cantonese-speaking household in Hong Kong. Although Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997, the influences are still obviously present in our day to day lives. I end up having to code-switch quite often when I\u2019m interacting with my rather conservative extended family versus my international friends. I find that when I\u2019m in that Cantonese mindset, I\u2019m more expressive and loud, and the language becomes so much more colourful. However, people are not as direct to point out problems or criticise: its always implied with non-verbal cues or subtext. When I do speak in English, I\u2019m (relatively) more reserved yet more direct. I\u2019m not afraid to point out where things can be better and I\u2019m not afraid to voice my opinion when I feel it matters. In this cultural mindset I\u2019m allowed more freedom to dream and be ambitious about my goals in life. I become indifferent to the competitiveness that is our education system and I can strive to better myself rather than compare myself to others. From my experience, culture affects behaviour drastically. In the Chinese culture, I\u2019m more inclined to be competitive and loud, but ultra-respectful to elder family members and base all my life decisions around my family. I\u2019m required to push and study hard and dedicate my life to family, university applications, and current academic progress, in that order. On the other hand, with more Western-culture influences, I\u2019m encouraged to pursue a more individualistic mindset and set goals for myself, with the ultimate goal of fulfillment and happiness.

So basing our behaviors on this norm, we too would be insane. The cause has been identified by the philosopher, by not following the truth. These denials took many years to widely develop in society. Some denials began at first man, millions of years ago. Placing education above all else, creates egotistical thinking. An inflated ego creates a godman complex, there isn't anything greater than a well educated person. Not taking into account instinct. Man denies instinct, denies that there are greater things in the universe and most of all denies global warming and extinction. This much denying, creates narcissistic insanity and no one but a few see society destroying life by his own hand. Follow the insane behaviors and go insane with the norm, or rebel. Victims rebel by taking drugs. But some take them to cope with traumatized emotions, caused by an insane father through incest and rape. You can see the inssnity through the incest victim, who is being victimized? The girl, or the father? Dad is accepted at his word, the child no one believes. Which one appears insane? I will follow the victims every single time, they follow their truths and try to cope. Society is not coping, there is too much denial. But this is your choice, all i can do is to help inform and speak the truth. ",
