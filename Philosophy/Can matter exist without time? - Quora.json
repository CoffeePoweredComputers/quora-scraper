            "answer_text": "If there were zero matter, time probably would have no meaning, so we could say in the total absence of matter, there would be no time. If there were only one proton, say, again, nothing could change, so again time would have no meaning. But when you have two particles, you can always define a velocity of one in the frame of reference of the other (even though it is zero). If you have a velocity, you must have time. So whenever you have more than one fundamental particle, you must have time. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, matter can exist without time. Matter consists of groupings of particles. Energy consists of postulated particles in space. Space is a viewpoint of dimension. The viewpoint considers there is something there; that\u2019s why there is. Time is the consideration that space and particles will persist. But the viewpoint? Ah! There is the fun! Can the viewpoint exist without time? And what is meant by viewpoint? Ask and it is updated. ",

By using the word \u201cexist\u201d you are imposing a human concept of time onto the question. So that means that your question itself is inconsistent and thus meaningless. Cheers. ",
