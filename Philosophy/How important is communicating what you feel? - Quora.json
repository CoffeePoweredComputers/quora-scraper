            "answer_text": "I'm trying to understand the author of this question, who framed this question in a particular way: I would venture to say that you feel some pressure to share/communicate what you feel. Whether that pressure is coming from someone else, society, or self-inflicted, I don't know. That's for you to know I guess, but I'd pretty much want to turn the question around on you: Out of all the possible scenarios, why would you think it would be bad? Did someone tell you this? Or do you feel \u201cbottled up\u201d? You say lots of things run in your mind. That's actually pretty descriptive. Is it too many things? Or are you handling it all well? If the latter is true then keep doing what your doing. Don't worry about sharing. However, there are other options - Talking to someone isn't the only answer you know! Keeping a journal (that you never have to share with someone) is a good way to get things \u201cout of your head\u201d and on to a page, freeing up some brain power, so to speak. You could even journal about why you think not sharing could be considered a bad thing. ",

            "answer_text": "I will answer the first pquestion because I don't quite understand the explanation For the second part. it is essential for good mental (and therefore often physical) health that you voice your feelings and communicate your experiencem especially if you are feeling the need to do this. When people go through psychotherapy, visit psychologists and psychiatrists, the main focus is to help the individual understand and express their feelings, as this often also brings about any unresolved issues and helps oneself realise their own emotions as well as other people\u2019s feelings. this is is often coined the talking cure, and as is implied, involves just \u2018talking it out\u2019. if there's no one to really talk to or no way to get in contact with a psychologists (often, in Australia anyway, you can go to a GP and tell them your issues and that you wish you to speak about your issues with someone and they will get you in contact with a psychologist at no cost :) ) Otherwise, expressing your feelings in writing through a journal or something similar has been shown to work well.

            "answer_text": "I think you have to pick your spots when communicating how you feel. You need to behave differently in different environments. For instance, if you have a coworker who prefers to-the-point conversations, keep your feelings to yourself and only talk about facts. ",
