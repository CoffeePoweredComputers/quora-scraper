            "answer_text": "I think a lot of the people on here are operating from a very prosaic and moralist perspective on the concept of \u201ctruth\". To wit, the idea that \u201cthe truth will set you free\u201d I think refers to an abstracting of more transcendent, virtuous or epistemological \u201ctruths\u201d/reality. To answer the question, then, I would say NO, the \u201ctruth\u201d is not always necessary. If, for example, I heard someone bad mouthing a friend, should Iimmediately go and tell that person. But what is equally important is my motivation for why I am taking it upon myself to share a truth (see fact) with someone. Let's do some \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d? What if someone's mother committed suicide when they were very young and the person never knew about this (and also knew virtually nothing about their mother, being they were so young when their mother died) and I found out this information from, say, that person's grandmother and then I decided to go and tell this person. Is this right? To tarnish the only thing this person has of their mother, her unblemished memory? Perhaps that would be better, to understand the complexities of human life and the pain if existence, yada yada yada, but is, THAT, my place? Say I know grandma, but really do not know the grandchild, should I then run and tell the grandchild, after all that person has been \u201clied to\u201d\u2026 So, I then should share the \u201ctruth\u201d with them? To me that sharing sounds like it hada not more to do with my ego than with the necessity to \u201ctell the truth\u201d. What if a woman was raped or a man had committed violent crime or was a repeated thief in his youth, should I deign to tell their child they decided not to share this information with? Furthermore, could one day it is wrong not to broach such sensitive topics. How about the man who used to be a thief, but the information is now sealed or expunged, should I deign to warn the man's current employer, if he is a friend of mine and then change that man's life forever and cost him his job? Should I force others to reveal painful and difficult, complex realities of fact, simply because \u201cit's the truth\"? I know many people who have made one mistake and then have a permanent crime on their records and are s therefore NEVER able to become gainfully employed. I know women who\u2019ve experienced sexual assault and simply never want it brought up, what are the appropriate response s in these cases? In sharing information, especially powerfully factual information involving regret and true human ugliness, for no reason other than \u201cwell, it's the truth\u201d is severely misguided. I have seen, many times in my life that\u2026 often\u2026\u201dthe truth\u201d is a needless \u201creality in effect or in fact\u201d which has more to do with ones ego based perceptions of reality. There is often no ultimate need to always \u201ctell the truth\u201d all the time. Search your motivations, test yourself, question your \u201cwhy\" and know your reason, in everything that you do. On this topic\u2026.sometimes it is better to simply let sleeping dogs lie. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends entirely on your personal definition of kindness. For example, there are countless jokes about how one should respond when one\u2019s wife asks if her dress makes her behind look big. What would be kinder? To lie and let her go out in an unflattering dress? Or to tell the truth, risk her ire, and have her choose something more flattering to her figure? To my mind my relationship with my wife is important enough that the truth is not optional, and I\u2019ll risk her irritation rather than having her feel uncomfortable for a whole event in a dress that she suspects doesn\u2019t look good. I certainly don\u2019t want to ever be in a position where I have to say that I lied to her and humiliated her in front of whole mass of people simply because I was afraid that she wasn\u2019t rational and reasonable enough to handle a negative comment on her dress choice. Perhaps there are some who would disagree, but to me this epitamises the honesty vs socially acceptable lie debate. Lying to people is fundamentally insulting to their integrity and maturity and is deeply unkind. As is \u201csugar-coating\u201d the truth to the extent that the response becomes easy to ignore or misinterpret. Honesty is kindness. Your teacher was being kind when they handed you that assignment with a big red F on it. They were unkind when they nudged it up to a C to save your feelings, because they promoted the idea that you were doing \u201cok\u201d and didn\u2019t need help. In so many ways honest is always the best policy. And if someone can\u2019t handle the truth and gets angry with you? Well, that isn\u2019t your failing or a failure of the truth - it is often because they\u2019ve been lied to so consistently that the truth is an alien concept. This of course comes with the caveat that the \u201ctruth\u201d is often a slippery concept, and instead what one is often giving is one\u2019s opinion. When delivering an opinion one should be careful to state that it is just one\u2019s opinion, and while it may be based on careful reasoning and evidence there could be other equally well grounded opinions.
