            "answer_text": "Blah blah blah, it cant be increased etc etc\u2026 You should not listen to people who told you this. Neuroplasticity is a great thing which can be observed during MRI scanning. What 100% can increase your processing speed and working memory, if you have deficiency in some of these areas\u2026 Drugs - methylphenidate, amphetamine, seligiline, atomoxetin, noopept, nicotine, rasalgine, modafinil, ephedrine and l-theanine with caffeine. Activity - aerobic, weight trainings. Aerobic provides you with new neurons, weight helps to increase a rate of aliveness of new neurons. Self-observation - meditation to provide calmness and focus. Environment - surrounding with high achievers, participating in learning communities. What the best drug combination? Methylphenidate + nicotine (ritalin decreases sensivity to dopamine, nicotine increases = balance), caffeine and l-theanine in the morning will give you a dopamine rush, which will be prolonged by ritalin and nicotine. If you are going to abuse medications, then you kill your brain, because over-stimulation of D1 receptor decreases working memory and cognitive control. These meds are nothing without exersicing (increases D2, decreases D1), learning a lot of information (you gonna use enhancement to be successful) and time-management (many people take adderall to masturbate all the day).

            "answer_text": "I.Q. (intelligence quotient) used to be measured solely by the Weschler Bellevue or Stanford-Binet scales. Not any longer. There are nine identifiable descriptions of categories for intelligence (at last count) such as social intelligence, mechanical intelligence, musical intelligence, etc.  We hear a  lot about \"intel\" when watching shows or news items about spies or terrorists or enemies in war, of course. That doe  not mean the opponents are intelligent in the old sense ((although they might be). It means we know something more about them than we did be fore we got the \"intel\"--intelligence. Memory is  an example of things that help develop or sustain I.Q. in  those various definitions or areas.  Memory assists in speeding up procedures that involve intelligence and that shows others you can operate at a higher levels of knowledge and efficiency.  Guests on TV shows that reward people for remembering facts and details about anything (even obscure facts that no one knows or cares about) are considered to be intelligent or \"smart.\" It's not a particularly revealing aspect of I.Q. in my view. Problem-solving is  a better way to judge I.Q. On the other hand, memory helps in problem-solving!  To answer the question,m I would use memory improvement to contribute to general efficiency and problem- solving and in that way, yes, increasing memory will increase your I.Q. ",

I'm clueless as why people search for this number. In younger people it measures precociousness and in adults it is probably most accurate at predicting your ability to do a jigsaw puzzle ",
