            "answer_text": "My limitations toward transcendence are my doubts that I could do it. To achieve enlightenment I practice manifestation. Manifestation involves the following steps: 1. *Get clear on what you want. *Be specific on what you want. Don't say \u201cI want a car\u201d. Rather, say \u201cI want a used SUV with less than 30,000 miles on it, priced less than $15,000\u201d 2. *Ask the universe. *Ask the universe. Amplify your signal to the universe by asking for what you want. Ways of asking include prayer, meditation, visualization, and vision boards. Write a letter to the universe. 3. *Work towards your goals. *You are co-creating with the universe. Write down three actions you can do to bring you closer to your goal. 4. Trust the process. The law of attraction says the more you want something, the more likely you are to manifest it. Whenever you catch yourself doubting, say to yourself \u201cI am getting closer to my goals everyday. The universe has had my back and it's awesome.\u201d 5. Receive and acknowledge what you get. You universe is always giving you signs. Write down the evidence of signs everyday in your manifestation journal at the end of the day. Make sure to include anything you do to further your goal. 6. *Keep your vibrations high. *Vibrations are like little radio signals you are constantly sending to the universe. You must tune your vibrations to a frequency adequate for achieving your goal. Spend 10\u201315 minutes at least a day doing something you want to do, such as watching a YouTube video or meditating. Stay positive. 7. *Clear your resistance. *If you haven't manfested your intention yet, you are likely resisting. Doubts, pain, procrastination, frustration, regrets, and resentments are all forms ofresistance. Breathe and relax. If you a hard time lettinggo of problem, find someone to help you through it. ",
