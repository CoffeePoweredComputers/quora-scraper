            "answer_text": "Consciousness is: 1. A state of human mind which keeps it awake, alert to the outside world. 2. It relates to the inner voice, voice of a person's soul. 3. Consciousness is that state of thinking which makes one person different from another in his psychological behaivour, thoughts, style of accomplishing a particular task. Since, in this mortal world everyone's gifted with diverse thought process and work pattern, its obvious that the consciousness varies from person to person. 1. It basically depends on the genetic design of an individual and environmental factors. 2. Environment, here is a broader term referring to the person surrounding the individual and also the literal environment. 3. Even the daily routine of an individual affects his consciousness, his sleeping pattern, eating pattern and various other factors. As all these things cannot be the same for two particular individuals, so the consciousness of an individual is unique. ",

            "answer_text": "Consciousness isn't unique to a single human being not same either. It is similar. As per my understanding of genes, they can only structure the body to the latest trends(as in the latest evolution of your father/ancestors) . This structure includes the quantity and quality of hormones released, brain size,etc. Due to which it may seem like a memory inheritance, but it isn't. Now assassin's creed is a game and it's only a game(the science ain't completely true in that). So what makes you, if all humans have the same genes(Instead of removing the genes let's assume all have the same genes) ? You are just another human baby,when you are a baby. As your body matures(growing as per the gene instructions, which is same for everyone), you will start receiving inputs from your senses. And the moment you start recording (memorizing), you become unique. Your memories make you unique. As your memories give you your logic and beliefs and many more things which are unique to you. As others can't feel from your senses. If you further interested please do tell me, I made a 10 page paper on nearly* the same topic. ",
