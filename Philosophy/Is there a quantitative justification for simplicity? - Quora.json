            "answer_text": "Is there a quantification justification for simplicity? This seems like a valid question. I will have to play with before I am sure of it: Is there a way to measure the justification of simplicity? Can you measure the usefulness of simplicity? Can you put the justification of simplicity into a certifiable math equation? I suppose the question is getting at the impossibility of proving the simple explanation as more useful than the complex one. Maybe it is getting at this; since you can\u2019t certify the simple explanation just as you can\u2019t the complex, how can you justify going against the complex mind that is able to bring in more relevant factors? The argument is, if simple can\u2019t be certified as useful just as complex can\u2019t you may as well allow the complex mind to shine. This is the best I can do as far as re-arranging the question to make sense and be answerable by my mind. I will use a natural law of Smith to try to prove how this question confuses things. If I am not reading the question right or slanting it in some manner, the one that understands I am can explain and I will listen. Natural law of Smith economics: The easier the flow of money the finer the breakdown of services within a society thus the more enjoyment the members are able to get. There is much agreement in Smith scholarship that Smith understood the power of greed. The disagreement is how did Smith feel about it. Some say he agreed that greed was good and some say nonsense \u2014 he saw greed as an evil of man. Recently I was reminded of a passage where it is clear that Smith was extra aware of it and was terribly irked by it. In my mind It was a passage that made clear Smith\u2019s overt awareness of greed as a integral trait of man but nonetheless very irritating even disgusting. The way I operate is if someone can\u2019t agree with what I feel is obvious then I go around the disagreement. I go to the point I believe Smith takes the reader to give his answer to greed as an evil. It is Smith\u2019s answers that many minds can\u2019t accept so the source of the disagreement and not lack of certainty of Smith\u2019s expressed feelings. Greed as Smith presented it is too easy to misunderstand; it was a pain in the ass to Adam Smith just as it is a pain in the ass of 100 percent of humanity to 100 percent of humanity. If we accept greed as a painful fact of life we can understand how justification of simplicity is measurable. Here goes the exercise: As the ease of flow of money increases so to does the finer breakdown of services provided. This sentence expresses a simple relationship of two factors \u2014 ease of flow of money and increase in fine breakdown of services. You can\u2019t actually use numbers because you can\u2019t quantify these factors but it is easy to understand how they are related or how the increase in flow causes an increase not just of services but types of services as well. The way Smith\u2019s math operates is he separated the complex of factors from the math above and put them into the mind of the actor. What I mean is the individual in his greed will know every factor related to the relationship of flow of money and number of services provided. This is true if all actors are free to act on their greed. The easier it is for the greedy individual to get his hands on some money by providing a service so is the certainty that he will do it \u2014 certainty is related to ease [only] in the case of money and service. If he can\u2019t provide the service he sees is the rage he will try to create a different service that is the rage. Because all consumers are different in every way imaginable, every service imaginable will be provided and it will be provided in the necessary amount. And what is magnitudes more important for our time is this; the services will automatically change upon signals from the environment that tend the human mind to realize change is necessary \u2014 the consumers \u2014 forcing the providers to make the adjustments; the providers of product and services will be at the mercy of the wisdom and social responsibility of the consumer rather than the wisdom and responsibility of the consumer at the mercy of the greed of the providers. The consuming human is the smarter mind and by a long shot in all things of consumption. The providers are strictly guided by their greed and [nothing] else. This was the very thing that irked Adam Smith thus the reason for the reader to get [it] \u2014 his extraordinary irritation. ",

            "answer_text": "Given the tags you provided for the question, I assume you\u2019re talking about a quantitative justification for a simpler model/equation. If such is the case, yes there is - a bit. The more variables you add, the more complex the model becomes, the longer it\u2019ll take to run necessary computations. If a simpler model does as well as the more complex one - just use the simpler one. This is the general philosophy. Especially if you\u2019re running some kind of machine learning or neural network program, having less variables will reduce the number of things the program is trying to optimize, so that should give you good results faster. The qualitative benefits are easier to understand though - having unnecessary/redundant variables makes it a lot harder to interpret your model. Additionally, getting information to feed into the model is often a pain, so having to do that for less variables is a plus. I hope I answered the right question! :) ",
