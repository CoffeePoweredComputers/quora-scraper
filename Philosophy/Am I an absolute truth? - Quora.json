The \u201cAm I (pronoun)\u201d (I? What are you?) means what: Exclusive to all else is of obscure self assertion of being something. AN, \u201cabsolute\u201d is not defined in application as to what that means is or not of universal consensus of agreement based on some authority of acceptance: I suggest one other \u201cI\u201d aside me have conveyed of mindful authority\u2026 \u201cAbsolute\u201d (In physics\u2026 we are but physical entities) = \u201cThat which is always, anywhere and everywhere, the same.\u201d So, if my \u201cI \u201c would depose another \u201cI\u201d to ask if that \u201cI\u201d has been a unchanging constant now or ever been an \u201cabsolute\u201d state as the definition would require of an answer serves to address ANY True or false premise is then framed against it. \u201cTruth\u201d (the object of the question) as a syntax of sentence structure - the point of the question - is always a relative definition to some comparative to which truth is dependent upon to resist contradiction or the ill-premise from which a truth is weaved in and of their self enable either a true or false in context of content and collective cohesiveness frame a conclusion compelled from that as true, even if false when subjected to acting upon to manifest a proof of thesis of valid veracity. Ergo, the \u201cPerfect Theory\u201d being that which cannot be proven true or false but of a seemingly accepted constant of expectation that aligns to one relative \u201cI\u201d with all \u201cI\u201d experience even if the \u201cwe of us\u201d cannot in any absolute way prove a truth or otherwise, other than what we would suppose to think and feel within the range of our sense-abilities or technology that surpasses the innate of our limits. The wit of posting philosophical questions proves nothing of wit if lacking in a degree of forethought of the what others may make of it is dangerous logic of assumptions. We are all often guilty of wanting to post, per se, \u201cDeep\u201d questions but have the root of \u201cShallow\u201d substance of sophomoric character. The maturation of our \u201cI\u2019 of presence in the play of things is a self-portrait that only an audience serves to affirm a true character of performance. t.SC 4/8/19 ",

            "answer_text": "No. we were partly an image of the one who created us. We need to learn more , adjust and readjust to be filled with absolute truth. Such process indicates in Jesus Christ words saying; \u201c 17  Sanctify them by means of the truth; your word is truth. \u201c- John 17:17 Jesus was calling the attention of his hearers/ readers that \u201c truth\u201d is in the word or saying of God. He always quoted writings from the Hebrew/ Aramaic Scriptures: Example: \u201c16 He then went to Naz\u02b9a\u00b7reth, where he had been brought up, and according to his custom on the Sabbath day, he entered the synagogue and stood up to read. 17 So the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him, and he opened the scroll and found the place where it was written: 18 \u201cJehovah\u2019s spirit is upon me, because he anointed me to declare good news to the poor. He sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and a recovery of sight to the blind, to send the crushed ones away free, 19 to preach Jehovah\u2019s acceptable year.\u201d 20 With that he rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were intently fixed on him. 21 Then he began to say to them: \u201cToday this scripture that you just heard is fulfilled.. The passage Jesus read and confirmed to be fullfilled that very day through him can be read at Bible Gateway passage: Isaiah 61:1-3 - American Standard Version. When Jesus said that the Scripture they just heard as he read it , is fulfilled, he meant that he himself is the \u201c anointed one\u201d of Jehovah ,the Israel\u2019s most awaited person, whom Jehovah himself \u201cpromised\u201dor \u201c words expressed\u201d to the prophets. Hence. the \u2018word of God\u201d is truth or will be realized in its proper time, or in Jesus timeline the words spoken from long ago, now a reality through him. That is why Christ confidently said \u201c YOUR [Jehovah God]WORD is TRUTH\u201d , not an empty words or lies. Man and woman, were partly an image of truth that was spoken by God when he created the first man and woman.Thus, no one can say with all honesty that God is a lie. It is rather the person himself that lies to himself intentionally or unintentionally. Our very breathe came from him, while our make up is just as dust of the ground. The Scriptures stated; Genesis 2:7 \u201c7 And Jehovah God went on to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living person. Genesis 1:27 \u201c27 And God went on to create the man in his image, in God\u2019s image he created him; male and female he created them. \u201c Did you noticed how mankind created? Both male and female possessed the image or qualities like that of God, whom Jesus compare to as a \u201c Our Father, in the heaven\u201d.(Matthew 6:9) Does it not a touching words though we were limited and prone to error?

Whether the argument for an argument itself is sound is a different matter. In other terms, \u2018do questions exist?\u2019 is ironically undecidable in its own terms. Similarly, if you are what you say you are then no-one else can refute that but only because everything else is arbitrarily irrelevant. Circles do not connect to any other curves. There are no consequences for them. So, you are an absolute truth unto yourself, but that does not apply in any other sense.  ",
