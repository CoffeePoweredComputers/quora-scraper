            "answer_text": "I. Dennett\u2019s objection to the hard problem Dennett thinks the \u201chard problem of consciousness\u201d is akin to a hypothetical \u201chard problem of symphonies\u201d \u2013 a philosophical problem I\u2019m inventing here for the sake of analogy. The easy problems of symphonies would be questions like: how does an instrument make a sound, how do individual notes convey a chord, and why can melody coexist with harmony? The hard problem though, is why do symphonies exist? Just what are symphonies, exactly? When you posit a hard problem, you imply an explanation, or at least a mystery: Isn\u2019t a symphony, taken as a whole\u2014with tempo, with its mood, its performance, its sense of narrative\u2014isn\u2019t that something special? Isn\u2019t it more than the sum of the answers to the easy questions? Isn\u2019t \u201csymphonyness\u201d a fundamental, irreducible element of the universe? In Dennett\u2019s view, no. Not breaking the question down into its component parts is basically mysticism. It\u2019s a philosophical mistake. [Here\u2019s brief Dennett article using life and cuteness as fundamental properties the universe as analogies: http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/chalmers.htm] I have tried to show that however compelling the intuition may be that we must not break up the conscious Subject into lots of parts that are not, themselves, conscious, this intuition must be abandoned. The tempting idea that there is a Hard Problem is simply a mistake. I cannot prove this. \u2014 https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/explainingmagic.pdf (emphasis mine)  II. Dennett\u2019s model Dennett\u2019s explains the popularity of the hard problem as the excessive influence of Descartes\u2019s ideas. Per Descartes, people envision a tiny \u201cobserver-me\u201d inside their mind, watching the show put on by their sensory organs. In Consciousness Explained, he calls this imaginary stage-and-audience the Cartesian theater. Dennett says that instead of this single \u201cexecutive\u201d in the brain, watching the show, consciousness is well enough explained by multiple simultaneous functions: The basic idea is that consciousness is more like fame than television; it is not a special \u201cmedium of representation\u201d in the brain into which content-bearing events must be transduced in order to become conscious. \u2014 https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/cognition.fin.htm(emphasis mine) \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 According to Dennett, consciousness is to be found in the actions and flows of information from place to place, rather than some singular view containing our experience. \u2014 Multiple drafts model  III. The consequence and scope of Dennett\u2019s model Dennett still believes that subjective experience is confusing, limited, sometimes contradictory, and frequently hard to describe. Accepting those statements doesn\u2019t necessitate belief in a hard problem of consciousness. The hard problem presumes that the sum of the parts isn\u2019t enough to account for consciousness. Dennett says the sum of the parts seems good enough. At the very least, he sees a mysterious essence of consciousness as something neuroscience shouldn\u2019t bother to look for. To be fair, Dennett oscillates between a) sneering at questions about consciousness as unremarkable and trivially explained by known cognitive functions [especially when the questions come from Chalmers] and b) acknowledging that the illusion of consciousness as \u201cspecial stuff\u201d is compelling. He [hard problem advocate David Chalmers] can appeal to your intuitions, but this is not a sound basis on which to found a science of consciousness. We have seen in the past and I have given a few simple examples here that we have a powerful tendency to inflate our inventory of known effects of consciousness, so we must be alert to the possibility that we are being victimized by an error of arithmetic, in effect, when we take ourselves to have added up all the Easy Problems and discovered a residue unaccounted for. \u2014 https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/papers/explainingmagic.pdf  IV. Outside Dennett Think of Dennett\u2019s argument as showing us why the assumptions of the hard problem aren\u2019t proven. That\u2019s different than disproving the assumptions of the hard problem. The next question then is this: Are there any consequences or interesting implications in Dennett\u2019s acknowledgment that we can\u2019t prove the hard problem is a mistake? Interesting is subjective, but for me, I think so. I\u2019ll offer two of many examples: A. Consider the way that many physicalists of the Dennett persuasion (though not Dennett himself, at least not always) are eager to downgrade the mystery of human consciousness by, for example, labeling autonomous cars as sentient or conscious. What if a hacker installs a virus that causes the car to tell you it\u2019s terrified of parking in your driveway? In what sense is the car terrified? Have you wronged your sentient car by parking it in your driveway? Or is it a \u201cphilosophical zombie\u201d? What happens when you\u2014as Dennett acknowledges you might\u2014begin to struggle to tell the difference? Can science or philosophy do anything to address this? B. Imagine in the future that technological groups want to make robot intelligence mimic human consciousness more closely. If Dennett\u2019s theory of consciousness is right, is that even ethical? Wouldn\u2019t we be, in effect, programming a sentient being into potentially painful cognitive shackles? How would we program human-like distractibility? Our ability to hold conflicting beliefs at one time? How would we even emulate the experience of peripheral vision? If these hypotheticals read like a criticism of Dennett, you aren\u2019t getting it. These hypotheticals accept Dennett, and then ask what the implications are. The point is that you don\u2019t have to believe consciousness is magic to find aspects of it mysterious, hard to draw a line around, and worth pondering. I believe that Dennett would agree.  A caveat: In defense of hard-problem doubters, I should acknowledge that believers overstep at least as frequently. Believers in the hard problem, in the specialness of consciousness, claim their side proven too. Dennett acknowledges that neither view can be proven in philosophical sense. It would be nice if the conversation could start from there more often. ",
