By Western definitions (or more specifically, American), different races (white (Americans and Europeans), black (Africans or of African descent), yellow (Asians)) are just the difference in levels of melanin in people\u2019s skin as an evolutionary survival trait due to sunlight density in different geographical locations of the planet, which are carried on to the next generations even when they live in areas where such physical traits were no longer necessary.  To draw the difference in skin colors as races would mean the difference between Homo Sapiens and Homo Erectus or the Neanderthals. Let\u2019s be frank, we\u2019re all Sapiens here.  In Vietnam we have many different \u201cpeople\u201d, such as the Kinh (also the majority of Vietnamese), the Dao, Thai, the Khmer (who were of Cambodian descent), etc. but they were considered as \u201cclans\u201d or \u201ctribes\u201d, never races. We treat them with dignity and respect, not some inferior species to look down upon or shun away.  ",

It would be wonderful if skin color were universally viewed as a matter of aesthetics, nothing more. Tragically, we assign some great undeserved importance to this thing we call race. We then weaponize it. We are not well. Since so many of us are race conscious, I guess most of us feel obliged to go along with the insanity. At least Dr. King dreamed of a day when we would become moral enough not to judge people on the basis of skin color. In the current reality, it would be stupid to utterly deny the existence of race. But, at least one can participate in the insanity grudgingly rather than enthusiastically. ",

A Jack Russel or a Dalmatian are races of dogs, which are artificially maintained by directing their breeding. As we humans breed as we wish, that can't be called races for us. The scientists talk rather of ethnies, which are physical and cultural traits shared by communities. That is deemed a better concept to apprehend the diversity of humanity. In France where I live, ironically the concept of race is used mainly by true racists and by \u201cantiracists\" who use the US \u201crace studies\u201d views. ",

That may be why right wing Republicans believe in conspiracies. They take something that isn't real, and make it an issue: Race isn't real but racism is. ",
