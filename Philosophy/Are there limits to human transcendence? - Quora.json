            "answer_text": "I like your question; let\u2019s talk about what transcendence means. A human being is an animal, alive and at risk for harm and death. We must pay attention or we can\u2019t survive, even in the relative safety and comfort of modern civilization. We are exhausted by our vigilance and we like to take breaks from it; some people manage to live their whole lives on break from vigilance, modern life can make that possible. One of the main dangers of modern life is boredom; we need to keep entertained lest we go out of our minds with boredom and that prompts us to do dangerous things. One of the best forms of entertainment is transcendence; it\u2019s a blend of the euphoric rush of chemicals in the brain and the grandiose thoughts that euphoria triggers. Are there limits? Probably there are neurological safeguards against becoming so euphoric that you can\u2019t function at all. This reminds me of a line in a song from Joe\u2019s Garage (Frank Zappa, 1979): Some people say that if you go too far, you might not get back to where the rest of them are. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but part of our expansion back into perfection is the expansion of our acceptable amount of light. This is why most enlightened beings left their bodies in the past, because their inner light was so far beyond the collective that their reality could no longer cohabitate. While now we are living in times of monumental shift, which is why we are seeing more blatant disregard for those who desire unity as displayed by governmental unrest and public outrage. This is happening on a planetary level too as we see environmental damage is coming to the fore, by way of earthquakes and fire. This too is all for the sake of transcending 3 dimensional reality or the reality of separation and duality. Do not give your undue attention to the mayhem and misfortune. Maintain a loving heart, and help where and if you can, to best overcome the fear and turmoil as this too, like our own personal disruptions, is due to our ignorance and must be experienced, as this is the law of Karma. Knowing this is transcendence. Be well. L&L ",
