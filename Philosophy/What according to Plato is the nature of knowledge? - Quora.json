            "answer_text": "According to Plato, true knowledge does not concern the world of phenomena, but ideas. Since ideas are the types of earthly things, human logos should try to avoid the tricks of the sophists, whose various philosophical proposals imply Protagoras' phenomenology and anthropocentrism (HOMO MENSURA RERUM). The senses can deceive you, and in fact it is typical of the sophists to say that there is not a single truth but many, each related to a specifc point of view of a specifc sensory disposition. For Plato, however, there exist an authentic truth that goes beyond appearances and opinions (DOXAI). Since, however, this truth deals with the ideas which are transcendent, in order to gain its knowledge you must have already seen the ideas or forms. Indeed, in this material world people cannot meet the forms of beings (except perhaps in the case of art). So knowledge is reminiscence of a metaphysical vision. Human beings already have the truth in their soul, because before the incarnation of the soul in the body, the soul contemplated the ideas of everything. Here Plato takes up a doctrine which dates back to Pythagoras: metempsychosis. ",
