            "answer_text": "Of course! So long as that freedom is in the political and/or economic interests of the United States. Which, in many cases, it is. \u201cFreedom\u201d usually implies freedom to do business with US corporations, the \u201cfreedom\u201d to provide support to US military and political operations in the region, and \u201cfreedom\u201d to accept US culture which foster favorable views of America. Those are the kinds of freedoms that the US heartily promotes. That said, there have been many instances where freedom hasn\u2019t really been in the US\u2019s interest. And lo and behold, in those cases we support some rather brutal dictators \u2014 from the Shah of Iran to Noriega to the Saudi royal family. The United States government has one job, which is to protect the interests of the United States and its people. Expecting anything else is naive. That should be obvious. Yet it\u2019s strange that so many Americans think of the USA as some sort of global superhero, doing good and battling evil around the world. LOL, no. They are only the heroes in their own own story. But it seems for many Americans it\u2019s the only story they ever hear. ",

I am American and have lived outside of the USA for the better part of 6 years. I have found BY FAR more freedom and life enjoyment in other countries than I EVER did in the USA, with its high exorbitant costs of everything and super restrictive laws. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I LOVE my country. But I don\u2019t want to live there anymore. As far as \u201cproviding freedom\u201d via the war machine, I believe that it is all a big hoax to take over regions, keep regions unstable in order to profit from oil for the biggest evil corporations on Earth. They provide nothing but headaches in places like Iraq. But I don\u2019t live there and don\u2019t now what it is like for the Iraqi people after having been given their \u201cfreedom\u201d from the US govt and military. I do believe that this freedom cost the Iraqi people their health, many beautiful museums, houses, dignity and sense of peace. All because the USA \u201chad to\u201d take out an evil dictator that was put into place in the first place by \u2026 guess who?! The US GOVT! There is no respect for life, people, property when it comes to the US GOVT. Have they caused more freedom for anyone, anywhere, because they exist? Hell no. ",

Freedom, from the US point of view, can be defined as a country that uses the same economic system of the United States and is beholding to the United States. If a country uses a different kind of economic system then it needs to be \u201cfreed\u201d and if it can\u2019t be persuaded to change its economic system then it will be \u201cforced\u201d to be free. Sometimes a country is freed by the CIA and sometimes by a military invasion.Yes, the US does play a big role in freedom. ",

We were truly the land of the free. That is no longer the case. Now it is just a talking point so that we can apply political pressure on other countries. Look at the two major political parties. The Democrats are worse than Republicans, however both of them want to pass all kinds of laws to restrict all kinds of things for us. The Democrats have been pushing to prohibit smoking, and food that they feel like is not really good for us. The Republicans are just as bad in some of the things that they want to prohibit. To be the land of the free, people need to quit prohibiting things. ",

If you disagree then I dare you to offer a harsh criticism of a non-Christian religion in the EU, use biological rather than psychological gender pronouns in Canada or be openly pro-Gay in much of the Islamic world. In those countries these actions can at least in theory result in official sanction. Not in the U.S.. With out freedom of speech there can not be an open flow of thoughts and ideas. People are not allowed to have full control of their own minds. I would argue control of one's own mind is the most fundamental freedom of them all. ",
