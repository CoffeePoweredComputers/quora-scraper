            "answer_text": "Ah, the moral science lesson. \"Lying, if is not harmless and is done with 'good' intention, is 'not bad'\".  Two things: 'good' intention and 'not bad'.  Example: You are at a social dinner. A typical sit-down dinner at someone's home. The host tells you that his wife has prepared the dinner and the dish you are eating is her specialty. Now, you don't like it. But social convention teaches you to not say that and instead praise her. You intention was 'good' and lie was 'not bad'.  Now my view. I have been struggling with this whole social convention. I am not good at giving false praises. But I received enlightenment after I started reading Psychology. I am starting to give praises and try to be as honest as possible, not being blunt. It helps people with their moral. But then the question arises \"If I give a false praise, isn't it wrong?\" The answer is no. If it is said with 'good intention'. :D So, yes, lying makes you bad person if you are a habitual liar. But adding 'my intentions were good' it doesn't makes you a bad person. Crazy ways our society works. ",

            "answer_text": "Depends on who you're lying to, and what the lie is. If you're lying to your kids to protect their innocence, like how was I born, or what happened to our dog, or where is grandma? That is just good parenting. You'll tell them when the time is right.If you're lying to protect yourself from consequences or to dodge responsibility, then it is bad. If you had the courage to do a wrong thing, you should have the courage to own up to it. Be it with your parents, your partner, or your boss, doesn't matter. You have to own up to your deeds. People with no conscience get away with anything they do. Since you asked this question, you're not one of them, and you'll end up hurting everyone you know if you don't act fast. It does a lot more harm than you'd think. It destroys relationships and trust, and it would never be the same again. ",

We as a species would never have newer risen from the savanna of africa to build the Civilisation of today. As social creatures we need to lie everytime to form and stabilize such huge groups as countries or a communities of more than 100 people. ",
