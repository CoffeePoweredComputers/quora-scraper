            "answer_text": "So three answers say \u2018we\u2019 are not illusions\u2026 though the content of the answers amount to mere \u2018declarations\u2019 that \u2018we\u2019 are not. They beg to be accepted as answers by begging the question \u2018who are we\u2019 :) The only one to answer the question is the Reader of these apparent words. So let\u2019s start with what is plain, which requires no theory or belief: Here now there is Seeing-coloured patterns that appear as words (and everything else) in the visual field. So the first question is: are these images an \u2018illusion\u2019? Hold \u2018your apparent thumb\u2019 close to \u2018the apparent eye\u2019 and observe that it occludes many apparent objects that are known to be orders of magnitude larger than it. Indeed it may occlude virtually everything else, including whole mountain ranges in the apparent distance. Plainly, no \u2018real\u2019 thing that is in \u2018reality\u2019 smaller than another \u2018real\u2019 thing can also actually be larger than the bigger thing! It can only \u2018appear so\u2019. On this account, it is plain that everything in the visual field is an \u2018appearance\u2019\u2026 an illusion! But what about \u2018my body\u2019? Look \u2018straight ahead\u2019, notice no \u2018body\u2019 is apparent at all. Now \u2018look down\u2019. Notice only the front of the torso and limbs are apparent as a foreshortened image distorted by the \u2018laws of perspective\u2019\u2026 but no head. Where the head should be the whole world appears (or at least that bit perceived from the perspective of the person you seem to be). As the only body that is seen appears in the visual field, the apparent body must be an illusion along with everything else. Of course, \u2018the world\u2019 and \u2018body\u2019 are not only experienced visually. They are also experienced as \u2018feelings\u2019 (so apparent things also \u2018feel\u2019 \u2018solid\u2019 and \u2018heavy\u2019 or \u2018hot\u2019), while odours and flavours and sounds round out the \u2018sensory experience\u2019. Can you imagine a \u2018feeling\u2019 that is not \u2018Felt\u2019? Plainly, Feeling-feelings is inseparable. Plainly too Feeling-feelings is an attribute of \u2018Consciousness\u2019. Who would claim that inanimate \u2018things\u2019 could experience \u2018feelings\u2019\u2026 or any other sensations! By simply observing this Observing now, it is plain that what is true of Feeling-feelings is true of Seeing-colours and Hearing-sounds and Tasting-flavours and Smelling-odours. Notice however, that as the sensory images change there is no change at all in the capacity to sense them. Notice too that no sensory image is itself meaningful. Only as ideas of a \u2018thing\u2019 are associated with an image does the sensory image appear to be that thing. Plainly, no idea can exist that is not Known. Knowing-ideas too is plainly an aspect of Consciousness. Plainly, no idea could ever change, for if it did, it would be a different idea and not the idea it is. Notice too that each idea is defined by reference to other ideas that are themselves defined by still more ideas that together form a closed set of all possibilities. As this set is ever unchanged, to that extent the \u2018things\u2019 defined in it are real. Notice however there is no awareness of any specific idea until it is imaged by sensations in some way. So: \u2018traffic light\u2019\u2026 only as these words appear AND the ideas are associated with it is there any awareness of Knowing\u2026 or not-Knowing this \u2018thing\u2019. (Notice that the same image may be quite meaningless if seen from the perspective of an \u2018illiterate person\u2019\u2026 where no ideas of the \u2018thing\u2019 are associated with the image. This is as true for the image of the \u2018thing itself\u2019 as for the words, say when seen from the perspective of a \u2018primitive person\u2019) While the content of experience appears to be illusory (including every apparent \u2018me\u2019), this capacity to experience is not. This capacity to experience is called Consciousness. It is undefinable\u2026 for it is no \u2018thing\u2019. Though spaceless and timeless, yet it manifests every \u2018thing\u2019 throughout all apparent space and time\u2026 as \u2018sensory images\u2019 within itself given meaning through the ideas-Known that are One with it. So are \u2018we\u2019 illusions? Only an illusion would ask such a question :) ",

            "answer_text": "What a wonderful question, I couldn\u2019t pass it up without adding my thoughts. There are so many perspectives on this, I\u2019ll try to cover them all The existential, philosophical view says nothing exists unless I choose to acknowledge it existence. The argument to this is, Because you say it doesn\u2019t exist does not make it so. Science looks at this thought and adds to it. From a science perspective, the only way that we are aware of the world around us is through our brains. First our brain tells us there is something to see A signal is then sent from the brain to our eye to tell us to see. Then another signal comes back from the eye, travels through our brain and tells us what we see. The point they make is that 1) everything happened in the brain and 2) there is no light in the brain. So, if everything is happening within the brain, then what we think we see must be created by the brain, and not necessarily exist in reality. Another surprising explanation comes from scientists who are at the top of their field. These people are in the same league as Einstein. There have been numerous experiments and on the strange behavior of particles, black holes, and the operation of the brain, and every one of them has come to the conclusion that the universe is holographic in nature. In other words, the universe is 2D and we experience in in 3D. And finally, people who have returned from death repeatedly tell us that this universe is an illusion. Some are completely blown away by this. They say thing at the spirit level were so much more real than this existence. This, they tell us, is created so that the Source can know Itself. Based on these sources of information it seems that we are indeed in an illusion. But, from my perspective, an exciting one. ",
