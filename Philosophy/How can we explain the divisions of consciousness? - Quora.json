            "answer_text": "Each cell exhibits signs of a separate consciousness so the division is between cells. Cells are individuals, but individuals can form groups and groups can exchange information and so share consciousness. Drugs effect consciousness because drugs effect cells, cells can communicate to form multicellular societies where the state of each cell depends in varying degrees on the state of every other cell. Multicellular societies can also converse and so effect each others collective state of consciousness. Since one is embedded in an environment that is as essential to ones state of consciousness as are ones cells each individual consciousness is dependent on the rest of the universe to exist at all.The simplest explanation is all energy creates consciousness while all mass creates unconsciousness, the interplay between mass and energy is the interplay between unconsciousness and consciousness, gravity is as if the force of unconsciousness and death, we fight gravity, electromagnetism is as if the force of consciousness and life, we live off of light.Energy means \u201cchange\u201d so consciousnesses exists wherever there is change, Mass means \u201cstasis\u201d, so unconsciousness exists wherever there is stasis.Gravity and death attempt to pull all the mass of the universe to a single point driving out all energy, Electromagnetism and life attempt to spread all the energy of the universe to every point driving all mass apartThe divisions in your brain are just as crucial to your function as the connections, so the mass of your brain is just as important to its function as the energy of your brain, unconsciousness is just as important to who you are as consciousness.to say that everything is conscious is like saying a drawing is all white because that\u2019s the color of the page, an energy based description, but without black dividing lines no specific drawing can exist.Some scientists counter by saying everything is unconscious because all drawings sum to a black page, a mass based description, but without white no specific drawing can exist.These are reactionary monaural positions that save their bearers from having to discriminate in a stereo world.

            "answer_text": "A very great question that has baffled psychologists since decades. Is consciousness divided or not? We cannot say that ultimately consciousness is varied or divided. There could exist the real quantum basis of consciousness that tells you what is consciousness scientifically. That would be the ultimate scientific nature of consciousness. I will deal in details in my coming book on this topic. Then there is a different type of consciousness the psychological element of consciousness. That one is certainly not due ultimately to physics but to biology. In other words biological psychology is the one where brain activity interferes with the expression of physical consciousness. That interference therefore can be symbiotic that is mutually positive but at times destructive and results in abnormal behavior that we call mental disorders, split personality and others. ",
