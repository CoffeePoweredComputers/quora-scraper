            "answer_text": "The property lines of your property will be shown on a survey that was done on your property. The survey will show items such a exactly where your house is located on the property, how far away from the street it sits, fences that have been permanently installed, any out buildings, etc. The surveyor\u2019s description of the property will include a fixed point (such as a piece of pipe) that\u2019s been placed to act as a reference point on your property. From that reference point, you\u2019ll measure the distances shown on the survey. The survey will also show any easements to the property. Easements occur when an owner allows others to access his property, such as when an owner allows a utility company to install power lines, either overhead or underground. Although it\u2019s still your property, they get a unique \u201cpass\u201d to get on the property to maintain the lines, etc. You have special rules to follow if you\u2019re going to place a fence on the property, so you can\u2019t block their access\u2014but it\u2019s still your property (at least here in Louisiana. A survey was most likely done when you purchased the property, so check in your closing documents. If you can\u2019t locate it there, you can also check in the county records department. A survey was mostly likely done when the property was built or when a previous owner bought the house or when a modification (such as adding a carport or driveway) was done. ",

In a real situation you would probably best be advised to obtain a) the professional opinion of a lawyer or surveyor who specialises in the subject.or B) a Land Registry determination Briefly the following may give some of the sources and clues Boundary markers On the ground, walls, fences, and other boundary markers may give evidence of the likely position of the legal boundary. Documentary evidence Historic evidence may be given land grants, Wills, conveyance deeds, tithe maps, enclosure statute schemes, compulsory purchase documents, etc. Some of this material may go back hundreds of years. Legal presumptions A judge will use established legal presumptions to determine the position in the event of a legal dispute. These are \u201crules\u201d established in case law. Official determination A Land Registry team offer (or may have already made) a plan for the purpose. See Practice guide 40: HM Land Registry plans, supplement 4, boundary agreements and determined boundaries Edit Party Walls (30/12/19 If your property is a building attached to another or is a flat etc, in England you need to consider the property line within or at the \u201cparty wall\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Hire a surveyor: That\u2019s exactly what they do, and they are well paid for it as well. \u2014-When a property is surveyed, the corners are marked with steel pins, usually well buried, and the information filed with a local \u201cregistry\u201d office. When the property is \u201cresurveyed\u201d, the surveyor first tries to locate these pins (or the pins of an adjacent property) but they frequently don\u2019t survive, so the location must be re-established\u2014which the surveyor does, in relationship to other properties and geographical features. Once these subterrainian pins are located, it is easy to re-establish the property lines using either stakes and strings, or paint on the ground. When you purchased your property, you probably were given a paper copy of the survey, which will show you where the property corners were, in relationship to other features\u2014such as neighbouring houses, or buildings already on the property. These points should be taken with \u201ca grain of salt\u201d, as buildings have often been modifed, so needless conflicts ofte occur between neighbours. It is worth noting that NOTHING agreed between neighbours is legally binding, as it is the \u201cofficial\u201d survey, filed in the registry office, is the only thing that counts\u2014-and you need a surveyor (and probably two lawyers as well) to have that \u201cofficially\u201d changed.

            "answer_text": "For purposes of this answer, I\u2019m going to assume you already own the property and there has been a dispute with a property owner next to you over the property lines. When you bought your property, you likely had an attorney prepare documents for you and handle the closing (or a title insurance agency who handles settlements). My first thought would be to contact the attorney or the settlement company and ask if the title to the property contained a recent plat which shows the property lines. Most lenders (if you borrowed funds to finance your purchase) also require a recent survey if there is none in the chain of title. If the lender required one, there should be iron or wood posts at the corners of the property to indicate the property lines. If there was no recent survey (plat) made, or no recent ones in the chain of title, your next move would be to contact a surveyor to have one prepared. The surveyor will first look in his own records to see if he has ever surveyed your property before or any adjacent property. Following that, he will visit the courthouse and look through the chain of title to ascertain the property description as well as looking for any plats ever made. When he comes to your property, he will then mark the corners of the property and afterward prepare a paper copy of the plat for you. You can also visit the courthouse where deeds and plats are recorded to look for any recent plat/survey. The employees at the courthouse will help you get started on your search. However, keep in mind that the property owners adjacent to your property may have had surveys prepared without reference to any on your property. If you do not review all of the records of yours and your neighbors, you may not get a full picture of the real situation. Although you can visit your county/city\u2019s real estate office to see if they have marked the property lines, you should not rely on their markings unless they note it was taken from a recorded plat. Even if they reference a recorded plat, many things can happen after a plat is recorded that would affect property lines and the county/city may not have updated their records. I would only use the government\u2019s information as a starting place, not the final authority on the lines. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "You should be able to get a map from your local taxing authority (probably your county in the U.S.) as a starting point. Also, in the deed you got when you bought the home, there is a legal description. Typically they start from a point (hopefully a survey marker) and describe the distance and direction to the next corner, and from there to the next, eventually having covered all the property lines (typically four) of your lot. In an ordinary city lot, you\u2019ll be able to see that the dimensions are 50 x 100 feet, for example and that will help you both finding the survey marker and visualizing the property lines. One difficulty is finding that first survey marker. If it\u2019s still there, it\u2019s probably buried under of few inches of dirt. Some have a top that describes (usually in latitude & longitude) their location. Others are just simple metal bars (think something like rebar) driven into the ground. The description from the deed will make more sense if you know where that marker is and can trace the imaginary property line(s) from there. Ultimately, if it\u2019s important enough, you may have to hire a professional surveyor ($500 and up). ",

Unfortunately, the old oak tree that marks the end point at three hundred paces SE of the rock wall that runs along Shady lane for four hundred and twenty-one paces North . . . has died, the road is now a two lane paved highway, which entailed removing the rock wall . . . The United States government eventually converted to the far saner Public Land Survey System, which with todays global positioning technologies can be very accurate establishing actual boundaries.

If you are doing this for the purposes of building a house or other structures, you are going to want to employ a surveyor to mark the boundaries and any other areas of concern.
