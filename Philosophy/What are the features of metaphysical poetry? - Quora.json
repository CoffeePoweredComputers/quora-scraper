            "answer_text": "John Donne as a father of metaphysical poetry is highly read and referred when it comes to the use of metaphysical characteristics. The metaphysical poets are said to be witty and intellectual because of the typicalities present in their writings specially in the use of wit and intellect, examples of ratiocination and conceit. Some of the characteristics are: \u2022 Ratiocination(Methodical way of reasoning)- It is a motion of ideas in such a way that an air of logic is maintained in order to persuade. Example- This flea is you and I, and this Our marriage bed,and marriage temple is \u2022 Thoughts and feelings- In the process of the intellectual ratiocination of metaphysical poetry,feelings have an appropriate place. Thoughts and feelings fuse into a peculiar union in metaphysical poetry. The fusion is what T.S. Eliot called \u201cThe Unified Sensibility.\u201d This kind of union lends flexibility and lightness to a piece. \u2022 Conceit- It is the comparison between two things which are unlike but likeness can be taken out from it. There are two types of conceit: 1) A short conceit-Comparison in a short conceit can only be applied in a given context. For Example- Motion in a mill is busy standing still. 2) Extended conceit- The comparison in an extended conceit is an elaborate attempt to prove the likeness between the two things. We may start from a comparison which is far from obvious but is gradually made clear. For example- \u201cA Valediction of Weaping\u201d by John Donne. \u2022 Colloquial style- The metaphysical poets are, apart from the use of wit and intellect,make use of colloquial style so that informality can be added to the style of writing. For example- \u201cThe Collar\u201d by George Herbert wherein he says,\u201dI struck the board,and say no more.\u201d \u2022 The abrupt opening- As the style majorly is colloquial or conversational ,abrupt opening also afds to the informal manner of the poem. For example- \u201cThe Sunne Rising\u201d by John Donne. As he says,\u201dBusy old fool,unruly sun.\u201d \u2022 Stream of knowledge- The metaphysical poets were very fond of showcasing their knowledge. It is even charged that due to frequent references to different streams of knowledge, their poetry and style of writing is lost and there is no perfect balance in between thoughts,feelings and references used in a poem. There is a frequent reference to mathematics,geography,science and philosophy. The metaphysical age can be divided into two, the first half is dominated by John Donne and includes secular poems and themes, the second half is governed by George Herbert and Henry Vaughan,the two devotional poets and their highly devotional style of writing.

            "answer_text": "The term \u2018metaphysical\u2019 means \u2018beyond the physical\u2019 or \u2018abstract ideas\u2019. In his essay Discourse Concerning Satire John Dryden remarked that John Donne in his poems \u2018affects the metaphysics\u2019 and \u2018perplexes the mind of the fair sex\u2019 instead of engaging their hearts. The term \u2018metaphysical poets\u2019 was also used in a derogatory sense by Samuel Johnson to describe a group of 17th century poets whom he viewed as \u2018the men of learning\u2019 and felt that \u2018to show their learning was their whole endeavour\u2019. The metaphysical style of poetry was first used by John Donne and later adopted by later like George Herbert, Richard Crashaw, Henry Vaughan, Abraham Cowley and Andrew Marvell. The following are the most conformed traits of metaphysical poetry: An intellectual styleThe metaphysical poets exploited all kinds of knowledge- commonplace and esoteric, practical and philosophical, theological or ethical-in their poems. Argumentative toneThe entire poem is based on several premises that build up the argument of the poet ( e. g. In To His Coy Mistress Marvell persuades his mistress to indulge in the act of lovemaking by providing different arguments to show the reasonableness of his stand). Innovative use of conceitsConceits are the term for figures of speech which establish a striking parallel between two dissimilar things or situations. While conceits used by Elizabethan poets were merely ornamental in nature, the conceits in a metaphysical poem are often an intrinsic part of the poet\u2019s technique of communication, amplification and persuasion ( e.g. In his poem The Flea Donne compares a flea bite and the mixing up of bloods inside the body of the flea with the physical union of two lovers). Witty, ironical and conversational toneThe metaphysical poems are realistic and rational in their approach. They are marked by subtle wit, irony and are composed in the style of everyday conversations. ( e.g. Donne\u2019s The Good Morrow begins in a direct tone with the line \u2018I wonder by my troth what thou and I/ Did, till we loved?\u2019) ",
