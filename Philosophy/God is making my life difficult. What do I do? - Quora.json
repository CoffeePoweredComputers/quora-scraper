            "answer_text": "I sympathize with your feelings. Recently I wrote an article which I believe will provide you with the answer you are in need of. God bless you. Why Does God Permit Suffering and Evil? Pastor Joseph Clark \u2013 August 27, 2020 \u201cIs man merely a mistake of God's? Or God merely a mistake of man?\u201d \u2015 Friedrich Nietzsche, Atheist \u201cAll thinking men are atheists.\u201d \u2015 Ernest Hemingway, Atheist \u201cThere is something infantile in the presumption that somebody else has a responsibility to give your life meaning and point\u2026 The truly adult view, by contrast, is that our life is as meaningful, as full and as wonderful as we choose to make it.\u201d \u2015 Richard Dawkins, Atheist Without a doubt, one of the most asked question of Pastors, is \u201cIf there is an all powerful, merciful, and loving God, why does he create / allow, so much suffering?\u201d Here is another way it is asked. \u201cIf God is good, then why does he cause or permit so much suffering and evil?\u201d Sadly, it is also one of the most common reasons people turn their back on God. It is one of the most common questions that believers and unbelievers alike ask. Atheists use it to attack the faith of believers. And I do mean attack. At least a dozen times per week as a minister, my faith is attacked by angry non-believers who feel threatened by my faith. It is one of the most often used arguments to attempt to disprove God. Here are some other versions of the question,\u201d If God is all powerful, why can\u2019t he stop our suffering?\u201d or \u201cIf God is real, why is there so much evil in the World?\u201d (Typically, any question starting with \u201cIf God is really\u2026\u201d can be an indication of the askers insincere intent as it usually turns out if they begin the question this way, that they are looking attack the faith. Not to effectively reason or seek genuine answers. But I digress.) I have seen a multitude of answers for this question from various pastors. The question can only be answered with faith. For those without faith, the question can never be answered. However, I tend to be a bit of a hardliner. I do not dilute the word even if it offends those who believe that it is better to be politically correct than to stick to your conviction. We do not know to what extent God causes suffering versus permits suffering. But we must accept it. I must warn you that I have an answer to this question, but it may not be a pleasing answer. My answer is in 7 succinct points. The first short answer which is the basis of the other 6 points is \u2018Because God deems it necessary\u2019. If he did not, there would be no suffering. This is supported by: 2 Corinthians 4:17 \"For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all.\" I wish to acknowledge that this world contains much horrific suffering that involves innocent people. God knows our suffering. Christ suffered unbelievably and died for us. Luke 13:1-4 says \u201cNow there were some present at that time who told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices. 2 Jesus answered, \u201cDo you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans because they suffered this way? 3 I tell you, no! But unless you repent, you too will all perish. 4 Or those eighteen who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them\u2014do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in Jerusalem?\u201d In other words, God allows people to suffer so they will turn to Him in repentance and not perish for eternity. Suffering is not to be taken lightly. We all go through it. Bad things happen to good people and bad people seem to prosper or get away with injustices all too often. But we must have faith in God who promises justice. How often do we see a newspaper headline about someone else\u2019s suffering as though it is not real, and yet when it happens to us, we cry \u201cWhy me?\u201d as opposed to introspectively thinking \u201cwhy not me?\u201d In the book of Job, God uses suffering as a test. The Book of Job demonstrates that suffering brings faithful believers into deeper understanding and relationship with God. Amid his suffering, Job exclaims \u201cMy redeemer lives!\u201d This is a lesson for each of us. This is what is expected to demonstrate our faith in God. God does test us. We do not know if our personal suffering is a test, but we do know that we are expected to have the faith and dedication to God that Job had when we face our tormentors and suffering. My additional answer is that without suffering, mankind would have no bearing on eternal salvation and eternal damnation. At this point we are only at page 2 of this article and no doubt the Christian readers are nodding their heads in affirmation and the non-believers\u2026want to punch me. All life is full of suffering. Ironically, we are responsible for much of our own suffering. This world is full of injustice, torment, and corruption. It gets worse. This world is the playground of the enemy. God permits Satan to carry on his schemes in this World. (1John 5:19, 2Corinthians 4:4, John 12:31, Isaiah 12:14-15). Why? Because it serves a purpose. Once again, without suffering we would have no bearing on eternity. Our purpose is to Glorify God. We do that by receiving Christ Jesus as our Lord and Savior in accordance with the Word of God, and we endeavour to live in accordance with the Word of God, despite the world. We are in this world, but in Christ we are not of this world. We discontinue being of this world when we become part of God\u2019s kingdom on Earth. When our bodies die, we join his heavenly kingdom as spirit. Our challenge is to live lives pleasing to God in the manner that the Bible teaches and commands, while resisting the temptations that the suffering of this world invokes. God is interested in the betterment of our eternal souls. The big picture! The long game! Think of it this way. Look at the thickness of The Holy Bible. It is a big book. Pretend for a moment that the thickness of the Bible is eternity. Our life here on earth is the equivalent of the thickness of a single page as compared to the thickness of all the other pages. God offers a single page of suffering in exchange for eternity in paradise with him. Unless you reject that offering. In which, well you know\u2026but that is covered off in another article. For God to do away with suffering, God would have to take away human freewill. At this point many will say, \u2018That is not good enough! I want the all expenses paid vacation in Heaven without having to suffer for it!\u201d And\u2026I cannot help you with that. Sadly, those who spend their lives constantly pursuing a free lunch, blaming others for their problems, and living with entitlement, tend to die that way. Satan was the first narcissist. It is an evil trait that causes a great deal of destruction, which we see all too often. There have been countless published studies which indicate that those with narcissistic tendencies represent the largest group of atheists. There is a French proverb which goes, \u2018You can be happy or you can be right all of the time, but not both.\u2019 Let us further remember The Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount, \u2018blessed are the Peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.\u2019 Before we go on, I want to preface that I get it! Suffering stinks! I have had a ton of suffering of my own. I have lived it. I lived with life threatening depression, betrayal, divorce, sin and self-loathing, gotten into trouble in my youth with the law, false accusations, and slanderous remarks made against me to friends and family, threats, persecution for my faith, a child who was close to death in the hospital, relatives who had cancer, friends who died in tragic accidents. And chances are that many who are reading this article have suffered worse than I. I have not had to battle cancer, go to prison, bury a child of my own, or lose immediate family. I write this humbly, acknowledging that we have not walked in each other\u2019s shoes, and I do not profess to be an expert on suffering, evil, pain, or recovery from grief. What I offer is supported by the Word of God. My own experience with suffering will be greater than some and less than others. For those who say, \u201cI don\u2019t expect special treatment, I just want to live a good life, not hurt anyone, but also, not to be hurt.\u201d My answer is, stay strong in your faith and walk it out. God gifted us freewill. The freewill to receive Christ and the freewill to reject him. Love is only meaningful if it is given of one\u2019s own freewill. God could have created a race of robotic men and women who were programmed to do no wrong and to constantly do what was pleasing and to constantly tell him that they love him, but it would have been meaningless. I can program my phone to tell me it loves me once an hour. But that does not compare to hearing my child say \u201cDad, I love you.\u201d God in his brilliance, selflessness, and infinite love, gave us freewill to love him with meaning. Here is what The Holy Spirit tells us in the word about suffering: 1 Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin. -1Peter 4:1 10 And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast. \u2013 1Peter 5:10 12 In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, - 2Timothy 3:12 12 Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him. \u2013 James 1:12 33 \u201cI have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.\u201d - John 16:33 27 And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. - Luke 14:27 Suffering creates questions in our minds that only the Word of God can answer. Suffering draws us closer to God\u2019s counsel. For as many questions as it creates it provides even more messages to us from God. We are instructed by Christ to have the faith of a child. Here is an excerpt of what Ravi Zacharias taught on the topic of suffering: \u201c\u2026the Christian message stands tall above any other teaching on pain and suffering.\u201d \u201cWithout suffering there is no good. Without good there is no moral law. Without moral law there is no moral law giver, without good there is no evil.\u201d - Ravi Zacharias When asked about suffering, here is what Billy Graham wrote: \u201cThe world\u2019s in pain. Without God\u2019s guidance, our response to suffering is a futile attempt to find solutions to conditions that cannot be solved. When suffering comes to us, we must entrust each day to God with praise on our lips. Doing this demonstrates we belong to Him. To tap the power of God in our lives, we must be connected to Him through salvation in His Son Jesus Christ who also suffered greatly in order to redeem us from sin.\u201d - Billy Graham Max Lucado wrote: Whether its two toddlers fighting in a playroom or two super-powers directing nuclear missiles at each other; the cause of conflict is the same. Selfishness. One side cannot get what they want so they demand their way. They fight. War is the fruit of sin. To ask God to prohibit war, then, is to ask him to prohibit the consequence of human behavior. Something he has never done and won\u2019t do. As long as there is sin there will be war. - Max Lucado It can be very difficult to trust God and turn to him when we are experiencing human pain. We might even get angry at times with the state of the world. However, we are best to turn to God for answers during these times as opposed to behave as though we are in a relationship with God in which we have one foot pointed towards the door each time we are scared or discouraged, or displeased. This world is a small part of our walk with God. I believe that in the vastness of eternity, the suffering of this life is short and fleeting much in the way that the pains of childbirth are easily forgotten. We must remain steadfast in our belief in God\u2019s love for us. In Christ\u2019s sacrifice and miraculous signs and his own resurrection. Why does God permit sufferings and evil? 1) God has deemed suffering necessary. 2) You cannot have one without the other. We must have evil to have good. 3) To do away with suffering and evil is to do away with Man\u2019s freewill. 4) It is part of our sanctification to choose to receive Christ and Glorify God in accordance with the Gospels, in the face of suffering. 5) Without a life of suffering, we would be ignorant to the value of Heaven. Mankind would have no bearing on eternal salvation or eternal damnation. 6) To drive us to repentance and hope of salvation through Christ. 7) To remove suffering and evil would involve removing the freewill of men and women to choose to do good and Glorify God, and truly love God with meaning, Let us remain steadfast and be there for others during their suffering. Practice mercy as Christ demonstrated and do our best to avoid creating suffering for ourselves and others. Endeavor towards the ultimate test of acting in the Grace of Christ amid discouragement, misfortune, disease, tragedy, injustice, assault. Let us remember how Christ suffered not only torture and execution but also false accusations, humiliation, and persecution, when face to face with suffering and evil let us remember and be reassured of these powerful and glorious words: \u201cI can do all things through him who strengthens me.\u201d - Philippians 4:13 And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who[ a ] have been called according to his purpose. - Romans 8:28 ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly I'm gonna answer you truthfully based on my experience. I was in such,a dilemma about a year ago, I kept asking why is this happening to me ? Did I kill someone? Why does God hate me? This got me thinking and i ended up formulating a plan.i was gonna take a break from God. As a Catholic this idea made my heart skip a bit, what if Jesus came to me at night and told me how much of a disappointment I am, how I was going to hell, how I would be disowned by the creator,forever be in suffering. But as a brave soldier I stood my ground,I was going to go through with the plan. First day of the plan was literally hell, the constant bickering at the back of my head telling me I should be ashamed of myself,ask for forgiveness,pray all night since I had committed such an atrocious crime. But I pushed through,. I knew I needed to take a break from this religion thing, I was becoming weak, every little thing, I prayed for i.e my grades to move from a 'c' to a 'b' at least. I was working hard don't get me wrong , I was giving 95% cause I knew God helps those who help themselves and it would all be just fine, but that's not how it went I constantly failed to reach my goals over and over again but I still had the Christian faith pushing trough telling me God has a reason, it is not yet time. So far I was one month in ,taking a break from religion when I read this quote from Buddha \u201c Be your own lamp, seek no other refuge, instead of being a victim to you fate be the master.\u201d This is when I realised I had had it all wrong from the beginning, I had control over my life, I was constantly acting as a victim in my own life constantly being led as a puppet through life, I wasn't going to be a sheep, when they jump I just jump with them. This is when I regained control over my life and realised the cards were in my own hands and no one else's. It's like I was viewing a new reality . And that's how I gained control of my own life and completely abadoned religion,it just wasn't my thing, it never was. I think another thing that contributed to me leaving religion was my love for astronomy and astrophysics. This was what kept me going through the dark times, I would just look up at the night sky and bask at the beauty of the universe . That's when I had to make the choice science or religion. I think the only mistake I ever made was having faith in someone else rather than myself. I started giving 120% in everything cause I realised I was the only person who was going to help myself. I hope you realise the power is in your own hands,it all depends on the story you tell yourself as the stoics say. I personally think you should break down what makes you think your life is difficult and if it's something you can solve then solve it, if it isn't then move on. Cause you got to let go of the things you can't control and just move on to the next. I'm not telling you to abandon your god ,I'm just hoping you learn a thing or two from my answer. Hope you get through the difficult times. -NOELLE. ",

            "answer_text": "I would think it\u2019s more likely that God is not appearing to help you out of difficulties that are part of your challenges in life. God is there to help you to learn, and also empower and guide you where you need it. But God won\u2019t remove problems from your path if you chose to face that challenge. Having said that, God won\u2019t leave you to fumble your way through the problems on your own. Neither will He (my own feeling of a Fatherly Energy) necessarily choose the solution that you would choose. You see, you can only imagine what seems viable now. That\u2019s a short term solution. God will opt for the best long term solution, because ultimately that\u2019s the best for you. So don\u2019t think that God\u2019s making life difficult for you, because it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019ve been making decisions that cannot help you along your path in life. If I were you, I\u2019d have a chat with God and tell Him that you need help so that you can help yourself out of your difficulties. Get into a habit of chatting regularly to God, and also pray, but in your own words. No thee and thou. Be positive and you\u2019ll find more good comes into your day. You chose life\u2019s challenges while you were still merely a spirit in the Heavenly Realms, then God made up the framework within which you could achieve your goals, and life can\u2019t always flow along without some ups and downs.. So don\u2019t rely on your logic to solve things, instead pay attention to those instinctive messages that come from your soul. Act on them and trust in God to be there for you as you work to bring about a positive and powerful journey of growth. ",

And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. We are born to suffer. We suffer to complete the redemptive mission of Christ: A. Jesus is all Heart. When Lazarus died, Jesus absorbed all the sorrow around Him - and wept (John 11:35)! We too must take our trials, and those of the needy to Jesus in prayer. When we petition Him, He suffers with us - thus the risen Christ completes His mission through us i.e. His Church. We being part of the family of God, become helpers in completing His redemptive process - Colossians 1:24 Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is STILL LACKING in regard to Christ\u2019s afflictions, FOR THE SAKE OF HIS BODY, which is THE CHURCH. Galatians 6:2 CARRY EACH OTHER'S BURDENS, and in this way you WILL FULFILL THE LAW OF CHRIST. B. Cross = Death. When we accept 'Jesus cross', we agree to 'wait upon Him' and 'do His will' when called upon to do so, and serve Him even unto death. Thus in every situation we must ask ourselves 'What would Jesus do, if He was in our place' - and we must take up the courage to do it, irrespective of the repercussions. Matthew 16:24- 26 Then Jesus told his disciples, \u201cIf anyone would come after me, let him DENY HIMSELF AND TAKE UP HIS CROSS AND FOLLOW ME. (Also see Luke 9:23). ",

            "answer_text": "I'm talking of God from a Christian point of view. If you're not into Christian things or thinking, please remember not everyone believes as you do. I'm answering this from a Christian and bible (old/new testament that Christians read) viewpoint. +++++++++++++ I like this question, as it's how I feel. Now what I'm going to say, is the perfect answer, and not what I might do myself. I am human, and very (oh what's the word?) Right here we go \u2026. When we pray, we expect to \u201chear\" from god, and often we expect, a yes. Thing is the answer won't always be a yes, and depending on our spiritual position (humble and bended knee, or boastful n full of sin) we don't always hear god. Now, hearing god, is not as a cartoon, voice out of the sky loud and clear, it's often a feeling or urge, or inner voice. If we asked God for something we want, but might be bad for us, then the answer will be a no! No, I won't let you touch that fire, you'll burn your hand! \u2026 I often feel Job, had it easy in his testing, as he had everything restored greater than he'd lost. My story is, I never had anything to be taken to be restored. I had no family (apart from in name) and I had no life (wife, kids, job, wealth). I studied the Bible practically every day for almost 5 years. This I think is my main problem\u2026 for me. Now I have no idea of your life, situation, upbringing, morals, sins, or anything about you. The Bible teaches us, if we pray for patience, we WILL BE TESTED. If we ask for love, we must first love others. And the list goes on, that everything we ask for, will either be earned (that well be tested) or gifted (blessings), or computer says no\u2026. Now when you say God is making your life difficult, what do you mean? I can't give you a full and proper answer without knowing what it is you're struggling with. We as Christians do talk of being tested. Abstaining, and then getting a security job at a brothel, or cake shop! Please reply, so I can answer this for you. ",

            "answer_text": "God is making my life difficult. What do I do? We assume that life on earth is the main life and blame God for not making it easier for us; that is a wrong assumption. We should remember that we are here for testing; test environment necessitates struggle between desires and obedience, between good and evil. Testing missions are not supposed to be fair, easy, or comfortable. The test questions are not supposed to be known in advance. The wealthy father has the right to test his sons before distributing the wealth The wise father disciplines his children and prepares them for a better life The obedient son who takes care of others should be rewarded better than the disobedient son who persecutes others. Psalm 66:10 teaches \u2018For You, O God, have tested us; You have refined us as silver is refined\u2019 Proverbs 17:3 teaches \u2018The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, but God tests the hearts\u2019 Isaiah 48:10 teaches \u2018I have refined you, but not as silver is refined. Rather, I have refined you in the furnace of suffering\u2019 Job 23:10 teaches \u2018when he has tested me, I will come forth as gold\u2019 Qur\u2019an verse 47:31 clarifies that we are here for testing And We will surely test you until We make evident those who strive among you [for the cause of God] and the patient, and We will test your affairs Verse 29:2-3 confirms that we are here for testing Do the people think that they will be left to say, \"We believe\" and they will not be tried? But We have certainly tried those before them, and God will surely make evident those who are truthful, and He will surely make evident the liars. Similar teachings are found in 67:2, 18:7, 2:155 and 76:2 Regardless of how successful we are with our personal objectives; we cannot have inner peace without addressing the high-level objective; the purpose of our existence. It is wrong to say \u2018let us enjoy the journey and forget about the destination\u2019 If you find yourself in a train, you should not enjoy the beautiful scenes before first ask: why am I here? Where is the destination? We should first ask \u2018what is the purpose of life?\u2019 What is the value of life if we do not know the purpose of that life? It is the greatest good for an individual to discuss virtue every day... for the un-examined life is not worth living \u2013 Socrates Our life on earth is a very short period compared to the universe time scale; It could be a temporary test period. There are hundreds of verses and teachings about that as mentioned in the following answer: https://www.quora.com/How-do-we-know-our-purpose-of-existence-in-this-world/answer/Sabri-Shahin We have been asked to believe in God and Heaven but we have not seen God or heaven. Our fate will be determined based on that belief and on our good deeds. Why did God make it a difficult test for us? Although God knows what\u2019s in our hearts and what each of us might do, he tests us and wants us to witness our own test results in order to admit that we have been fairly rewarded according to our achievements as recorded in the test results Before the wealthy father distributes his wealth, he may want to record which son is obedient, the records are not for the father who knows, but as a testimony for people who might question the justice of their father Although the wise teacher knows the hard-working student and the lazy student, he prepares regular exams as testimonies so that the students would not say that the teacher had favored some students over the others. Exams also urge students to get prepared in order to succeed The student is not supposed to rejoice and enjoy himself during the exam hours Students should not wonder about the intention of the teacher; they are supposed to focus on what the teacher asked them to do If God wants to set up the testing environment to test people, then we are not supposed to advise God on how to set up the terms and conditions of the testing. The students are not supposed to advise the teacher on how to prepare the exams. God has created us, and he knows how to test us. The testing questions and answers are not supposed to be disclosed before the exam; testing environment necessitates some doubts and enables different choices and different decisions. The test does not depend on the level of education, a child may say \u2018I do not see the plane any more, it is going far away, it is still there but my sight does not reach it; God must be there but my sight does not reach him\u2019, but a scientist might conclude that, \u2018I do not see God, then there is no God\u2019. The test does not depend on the level of religion education, maybe someone who never heard of the religion teachings could pass the test based on the natural original gifts of conscience and reason \u2018What I do not want done to myself, I will not do to others. We may find some scholars who know the religion teachings but they accept to persecute and torture others, those are the bad trees which the prophets have warned us of them and of their bad fruits. The wise teacher sets different evaluation criteria for different grades; the students in the first grade are not evaluated as the students in the advanced degrees. We expect that the fair and wise God would evaluate people according to what they have been provided. The person who never heard of Prophets would have an easier test based on the gift of intelligence and conscience; he might get rewards for his good works and he might not be punished if not wicked. God has empowered each of us to be happy and blessed. God does not predetermine bad plans for good people. God does not predetermine good plans for disobedient people. We see many people born poor but have succeeded in life We see many people born rich but failed in life God has empowered us to do and get whatever we want. God has delegated that task to us, it is up to us to be blessed or to be cursed. The message that God has revealed to all prophets is: \u2018Blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience\u2019 All prophets taught that we can earn salvation by obedience, repentance, and good deeds to help others. \u201cIn obedience and repentance is your salvation\u201d Isaiah 30:15 Based on the above, the obedient believer should be blessed in this life and should be saved in the afterlife. That is the truth which should set you free. For those who have doubts, they can ask God. All prophets have urged us to ask God and taught that God would answer us. Do not worry about how you will receive and understand the answer; God has created us and he knows how to convey his message to us.

Dhoni is living legend only because he faced his difficulties, believed in himself. He could have said that God is not on his side therefore I am not successful.Read about American elite troops Navy Seals these to be soilders are put to harshest test to test their character in difficult situations. Only then they are allowed to be part of the elite troops. Bear Grylls of Man vs Wild is from one such British elite force called SAS. If your are facing difficulties in life, it means God has great plans for you. It is only after struggle till a particular threshold that we achieve excellence. You are being tested in character, patience and your zeal for living a purposeful life. Your question suggests that you have not given up but searching for answers more zealously. Nothing succeeds like failure, the more you fail the more confident, bold and adept you become for achieving greatness What you should do Face the situation at hand, understand that it is not only you who is facing the difficulties. If you have shelter and two square meal you are lucky if compared to many.Analyse your problems,break them into parts. Brain storm at each part seperately. Now start working on it, you can start by achieving the lowest hanging fruit.Leave inhibition and shame aside. People will comment even if you do something or you don't. Better to do and get wise.Action however small is way stronger than any amount of words.

Stay committed. Stay focused on the things of God, your dream and try to maintain a positive mindset because you may be going through a test. Put God first. When you put God first everything becomes easy automatically, love your neighbour and love yourself, don't judge, forgive, stay blessed stay hopeful, be kind, be honest and lastly Live your life. God brought us here to live life as easy as possible, he gave us talents to invest heavily in. Use it/them wisely. If life gets hard in a particular area ask yourself if you are holding on tightly. I know its hard but ask God to do it for you and thank Him for His blessings. Make a bold decision and let God lead you to the right direction. Its important to know that you cannot do it on your own but as God has helped every great king, inventor, doctor etc. Your problems are too small for Him not to handle. Shalom. ",
