            "answer_text": "\u201cIf you're really in love, then when you start feeling the urge to compliment your partner, you should feel a fresh thought coming to mind always.\u2026 Can't get that girl or guy out of your head? Daydreaming about the person when you should be working? Imagining your futures together? These dizzying thoughts may be signs of love. In fact, scientists have pinned down exactly what it means to \"fall in love.\" Researchers have found that an in - love brains looks very different from one experiencing mere lust, and it's also unlike a brain of someone in a long-term, committed relationship. Thinking this one's special When you're in love, you begin to think your beloved is unique. The belief is coupled with an inability to feel romantic passion for anyone else. Focusing on the positive People who are truly in love tend to focus on the positive qualities of their beloved, while overlooking his or her negative traits. They also focus on trivial events and objects that remind them of their loved one, daydreaming about these precious little moments and mementos. This focused attention is also thought to result from elevated levels of central dopamine, as well as a spike in central norepinephrine, a chemical associated with increased memory in the presence of new stimuli. It\u2019s a big, confusing world of love and life out there. But there really are some tell-tale signs you\u2019re in love that can help you figure it out. Here are some important signs you\u2019re in love: 1. You don\u2019t feel pain. And yes, I mean physical pain. (And yes, this is actually true!) Studies have shown that love really is a bit of a drug, and intense love actually has the ability to relieve pain. 2. You feel like you\u2019re on drugs. This sounds extremely dramatic, but there\u2019s truth behind it. When you first fall in love, and at times throughout your love story, you maybe like you\u2019re on a sort of drug high. Falling in love can produce a very similar sensation to getting high. When you\u2019re in love, your brain releases euphoria, which can occur at various times throughout your cycle of love, and helps you solidify the bond between you and your partner. 3. You\u2019re interested in new things. (That just happen to be about them.) This doesn\u2019t just apply to new sensations in your world, but in the literal sense. If you find yourself drawn to more new ideas and experiences than you\u2019ve ever been interested in before, chances are, you\u2019re in love. For example, if your new partner is involved in improv, you may find your Friday and Saturday nights completely entwined with laugh out loud comedy. If your partner is a huge soccer fan, you may find yourself with season tickets to see your local team. If your partner is a tax attorney, all of a sudden you may understand the IRS a lot more than you ever had before. If you\u2019re in love with someone, you will find yourself more and more interested towards what they care about. And the good news is, everyone likes new hobbies. 4. You check your phone a lot. Many of us are already kind of super-glued to our phones.But when you\u2019re in love, you may find yourself even more likely to quickly respond to a text message or even (gasp!) more likely to pick up a phone call. It\u2019s a common joke that no one likes talking on the phone anymore, but when you\u2019re in love, you may find that you make an exception for that special someone. 5. You check social media a lot.Consider yourself lucky if you\u2019re falling in love with someone who is not much of a social media user. Otherwise, consider yourself even more addicted to those social platforms. Not every couple is an \u201cInstagram Couple\u201d but you might be. If you find yourself posting a bunch of cute pictures and generally leaning into the corniness of the world wide web, you may just be in love. 6. You feel sick.Nobody likes being sick, but being lovesick really is a scientific phenomenon. If you notice your heart racing, your hands getting sweaty, your stomach filling with flutters that kind of make you feel nauseous, don\u2019t rush to the doctor. You really may just be in love. The stimulation of adrenaline and norepinephrine is legitimately something that happens to most of us when we\u2019re in love. You can truly feel like you have the flu when really, you\u2019re just overwhelmed with those feelings of love. (There\u2019s no medicine for it!) You may also experience symptoms like appetite loss and feeling kind of nauseous. What a world. 7. You catch yourself smiling.This sign is a little more pleasant than all of that flu stuff. If you happen to check your phone in front of a friend, chances are they\u2019ll tease you about the big smile plastered across your face. It\u2019s a common theme in movies and television shows and there\u2019s a reason why. When someone is in love, you can almost always tell by the big ol\u2019 smile on their face. Thank you for reading :) Hope my answer will be helpful to you :) Spread love \u2661 ",

            "answer_text": "How do I know? Well, I spent 43 years looking for \u201cthe one\u201d. And even though it didn\u2019t take me that long to realize that there wasn\u2019t a mythical creature out there somewhere who could fulfill all my needs and desires, I still hung onto the hope that there might be someone who could make the butterflies in my stomach tickle me whenever I saw her. And there was. For two decades, I tried what I could to find someone I could even feel comfortable with. And as an introvert with anxiety problems, this wasn\u2019t easy to do because I\u2019ve never liked to socialize at all. Going to parties or night clubs was never something I enjoyed, and the kind of woman I wanted wasn\u2019t very likely to be found there, anyway. I didn\u2019t know what or who I wanted. Only what I didn\u2019t want. And unfortunately, I only met women I didn\u2019t want to get involved with.Not bad people at all. They just didn\u2019t seem right somehow. There was no chemistry. From the age of 20, I was actively trying to find someone. Or that\u2019s to say, I met people at work and at my usual hangouts like the library and the record store where my friend works, but most of the women at work were married already and I felt too awkward to approach women who were reading a book in private. And because I felt awkward, I looked awkward as well, and I\u2019m sure this put a lot of people off the idea of approaching me. There was no social media at that time. No Facebook and certainly no Tinder.You could always put a classified ad in the local paper, but I figured that if it was difficult for me to approach someone cold in a public place, it would be even more terrifying to do so with a completely unknown person I hadn\u2019t even seen. Eventually all the dating sites and apps became available, but by that time, I was kinda set in my ways and didn\u2019t want to use them.I was an old-school romantic who\u2019d grown up with people who married and stayed married to their first love. And as naive as that may sound, that\u2019s what was normal to me. That\u2019s the kind of relationship I wanted to find. Love at first sight. Or at least soon thereafter. In my 30\u2019s, I\u2019d given up on that idea. I\u2019d become cynical and bitter.I hadn\u2019t met anyone and I didn\u2019t like to look for someone in the places where people meet. And I especially didn\u2019t like the idea of someone judging my worth from looking at my picture and swiping left or right. Even if someone wanted me, I didn\u2019t want someone who wanted me, purely based on my physical attributes. It wasn\u2019t until I hit my 40\u2019s that I seriously started to ache for another person\u2019s company. I was afraid that it was too late. That I\u2019d left it too long. That I\u2019d been too much of a coward to seriously make an effort. Then I found Quora. And by writing here, I suddenly met lots of people who weren\u2019t necessarily looking for relationships, but who nevertheless shared my interests and liked to express their opinions on everything under the sun. I loved it! I\u2019m not sure why it took so long to discover this site (it would\u2019ve been great to do so much earlier) but once I did, I suddenly had more friends than I\u2019d ever had before in my life. And I felt at home here because people weren\u2019t simply interested in their own status or follower count; many of them were here because they had a lot to say and they wanted to be heard. And to learn from others. That\u2019s exactly the sort of environment where the woman of my dreams could be lurking. Not that I had any serious faith in that possibility, but I could at least imagine it. It wasn\u2019t out of the question. I contacted people. People contacted me. I established both friendships and relationships. And I lost or caused the end of friendships and relationships. It was both beautiful and painful at times. Just like life is supposed to be, I guess.But that elusive woman I dreamed of failed to materialize. 3 years had gone by and I hadn\u2019t found her. I still enjoyed being on Quora, but my cynicism and bitterness had started to return. I became more and more convinced that I either wasn\u2019t fit for relationships, even online, or else Quora might not be the place to look for them. I was 43. Desperate and needy. Pathetic. Out of options. Depressed beyond belief.There was no one for me. There couldn\u2019t be. I wasn\u2019t worthy. And then she found me. She just showed up one day. Out of the blue.There was no profile picture to look at, but I was immediately intrigued by the way she introduced herself and let me know the reason for why she\u2019d contacted me. She didn\u2019t beat around the bush. She\u2019d read my answers and could relate to them.So much so that she\u2019d actually opened a Quora account, just to be able to talk to me. Being bitter and cynical, I thought she might be a scammer at first.I\u2019d had to deal with them in the past, and they often appeared out of nowhere, just like her. But she was different. Very intelligent and funny. And she knew what she was talking about. There was no pretense about her. She actually had read my answers with great interest, and the way she spoke about things I\u2019d written, it was if she could see right through me. Almost from day one, we could finish each other\u2019s sentences.That had only happened with my best friend back at school, and even then,we could only do that because we sat next to each other every day for 9 years. With her, it took a couple of days! I was amazed. And also a bit scared.Who was she? How did she know me so well? How come I never got bored with her like I did with most other people? How was she always able to read my mind and say what I wanted to say and the things I\u2019d never told anyone before? It felt like I\u2019d found a soul mate. A twin sister. We started talking. All the time. And after several months, we\u2019re still talking. All the time. And I still can\u2019t get enough of her. As an introvert, my instinct has always been to withdraw. I don\u2019t like having other people around. They drain my energy, just by being there.I prefer to hang out in my own little bubble where I can do what I want, whenever I want, without others telling me off for doing so or forcing me to pretend to enjoy their company. But with her, I felt energized and full of hope whenever we spoke.7 years of therapy and too many antidepressants couldn\u2019t achieve what she did for me by simply laughing at one of my stupid jokes. And even more impressive, she made me laugh! For years and years, friends would complain about how stiff and boring I was for not laughing at their jokes, and I always felt embarrassed about that because I wanted to laugh. I just didn\u2019t think they were funny. But she was. She was a master of surprising me with plot twists and punchlines I could never see coming, and I fucking loved it! That\u2019s what I was looking for. A woman who thought like me and could relate to me.I tried for a long time to fit in and be like others, but that didn\u2019t work.If \u201cthe one\u201d existed at all, she\u2019d have to be like me: Insecure, patient, empathetic, intelligent, opinionated, funny and a bit naughty, etc. And she was all of that and so much more. But apart from being very similar people, what really tipped the scales for me; what truly made me know that I\u2019d been found by \u201cthe one\u201d was a few very important things. She showed me her artwork. She\u2019s a brilliant artist who paints some of the most impressive stuff I\u2019ve ever seen. And she\u2019s also humble about it and would probably hate it if I praised her too much. But I\u2019m very picky with the art I like, and her work impresses me. I\u2019m very proud of her.As a musician, I always hoped I\u2019d find a woman who was artistic and creative.She accepted me the way I am, because she\u2019s the same. I didn\u2019t think that could be possible, but no matter how much I tried to \u201ctest\u201d her with questions and suspicions, she instantly blew away any such notions by being absolutely real and straightforward with me. And I respect that.I could be vulnerable with her. When we met, I hadn\u2019t truly cried for over 20 years. I held it all inside and bottled it up. But I found that by being kind and understanding, even when I was behaving like a complete shit, she brought the tears out of me. I couldn\u2019t stop it from happening.Her words were therapeutic and comforting, and I wept like a baby.I haven\u2019t told her this, but it was a cathartic experience for me.My therapists always had a box of tissues if I needed them, but I never did.Letting someone else see me crying would be the ultimate loss of face, I thought. But with her, it just happened naturally. It felt right.I cried. She cried. We cried together. And it was lovely.I like her courage. She claims to be no braver than me, but she was the one who found me and approached me. She took all the difficult steps.And I think that\u2019s so fucking cool that she would do that when society so often tells us that it\u2019s the man\u2019s job to woo the woman.I wish more women would approach first. It\u2019s great. Especially for cowards like me.I like to talk. A lot. It\u2019s not easy for me to find people who can keep up with me, but when I like someone, I like to talk with them. And most of them give up on me or get bored. She doesn\u2019t. Or if she does, she\u2019s kind enough to not openly let it bother her.I used to be concerned about that at first because I was afraid that she\u2019d leave me like the others did when I wanted too much of their time, but she can talk as much as I do. About the same things I like to talk about.And if I can\u2019t think of anything to say, then she takes over and we continue.I could go on, but let\u2019s just say that I know she\u2019s \u201cthe one\u201d.She\u2019s the first woman I\u2019ve been interested in that I didn\u2019t awkwardly pursue or desperately tried to keep.She\u2019s with me because she wants to be, and I feel exactly the same way about her. I have something to look forward to now. Every day she makes me smile.She\u2019s put a smile on the most hardened cynic in the world. And for that, I love her. ",

            "answer_text": "There are many different kinds of love and there's no single way to know whether you're really feeling it \u2014 or just in the throes of a serious infatuation. Still, if you pay attention to how you feel and act around your special someone, you should be able to figure out whether you're really in love. If you want to know how to do it, just follow these steps. Noticing What You Think 1 See if you can\u2019t picture a future without your loved one. If you\u2019re really in love, then you shouldn't be able to picture your future without them. Whether at night, or in the morning, or with your friends, the fact that you can't stop means you're in love, and mayhave found \"the one\". Whether thinking of moving to a new city, having children, spending a year abroad, or reaching any of your future goals, you should be thinking of doing these things with your significant other by your side. If you can\u2019t imagine going through life without your significant other \u2014 not just next summer, or next year, or whenever\u2014 then you may be truly in love. Here are some other signs that you\u2019re truly in love:If you can't think about starting a new chapter of your life, whether it's a new job or a move to a new place, without your loved one at your side.If you've thought about having children but can't imagine having kids with anyone other than your loved one.If you can't imagine growing old without your loved one by your side.2 See if you can\u2019t go a few hours without thinking of your loved one. To be in love, you don\u2019t have to be obsessive about your loved one; in fact, quite the opposite is true. If you have a healthy loving relationship, then you should be able to spend time apart from your loved one without obsessing over what they're doing every five seconds.[2]However, if you can go a whole weekend, or a whole month, without your loved one once crossing your mind, then you may like them a lot, but you may not necessarily have reached the love stage yet. Here are some other signs that you\u2019re really in love:If you read a book or see a movie without your loved one, you may wonder what they would think of it.If you're trying on clothes without your special someone, you may think about how they would like your new look.If you call or text your loved one just because you want to say hi or hear their voice, then you may be falling in love.3 See if you truly value the opinions of your loved one. If you\u2019re really in love, then you won\u2019t just be thinking of your loved one as a perfect object that should be worshipped, but as a living, breathing human being with an interesting perspective and many unique opinions. If you\u2019re really in love, then you should value your loved one\u2019s opinion and should care about what they think, whether it\u2019s about your next career move or the political situation in your country. Though you don\u2019t have to care what they think about absolutely everything, if you don\u2019t truly value the input of your loved one, then you may not be in love yet. Here are some signs that you\u2019ve truly found the one:If you take your loved one's ideas into account when you're making a big decision, then you take your partner seriously enough to be in love.If you're in a difficult social situation and value your special someone's opinion of what you should do, then you may be falling in love.If you care what your loved one thinks about the news, politics, art, or anything else that truly matters to you, then you may be falling in love.4 See if your loved one makes you want to be a better person. If you\u2019re really in love, then you shouldn't just be completely comfortable in your status quo, even if you\u2019re very content with your loved one. Though being happy with the relationship you have and the person that you are is essential, being with your loved one should make you want to take your life to the next level and to be the best person you can possibly be\u2014eventually. Here are some more signs that you\u2019re truly in love:If you want to read more, know more, care more, and just to be a more well-rounded person not just to please your loved one but because they really motivate you to want to change your life in a positive way, then you may be in love.If you want to work on addressing your flaws and developing your character just from being around your loved one, then you may be falling in love.5 See if you feel like the best version of yourself when you\u2019re with your loved one. If you\u2019re in love, then the person you love should bring out the best in you. After all, if you\u2019re in love, then you should want to be with the person you\u2019re with for the rest of your life, so that person should make you feel like your best self. If you feel like you can never fully be who you are,[3] or that you\u2019re inadequate in some way when you\u2019re around your loved one, then you may not be in love. Here are some signs that you\u2019ve fallen in love:If you feel at your most handsome or beautiful when you're around your loved one, even if you're just rocking a casual look.If you feel like you're at your smartest and sharpest when you're talking something through with your partner.If you feel you're most confident around your loved one, and never have to worry if you're going to sound stupid when you begin to say something.6 See if you\u2019re aware of your loved one\u2019s flaws \u2013 and are okay with them. If you\u2019re really in love, then you should be able to see your significant other as a real live human being with real human flaws \u2013 not as a god or a goddess. If you insist that your loved one is perfect, then you have a real problem. But if you\u2019re comfortable admitting that your loved one can be a bit selfish or isn\u2019t the world\u2019s greatest listener, then you have a more realistic perspective on the relationship and are much more likely to be in love for real.Being aware of your loved one's flaws doesn't mean you shouldn't help them address them if that's the right thing to do.If you can't possibly think of two or three things that make your special someone less than perfect, then you may not be truly seeing the person for who they are.If you and your loved one are comfortable enough with each other to laugh about one another's flaws, then you're more likely to be really in love.Part2 Noticing What You Do 1 See if you take pleasure in helping your loved one. Love is about giving and take. If you\u2019re in love, then you should enjoy the giving just as much as the taking. You should take pleasure in making your loved one lunch, giving them a ride when they need one, or even doing your loved one\u2019s laundry if they're having a rough week. Though you shouldn't get taken advantage of, you should be able to enjoy helping your loved one when they need it and be prepared to be helped in return. Here are some more signs that you're really in love:If you feel good about getting your loved one coffee or surprising them with a dessert from your favorite bakery without feeling like you're wasting your precious time.If you enjoy teaching your loved one how to do something, whether it's to make the perfect burger or to solve a complicated math problem.2 See if your loved one makes you laugh. Love doesn't have to be so serious all the time. Sure, you can spend hours staring longingly into the eyes of your loved one, but that can get a little boring. If you\u2019re really in love, then you should be able to goof off and laugh with your loved one and to enjoy the sense of humor of your loved one. Though neither of you has to be comedians for your relationship to work, it helps to be able to laugh with each other from time to time. This shows that you\u2019re comfortable enough (and happy enough) with each other to be in love.If your special someone has the ability to make you crack up even when you're in the worst of moods, then you may be falling in love.3 See if you enjoy doing the little things with your loved one. True love isn't like an episode of The Bachelor \u2014 though taking a helicopter ride with your loved one or having a romantic picnic in a vineyard can be intensely romantic and an incredible experience, real love means being able to find the fun in the mundane things with your loved one, from having a beer or two at your local bar to buying kitty litter and stopping to get ice cream on the way home. Here are some signs that you truly appreciate all of the time you spend with your loved one:If you like just sitting around and watching your favorite TV show with your loved one.If you like stepping out to get ice cream with your loved one as much as you like enjoying a delicious fancy four-course meal together.If you enjoy a night in with your loved one as much as you like the occasional extravagant date.EXPERT TIPJESSICA ENGLE, MFT, MARelationship CoachLove is different throughout the stages of your life. Jessica Engle, the director of Bay Area Dating Coach, says: \"Often when we're younger, there's that exciting feeling we refer to as puppy love. As we get more experience and start to grow older, love might be less intense at the beginning, for some people, but it has legs, so to speak. There may be a calmer, deeper sense of connection over time.\"4 See if you\u2019ve made it through the tough times. Love isn\u2019t a bed of roses, though if you\u2019re truly in love, the good days should far outnumber the bad, and you should be comfortable staying in your relationship during less-than-ideal circumstances, from a job loss to the death of a loved one. Tough situations can test the strength of your relationship, and if you\u2019ve never had to overcome a significant hurdle with your loved one, then you may not have enough information to know if you\u2019re in love yet.[4]If you were able to work through a tough problem in your relationship, whether it was trying to make it work with one of your insanely busy schedules or dealing with one person's disappointment in a major life event, then your relationship should be stronger for it.If you were able to stay strong during the death of a loved one, then you're more likely to feel truly in love.5 See if you\u2019re willing to step out of your comfort zone for your loved one. If you\u2019re really in love, then you should be willing to try something new and unexpected for your loved one, even if it makes you a little scared or queasy. This doesn\u2019t mean that you should walk across hot coals or embarrass yourself just to win over the person you love, but it does mean that you should be ready to take a far-away trip to see your loved one\u2019s distant relatives in Guatemala or go on a hike or two with your loved one if he\u2019s obsessed with hiking.[5]If you're willing to do something that you thought you would never do, such as learn a new language or learn to swim, because it's really important for your loved one, then you're more likely to be in love.If you've found yourself being more comfortable with being uncomfortable, with or without your loved one, then you may be in love.6 See if you\u2019re willing to compromise for your loved one. If you\u2019re really in love, then you should know that you can\u2019t always get your way. If your loved one is always giving in to your demands because you\u2019re so stubborn, then you\u2019re not really in love. Being in love means getting what you want sometimes, and letting your loved one get what s/he wants sometimes; or better yet, finding a solution that makes both people happy.If you're in love, then you should not only be able to compromise with your loved one, but you should feel good about reaching a decision together, instead of feeling like you didn't really get what you wanted.If you're really in love, then both people should be able to compromise, instead of one person doing all the giving in every time.7 See if you\u2019re comfortable with maintaining your individuality. If you\u2019re really in love, then you shouldn't turn into a clone of your loved one, copying all of their interests and hobbies and shedding anything that gave you pleasure before you started your relationship. Instead, you should be able to maintain your sense of self while growing together with the person that you love.[6] If you\u2019re truly in love, then you should be doing the following things:Being comfortable hanging out with your friends without your special someone, and letting them do the same.Being okay with maintaining your own interests, such as yoga or soccer, even if your special someone doesn't do them.Being happy having some alone time instead of always hanging out with your significant other.Part3 Noticing What You Say 1 See if you can truly say what\u2019s on your mind in front of your loved one. If you\u2019re really in love, then you shouldn't hold back when you talk to your loved one. This doesn't mean that you should tell them every little thing that\u2019s bothering you or nag them because you feel like you\u2019re being honest, but it does mean that you should be comfortable enough in your relationship to be able to bring up something that\u2019s bothering you, or sharing your true feelings, without feeling like it\u2019s not worth it because your loved one will be bored, angry, or just won\u2019t care.[7]If you can tell your partner exactly how you feel about something without worrying that you sound immature or stupid, then you may be falling in love.If you're okay with cracking a joke, no matter how corny it may be, then you and your loved one are on the same page.2 See if you\u2019re happy to spend hours talking about nothing with your loved one. If you\u2019re really in love, then you and your loved one don\u2019t have to have deep discussions about the meaning of life or about the status of your relationship all the time. A lot of love lies in the little things, and most of your conversation won\u2019t be earth-shattering or celestial, and that\u2019s perfectly okay.If you\u2019re really in love, then you should be happy dissecting the latest episode of Breaking Bad with your loved one, or making small talk during a baseball game, and feeling that it\u2019s enough.If you've gotten off the phone with your loved one after laughing the whole time and wondering, \"What did we just talk about?\" then you may be in love.3 See if you\u2019re comfortable revealing your weaknesses to your loved one. If you\u2019re truly in love, then you should be comfortable enough to let your loved one see the real you, even if that means showing your less-than-flattering side. If everything you say is devised to make your significant other like you or want to be with you even more, then you\u2019re not comfortable with them enough to be really in love.If you\u2019re willing to open up and talk about your past mistakes or grievances, then you\u2019re more likely to be in love.You don't have to tell the person you love every last thing that has caused you pain, but you should be able to feel better after mentioning it. If you're in love, you'll accept each other, flaws and all.4 See if you\u2019re always finding new ways to compliment your significant other. If you\u2019re really in love, then when you feel the urge to compliment your partner, you should feel a fresh thought come to mind. If all you can think of is, \u201cYou\u2019re so hot\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re so funny,\u201d then you have to dig deeper to find why you really love the person you\u2019re with. You should be able to compliment the strong suits of the person you\u2019re with \u2014 inside and out.If you're always finding yourself pleasantly surprised by the seemingly endless good qualities that your loved one demonstrates, then you may be in love.If you often tell the special someone things you love about them \u2014 and really mean it \u2014 then you may be in love.5 If you're in love, then you will notice them for their inner beauty, not (only) their outer beauty.",

            "answer_text": "13 Scientifically Proven Signs You're in Love Introduction Can't get that girl or guy out of your head? Daydreaming about the person when you should be working? Imagining your futures together? These dizzying thoughts may be signs of love. In fact, scientists have pinned down exactly what it means to \"fall in love.\" Researchers have found that an in-love brain looks very different from one experiencing mere lust, and it's also unlike a brain of someone in a long-term, committed relationship. Studies led by Helen Fisher, an anthropologist at Rutgers University and one of the leading experts on the biological basis of love, have revealed that the brain's \"in love\" phase is a unique and well-defined period of time, and there are 13 telltale signs that you're in it. Thinking this one's special When you're in love, you begin to think your beloved is unique. The belief is coupled with an inability to feel romantic passion for anyone else. Fisher and her colleagues believe this single-mindedness results from elevated levels of central dopamine \u2014 a chemical involved in attention and focus \u2014 in your brain Focusing on the positive People who are truly in love tend to focus on the positive qualities of their beloved, while overlooking his or her negative traits. They also focus on trivial events and objects that remind them of their loved one, daydreaming about these precious little moments and mementos. This focused attention is also thought to result from elevated levels of central dopamine, as well as a spike in central norepinephrine, a chemical associated with increased memory in the presence of new stimuli. Emotional instability As is well known, falling in love often leads to emotional and physiological instability. You bounce between exhilaration, euphoria, increased energy, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, trembling, a racing heart and accelerated breathing, as well as anxiety, panic and feelings of despair when your relationship suffers even the smallest setback. These mood swings parallel the behavior of drug addicts. And indeed, when in-love people are shown pictures of their loved ones, it fires up the same regions of the brain that activate when a drug addict takes a hit. Being in love, researchers say, is a form of addiction. Intensifying attraction Going through some sort of adversity with another person tends to intensify romantic attraction. Central dopamine may be responsible for this reaction, too, because research shows that when a reward is delayed, dopamine-producing neurons in the mid-brain region become more productive. Intrusive thinking People who are in love report that they spend, on average, more than 85 percent of their waking hours musing over their \"love object,\" according to Fisher. Intrusive thinking, as this form of obsessive behavior is called, may result from decreased levels of central serotonin in the brain, a condition that has been associated with obsessive behavior previously. (Obsessive-compulsive disorder is treated with serotonin-reuptake inhibitors.) Emotional dependency People in love regularly exhibit signs of emotional dependency on their relationship, including possessiveness, jealousy, fear of rejection, and separation anxiety. For instance, Fisher and her colleagues looked at the brains of individuals viewing photos of a rejected loved one, or someone they were still in love with after being rejected by that person. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showed activation in several brain areas, including forebrain areas like the cingulate gyrus that have been shown to play a role in cocaine cravings. \"Activation of areas involved in cocaine addiction may help explain the obsessive behaviors associated with rejection in love,\" the researchers wrote in 2010 in the Journal of Neurophysiology. Planning a future They also long for emotional union with their beloved, seeking out ways to get closer and day-dreaming about their future together. Another love expert, Lucy Brown, a neuroscientist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, says this drive to be with another person is sort of like our drive toward water and other things we need to survive. \"Functional MRI studies show that primitive neural systems underlying drive, reward recognition and euphoria are active in almost everyone when they look at the face of their beloved and think loving thoughts. This puts romantic love in the company of survival systems, like those that make us hungry or thirsty,\" Brown told Live Science in 2011. \"I think of romantic love as part of the human reproductive strategy. It helps us form pair-bonds, which help us survive. We were built to experience the magic of love and to be driven toward another.\" Feelings of empathy People who are in love generally feel a powerful sense of empathy toward their beloved, feeling the other person's pain as their own and being willing to sacrifice anything for the other person. Aligning interests Falling in love is marked by a tendency to reorder your daily priorities and/or change your clothing, mannerisms, habits or values so that they better align with those of your beloved. Even so, being yourself may be your best bet: In another of Fisher's studies, presented in 2013 at the \"Being Human\" conference, she found that people are attracted to their opposites, at least their \"brain-chemical\" opposites. For instance, her research found that people with so-called testosterone-dominant personalities (highly analytical, competitive and emotionally contained) were often drawn to mates with personalities linked to high estrogen and oxytocin levels \u2014 these individuals tended to be \"empathetic, nurturing, trusting and prosocial, and introspective, seeking meaning and identity,\" Fisher said in 2013. Possessive feelings Those who are deeply in love typically experience sexual desire for their beloved, but there are strong emotional strings attached: The longing for sex is coupled with possessiveness, a desire for sexual exclusivity, and extreme jealousy when the partner is suspected of infidelity. This possessiveness is thought to have evolved so that an in-love person will compel his or her partner to spurn other suitors, thereby insuring that the couple's courtship is not interrupted until conception has occurred. [5 Strange Courting Rituals from Around the World] (Shown here, Prince William and Duchess Catherine after their wedding on April 29, 2011.)  Craving an emotional union While the desire for sexual union is important to people in love, the craving for emotional union takes precedence. A study found that 64 percent of people in love (the same percentage for both sexes) disagreed with the statement, \"Sex is the most important part of my relationship with [my partner].\" Feeling out of control Fisher and her colleagues found that individuals who report being \"in love\" commonly say their passion is involuntary and uncontrollable. For her 1979 book \"Love and Limerence,\" the late psychologist Dorothy Tennov asked 400 men and women in Connecticut to respond to 200 statements on romantic love. Many participants expressed feelings of helplessness, saying their obsession was irrational and involuntary. According to Fisher, one participant, a business executive in his early 50s wrote this about an office crush, \"I am advancing toward the thesis that this attraction for Emily is a kind of biological, instinct-like action that is not under voluntary or logical control. ... It directs me. I try desperately to argue with it, to limit its influence, to channel it (into sex, for example), to deny it, to enjoy it, and, yes, dammit, to make her respond! Even though I know that Emily and I have absolutely no chance of making a life together, the thought of her is an obsession,\" Fisher reported in 2016 online in Nautilus. Losing the spark Unfortunately, being in love usually doesn't last forever. It's an impermanent state that either evolves into a long-term, codependent relationship that psychologists call \"attachment,\" or it dissipates, and the relationship dissolves. If there are physical or social barriers inhibiting partners from seeing one another regularly \u2014 for example, if the relationship is long-distance \u2014 then the \"in love\" phase generally lasts longer than it would otherwise.

            "answer_text": "Oh\u2026to be young again. I remember love\u2026.well, here\u2019s the thing; You are not in love every time you think you are. What people typically mistake for love is either lust or infatuation. The first step is an immediate encounter where the two of you interact. Maybe she\u2019s pretty, she smells nice, or has a cute accent. Maybe she mentions some things that you like or can identify with. For guys, it is often just a pretty girl who talks to you for more than a few minutes. Guys do like appearances at first, but for a relationship, he has to know the woman is going to be there for him, be faithful, get along with his family, and at least try to tolerate his friends. For women (and this is just an observation. I am not a woman, so I don\u2019t know for sure-just based on my experience) it is a man that takes time to notice things other than her boobs, legs, butt, and so on. The man might mention that he likes her perfume, her shoes, the color she is wearing. He might also comment on things that she brings up in conversation. Women like men to notice them, not just for their appearance, but also for their mind, their fashion sense, their dancing skills, and maybe their cooking. At any rate, women can be attractive and friendly, and guys can be attentive and polite. Despite these first impressions, the person could still be totally wrong for you. It\u2019s difficult sometimes when a woman makes you comfortable. She is pretty, she smells good, dresses well; check, check and check, but the clincher is when she sits down and watches football with you and even gripes at the referees over bogus calls. It could also be Star Wars (unlikely, but one can always dream) and she knows all the lines by heart\u2026.or at least she appreciates and is entertained when you demonstrate your acting\u2026errr\u2026mimicking ability. Maybe she sings along with you to your favorite song, or she knows how to cook your favorite dish. With all of this going on, you think it must be love. It just might be\u2026but\u2026you could be a total asshat and love Star Wars or you could be a great person and not really care for it at all\u2026the Force? I don\u2019t get\u2026lol. Anyway, the real way to know if it is real is to pay attention. Does the person park in handicapped spots? Is the person rude to people on the street for no reason. Does the person tip well and is he or she kind to waitstaff? Does the person talk during a movie at the cinema? (at home is okay, but not at the theatre). Basically, is the person a good person. Are they the kind of person you want to be? Do they make you want to be better? Are they supportive of your ideas? Do they take care of you when you are down? Are they loyal, kind, trustworthy and forgiving? Think long and hard about it. I know this sounds like it may be a personal list and maybe not everything applies to you or your situation. The point here is that the person you think you are in love with is a good person who will stick by you. Just remember, sometimes saying \u201cI love you\u201d to someone is a very selfish thing to say. Telling someone that imparts how you feel and expects a reciprocal response. You should never tell someone you love them if you think it will come as a surprise. It should only be an affirmation of the mutual feelings you already have for each other. So how do you know when you are in love? You try to imagine yourself with anyone else and it makes you sad; not so much for yourself as for the person you love. It hurts you to know that the person is in pain, especially over something you have done. When you think about what you want in life, do you automatically think about and allow for what aspirations your prospective partner has? Here is an example; You both like the same soda. The other person is out for a while running errands and there is only one soda in the fridge. What do you do? Why? Another one; You have just had a long day at work and you drive through rush hour traffic for over an hour to get home. You know that the other person will be there. Does it occur to you to stop and get some roses and a bottle of wine (or something else appropriate)? Also, do you let all of the day\u2019s worries, concerns, aggravations, and such fall away before you get home so you can give your best self to that person waiting for you? If you have plans to go out with your family and friends and she has similar plans but had to cancel because she got sick, what do you do then? A person in love (or not in love for that matter) should have no trouble answering each of these questions without guilt or remorse. They are highly subjective. Going one way or another doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. It does show exactly how you feel, though. Oh and do not think of these examples as ways to convince yourself or the other person you are in love. It either is or it isn\u2019t. ",

            "answer_text": "As experts say, being \"in love\" and loving someone unconditionally are two totally different things. So here's how you can tell the difference, according to experts. Being In Love Has A Lot To Do With Brain Chemistry \"Being 'in love' has a lot of different meanings, but it's usually a feeling that's caused by brain chemistry changes that happen in the first one to three years of a relationship and then starts to fade,\" David Bennett, certified counselor and relationship expert, tells Bustle. This, he says, is known as \"puppy love\" or infatuation. During this period, your brain chemistry causes you to ignore red flags in order for you to see your partner in the best possible way. The problem here, however, is it eventually fades unless you both make an effort to keep the spark alive. Unconditional love, on the other hand, is less of a feeling and more of a choice. \"It is choosing to love, commit, and stay with your partner even when the blissful feelings fade,\" Bennett says. \"In fact there is research that shows simply valuing commitment and desiring it is a great predictor of whether a relationship will last.\" In other words, being in love with someone doesn't always mean you're in it for the long haul. When You're In Love, There's Mutual Respect \"Someone that is in love with someone knows exactly what they want and how they want to feel,\" relationship coach and expert, Jenna Ponaman, CPC, tells Bustle. They love themselves enough to know that they're with a partner who can give that love back to them because there's a mutual agreement and respect for one another, she says. Unconditional love, on the other hand, is really great to have, but there is a downside to it if you're not aware. While it can represent a level of devotion one person can have for another, it might also lead to the blurring of boundaries. \"Good boundaries are shown within couples that are in love through that mutual agreement of how they will behave and respond to one another,\" Ponaman says. If you're sacrificing your values, wants, needs, and desires for another person and expect nothing in return because you love them unconditionally, that's not always a good a thing and can possibly lead to resentment. When You're In Love, You Might Hope Your Partner Will Change For The Better When you love someone unconditionally, you accept them as they are, Rappaport says. That means, there's nothing you really would want to change about them. If there is, you've come to the point where you've accepted it because it makes up the person that you love so much. Loving someone unconditionally means accepting both the good and the bad, including vices they may have. When you're in love with someone, you might still hold out hope that your partner will change eventually. And while relationships can help the both of you grow, expecting someone to change completely may not be realistic. When You're In Love, You Might Compare Your Partner To Your Ex Occasionally When you're in love, sometimes you'll find yourself thinking about your ex. There's really no problem with that unless you have some sort of unresolved feelings there. \"If you love someone unconditionally, you don\u2019t compare them to previous partners or want your relationship to be the way it was with someone else,\" Rappaport says. \"You love them just the way they are.\" In other words, loving someone unconditionally means being in the relationship you really want to be in at the current moment. You're not living in the past or comparing. You're content in the moment with the person you're with. When You Love Someone Unconditionally, You Let The Little Things Go Everyone argues at some point. That's just how most relationships are. But when you love your partner unconditionally, you try to argue effectively. \"You realize it is not important to be right or win the argument,\" Rappaport says. \"You work toward resolving things amicably, even if that just means you agree to disagree.\" You're more likely to listen more and comment less. When you're in love with someone, fights can have a way of making you see your partner in a different way. Sometimes, that can cause your happy-in-love feelings to fade. When You Love Someone Unconditionally, You Take Responsibility For Your Actions If you love someone unconditionally, you don't hold on to grudges. There's no blaming or shaming. You have the ability to take responsibility for your actions and words, and your partner should be able to do that as well. \"You also realize that in the vast scheme of life, it really doesn\u2019t matter what they did or didn't do,\" Rappaport says. \"What matters is that you love your partner and you learn to forgive and forget because you know your relationship is more important than getting caught up in things that can ruin it.\" When You Love Someone Unconditionally, They Don't Need To Do Anything To \"Earn\" Your Love Whether or not you actually choose who you fall in love with is debatable. But as we all know, maintaining a relationship takes a lot of work from both parties. Some people end up falling out of love because they're bored or their partner stops caring. According to relationship coaches, Todd and Diana Mitchem, unconditional love doesn't require one partner needing to constantly \"woo\" the other, or vice versa. \"Loving someone unconditionally is 'love given freely,'\" they say. \"Just like the more traditional marriage vows, you are in it for better or worse.\" You just love them regardless of what they say or do. Loving someone unconditionally doesn't mean you see them as a perfect person. It doesn't mean they can hurt you all they want and you'll keep running back to them every single time. According to experts, it's more about your approach to love. Unconditional love tends to be more grounded in reality. As Rappaport says, you can still be in love with someone and be grounded at the same time. \"In this case, you can love someone unconditionally and also be in love with them, too.\" It's all about loving and accepting someone for who they are and making a conscious effort to keep working on your relationship long after the honeymoon period is over. If you can do that, the love you have for your partner is a solid foundation. ",

            "answer_text": "1. \"This one's special\" When you're in love, you begin to think your beloved is unique. The belief is coupled with an inability to feel romantic passion for anyone else. Fisher and her colleagues believe this single-mindedness results from elevated levels of central dopamine \u2014 a chemical involved in attention and focus \u2014 in your brain. 2. \"She's perfect\" People who are truly in love tend to focus on the positive qualities of their beloved, while overlooking his or her negative traits. They also focus on trivial events and objects that remind them of their loved one, day-dreaming about these precious little moments and mementos. This focused attention is also thought to result from elevated levels of central dopamine, as well as a spike in central norepinephrine, a chemical associated with increased memory in the presence of new stimuli. 3. \"I'm a wreck!\" As is well known, falling in love often leads to emotional and physiological instability. You bounce between exhilaration, euphoria, increased energy, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, trembling, a racing heart and accelerated breathing, as well as anxiety, panic and feelings of despair when your relationship suffers even the smallest setback. These mood swings parallel the behavior of drug addicts. And indeed, when in-love people are shown pictures of their loved ones, it fires up the same regions of the brain that activate when a drug addict takes a hit. Being in love, researchers say, is a form of addiction. 4. \"Overcoming the challenge made us closer\" Going through some sort of adversity with another person tends to intensify romantic attraction. Central dopamine may be responsible for this reaction, too, because research shows that when a reward is delayed, dopamine-producing neurons in the mid-brain region become more productive. 5. \"I'm obsessed with him\" People who are in love report that they spend, on average, more than 85 percent of their waking hours musing over their \"love object.\" Intrusive thinking, as this form of obsessive behavior is called, may result from decreased levels of central serotonin in the brain, a condition that has been associated with obsessive behavior previously. (Obsessive-compulsive disorder is treated with serotonin-reuptake inhibitors.) 6. \"I wish we could be together all the time\" People in love regularly exhibit signs of emotional dependency on their relationship, including possessiveness, jealousy, fear of rejection, and separation anxiety. 7. \"I hope we stay together forever\" They also long for emotional union with their beloved, seeking out ways to get closer and day-dreaming about their future together. 8. \"I'd do anything for her\" People who are in love generally feel a powerful sense of empathy toward their beloved, feeling the other person's pain as their own and being willing to sacri?ce anything for the other person. 9. \"Would he like this outfit?\" Falling in love is marked by a tendency to reorder your daily priorities and/or change your clothing, mannerisms, habits or values in order for them to better align with those of your beloved. 10. \"Can we be exclusive?\" Those who are deeply in love typically experience sexual desire for their beloved, but there are strong emotional strings attached: The longing for sex is coupled with possessiveness, a desire for sexual exclusivity, and extreme jealousy when the partner is suspected of infidelity. This possessiveness is thought to have evolved so that an in-love person will compel his or her partner to spurn other suitors, thereby insuring that the couple's courtship is not interrupted until conception has occurred. 11. \"It's not about sex\" While the desire for sexual union is important to people in love, the craving for emotional union takes precedence. A study found that 64 percent of people in love (the same percentage for both sexes) disagreed with the statement, \u201cSex is the most important part of my relationship with [my partner].\" 12. \"I feel out of control\" Fisher and her colleagues found that individuals who report being \"in love\" commonly say their passion is involuntary and uncontrollable. 13. \"The spark is gone\" Unfortunately, being in love usually doesn't last forever. It's an impermanent state that either evolves into a long-term, codependent relationship that psychologists call \"attachment,\" or it dissipates, and the relationship dissolves. If there are physical or social barriers inhibiting partners from seeing one another regularly \u2014 for example, if the relationship is long-distance \u2014 then the \"in love\" phase generally lasts longer than it would otherwise.

            "answer_text": "Falling in love is a wonderful and crazy feeling that\u2019s worth  experiencing at least once in our lives. When you know you are falling  in love, the way you look at the world and experience life can change in  a moment.  Ways to know you're in love with someone:  1. Butterflies in stomach.    For anyone who experiences falling in love it first sight,Or gradually, you can\u2019t really help but experience butterflies in your stomach. It\u2019s a vague sensation of wanting to throw up and trying to get to the loo at the same time. Your stomach starts to perform intricate back flips and the insides of your stomach feel like they\u2019re fluttering. 2.Unexplained happiness When you fall in love, the levels of dopamine in the brain increase due  to the increased blood flow to the regions where the receptors of  dopamine are present. Dopamine, a pleasure chemical, makes you more  excited, energetic and full of life. 3.You can\u2019t think of anyone else  When you\u2019re in love, you can\u2019t really think of anything else but your  lover. They\u2019d be tirelessly running around in your mind and you can\u2019t  work, remember things or focus on other interests. 4.You get depressed easily Do you get upset easily if the person you like upsets you in any  manner? The drop in the serotonin  makes you depressed and anxious. Even the smallest of things can upset you or your lover, and both of  you may end up spending a lot of time trying to please each other with  little acts of love and affection. While each act of love increases the  love and attraction, each disappointment makes you more vulnerable to  pain and depression.   How to know if you are in love  Falling in love is like a drug, and unfortunately, just like a drug,  it doesn\u2019t really last forever. While the levels of chemicals like  dopamine and serotonin gradually come back to normal after a few months  or years depending on the type of relationship, it\u2019s up to the lovers to  find ways to keep the excitement in love alive.Every time you have a crush on someone, the whole game of chemistry  in love starts firing the Bunsen burners and we\u2019re back to square one  all over again.    Tips  If you like them, you will blush and feel embarrassed around them.  If you really like them or love them, you will feel self-conscious, yet  comfortable around them. Your heart may pound very fast, you may be blushing or be excited  and nervous. Remember to have patience in love. Timing is everything. They make you get a surge of happiness or excitement, but most importantly they inspire you to be the best you even if they don't return the love. When you're in love, you constantly try to look for them or search for them.Don't rush love! Find someone perfect for you. Don't force yourself  to \"love\" somebody just because they're popular, or you think you  should. If you can't say their name without smiling, you might be in love. If  just the sight of them brings a smile to your face and makes you  excited, then you probably love them. Especially if just thinking of  them makes you happier. When you're listening to love songs and you think about \"that special person\", it may be a sign that you are in love. When you're in love and you see him/her, you might feel a sudden shock in your heart and your heart might beat faster. If you would be willing to wait for someone or stay in a certain area for a long period of time, then it's probably love.  ",

            "answer_text": "Well as the question is asked without mentioning any specific gender (male or a female), so I would try to put forward few of my views/opinion about both of them. If a girl loves a boy: Love is a very beautiful yet a very weird emotion. When a woman is in love with a man, no matter how mature, sensible or in control of her life she is, one will be able to always observe a few differences or changes in her personality which would indicate that she is madly and deeply in love with a guy/man. Usually shy behaviour: It is quite a common feeling to have those butterflies fluttering around in your stomach when you are around the one you love. Women, being the more sensitive ones, tend to handle such a sensation differently. When a woman is around a man that she is deeply in love with, people around her start to notice a few changes in her. Those changes in her mainly highlight the enhanced feminine qualities of the woman. People would observe that the woman starts to get shy over small things, such as communicating directly with the one she loves, hesitating to make direct eye contact, rigid body postures and so forth.Giving her man a present: The exchange of presents is considered as a gesture of love and care If a woman is in love with a man, she would buy presents for him without any reason. Usually, we buy presents for our loved ones on their birthdays or anniversaries, but in this case the woman would buy gifts without any proper reason. It is a really good indication of her love for that man. But on the contrary, few girls also likes to give presents to their friends too, so it's your duty to distinguish between that thin line to understand if you are the guy that she in love with or the \u201cjust friend\u201d.Acting childish infront of the man she loves: A woman may start to behave childish around the man she loves because she would believe that she can be cute around him. Childish behavior mostly indicates cuteness. She will try to woe him by her innocent actions and words, but know that her intentions are highly pure and acting innocent just shows a glimpse of her deeper feelings for you, isn't it!Starts the conversation: Women mostly do not like being the one to start a conversation nothing personal though. Some men do not realize that when a woman initiates a conversation many times with him whether it is on cellphone or in real life, it means that she is interested and probably in love with him. Of course, this indication does not prove that the woman is in love with the man on its own but in fact different combinations of indications prove love. Therefore, this one can be a really strong indication if there are other signs as well. So every man should know that it takes a lot of courage for a woman to start a conversation and if a woman does then they should acknowledge it and appreciate it. And ultimately it's a sign that she in love with you dude!Tries to impress the man physically: She would try to enhance her good features so that the man would notice them and like her. It is all but natural for a woman to want to make the man like her if she is in love with him. She would not necessarily dress up too much to make him notice her, but just enough so. Looking good for the one they love also gives them a higher sense of purpose, something that would make the one they love notice them more than before. And can we blame them? Love makes us do crazy things after all, doesn\u2019t it?Gets shy when maintaining an eye contact: They say only two kinds of people are unable to make eye contact with you: those trying to hide a lie and those trying to hide a love. For women, the latter case seems to be the more common one. If a woman is in love with a man then while maintaining an eye contact with that man the man would notice that she would get shy or try to look away.Pays a lot of attention to the needs and wants of the man: If a woman is deeply in love with a man, then she would pay a lot of attention to all his needs and she would make sure that he gets what he wants. She would try her best to please him in every possible manner. One can sort of relate it to the care that a mother would give to her child, because she wants to keep the child happy and pleased. Same goes for a woman who is deeply in love.And this list will just go on and on and on. If a boy loves a girl: The way he looks at you: He looks at you like you are an unicorn, like he can\u2019t believe you exist. He may even come right out and tell you, \u201cI can\u2019t believe someone like you exists.\u201d It isn\u2019t a look of lust and desire. Instead, it\u2019s marked by a certain awe, serenity, and inner calm. It\u2019s a look reserved only for you. It\u2019s not only the way he looks at you; it\u2019s the frequency. He can\u2019t stop looking at you; whether you\u2019re together or across the room from each other, his gaze will always be oriented towards you.He always wants to give you: When you love someone, you want to give that person everything you have. This isn\u2019t about material possessions. You want to give by being the best you can, you want to make them happy, to enhance their life, you want to do things for them that will make them happy. And this act of giving can be anything even, time, respect, care, love, gifts, kindness and everything that truly matters when two people are in love with each other or atleast the one who is in love with someone.He gives you a priority: Everyone is busy; we all have work or studies or office or other commitments. When a man loves you, he will make spending time with you a priority. And if he really doesn\u2019t have time, he\u2019ll make sure to let you know when he will be free.He really sees you: He notices things about you that others don\u2019t (maybe he even sees things that you don\u2019t!) He notices how you interact with others, how people feel in your presence, how your mind works, how you process emotions, how you express yourself. He pays attention to all the little details and he remembers them. He appreciates both the sides of you, the good and the bad as well.Your happiness is also important to him: Your happiness may be even more important! When you love someone, really love someone, their happiness is your happiness. This is especially true for men who need to feel like they can make a woman happy. If you tell him that something makes you unhappy and he keeps doing it, this is not a sign that he\u2019s in love with you. A man who loves you will avoid doing things that make you unhappy and will learn the things will make you happy.He misses you: Men typically fall in love in a woman\u2019s absence, not her presence. A man can shower you with all the love in the world while he\u2019s with you, because it\u2019s nice to be with someone else and to connect and be affectionate, but what is he like when he\u2019s not with you? Does he miss you? Does he make an effort to reach out? Or does he disappear for days on end and then tell you he\u2019s sorry, he\u2019s just been \u201csuper swamped?\u201d well, figure it out!You don't worry how he feels, you just know: When someone truly loves you, his behavior and way of being with you won\u2019t arouse feelings of insecurity/fear/anxiety/worry in you (as long as you yourself are emotionally healthy. If you\u2019re prone to having those feelings no matter what, then they are probably generated within you). Check in with yourself and see where it\u2019s coming from. Usually, when we feel uneasy, like the rug is going to be pulled out from under us, it\u2019s because the relationship isn\u2019t standing on a stable ground because the guy isn\u2019t sure of how he feels. When someone loves you, he shows it and you just know it, even before he says it.And again the lost will go on and on and on. So basically, if a person is in love with you, then it's all about the actions that we can see from that other person and undoubtedly we can get to know what this is all about! Note: These are my personal opinions and yes I have taken some content from the internet as well but I have merged few things or cut down some, so I'm open for the suggestions or the edits. Hope this answers the question! Nadeem \u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "You can be rest assured that you are truly in love with the person if you can get up each day and despite the fact that you might have been going not speaking for a few days, or going through a Rocky patch or quarriling like cat's and dogs to the point of wanting to wrap your hands around their jugular the next time they cleared their throat and made that same sound which has somehow, after years into going unnoticed, suddenly started to tug on your last nerve!! If you can still wake up and choose to do better, work it out, make a stronger effort, decide to never give up on them and what you two share, then and with a lot more signs, you are safely able to declare the fact that you have love, true love. That giddy, butterfly in your tummy, face flushing, heart pounding feeling like a roller coaster at the top of the first dead drop in the seconds before the mechanism releases the carts aythe feeling of loosing your stomach\u2026except without the roller coaster ride and much more intense, ESPECIALLY depending on the time, place, or event!! You know you're in love, when you have just been informed of some amazing news and the only person who you really really want and need to tell is them!! The bad news too\ud83e\udd74\u2026who else could you think of going to with the weight of the world on your shoulders, teary eyed and sad beyond belief?\u2026. Of course the person who you love is the one who you are going to want to run to\u2026 to both share in your excitement and cheer, and wipe away your tears, while providing you with comfort, the kind of comfort that only the one person would be able to provide you with the relief and soothing you are after!! You know you are in love when you are still just as shy and nervous as you were back in the beginning, the fact that you have been together forever adds familiarity and comfort with an added security of trust and respect, however this is your love and the butterflies return every time you get to be with them in that close intimate and exciting scenario. You can rest assured that you are in love with the person if they are not only always there for you, but you can both count on the other to drop everything and be able to get there for each other no matter what!! It's a different way than that of your parents or friends even\u2026. you are not scared and nervous as you might imagine what you are like as you call your parents to pick you up from jail at 2am with a DUI charge\u2026nor feeling like a loser and degenerate calling for a friend to help with the same ride, feeling the judgment and knowing that you are not only going to be looked at differently by your so called friends, they are going to be able to get the news around pretty fast and sure enough it was your trust and belief in the friendship you have misconstrued!! BUT your person will keep your secrets, he or she will be able to understand the inner most driving emotions, the fact that your friends are your\u201dbest friends\u201d since first grade and the whole friendship is a solid and supporting role\u2026..IS NOTHING compared to the bond you share with the person who you love and who loves you back!! They are going to keep your deepest darkest secrets\u2026and then also being so understanding and patient with helping you work out all the struggles and difficult issues life is filled with!! You know what you want when you are done with a long day of doing absolutely everything you DON'T really want to be doing, a lot of work, school, job, meetings, chores, appointments, etc\u2026. after the whole day of non stop traveling hours back and forth\u2026busy grueling and mind numbing events come to an end and the day has long been over, now early morning and dark, you are absolutely spent\u2026.so exhausted, such that just being able to get to your bed and pass out is the only one thing that you have left energy wise to get your body to do, except for the fact that you are not able to sleep without a kiss and hug and talk with your love\u2026. even if you can not make it to the door, the fact that you have your person who is waiting on you to see if you have made it home safe or if they have waited up in bed with an excited longing to be close to them after being apart the entire day\u2026. you are surprised to discover the second wind you obtain as the picture of the love of your life enters your mind, the embrace alone in reuniting after the day apart\u2026.a huh and kiss you just can't miss for the world!! You can be sure you are in love when you are not clueless about the person's flaws, in fact it is an obvious hinderence and blessing in the relationship\u2026from both parties, yet the only thing that would explain why you are not booking it far away as you can get is simple\u2026. Love is the one \u201csuper power\u201d that sees through the flawed broken and full of scars beautiful soul that is the person who in their entirety, makes up the encompassing good, bad, exciting, smart, silly, dangerous, thrilling, sneaky, cuddly, sexy, beautiful, funny and all knowing person who is the perfect person for you!! The flaws add to the charm and the fact that they aren't perfect is exactly what makes you both click, without a tiny portion ( the stuff everyone everywhere struggles with in one way or another, if you dump Jenny because she is too bossy and demanding and angry at times, don't expect you are going to be finding the next girl Kristen without a bout of serious bipolar and depression) everything is give and take, and everyone is flawed!! the entire make up of this amazing love you have found is only a part of the negative mixed in with the other great qualities\u2026the fact that you are able to connect with the other and the commitment to take the good and the bad in stride, determined to make the best of it as much as you can and the fact that you love each other means the efforts are not a chore\u2026the fact that you are going through a lot together and have made the decision to go to whatever lengths possible, is the exact definition of love and more straight to the point!!\u2026. You know when you are in love when you are happiest when you are laying down in the lap of the person you can not get enough of\u2026they're stroking your hair and you are both discussing your days or plans comming up or even better yet\u2026YOU SIT IN TOTAL SILENCE!! And not an ounce of discomfort or forced silence filler talk, not a word need be uttered, because in that moment, the both of you are confident in the space which stood silent, yet screaming with the enormous amount of passion and care and lust and respect and need and contentment and happiness and joy and safety and security, the feeling of the two of you melting into one another on the couch, the long day behind them, hearing everything the other is feeling without a sound but their breathing in unison and the heart beats pulsating from the other parts where their bodies met\u2026. it's a very difficult atmosphere and super indescribable feeling to articulate\u2026but you are going to be able to make a 100% accurate deduction of being in love when you have experienced the serenity and peaceful bliss that comes with the safe loving embrace of the person who is the one that completes your world, who you know you can live without but would never ever want to go through life without!! \u2026\u2026.\ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude48Despite the fact that they might be secretly trying to kill you \ud83e\uddd0\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude02\u2026.

            "answer_text": "Its that crazy feeling. Watching them do anything just makes you happy. You notice things about them that just make you want them so much. Tiny little things that nobody would notice are just melting your heart. Ima just give an example here cuz yea but I remember what she was wearing the first day we met cuz it was just this weird feeling I got like I can\u2019t explain it. I remember she asked me to hold something for her and could not get words to come out. It was crazy. Im a talkative person so when some is talking to me and im just awe struck like cant even talk its weird. I remember she started hanging out with us and I would notice all the little things she did and I would try to keep my cool you know. I was trying to be suave but it was not working. I had dreams bout me and her. Everything she did was like something that I would notice. If she was cold it was like ill freeze have my hoodie. This was like the first time I had fallen for someone really hard you know. Seeing her wear my hoodie was like daaaamn I want you. She played soccer and when the team would leave for the games I would be in weight training 5th period so I would like wait outside and pretend to be messing around with a weight ball with my friend just to see her. She was the goalie just like crazy stuff that doesn't really matter were like gifts from God to me. She would leave for games and whenever she hugged me I would just feel my heart accelerate. I would like have these thoughtful things to say to try and ask her out but like when they came out instead of saying the stuff I meant to say I would be like \u201cWords Words, you me, words words, eat, words, book, words, movie\u201d It was terrible I could not function. Whenever she wore my hoodies they would come back smelling like vanilla and it just drove me crazy it was like I could not get her out my head. Im not a jealous guy but like whenever she would talk to other guys in my head I would be like telling myself she prolly likes this dude I should just give up but I wouldn't show it so I was like having these internal battles in my head. She would always wear this jade necklace and she would alwyas put the chain in her mouth and that would make my heart just speed up like im smoking in the bathroom and I hear key jangling walking in. And she would like do this thing where she would be looking down and she would have the chain in her mouth but like when we\u2019de come over she would like look up while still looking down so it was like she would lift her head up a little and her eyes would look at you but most of her head was down. God that would get me every time; it was like they were walking in with the key jangling, the walkie talkie went off and I just blew out a major cloud. I had a dream that we were just lying down next to each other and that was it just lying down in the grass holding hands. woke up and I was so mad that I had to wake up but it was like happy too because that\u2019s an awesome dream. Her soccer uniform just made her like so hot. She never wears makeup, and shes like super smart. She was just like nothing I ever even considered before totally different. She would smile and that was like the light of my world. It was crazy. I stopped smoking just cuz she suggested it. I was like so deep into it I would jump off a bridge to make her smile. I knew I was in love when she left. I had been working up the courage to ask her out all week and I finally had enough to go up to her and ask her but she was never their. I don\u2019t even know what happened It wasn\u2019t like she was avoiding me but it was like she was avoiding the whole friend group. She just never wanted to talk to any of us and it just destroyed me. I had this dream that someone told her some shit about me that was like super old; just dumb shit that I did in the past and she just left. So it was like terrible. i remember my hoodie still smelled like her and I wouldn't wear it cuz I didn't want the smell to fade. I gave up on everything. I bought a bunch of weed and carts and just let myself go. I would show up blazed off my mind to school. And I would see her sometimes and I was always wondering why. I was so out of it one time that I could barely see i was sitting at a bench and I see someone walking by in the distance and im like dammmn who\u2019s that she just looks so different and confident. My friends were just staring at me like \u201cbru thats mani\u201d And I was just not feeling anything. I still feel like that but im trying not to let it get to me Ive stopped smoking for awhile now and Im trying to just talk to new people but in the back of my head she\u2019s always their and I know as soon as quarantine is over and I see her again im just going to be right back at square one. listening to my music tuning out everyone just trying to get by.

            "answer_text": "1. You talk about things you'll do together in the future, without realizing you're talking about the future. It's not weird to talk about that concert that's in three months or the trip you want to take to the beach this summer around him, because he'll be around to go with you. 2. When you say, \"I miss you,\" it's because you really do miss him after only a day apart. It's not just a cute thing to say, it's a real ache that says he's a part of your life now. 3. You can't remember the last time you thought about your ex. Things with your guy now are so good you can't be bothered with whatever's in the past. 4. Things you usually hate seem OK \u2014 and even fun \u2014 if you're doing them with him. Riding a roller coaster you're terrified of? Fine, as long as he holds your hand and promises not to laugh at how you scream. 5. You're comfortable with making little sacrifices for him. You wouldn't put off your responsibilities for him, but if he's sick and needs you to help take care of him instead of going to brunch one morning, you're totally cool with that. 6. He's the \"something good\" you think about when everything else is really rough. Work is driving you crazy, but at least you've got him to cheer you up when you get home. 7. You feel safe when you're around him. It's hard to describe this feeling, but it really is the best thing in the world. Like nothing bad can happen. 8. You're comfortable enough around him to make bad jokes and be your fully weird self. You might've been trying to impress him before, but now you're cool to hum around the kitchen and wear your pants tucked into your socks when he comes over. 9. You keep seeing things out in public that you know he'd love. Stuff you used to walk by every day suddenly has David's name all over it. 10. He's your person. When something really good or really bad happens, he's who you go to first. 11. You're not worried about \"scaring him off.\" You're comfortable enough to cry in front of him or show him huge, slightly embarrassing collection of Beanie Babies (that you swear could be worth a fortune one day), because you feel secure that he's not going anywhere at the drop of a hat. 12. Little things, like going to the grocery store, are better when he's around. A walk down the cereal aisle can be a very romantic date if you're with the right person. 13. He annoys the hell out of you, but you still want to be around him. \"I love you, but I don't like you right now,\" is something you're almost ready to say. 14. You don't freak out if he doesn't text back right away. All that \"does he like me back\" anxiety is gone, and you finally have enough chill to be OK with his slow texting. 15. When he's sad, you're genuinely sad too. You feel his pain and he feels yours. 16. You're actually entertained by his cute AF childhood photos. And you actually like listening to his long, rambly stories. Just hanging out and talking about anything is fun. 17. You'd rather stay in and do nothing with him than go out. \"Started staying in and going out less\" is your new mantra, and it's totally OK with you. 18. You want to show him all of your favorite things. Not because you want them to be his favorite things too, but because you want him to know you better than anyone else. 19. You have to restrain yourself from talking about him with your friends all the time. If you could you'd gush about this guy constantly. But out of respect for your friends and their sanity, you hold back (a little). 20. You've started thinking about introducing him to your family. Because you genuinely want to know how he fits in around them. 21. You regularly catch yourself doing deep dives of his Instagram. And the best part is you aren't even scared of accidentally liking a photo, because you're past the point of feeling like you'll freak him TF out if you do. 22. You want to do things you've already done again so he can be there with you this time. Time to take a return trip to the Grand Canyon so you can kiss while the sun goes down and not care how cute or gross you look \u2014 you're in love, dammit! And you don't care who knows. ",

            "answer_text": "There is one person out there who has the ability to make you feel some emotions you have never experienced before with anyone else. Love cannot be just a perfect road without any flaws\u2014but the day you cross the path of a specific someone, you feel like it's a no-brainer. You feel like it because of the effect they have on you. 1. Haaaappiness & Tiramisu That person makes you feel a bunch of pleasant feelings. They make you feel like you don't have to worry about anything, and it feels good. You are just peaceful and comfortable when they stand next to you. They make you laugh, and somehow, they make you feel blessed. Blessed because you know deep, deep down, you are the lucky one who gets the chance to bond a unique relationship with them simply because they agreed on letting you in on their world.  2. A story with Super Heroes That someone is neither Captain America nor Captain Marvel\u2014and they are perfectly aware of that\u2014but you can\u2019t help feeling safe with them. On top of that, you feel comfortable in your relationship and your trust it. 3. No questions asked You are not scared of thinking about the future and including them in it. You don't wonder if that person will still be close to you in months and years because you peacefully feel like you don't need to wonder. 4. Cui-cui-cui, les oiseaux chantent (=birds are singing) You think of that person as being special because not only do they make you feel special, but they are, in reality, exceptional (most of the time.) You appreciate that someone for who they are. They have flaws, of course, like anybody else, but your thought about that is nothing else than: \u2013\u2013\u2013 (I let you complete that part.)  5. Dys-Dys-Dysfonctionality When thinking of that person, your brain doesn't function the same way. Your mind experiences an unlimited number of ideas and dreams, your words are meaningful, your feelings are intense, your adoration has no limits, your sweetness is pure, your honesty is genuine (and you might have the feeling you lost some neurons.) You do feel confident about being yourself, and you feel at ease with that person. 6. Extreme curiosity You observe that someone. You may stop doing whatever you are doing at a specific moment just to look at them, and you do not get tired of doing it because you simply adore that human being you are looking at\u2014you just don't do it in a creepy way. What others think of you? You don't care that much, but you definitely pay attention to the way that particular person can see you.  7. Confidence pour confidence You trust them. You may not be able to give a reason for that, so, how come? Simply because your gut tells you so, and it is never wrong (or rarely at very least.) You don't have time to be angry toward that person. Do not get me wrong here; I am not saying you never pick a fight, you are mad sometimes, of course\u2014you are a human being after all\u2014but it does not last more than a few minutes\u2013or a few hours if you are really, really, mad (but in that case, calm down, think clearly and open up the topic. Your anger will vanish.) 8. Et \u00e7a continue encore et encore (=And it keeps going over and over again) You love, you genuinely love, and you never stop. You are here and there for the others, but most importantly, you are here and there for that person. You care for any relationships you have with anyone close to you, but the one you share with that person is one of your favorite ones.  9. The reality of that game You don't need to play any mind games, be dishonest about your feelings, try any kind of manipulation or try to have any kind of freaking control. Everything sounds all natural. And if not, better to reconsider what you are doing. \"What if\" doesn't exist with that someone\u2013or if you come up to use it sometimes, it doesn't last because you fight for what you deeply wish with them and you dare to live new adventures. You are aware that life is short and you know you don't want to waste your relationship with them. However, you don't rush anything either. You try your best to make sure both of you feel at ease and happy together, even if you know you are two independent people in the first place. 10. Click-click-click-click That particular person does not need to try being a light, that is just who they are, and you see them this way. As a matter of fact, you would better be with someone you feel happy to spend time with and who has the ability to blow your mind... in a positive way, of course-but anyone do whatever they want.  Anyway, yes, you love that person to the point that you try to think before saying anything hurtful, or painful, or regretful (OK, mostly \u2013 you are human after all.) But you keep in mind that you should not take anything for granted, especially not that particular person. Bazinga, ",

            "answer_text": "Knowing you're in love feels different for everyone. Some have been in love often and know the feeling well, and others may be not so sure if it's love or just a deep infatuation. Luckily, your body has some pretty sneaky ways of tipping you off to whether these feelings for your partner are more than just a passing phase. Keep an eye out for these tell-tale signs the next time you catch yourself wondering if you're actually in love. \u2026. You can't stop staring at them\u2026 If your partner has ever caught you staring at them lovingly, it could be a sign that you're head over heels. Eye contact means that you're fixated on something, so if you find that your eyes are fixed on your partner, you may just be falling in love .Studies have also found that couples who lock eyes report feeling a stronger romantic connection than those who don't. It goes the other way too: when a study had strangers lock eyes for minutes at a time, they reported romantic feeling towards each other\u2026.. You feel like you're high__ It's completely normal to feel out of your mind when falling for someone. A study from the Kinsey Institute found that the brain of a person falling in love looks the same as the brain of a person who has taken cocaine. You can thank dopamine, which is released in both instances, for that feeling. This is a good explanation for why people in new relationships can act absolutely nonsensically\u2026. You always think about them If you love someone, you may feel like you can't get them off of your mind. That's because your brain releases phenylethylamine, aka the \u201clove drug\u201d when you fall in love with someone. This hormone creates the feeling of infatuation with your partner. You may be familiar with the feeling because phenylethylamine is also found in chocolate, which may explain why you can't stop after just one square\u2026 You want them to be happy Love is an equal partnership, but you'll find someone's happiness becomes really important to you when you're falling for them. So-called \u201ccompassionate love\u201d can be one of the biggest signs of a healthy relationship, according to research. This means that you're willing to go out of your way to make your partner's life easier and happier. If you find yourself going out of your way to keep your partner dry when walking in the rain or making them breakfast on a busy weekday morning, it's a sign you've got it bad.. You don't feel pain as strongly\u2026 Falling for someone might be painful, but if you've noticed that literally falling doesn't bother you as much anymore, it could be a big sign you're in love. A study conducted by the Stanford University School of Medicine had participants stare at a photo of someone they loved and found that act could reduce moderate pain by up to 40%, and reduced severe pain by up to 15%. So if you're getting a tattoo, you may want to keep a photo of your partner handy. Just in case. You're trying new things.. Everyone wants to impress their date in the beginning of their relationships, but if you find yourself consistently trying new things that your partner enjoys, you may have been bitten by the love bug. In fact, a study found that people who have claimed to be in love often had varied interest and personality traits after those relationships. So even if you hate that square-dancing class you're going to with your partner, it could have a positive effect on your personality. Your heart rate synchronizes with theirs\u2026 Your heart may skip a beat when you think about the one you love, but a study showed that you may also be beating in time with each other. A study conducted by the University of California, Davis, suggests that couples' hearts begin to beat at the same rate when they fall in love. Although you may not be able to tell if this has happened without a few stethoscopes, feeling a deep connection to your partner is a good a sign as any that you're in love. You're OK with the gross stuff.. If you're a notorious germaphobe and totally cool kissing your partner after just watching them pick their nose, you might just be in love. In fact, a study by the University of Groningen in the Netherlands found that feelings of sexual arousal can override feelings of being grossed out. So that means if you're super attracted to your partner, you may just let them double dip. That's love, baby.;) You get sweatier.. If you're nauseous and sweaty, you either have a bad stomach bug or are falling in love. A study found that falling in love can cause you to feel sick and display physical symptoms similar to that of anxiety or stress, like sweat. Although this feeling will probably pass once you really get comfortable with your partner, it may be a good idea to carry around an extra hanky, just to be safe. You love their quirks\u200b.. If you really get to know a person, chances are you'll pick on the little things that make them uniquely them. And if you're in love with them, these are probably some of the things that attract you most about them. A study found that small quirks can actually make a person fall deeper in love with someone rather than just physical attributes because people have unique preferences. So although you may have judged your partner a little harshly on first glance, if you find that you're suddenly in awe of their uniqueness, you might be in love\u273f)  ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously, as with any guy, it starts with physical appearance. I notice you as an attractive being and decide I want to meet you. As far as physical features, don\u2019t assume the worst ladies, as many internet posts have said and many real people, generally it\u2019s the face and especially eyes that I notice, but really any face. Then it\u2019s the smile and or laugh. From that point forward it\u2019s about personality. I think that what can get me often times is the shock that my assumption of what they are like. For instance, I met a girl that by anyone\u2019s standards was drop dead gorgeous, so I assumed, not just based on this but other things to, that she might be a \u201cmean girl.\u201d But when I met her, I was completely caught off guard by her genuine humbleness and authenticity towards me and everybody. So side note for traits, I like humble attitudes and a genuine personality. The next thing I look for, partly because I\u2019m not a talker, is someone who can carry on a conversation. But even more than that, I look for someone who I can connect to. I am not a person who just likes talking about sports and girls all day, I need a conversation that has sustenance of sorts, something deep or beneficial. Part of this is looking at similar interests of course, but just feeling like this is someone you could get to know is great. Beyond getting caught by surprise, I like girls who are straight forward, secure in who they are, can handle criticism, has emotional intelligence, tells me when I\u2019m wrong, likes making plans (more of a preference because I don\u2019t like to make plans), has similar interests that are mutually beneficial such as physical health or instruments, is encouraging\u2026 I feel like the list is getting long so I won\u2019t go on, but I could. So when girls exhibit these traits and we connect on a personal level, I begin to feel like I\u2019m falling in love. But usually it isn\u2019t as we are talking, I\u2019ll generally be at home reliving the day and then say, \u201c wow, I really enjoyed ____, I would like doing that again\u201d and as I continue to lay there I can\u2019t get them out of my head, sometimes even a week later it\u2019ll hit me. The moment I realize I can\u2019t stop thinking about a certain girl is when I decide I\u2019m in love. But honestly the more I type this the more I feel like it is just my personal choice of when I decide to be in love, not something I can\u2019t help but feel, so when I decide to is when i feel I\u2019m falling in love.

            "answer_text": "Falling in love is such a pleasurable thing, the tell-tale signs are not easily missed because they take over your life for as long as the feeling lasts. They permeate every activity, they define one's actions and appear to take on a vibrant life of their own. There is no greater feeling than being in love, because that is strongly connected to one's feeling of self worth and acceptance, which makes it one of the happiest moment's of a person's life. The most obvious signs of love in the air are most evident in seven major areas of behaviour, especially the fist three: 1. Constant Loving Thoughts When we are in love, we cannot stop thinking about that person. We spend a lot of time imagining what we did with them (like that first kiss, or the way we met) and that is relived over and over; fantasising about spending time with them, and constantly wondering what they are doing while smiling to ourselves like Cheshire cats who got the cream! It is really difficult not to think about the loved one mainly because they make us feel happy; they make us want to shout out loudly from the rooftops, to tell the world how we feel, and they give us a quiet sense of satisfaction and self reinforcement in being loved, desired and wanted. 2. Increased Communication and Interest This is a time when the desire to communicate with the loved one is strongest. We tend to become more expressive and open. There will be lots of phone calls, visits and/or texts/emails between the parties. There will be dialogue around the most insignificant things. There will also be playfulness, teasing, expressions of endearment, tons of questions, and plans about the future, especially regarding sharing activities. In fact, it will be non-stop communication around the things that matter, coupled with an insatiable mutual interest in the lives of both parties. Everything, no matter how trivial, will assume importance and significance to maintain that connection and dialogue. This is because the very act of communicating is both enjoyable and self-reinforcing so both parties try to get even more of it. 3. Desire to Please Love gives us a strong desire to please. At such times we would go to the ends of the earth for the person we love. Nothing seems too difficult or challenging because we are trying to impress, to be given the seal of approval. In fact, we would even take up hobbies we do not like, if the other person is doing them, just to show how much we care about them and to gain their approval! When we love someone we want to make them notice us and to keep that loving feeling going as long as possible. This is where we are at our most compliant and amenable. It also explains why many people can be taken advantage of during these heady, vulnerable times. The most definite sign o falling in love is when that person begins to occupy your thoughts, even when you don't make any conscious effort to think about them. It is really about feeling good vibes towards her/him in a warm, comfortable way; a way you wouldn't feel about anyone else.  ",

            "answer_text": "How can you tell that you are truly in love with someone? Simple answer, Sexual interest is not one of the first reasons you are pursuing that individual. There is a fine line when guys hook up with girls. Because they are sexually attracted the girl. (sole purpose of just wanting sex nothing more).They love her beauty and personality. ( present infatuation of the entire persons physical and personality traits. (In most cases 75% of the time her face is the most attractive feature to you, 25% is her personality, no other physical body feature bothers you or interests you aside from her facial beauty.I hope i am making sense. Let me try to rephrase myself, when you are truly in love with a person sex is the last thing on your mind, you are so in love that you almost do not want to have sex. (Let me continue explaining before you jump to conclusions.) To know that you are truly in love. When you constantly think about the person you love and how you are thinking of the steps to be in a partnership with themWhen you strive to become a better person and improve your physical and mental appearance solely for the person you are in love with. (becoming a better person).When everytime you see that person you choke up or become nauseous from anxiety.When you cannot sleep or focus because you are complelty focused on that person.Probably the most prominent give away that you are in love with them. When the persons beauty is so stunning that you cannot even remember what their face looks like, you can only see their beauty in person. Many of the crushes I have had in the past had a face I had a very difficult time recollecting mentally. Its funny because I would say to myself \u201cI\u2019m in love with that girl, but I dont even remember what she looks like\u201d? Haha. I dont really know why this happens, the best logical answer I could give you is that when you see your crush you get stressed both mentally and physically, and somehow your memory blacks out for a moment. Another explanation could be that you dont want your crush to catch you looking at her. Your mind knows you shouldn't be looking at her but you want to, two conflicting pathways of the brain causes you to have a very poor image receptor I think.Its difficult to be yourself around them or you instantly feel self conscious when you see them. (elaboration) I want to give some advice to whoever has trouble with being themselves or becomes self concious either in public or around their crush. You have to realize that your best self is when you are being yourself. Think about it , try to remember when you are being yourself, were you with friends? family? co-workers? Do you remember how cool you were being? You talked with confidence, you were happy and outgoing, you were knowledgable, intellegent, and interactive as well as engaging. In other words, when you are yourself you are being \u201cnatural\u201d. Your best self is being yourself, If you are trying to be someone youre not or faking your personality you are making it harder on yourself. People can tell when you are faking it ,and it exposes insecurity. It also makes friends and dates around you feel uncomforatble.STOP IT. I know its easier said than done but it takes time. Ever see average looking guy pick up a gorgeous woman? Most people think goldigger or something. In reality the guy just said FUCK IT IM GONNA BE MYSELF AND JUST TRY TO GET A GIRLFRIEND, I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE, MAYBE I WILL GET LUCKY. They play by the simple laws of nature and win big. I know I said alot about looks and attraction, but a good quality original personality is just invaluable. Again being yourself means being \u201cnormal\u201d mentally healthy. I consider myself a good looking guy, but my personality is unaturally quiet, introverted and serious due to my insecurities, My normal personality is laid back and outgoing without even trying (some people said I had way too much confidence when I was younger). in the beginning I had zero friends and little luck with dating due to this reserved nature of my personality, I started to not give a fuck and slowly open up to people. To say the least I saw results in a near instant. The law of attraction is real.These are a few quick ways to tell that you are truly in love with someone. Now as for the sex part, if you are truly in love with someone you both take the initiative not even to mention sex until it happens naturally , not a one night stand, not a friends with benefit but only naturally by true love. In most cases after having sex , the female feels more connected to the guy , but the guy feels like he wants to run away (this is a natural hormonal response.) If he truly loves the girl he wont dump . (obviously lol) True love sex is so much more fulfilling than cheap uninvolved sex. Alot of players and posers will get angry at my answer because they know its true. It really bad morally but also mentally and hormonally to have multiple sex partners. Sex is meant as a bonding tool so that both parents will have enough love and respect for one another so that they will stick together to raise their offspring (child) in a loving environment. Thats what sex\u2019s sole purpose is really. Has it been abused? Of course for personal gain. In this day and age its is being seen as more and more acceptable to have multiple sex partners even inside of marriage, but whatever people are free to do what they want. Personally I believe it should wait till marriage because you have enough trust to expose yourself and engage in such a intimate act such as sex because you are \u201cin love\u201d with one another. DISCLAIMER: Yes i know we as humans are naturally attracted by sexual traits by nature but there is definitely a fine line between where you are with a person for sex or because you truly want to be in a partnership with that individual ",

            "answer_text": "There is a saying: You know you are deeply in love when you're not thinking about sex with the man. You will think about sex when you are in love, but first and foremost you know it from these signs. You know you are in love if you're sitting in a cafe and you know you only have a short time to tell him something sweet before you both leave (and you don't know if and when you you meet again), and you cannot yet tell him that you've in love with him. You know this moment will feed your memories for however long you'll be apart. So you're looking into his eyes, your eyes are locked and you say \u201chmm, your eyes are green\" and you both have a chit chat about the colour of your eyes. You slightly ache inside, because you know this moment may never come again and you are silently saying \u201cI love you.\u201d You know you are in love, if you put on your headphones, because you mirror him (you know he loves music) and want to be close to him when you walk in the street without him. You're listening to the beats and the world around you blossoms as you walk, because he walks there with you, even though not physically. You know you are in love, when the love for him flows out of you, and through like a warm golden stream, whether you think of him or not (you mostly do) and goes out to every human being, animal, tree and flower, everything alive and all you touch. Real love transcends beyond the two of you. You know you are in love, when he smiles, his neglected yellow teeth show up, and you're strangely glad that they are part of him and you'd love to kiss them. Over and over. All other 'flaws' are so sweet to you, that you cherish them as the best parts of him, like a precious quartz stone with cracks ans scratches underlying the beauty of your stone you found in the most unlikely place. You know you are in love, when you feel electricity going through your body as the thoughts of you being intimate with him visit your mind. The chemistry is undeniable. You know you are in love, when you don't know when you might see him again, but you are not demanding and chasing. You let the love flow and be, for you know you can't separate yourself from it - it was your destiny to love without limits, expectations, unconditionally.  ",

            "answer_text": "My cousin is in a relationship from the last 12-13 years. They're finally going to be married now. (Hopefully soon) She has had a failed relationship as well. To be honest, she never thought that this is going to last this long. To be precise, she didn't even know he loved her. She realised it with time. It was a long way procedure. Fortunately, she's very open to us and her parents that she tells everything to us. What are the differences I found between the failed and the successful ones are: When she was actually in love - she could smile in front of him without any reason.When she was in love - she could cry in front of him. Relationships are not always about happiness, it's also about sharing the bad times together.When she was in love - she could express the real her in front of him. She didn't need to keep a filter on herself. She became wild at times, while at times she became a child.When she was in love - she wanted him to be present there while she's crying and hold her tightly. Not when she's happy and she wants to dance with him.When she was in love - she didn't need to have topics to talk. She started off and it lasted for hours.When she was in love - she didn't had some dreams having it. He was her dream.When she was in love - she started drinking chai cause the boy loved it. She wanted to experience everything that he did.When she was in love - she used to tell every small detail of her life with him.When she was in love - she used to hope that every message is his, every call is his.When she was in love - she used to apply men deodorant (the one he used) to feel his smell everytime.When she was in love - she didn't need to dress up for him. Her messy looks were also his favourite.When she was in love - she didn't need to wear sexy dresses. He found her sexy even when she wore her PJs.When she was in love - she used to watch movies and series or read books which had his name.When she was in love - she cared for him everytime!When she was in love - she always had a helping hand for her.When she was in love - she always has one to share her best of moments as well as the worst of them.When she was in love - she didn't need to convince her parents. They understood it.I'm no pro. I'm myself single. I'm writing what I've seen. I don't even know if this is love. But for me, it's a relation of love, trust and hope. It's powerful and caring. Isn't it enough?  Amour\u2661 ",

            "answer_text": "I used to wonder the same thing\u2026 until I fell in love at 29.  How do you know when a joke is funny or when something smells good? It\u2019s intuitive. Laughter simply bounces out of your chest or you naturally go \u201chmmm\u201d while tilting your nose up. It is the same way with love. One day you might be looking out of the window, running on the treadmill, shopping for groceries, holding his hand, you could be doing anything, and the thought simply comes, \u201cI love him.\u201d That\u2019s how you know you're in love.  If you are unsure or question whether you love him, then you are not in love. Love exclaims itself proudly, leaving no room for doubt.  A related question is \u201cHow do you fall in love?\u201d Many think love is a circumstantial happenstance that you have no control over. While fate does play a big role, my experience also tells me that you can as well. Here's my story: I grew up in a dysfunctional household. My parents had shouting-at-the-top-of-your-lung arguments daily. Dad cheated on Mom (among other heinous things). Mom told me never to get married. She said, \"men are bad\" and pointed to Dad as the prime example. Growing up, I didn\u2019t believe in \u201ctrue love.\u201d I thought men cheated and lied and then you are stuck in a terrible marriage.  I was the poster child for emotional baggage. Although I met nice guys and got into relationships, I would inevitably turn them into villians (in my mind) and find reasons to breakup. I never let anyone through. I rationalized many reasons for this but the real one was that I was terrified I'd end up like Mom. This continued until I was 28. That year, I had a particularly heart-wrenching breakup. He was a great guy. A sweet gentlemen with a boyish innocence who adored me. I unconsciously played out my routine and pushed him away. Months passed. When I finally I realized what I had done, I broke down in full acknowledgement of how messed up I was. I just knew then that I HAD to change. My worst nightmare was living that way until I was 70 and dying alone, never having known love. I started a new journey to get to the bottom of my fears and create a new way of being.  I did my own version of \"Eat, Pray, Love,\" going to meditation/yoga retreats, temples and ashrams. It was tough work clearing out my emotional junk but it was also exhilarating to get in touch with myself in a way I never had before and create new possibilities.  Within a year of my work, I met this incredible man and I fell in love. He is my best friend, my goofball, my sweetheart, and my trusted advisor rolled into one. Over the course of our relationship, I have learned to bring to him my raw and unfiltered self because I know that he accepts and loves every bit of me, from my sweetness to my crap. So coming back to the question, \"How do you fall in love?\" I believe that a part of it depends on you. I would not have the relationship I have today if it weren't for the work I did to clear out my fears and negative thinking about love.  ",

            "answer_text": "Falling in love is one of the most exciting, rewarding and scariest things you could ever do. Once you\u2019re in love with someone, it\u2019s hard to remember how you lived without him or her. Of course, you were alive before you met this person, but you really didn\u2019t start \u201cliving\u201d until the two of you met. I remember when I first fell in love with my boyfriend; it was a very scary feeling, as I had managed to elude love for the entirety of my life before him. I specifically remember the transition from when I liked him to when I began to love him. He went from being someone who made me smile to being the greatest catalyst of the happiness and joy in my life. He went from a sexy guy I met to the most adorable person I know. He went from my crush to the love of my life. Everyone experiences love differently, and at different times. Even the meaning of love is extremely subjective, but I say for certain that anyone who\u2019s experienced it knows it\u2019s the best feeling ever. Here are 10 ways to know if you might be in love \u2014 rather than in like \u2014 with someone: 1. The best part of your day As Childish Gambino said, \u201cWhen I\u2019m alone, I\u2019d rather be with you.\u201d Seeing my boyfriend is always the highlight of my day. If you really love someone, you never truly get tired of him or her. No matter how great your day might be going, your special person will make it better. When you just like someone, he or she might make your day better, but probably isn\u2019t the best part. 2. The first person you think about Your love will be the first person you think about when you wake up and the last person you think about before you go to sleep. When something good happens to you, this is the first person you want to tell. When something bad happens to you, you look to this person for support.  3. Prioritize above your own needs Love is selfless. I was the most important person in my world until I met my boyfriend. Once I fell in love with him, his needs became much more important than my own. This is just how love is. Your needs always seem trivial in comparison to your significant other\u2019s needs 4. You\u2019d do anything If I tried to construct a list of things I wouldn\u2019t do for my boyfriend, the list would be pretty empty. When you\u2019re in love with someone, you do whatever you can to make the person happy. When you like someone, you may feel like there is a lot you would do for the person, but you have your limits. True love knows no limits. 5. You are never afraid to express your feelings in public I have this semi-bad habit of telling the world how in love I am with my boyfriend. When you\u2019re truly in love, you want everyone to know. You are not bashful about your feelings by any means. When you like someone, there is a lot of holding back on how you feel. 6. You love the imperfections My boyfriend is the most wonderful person I know, but he does have some imperfections. But, to me, they\u2019re not imperfections \u2014 they\u2019re unique qualities and things I love. When I tease him about them, he thinks I am making fun of him, but I am truly just admiring them. Love is the ability to know and accept someone\u2019s faults. You may know the imperfections of a person you like, but having the capacity to embrace them likely won\u2019t happen unless you fall in love. 7. You think long-term When you\u2019re in love with someone, it\u2019s hard to imagine a future without the person in it. For this reason, you will think long-term about how you can build a life with this person. You won\u2019t give in to short-term temptations that might mess up your long-term goals. When you just like someone, thinking long-term can be pretty scary. 8. You become a better person No one is perfect; we all have room for improvement. But, being in love will force you to work on these things. You want to become the best version of yourself for the person you love. I am a better person now than I was before I met him. 9. Your feelings are unconditional When you love someone unconditionally, it means that your love knows no conditions and is absolute. I don\u2019t actually like the term \u201cunconditional love\u201d because I think it\u2019s redundant \u2014 I believe all true love is unconditional. When you like someone, your feelings change depending on the condition. 10. Your love is your best friend Sometime along the way, my boyfriend became my best friend. I believe this to be true for most people who fall in love. Your significant other becomes your partner in crime. You feel like, together, you can take on the world. ",

            "answer_text": "The feeling of love is complicated. Some people say you\u2019ll just know when you are \u201cin love,\u201d but it can more complicated than that. Love is easy to both overthink and underthink. For one, the feeling of romantic love can be separated into separate types. The first is sexual, which is the feeling of physical attraction toward another person\u2019s body and the desire to be intimate with that person. This is simple to gauge whether or not you feel sexually attracted to someone: either you feel it or you don\u2019t, and this can change moment to moment. Second, is a flirtatious type of love where you enjoy their company, feel a sense of trust towards them, and find them fun to be playful with. This does not always lead to deeper love, but bridges the gap between non-romantic love, such as friendship, and deeper romantic love. The last two are the most important to understand: infatuation and committed. Infatuation is that obsessive feeling that you need to be with somebody. This is the feeling of living life through rose coloured glasses. Everything feels amazing when you are with this person and you can\u2019t bear being away from them. Almost every one of their flaws doesn\u2019t seem so bad and their good qualities make them seem like the greatest human of all time. Being with them feels easy. In contrast, committed love is not as obsessive and is more difficult. This type of love requires work and dedication to hold together. Committed love is that long-term feeling that a person truly matters to you, even through all of their flaws. You need them in your life. People confuse infatuation with committed love all the time, which can lead to major problems. Infatuation always fades. Some people call it the honeymoon phase. In movies and fairy tales, it\u2019s the happily ever after stage: the prince gets the princess and they lived happily ever after. But in real life, happily ever after is never forever. For most, it lasts for about 3 months to 2 years. After that the real work begins. Committed love is different. It takes time and effort to build trust and value to bond together. It means not always being perfectly happy with your partner. It means sticking with them through tough times. Some people make the mistake of thinking they fell out of love with someone when the infatuation stage ended, but infatuation is just a trick the brain does to convince a person to invest enough energy into a relationship to bond to another person. Love is hard, but infatuation makes it feel so easy. When you are infatuated with another person: then you know. You can\u2019t not think about them. But deeper romantic love is trickier. So, to the question \u201cHow do you know?\u201d, well with infatuation you will just feel it burning inside and know, but deeper romantic love is trickier. Not everyone will go through the same level of intense infatuation: some aren\u2019t wired that way and some people slowly begin to feel love towards someone over time. Just because a person doesn\u2019t feel infatuated doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have romantic love for another. How long have you known this person? Is this somebody who you just really like spending time with or are they someone you feel you need to be around frequently. Do they have feelings towards you that are nearly the same? Do you legitimately care about their feelings and feel with them? Do you find yourself thinking before you act about how your actions will affect them? Do you want to be involved with their involvements? Do you feel willing to sacrifice your own needs for them? If your answer is yes to a lot of these, you might be feeling the early stages of romantic love. Or you might be feeling a weak sense of infatuation. My advice: don\u2019t overthink it. Don\u2019t read too deeply into it. I don\u2019t know how old you are, but if you are young then just take it slow and see where it takes you. Be careful with infatuation: it makes people do stupid things. If you are still in middle or high school, then enjoy it but don\u2019t overthink it. Your first love will probably not be your last, but that\u2019s okay. Think of it as a trial run for the real thing later on. Some people think that teenage love isn\u2019t real, that it\u2019s only infatuation. There\u2019s some truth there, in that most teenagers mistake infatuation for love, but love is still possible. It\u2019s still developing and maturing. But it\u2019s still real. Every relationship you have will teach you something about yourself and what you want in life. And if you still are unsure of what you feel then just go with the flow. Try things out. Just don\u2019t make any significant life-altering decisions or let it ruin your friendships. One day you\u2019ll have to make those decisions (probably in your mid-20s ), but you\u2019ll have time until then. Figuring out love is a part of figuring out yourself. With time and practice, you\u2019ll know more about what your feelings mean. I can\u2019t tell you what you feel (especially from here), but I can advise you to just take it slow, go with the flow, and avoid making any drastic decisions (especially if you are in a state of infatuation). One day you\u2019ll find someone who once the infatuation fades, and with significant time, is somebody who you\u2019ll want to commit to. Maybe it\u2019ll happen more than once. Until then, just enjoy the ride. Hope this helps. ",

            "answer_text": "So love is often misunderstood. First don\u2019t worry too much about love itself and learn to enjoy what you have. But secondly, on to what we experience and how we define them: Attraction (platonic) - A simple friendship. Comfortable and enjoyable spending time with the personAttraction (erotic) - A more intimate form of friendship. Obviously there\u2019s physical attraction in this case and what people call chemistry. Your body lights up like a lightbulb you feel a lot of things and it\u2019s mostly physical. This is often mistaken for love - it isn\u2019t.Like - The next level beyond any type of attraction is liking somebody. Willing to spend time with them for reasons other than physical attraction. Isn\u2019t just limited to partners of course, but it\u2019s important to have this with a potential partner you hope to build a future with. You don\u2019t just like their looks, you like their mind. Their thoughts, their weirdness, their normalcy. You just genuinely like this person, and you\u2019re not ignoring anything about them, you accept them for who they are and you like them.Love - Things get dark here, unfortunately. A great example of love isn\u2019t from erotic relationships cause a lot more emotions will cloud what love really is. A great example is a parent - child relationship. A parent that loves their child might not receive it back. The child might in fact hate them, try to run away, say hurtful things and disregard their parent\u2019s humanity and needs. But the parent loves them anyways. If you look at your partner, and know you\u2019d stick by them, do right by them, even if they don\u2019t - then you love them.It should also be noted that love isn\u2019t a switch. There\u2019s varying intensities of love:Weak love means you care about someone up until they piss you off and act hard headed. It\u2019s like weak glue.A stronger love will see you survive some proper fights, grow together, and learn more about each other.The strongest type unfortunately can be so strong it hurts whoever owns that love. Some people stick by a person who has hurt them by cheating or disrespecting them. Some people love too easily and too strongly, and get easily manipulated and therefore hurt. It can get so bad that even suicide is considered because their heart has been broken and their love is too strong - that glue can\u2019t let go. It hurts too much, and they want it over.In the end, love is something you nurture in your own mind, away from physical impulses and it\u2019s unidirectional (your love may not ever be returned). My final piece of advice to you in general is to be willing to like everyone, but love only a few, and pick those you love very, very carefully. It\u2019s worth the risk, if you pick the right person, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t hurt. ",

            "answer_text": "You\u2019re addicted to this person. Love changes the brain. In early-stage relationships, that euphoria that people feel appears as heightened neural activity in dopamine-rich areas of the brain\u2014areas linked to the reward system\u2014and in areas associated with the pursuit of rewards. There\u2019s even some hint of activity in the anterior cingulate, the area of the brain linked to obsessive thinking, which is a classic experience when people are falling in love . As a relationship progresses into a long-term partnership, thinking about the partner activates the reward centers as well as brain areas implicated in attachment, but less so obsessive thinking.You really want your friends or family to like this person. New evidence shows that people are often motivated to \u201cmarshal support\u201d for someone they are dating , which is consistent with the idea that the people in a person\u2019s social circle often play an important role in the success of a relationship . Being attuned to how your family and friends might think about your partner or potential partner is a good sign that you are becoming increasingly attached to the person.You celebrate this person\u2019s triumphs (even when you yourself fail). If you\u2019ve fallen in love with someone, you probably have an atypical reaction when witnessing them excelling at something you don\u2019t. Because romantic partners feel connected and can share the outcomes of each other\u2019s successes, romantic partners will often feel pride and positive emotions when they see their partner succeed, even at something they themselves can\u2019t do, rather than feeling negative and inferior.You definitely like this person, and this person likes you. Liking is different from love, but is often a prerequisite for falling in love. In a cross-cultural study, researchers showed that a critical factor recognized as directly preceding falling in love is reciprocal liking, when you both clearly like each other. In addition, an evaluation of the other person\u2019s personality as highly desirable tends to be a precursor to falling in love.You really miss this person when you\u2019re apart. In many ways, how much you miss a person reflects how interdependent your lives have become. If you are questioning whether you love someone, perhaps consider how much you miss him or her when you\u2019re apart. how much people miss each other tends to correspond with how committed they feel to the relationship.Your sense of self has grown through knowing this person. When people fall in love, their whole sense of self changes. They take on new traits and characteristics, growing with diversity, In other words, the you before falling in love is different from the you after falling in love. Maybe you feel the difference, maybe others notice it, but the things you care about, your habits, how you spend you time\u2014and or all of this is subject to the (hopefully positive) influence of a new romantic partner.You get jealous\u2014but not suspicious. A certain amount of jealousy is actually healthy, not toxic. From an evolutionary perspective, jealousy is an adaptation that helps relationships stay intact by making its members sensitive to potential threats. People who are jealous tend to be more committed to relationships. Keep the jealousy in check, though: Reactive or emotional jealousy is the type that is predicted by positive relationship factors like dependency and trust\u2014but people who engage in suspicious jealousy, which includes taking actions like secretly checking a partner's cellphone, tends to be associated with relational anxiety, low self-esteem, and chronic insecurity.Falling in love and building an attachment are a wonderful basis for a healthy relationship, but keep in mind that staying in a relationship (or, for that matter, choosing to start one) is often based on more than satisfaction and feeling good in another person\u2019s presence. the staying power of relationships takes mutual investment and commitment. If love is passion, security, and emotional comfort, commitment is the necessary decision made within one\u2019s cultural and social contexts to be with that person. ",

The warmth of air-kissing your neck, tickling your stomach,fingers and back. Every path is beautiful than ever. You should know, now that you are in Love.When mornings are painted Rose pink. Everything is fantastic and nothing much annoying.When your smile gets wider and wider in every passing minute with him.When you don't need a reason to smile and a joke to laugh.When you are sweet as hell. Even ants are irritated from your sweetness.When you remember everything about him. Even in sleep, you can babble the date you met, held hands, kissed, and went on the first date.When you memorize his number. As girls only remember someone's numbers when that person is too important. They don't give any unimportant person space in their memory land. If you remember his number and laughs at his silly jokes then maybe you are in Love.When you want to cook him his favourite dish.When you can speak your mind to him. Things that bother you, things you fear, deep secrets, and our bucket list.When you keep checking your phone. Your phone is now your oxygen cylinder. You can't even breath without looking at your phone.When reality is more beautiful than dreams. When his voice become lullaby in nights. Nothing better you can ask for.When his face keeps appearing in every person you look at and his thoughts keep running your mind all day.When you cherish day-dreaming and sleepless nights.When you crave his voice. And can hear him talking all night watching the moon in the sky.When you want to look gorgeous just for him.When the whole world vanishes before his dazzling eyes.When cute fights between you two start irritating your friends and no longer they want to give you two company.When he gave you a cute name and when he calls you by that name flowers started blooming in your stomach.When you ask the winds to tell him, how do you feel and how much you miss him.Suppose you have the power to be invisible for a hour, you can go anywhere and can do anything. If instead of going to to a mall or store and lifting clothes; you think of going to him and seeing how his face looks when he is sitting alone in the chair next to window texting you. How his cheeks got red and eyes to blush, that is all you want to see, then you are in Love.If you can imagine a life with him and ever thought how awesome your children are going to be then you are in love.You walk with a cloud with white face pink cheeks above your head which has a room for every memory of him, and you keep looking for a chance to disappear in that memory cloud.When you love hearing your name in his voice.When every person with the same name makes you smile.When you walk slowly with him so that path never ends.When words stop talking and silence is connecting hearts.When he becomes a part of your prayers.When you listen to his favourite song again and again, to know his side of the story.When a person can make you believe that heaven is on earth then, you are in Love.When you desire to have a kid who has a dimple on one cheek like him, all his tantrums is as cute as his. When you can see his presence- all of him, in every nook and corner of your life, then you are in Love.",

            "answer_text": "You just know. There is no doubt at all \u2014 and no need to tick a checklist, or source opinions on Quora (although all questions are welcome and thank you for yours). \u25cf Other person is always on your mind: first thing in the morning and last thing at night. \u25cf Physical sensations of being truly alive and thriving and a peculiar sensation in the abdomen/solar plexus of a yearning/aching-warmth for the other person. \u25cf You crave the other person's company: their touch/contact, their kiss, being able to see them, talk to them, listen to them, etc. And going home afterwards feels like you are ripping yourself away from them such that you already can't wait to see them again before you've even left. \u25cf You see \u201cinto\" them: beyond the superficial seeing that a stranger does. You see their quirks, charms, the good and the not so good, the whole of their personality and all that they are: and you still like (or love\u2026) them for being exactly as they are. \u25cf If you're young, it's all a rush and all-in head spin. When you've known love before, you enjoy a slower pace. Perhaps. People differ. These are just the obvious things that come to my mind \u2014 but for the absolute simplest truth: see the first sentence of my answer again\u2026 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\ Addit: \u25cf You start to factor the other person into your thoughts and decisions. \u25cf You seem less interested in other \u201ccompeting\" parties. You desire exclusivity \u2014 to share all of yourself with the other person only, and you hope for reciprocity (unless you are one of these new-love jerks that's all about open relationships and non commitment etc \u2014 just my opinion that you jerks are jerks, so don't jump down my throat for saying it\u2026. Ya bunch of JERKS lol!). Or perhaps another way of looking at it is you desire a relationship with that person where you both occupy special places in each others lives. \u25cf You are happy to be vulnerable, take the armour off, take a risk, and hope for the best. \u25cf Your friends and family will sense it in You\u2026 And unhappily accept that there's a new voice that carries influence in your life, and they better fall in line with the new world order because \u201cso and so is amazing \u2014 don't say anything bad about so and do\u2026\u201d. MAYBE: This one also is a bit down to who you are inside yourself. \u25cf Heaps more - maybe someone else can keep the list going? (\u2026) ------------------------------ Addit thanks to Linda Mayes: You feel comfortable around them. All the things that reside in the old love story doesn\u2019t matter. Netflix, laughs and a home cooked meal seems boring to everyone else but amazing to you. You start to create your own love story. The warmth and feeling you receive from them. When you feel the love, it\u2019s is only right yet natural to give back. They appreciate every flaw you have. They always encourage you & want you to be your best. They always believe in you. They never bring you down and want you to be your best at everything you do! My favorite one: Consideration for one another !!! The most important trait. Love will truly go so far with this one. Sharing everything. Only the two of you knows what nobody else knows about one another & knowing that they are secure & it stays between the both of you only. Even when things go bad. Why? Because they are your best friend too!! Material, & other outside instances really don\u2019t matter. Who doesn\u2019t love them right? But if they are gone the love will still be there;) You get butterflies or your heart is beating out of your chest. When you feel & know for a fact that they love you; not by what they say, but what they do!! \u25cf Anyone else care to add to the list? ",

            "answer_text": "Being in Love is that thing where you become vulnerable and give someone the ability to destroy you, but you trust them not to. Love is unconditional, selfless, it makes you happy when you see your soulmate happy, you feel better with her/him, you truly care for the other person, their appearance doesn't matter, perfection doesn't matter, you can love them for what they are and what you are when you are with them. Most of the time, we know we are in true love, not from the butterflies when she/he is around , but from the pain when she/he has gone away. Love need not always be mutual. Love comes from within. It doesn\u2019t need to be reciprocated. We feel happy if it is, but if not, we will still continue to love the other person for love comes from within. A crush is short lived. Lust and strong physical attraction fade over time. The initial infatuation fades. It is just a strong sense of desire and attraction knowing only the superficial details about the other person. It makes you feel happy. It eventually fades with time. True love, on the other hand, takes time and lasts forever. It nurturers and it grows over time. It is real and it is a feeling where the other person's happiness is a priority over your own happiness. Love cares for the other person. Rejection from a crush hurts, but you will get over it with time. But rejection from the one you truly love, stings and kills you, because it takes away a part of you. True love is unconditional and selfless. You love someone because you want to, not because you will get something in return. That is what love is all about. Do you still love someone even though you know you can't be together? I\u2019m sorry for strangling you with my true love. I\u2019m sorry when I love you unconditionally even after you wanted me to stay away and move on. I\u2019m sorry if my care appeared as pestering. I\u2019m sorry if my love appeared as torture. I\u2019m sorry if not moving on appeared as my weakness. I\u2019m sorry if not letting you go, appeared as stubbornness. I\u2019m sorry if I have ever made you fear by showing my vulnerability. I\u2019m sorry if I have ever made you freak out by showing my endless love :\u2019( I\u2019m sorry if everything appeared to you as Whiny. I\u2019m sorry if everyone misled you that I whined when I was probably trying to be understood. I\u2019m sorry if my intentions of wanting to be understood appeared as clingy. I\u2019m really sorry. It was all because I truly love you unconditionally. Even after you broke my heart a million times, those million pieces still love you to the truest of its senses. Because that is what love is all about. UNCONDITIONAL. But all I wanted to say to your deafening Silence when you cut me off from your life and left is that \u201cStaying away and no communication is never a solution to anything in life my dear.\u201d It is not that I didn\u2019t accept that you don\u2019t want me anymore in your life, but that I still love and care about you even though you can\u2019t give me anything in return. It is not because I can\u2019t move on or don\u2019t want to move on, it is because my love for you is true. I am not crying because it ended. But because I still love you. Even after you ended it and ignored me completely. Tears start rolling down my cheeks, when I guide your hair behind your ears ,in the latest picture of yours.The moment when a picture speaks a thousand words. Every love story doesn't have a happy ending, because TRUE LOVE doesn't have an end. I still love you in silence. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2018ll try my best to answer your question from the perspective of an old guy, but have to begin by pointing out that the words \u2018romance\u2019 and \u2018romantic\u2019 can be confusing Ignoring the literary definition of romance, which I vaguely recall referred to a story about a hero with a tragic flaw, romance seems to mean completely different things to different people. To many people, including most of the young people I know, it refers to a sexual relationship based on physical desire , but not necessarily a relationship expected to last very long or that is deeply felt. To others like myself, it connotes a deeper and more spiritual concern for another's well-being, and calls to mind a relationship where sex is an important but not crucial component. Fortunately, both of those concepts are easily distinguished from the love a person feels for their parents or other family members, which are not of a sexual nature at all. I'll take a huge leap of faith that you are referring to the deeper meaning of \u2018romantic\u2018 which I subscribe to, since I hope you can tell when all the crazy chemicals in your body make you \u2018want\u2019 someone in a way you'd never think of with a family member. So - how do you know if you love someone versus being \u2018simply\u2019 attracted to them? The truth is, you can't always tell. Sorry, but we are all capable of lying to ourselves, and we do that most often when it comes to our feelings. When you find someone attractive, which is based on their appearance, your own experiences and ideals, and of course hormones, it's very easy to not notice or even ignore flaws or incompatibilities. Moving to another level, good sex - I know, I know, someone is already typing \u201cit's all good\u201d - can completely distort a person's rational thought processes. Things can become even more confusing if your love interest is very kind, or understanding, or displays some personality trait you crave for one reason or another. It's no surprise then that so many couples sincerely believe they're in love with each other and then are amazed to wake up one day and admit that they either don't really know, or don't really like their partner. But I don't mean to seem so gloomy, because there is one simple way to determine if you really love someone. You just make a decision. You think about the person, acknowledging all of their virtues and then honestly considering all of their faults, even those that are in actuality your problems, for instance if you're averse to pets but they love cats. You concentrate on the negatives, and ask yourself if you can live with those the rest you your life. Important point, which deserves a book in itself - don't count on \u2018changing\u2019 the other person's behavior, or opinion, or attitude. That could happen, but the only thing you can be sure of changing in how you feel about their behavior. Think long and hard about those things you dislike, and especially about moral values which you share or differ on. For instance, if I found out that the kindest, most generous, most beautiful woman I ever met felt that she was superior to people of another background or culture, I know that I could never enjoy spending time with her. I might be able to overlook any number of mannerisms or a stubborn streak or a tendency to argue about silly things, but not issues of character. Of course for some people, the things most aren't likely to notice can be deal breakers. On of my sisters wouldn't go out with a guy who even occasionally used the wrong tense, for example saying \u201cshe don't\u201d instead of \u201cshe doesn't\u201d. In her defense, our mother was Italian and insisted that we always use proper grammar, so it was very jarring to hear the way many people butcher the language. But my point is that every one of us has unique personal and often trivial preferences and if we choose not to change or eliminate them, we must be willing to have our choices reflect them. So you don't know if you love someone, you decide to love them. Love is not a feeling, nor an emotion, it's a decision. Feelings are basically hormones, or sometimes difficult to understand aspects of our own unique personal psychology resulting from upbringing and experiences. They are fleeting and sometimes surprising. Emotions are much the same but are more consistent and more apparent by our actions; still, they are nothing more than our outward reactions to specific events. If someone were to insult you, causing you to feel hurt and become angry, you would (hopefully) not kill them because of your hurt feelings and angry emotion. Yet we are all conditioned by modern culture to think that it's sensible for two people to marry and commit to a lifetime of togetherness because of feelings in their crotch (hormones) and the fact that they feel cared for when the other person compliments them (emotions). So, real and lasting love is not about feelings or emotions, it's a decision, cold as that may sound. You must look at yourself objectively and your potential partner critically, and then you decide. Do the things about the person that appeal to you mean enough that you would choose to accept those things about them that bother you? Conversely, are there aspects about that person that you find lacking as compared to your \u2018ideal\u2019 that are more than offset by less obvious characteristics that you never thought of looking for. One of my friends in college who was very petite, about 5\u2032 tall weighing less than 100 pounds said she'd never even consider any guy over 5\u2032-9\u2033 because she felt they'd look odd together. But the last time I saw her she was dating a guy who was 6\u2032-5\u2033 because she said he was the first guy other than me who didn't treat her like a child and constantly make jokes about munchkins. Those things about a person that are simply unacceptable and those that are absolutely necessary in order for them to be considered at all are different for each of us, but that's fine, because we each have to decide what matters. But in the end, the most important thing to know is that you alone can choose what matters to you. Once you know that, whether or not you love someone is simply a choice you make. Some find that discouraging, as they are apparently enchanted by the mysterious twists and turns of fairy tales and Disney movies. But others of us find that realization to be the most empowering and powerful aspects of humanity - that we are not ruled by fate or chemicals, but that instead we have the power to choose. ",

            "answer_text": "She was waiting for me in the college, when she called. I picked up in the first ring. Her: Hey. Are you coming? Should I wait here? Me: I have almost reached. Give me some time. I have already reached the place long back. To be honest, I couldn\u2019t sleep the whole night before in excitement. I kept looking at clock and her picture. She was beautiful but I was scared to face her. I was conscious this time. I never felt like that before. I pretend that I am looking for her repeatedly, when she called me. I looked behind and I felt numb. I couldn\u2019t speak at that moment. She kept saying things, but I was lost in her. Her: Hey. Is something wrong? I am really nervous. I never stayed far away from my home before. I was concerned and worried. I wanted to make her comfortable. I wanted to hold her hand and hug her. I wanted to assure her that I am with her. I would never leave her at any instance. There was something wrong with me that moment, as I was talking to myself rather than answering her. We met again. This time, she was worried that her phone wasn\u2019t working and she didn\u2019t know our place quite well. I started to leave things in the middle and getting ready. I ran miles on foot to reach college. I couldn\u2019t breathe even properly as I never did that before. I knew something wasn\u2019t right but I started loving this change, which I wasn\u2019t aware of. Me: Is everything alright? Give me your phone. I will do something. I never felt so confident before. I always needed extra preparation to feel that way. I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. We ran into innumerable shops but couldn\u2019t find the solution, when she felt sad. I couldn\u2019t see her sad and I started doing something on her phone and it clicked. Problem is solved and she jumped out of excitement. She hugged me. I felt strange and I was speechless. It was something unimaginable for me that instance. I couldn\u2019t sleep that night too. There was something seriously wrong with me now as I was trying to connect with her, when I missed her beautiful presence. This time, she was volunteering for blood camp but she didn\u2019t call me specifically. I never did any voluntary work before, but I wanted to try this time. I called her and she felt happy. We met again. Supposedly, she was coordinating and I preferred to be her volunteer. I started following her ideas. She was good at leading this camp and everyone was impressed. Everyone started reaching out to her, but I kept working on my activity silently. I just visited that camp to spend time with her. But she didn\u2019t know that I even existed. Later, I left the place without informing her. I didn\u2019t sleep that day too. But this time the reason was unusual. I felt sad when we couldn\u2019t spend time together. Next day, I preferred to stay away from her sign. I tried focussing on my studies as I was hurt. We never talked for a month. I was still dealing with my feelings. I felt I was too immature that instance. She called me on my birthday. I never told her about it. She repeatedly asked me to meet her at college. I made up some excuse and she felt sad. I hung up. But all this time, I even felt guilty. I knew the place where we used to hang out the most. I surprised her. She hugged me and wished me. I almost forgot all the pain. We shared good times together that day. This time, I wanted to do something special for her. Her: Hey. Chill. I will go on my own. Don\u2019t worry. Me: No way. Its already late. I will drop you. Please I insist. Her: Okay great. We will have more time to spend together then. She was excited and I felt relieved. She kept talking all the way, and I kept listening to her. I dropped her at her hostel. It was awkward moment but this was new for me. I didn\u2019t know what I am supposed to do. Me: Okay Take care. Thanks for your time today. She ran towards me. Her: Please call me when you reach your hostel. I will be waiting for your call. Don\u2019t keep me waiting. She smiled. And I was speechless. I recall that I kept singing all the way during my journey back to my hostel. Now I know, I was in love definitely. After few days, I received a text, \u201cSorry. I couldn\u2019t reply. I had some tests so I have to go to hospital\u201d. I was silent. I couldn\u2019t understand what she had been going through. I had to skip next class and so I ran to visit hospital. I was angry as well as worried. It kept bugging me, \u201dIs she okay? Why didn\u2019t she tell me? It was my fault. I should have asked her. Why I couldn\u2019t keep my ego aside? \u201d. I finally saw her. She smiled and I felt relieved. It was difficult for me to see her like that. This time, I couldn\u2019t control and I hugged her myself. Her: Hey I am alright. Nothing happened. But I couldn\u2019t believe her. I couldn\u2019t sleep that day too because every now and then, she was affecting me. She was all over my mind, wherever I would go. At first, love feels like a serious affair but it is something that we aren\u2019t aware of. Loving someone wasn\u2019t all about spending beautiful moments together. It was all about how you feel, when you miss her beautiful presence every now and then. When you miss being with her, then you realise and wish you could have more time together and that is love. Loving someone takes a shear amount of quality time to understand your feelings but when you get there, you don\u2019t want to leave that beautiful place again. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s very difficult to answer this question. It would be like explaining to you when your are hungry: no one better than you can tell. Citing a quote from Pierre Beaumarchais, though, can help you to understand when your feelings towards someone else are genuine: Where love is concerned, too much is not even enough. Imagine these two examples, inspired by and freely translated from an Italian book written by mental coach Giacomo Papasidero.[1] #1 It\u2019s your birthday. You come back from work and discover that your partner has arranged a surprise birthday party for you and invited your best friends. You spend a wonderful evening with them and with the person you love who has arranged it just for you; then, when everybody is gone, there is still time for her to surprise you once more with a night of passion. In the morning you wake up and smell the coffee that she has prepared and brought to bed for you. What a wonderful person, the one you love. What you don\u2019t know, though, is that she has a secret lover and that the day before, in the afternoon before you came back from work, she \u201ccelebrated\u201d your birthday with him in your couch. #2 Now think of someone else. A couple. They are doing really well in the love department, until one day he decides to spy on her mobile and discovers a few messages from a common friend who had a flirt with her before the couple got together. He gets furious and accuses her to betray him. He starts being suspicious every time she goes out with her friends. She denies any wrong doing and tries to reassure him with hugs, attentions and sweetness any time she can; but he doesn\u2019t believe her, he feels ripped off and thinks that those nice gestures of her are just fake. He feels that she doesn\u2019t love him. But the truth is that she is really honest, she has never betrayed him or even thought to betray him and that the common friend is just\u2026a friend.  Isn\u2019t it bizarre that you, who are betrayed by your partner, feel like the luckiest person on earth, while the guy from the other couple, who is genuinely loved by his partner, feels betrayed, disappointed and unloved? We truly love when we are not concerned. The guy from the second couple doesn\u2019t really love his partner. He loves (loved) her alignment to his expectations. When this comes less, concern kicks in and the truth, which would be evident if he was truly in love, becomes secondary and blurred. He is moved by personal gain, not by unconditional love. True love is not measured by how happy the other person makes you feel, but by your spontaneous desire to make your partner happy. Think it like this: would you feel loved by a friend who shows to be as such only when he can gain a favor from you? No, you are not loved by him. And yet, you probably keep doing him these favors he needs. Why? Because you truly love him. Because you don\u2019t need to receive anything in exchange, when you truly love someone, not even love itself. Footnotes[1] Imparare a essere felici eBook: Giacomo Papasidero: Amazon.it: Libri",

            "answer_text": "Signs that you are in love? Like seriously? Ooh C\u2019mon you beautiful creature, love is never so tangible and objective. Had it been so, the world would have been filled with resplendent stories which generally get lost in obscurity due to vague nature of love. There are no signs, rules, equations, algorithms\u2026 Just emotions and instincts. I remember a beautiful story here. Once Ross asked Joe, tell me how much love is emotional and how much of it is physical? To which Joe elegantly replied, \u201clove is 99% physical and 99% emotional and the best part is, rules of mathematics do not apply here\u201d. Still there are some pretty obvious cues that you are going into that tender phase of being in love. Some of them might sound silly though but again logics don't apply here:). When some part of you is always lost somewhere other that your physical location and your colleagues keep complaining of that. And high part is, you are completely okay with those complains and taunts. When you are into middle of something, however tedious, monotonous or messy it is, a sudden thought of a particular person comes and pours an elixir of joy in your mind and mood.You start smiling and others are like, what's wrong with him/her?:) You start observing changes in yourself. All the music and poetry which you cherished just as an avid reader now mean a lot to you. They seem highly relatable and relevant now. Your perception about life and people changes and you become more empathetic.  Things get really interesting if you have habbit of self talking [applicable to me :)You start enjoying your company more than anyone where you keep rehearsing all those honest emotions which you want to convey to that beautiful personality which has now become a part of you, which is always with you,obviously not literly but metaphorically. Things get really pathetic when you see that you haven't ever initiated a conversation with that person, this situation keeps killing you, believe me. It's not that you are afraid or insecure about intensity and honesty of your true emotions. It is just that you don't want to loose the treasure you already have[unexpressed, unrequited honest love]. Mere thought of losing a person you never had with you scares you to the core. This most beautiful yet cruel thing about being in love.  Stalking over social media and other such deeds are way to mainstream. You never start a conversation even there because again can't risk being stereotyped as another random highly infatuated creepy Romio. If your emotions are short lived and more tilted towards bodily pleasures and not with mind and personality of that person, them I am sorry pal, you ain't in love, you are just infatuated.  Infatuation is disorganised form of enery of your brain. But love of is same energy dancing elegantly on the choreography of your heart beats,highly pristine and resplendent. If you are just infatuated then you will get over this in 21 days or so.But being in Ishk[love] will never fade. It's just constant or keeps on increasing, each day with a new sensation in mind, with a new note in the beats of your heart. In the end\u2026. Love is love, no metaphors,no explainations.

            "answer_text": "Love is a strange feeling that a man can feel only when he falls in love and shares some feelings with you.  Love is an entirely amazing medication. When you feel it, you truly feel it. It can suspend time, influencing the entire world to appear to be still with the exception of both of you. It encourages you more than any sustenance; you feel full within the sight of adoration. In any case, there's a huge contrast among adoration and intimate romance. Genuine romance knows no profundity. It's an unending passage that clears you up in the hurricane and you're never fully free from it. It remains with you. Furthermore, you trust this individual will as well. Genuine romance isn't customary. It doesn't come around regularly and that is the manner by which you'll know it's certifiable. \u2026 .Or, you know, you could peruse this rundown and discover for yourself. Here are the 21 signs you are genuinely enamored with your accomplice: 1. You see something and as opposed to deduction how upbeat it makes you, you consider how glad it would make them. 2. You feel more at home with them than you've at any point felt in all your years. Notwithstanding when you were 7 and had all the soft toys on the planet. 3. You wind up singing Macy Gray at different occasions for the duration of the day. 4. You can get full scale distraught or discouraged or cheerful or whatever it is that you are before them. What's more, you realize it won't change how they feel about you. 5. Persistence: It doesn't make a difference to what extent it takes for them to get something, you appreciate investing the energy educating or gaining from them. 6. You have the choice to wear your go-to equip, yet at the same time take an additional five minutes to prepare. 7. You live for their eccentricities. You adore that they take up the whole move floor when they break a move. You cherish that you can't share suppers since they loathe chicken. You adore that they will examine superstars like they're your genuine companions. You'd much preferably have them be odd over any other individual. 8. Despite everything you head toward their place regardless of how late around evening time it is and how tired you feel. It's constantly justified, despite all the trouble. 9. You don't want other individuals. Indeed, you may discover some of them appealing, yet no piece of you needs them. 10. Their joy implies more than your own. 11. You eagerly surrender to the things you regularly don't settle on. 12. You never become sick of their organization. It's in every case simply better when they are there. Regardless of whether both of you don't fill the quiet, you're content basically realizing they are available. 13. You have snapshots of weakness however their consolation influences you to acknowledge it doesn't make a difference. Just when they state things will be fine do you truly trust it. 14. You partner certain aromas with them. Cut grass helps you to remember the time after your morning run. Football calfskin conveys you to pre-winter nighttimes spent playing get in the leaves. Furthermore, don't kick us off on the smell of their pad\u2026 . 15. You long for all the manners in which you can deal with them more than you long for all the manners in which you need them to deal with you. 16. You never would prefer not to hear them out \u2013 notwithstanding when they sing Motown completely awfully in the shower. 17. When you do battle \u2014 it's a piece of cherishing somebody \u2014 you really would prefer not to be frantic at them. You don't speak gravely about them after it's settled either in light of the fact that you realize their activities originated from a decent spot. 18. As though it's even conceivable, you observe them to be even cuter when they are dozing. (I guarantee this isn't dreadful\u2026 ) 19. They can come at you with anything \u2014 news, insider facts, possibly a homerun stick \u2014 and you won't pass judgment or abhor them for it. 20. You wake up cheerful if simply because you get the chance to see them that day  ",

            "answer_text": "Love is very special and not many people are capable of being loved. But, no matter what the feeling of love is one of the best feelings yet. When even the smallest thing reminds you of them. You look at that thing and smile thinking about that person.Each night you go to sleep thinking about that person.Each morning you wake up thinking of that person.You are with them you feel great and just wish that time would stop.Whatever they say makes you smile and laugh.You just can\u2019t get your eyes off of them.Everything else seems wrong but, they are the only ones that are right.You try every way to make them happy and smile.Everything seems so beautiful. Even the things that you didn\u2019t like before you start loving.Life finally starts making a little sense.Sometimes you sit there staring into space and smile about nothing.Every time you see that person your heart skips a beat.And those who are not so lucky of seeing their love every day. Their heart starts beating like crazy and they start jumping up and down and screaming out of happiness when they finally see the person that they have waited so long to see.You start doing really stupid things for no reason.Every time you are with them bubbles of happiness blast out inside of you.You become a little more mature and realize that money is not everything. Love is much more important and valuable.You are having a really rough day and just one single message from them shifts your mood entirely and make you really happy. That message doesn\u2019t even have to be an I love you message it just can be really casual.You might be angry at them for not talking to you for days. But, as soon as they respond all that anger just evaporates.Sometimes when you think about them it hurts yet, you still keep thinking about them and the times that you spent together.And sometimes you even stalk them.You observe them and carefully see what they like and not like.You too start developing their habits which could either be good or bad. For example you notice that your love says \u201cOh! Man! I am dead!\u201d every time they laugh really hard and the next time you laugh you start saying it too without realizing that you are saying it because of that person.When you see a picture of them no matter how ugly you still love it. Hay mein marjawah.When forgetting them hurts a lot.Even if they have made many mistakes you are willing to expect them with the flaws that they have and love them just the way they are.Then there is those who while reading this answer think of someone. Someone whom they love and that is when you know that either you crossed the wrong path or fell for the right person.Love is something unexplainable. Each person feels love different;y and based on who they fallin love with how they feel love also changes. Regardless love is a beauttiful feeling and we should enjoy it when we can because we might not always be in love. Lots of love, Simran Patel ",

            "answer_text": "Look at a photo of your person of interest. Does the profound beauty of everything within the lines of their face hit you full force? Does everything seem to slow down around you just slightly when you look into their eyes? How does their voice feel coming over the phone on a bad day? is everything suddenly golden after seeing their name pop up? Do you dream about them? How often? How do you feel when you wake up? True love, in my experience, provides an incredibly peaceful feeling. Something akin to meditation. Utter openness. It also causes extreme excitement at unexpected times, a profound motivation to be near and around the person, and some sadness when they aren't around. You'll find yourself grateful for every opportunity to connect with them. Passionate about their interests. Amazed by their actions. You should be careful. Love is a drug unlike many other human pursuits. It will change you if it is really true. \u201cDear little sweetheart. Once again I\u2019ve let a few lazy days slip by without accomplishing anything. You know, the kind of days when you sleep late because there\u2019s nothing important to do, then go out until the room has been made up, and then study until fatigue sets in. Then you loaf around for a while and half-heartedly look forward to dinner, listlessly contemplating highly philosophical questions while whistling a little\u2026 How was I able to live alone before, my little everything? Without you I lack self-confidence, passion for work, and enjoyment of life \u2014 in short, without you, my life is no life.\u201d-Albert Einstein \u201cLove is a temporary madness, it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No, don\u2019t blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being \u201cin love\u201d, which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident\u201d.-Louise de bernieres \u201cIt\u2019s to do with knowing and being known. I remember how it stopped seeming odd that in biblical Greek, knowing was used for making love. Whosit knew so-and-so. Carnal knowledge. It\u2019s what lovers trust each other with. Knowledge of each other, not of the flesh but through the flesh, knowledge of self, the real him, the real her, in extremis, the mask slipped from the face. Every other version of oneself is on offer to the public. We share our vivacity, grief, sulks, anger, joy\u2026 we hand it out to anybody who happens to be standing around, to friends and family with a momentary sense of indecency perhaps, to strangers without hesitation. Our lovers share us with the passing trade. But in pairs we insist that we give ourselves to each other. What selves? What\u2019s left? What else is there that hasn\u2019t been dealt out like a deck of cards? Carnal knowledge. Personal, final, uncompromised. Knowing, being known. I revere that. Having that is being rich, you can be generous about what\u2019s shared \u2014 she walks, she talks, she laughs, she lends a sympathetic ear, she kicks off her shoes and dances on the tables, she\u2019s everybody\u2019s and it don\u2019t mean a thing, let them eat cake; knowledge is something else, the undealt card, and while it\u2019s held it makes you free-and-easy and nice to know, and when it\u2019s gone everything is pain. Every single thing. Every object that meets the eye, a pencil, a tangerine, a travel poster. As if the physical world has been wired up to pass a current back to the part of your brain where imagination glows like a filament in a lobe no bigger than a torch bulb. Pain.\u201d-\u2019the real thing\u2019 play. ",

            "answer_text": "We sing about it, write about it and watch movies about it, but when you think about it, falling in love is crazy and maybe even weird.It makes us feel and do things we usually wouldn\u2019t under any other circumstances. First of all, it physically affects our hormones and brain. In fact, scientists have shown that love affects the brain in a way similar to cocaine addiction. Not only that, it also affects us psychologically and behaviorally  some weird symptoms-  Your hormones go wild When you fall in love, your cheeks flush, your heart beats faster, your palms are sweaty and your head starts spinning. This is all thanks to a rush of chemicals and hormones that flood your brain and body when you fall in love.This leaves you with feelings of euphoria similar to an endorphin-induced \u201crunner\u2019s high.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing you can do about this; love physically makes you crazy. You wake up and go to sleep thinking of someone other than yourself From the moment you wake up in the morning to the moment you go to sleep at night, the person you love occupies at least some part of your mind. How does your brain even know to think of that person first thing in the morning? Doesn\u2019t it have other more important things to worry about?The truth is this phenomenon is usually subconscious and automatic, almost like your mind is programmed to do so. Even throughout the day, that person stays staunchly in the back of your mind.As crazy as it may be, it is nice to think of someone beside you every once in a while. You smile when you\u2019re alone We\u2019ve all seen them: the smile texters. Smile texting is the perfect example of what happens when you\u2019re falling in love. You experience weird, giddy feelings of happiness, even when you\u2019re not physically with that special person.You might smile when he or she texts you, when you hear a certain song, see a picture on Facebook or when you just think of that person.In general, little things like that will make you smile more than usual because you are just so blissfully in love (and because of all those happy hormones flowing through your bloodstream).People may look at you funny and wonder why you\u2019re so happy, but you don\u2019t even mind You become a little obsessive  I wonder what she\u2019s doing right now. I wonder if she\u2019s watching the game. She loves football, which is cool for a girl. But I forget what her favorite team is \u2026 I need to ask again. Or maybe I should ask now. I\u2019ll mention it if she texts me later.Oh look, a bag of chips. She loves chips. But only the BBQ kind.  People in love, love to think about each other. They somehow manage to relate even the smallest things to the person they love. If your life is the universe, then chances are, your love is the sun, and everything revolves around that.  You do embarrassing things Ever heard those sappy stories of boys in the olden days throwing rocks at a girl\u2019s window, and playing her songs on their guitar? That was then, but today, there are videos all over YouTube of men proposing to their fiance with elaborate flash mobs that take place in front of hundreds of people. Love will make you do embarrassing things because when you\u2019re falling in love with someone, you will do almost anything to make him or her happy, no matter what other people may think You do things outside of your comfort zone Along the same lines, falling in love will make you do things you never even considered doing before. Boys, that may mean taking a yoga class or going to get a pedicure with your girlfriend (they feel really good, it\u2019s okay to admit it).Girls, that may mean watching \u201cSportsCenter\u201d for two hours or playing a couple games of FIFA. Of course, doing these things can open your mind to new activities you might enjoy. Doing them with the one you love is a great bonding experience, too You suddenly care more about your appearance  Before, you may have rolled out of bed and thrown on some athletic shorts and a t-shirt, but you now have a reason to try to look good. You might comb your hair more often, double check to make sure you didn\u2019t forget deodorant, shave more meticulously and go to the gym, instead of falling asleep on your couch after work You sing  When you\u2019re falling in love, you feel so happy and carefree, you can\u2019t always keep it inside. Whether you sound like William Hung or \"Ariana Grande\", sometimes, you just have to sing at the top of your lungs to let it all out. You go out of your way You may find yourself driving out of the way to pick up your love\u2019s favorite dinner, or calling in sick to work just to hang out with him or her. The crazy part is that even though these things may inconvenience you, you\u2019re happy and excited to do them. You actually take joy in making that extra effort to please your SO and show him or her how much you care You go blind As the old adage goes, love is blind. When you\u2019re falling in love, everything your love does and says is interesting and amazing. Every word uttered from his or her mouth, and every move he or she makes, is magical. Love blinds you to faults and screw ups, and even when you do notice them, you\u2019re quick to forgive because your love can do no wrong. As it turns out, KeSha might be right about this one: Love is a drug. It makes us crazy, but it also makes us happy. Love is exciting; it\u2019s addicting, it\u2019s confusing and it\u2019s weird. So, cheers to love: both our worst nightmare and our best friend. <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 ",

            "answer_text": "Very simply \u2026 there is one question you can ask yourself, and if the answer is \u201cyes\u201d, you will absolutely know without a doubt that you love this person. So what is this magic question? Well before I reveal it, I think it's important to realize that we\u2019re not alone in wondering what being \u201cin love\u201d is. We don't have a simple definition in English for such a complex emotion.  Love has many subtleties. We have several words to describe love in English, yet still there are some shades within the spectrum of that emotion we haven\u2019t been able to capture in our own language. Here are some interesting examples of foreign words relating to love that we don't have in English:  Koi No Yokan \u2013 Japanese The sudden knowledge upon meeting someone that the two of you are destined to fall in love. Unlike the phrase \u201clove at first sight\u201d Koi No Yokan doesn\u2019t mean that the feeling of love is already there when meeting someone, rather this describes the concept of feeling like love is inevitable. It\u2019s looking at someone and feeling those sparks that a deeper romantic connection is possible.  Mamihlapinatapei \u2013 Yagan A wordless, yet meaningful look between two people who both desire to initiate something, but both are too scared to initiate themselves.  Forelsket \u2013 Norwegian That overwhelming euphoric feeling you experience when you\u2019re falling in love with someone.  La douleur exquise \u2013 French The heartbreaking pain of wanting someone you can\u2019t have. La douleur exquise is not the same as unrequited love \u2013 the state of one desiring another they can\u2019t have. This phrase is meant to describe the emotional experience and heartbreak of being the person whose feelings and desires aren\u2019t returned.  Ya\u2019aburnee \u2013 Arabic This phrase translates to \u201cyou bury me.\u201d This is the hope that the person you love will outlive you so you can spare the pain of living without them.  Saudade \u2013 Portuguese The feeling of intense longing for a person or place you love but is now lost. A haunting desire for what is gone.  Kara sevda \u2013 Turkish Meaning \u201cblack love\u201d this is a lovesick term for when you feel that passionate, blinding love for another person.  Kilig \u2013 Tagalog The heady-sublime rush you experience right after something good happens, particularly in love/dating. Like running into your crush, kissing someone for the first time, hearing someone you love tell you they love you too for the first time.  Gigil \u2013 Filipino The urge to pinch or squeeze something that is irresistibly cute.  Cavoli riscaldati \u2013 Italian This literally means \u201creheated cabbage\u201d but the phrase describes the moment when you attempt to start up a failed relationship or love affair.  Yuanfen \u2013 Chinese A relationship by fate or destiny. In common usage yuanfen means \u201cthe binding force\u201d that connects two people but it\u2019s an ambiguous term. Although it can be a complex concept, it essentially draws upon the principles of predetermination in Chinese culture that dictates relationships, particularly in love, friendship, and business. It is the idea of bringing two people together that were destined to meet.  Ok ok, I know you\u2019re ready and just want to know the simple question to ask yourself to know if you're \u201cin love\u201d. I hope that by seeing there are many ways to describe and define loving feelings in other cultures, you'll see it\u2019s not entirely your fault that you\u2019re unsure of your own feelings. Yes, blame it on our inability to define something so complex. If you want to know if you\u2019re \u201cin love\u201d, here is the simple question to ask yourself \u2026 and a simple \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d is the only way to answer: \u201cIf this person was completely disabled and stuck in a hospital bed for the rest of their life, and I was able, would I stay by their side and take care of them\u201d  Wow, that got dark fast. Well, if you think about this for a minute and realistically the answer is \u201cno\u201d, you are not alone. This is a very big deal and would take you sacrificing much of your own life's comfort for someone else's. Life will not be easy forever - you will go through hardships (hopefully never this drastic). If you said \u201cno\u201d to this question, please don't worry as it doesn't mean you don't have love for them at all, but it does reveal something extremely important about your true feelings and the relationship. Your definition of love may be different than theirs - and it's important that love must be returned equally for it to work long term. I'm divorced from a woman I loved dearly, and I learned this lesson the hard way. I personally wouldn't call what you're feeling as being \u201cin love\u201d if you can't answer this with a definite \u201cyes\u201d. I also would not marry another person if I couldn't answer \u201cyes\u201d to this question about them and they couldn't say the same thing back without thinking. -ZAKARY STAHLSMITH Follow me for more and/or upvote this to make my day P.S. If you can't tell by now - I love the movie Princess Bride. Seriously go watch it on Netflix with the family if you haven't yet. Even my 14 year old son liked it! And this is my cat Westley (if I got a girl cat she would have been Princess Buttercup, no doubt). He's a one year old tabby I saved from a local shelter and he has asthma. Yes, cats can have asthma as weird as that sounds and he needs his inhaler twice a day to avoid asthma attacks. I promise to give little Westley a rub on the head (he prefers his head being rubbed over his body) for each upvote to this answer. Yes, you can make my day \u2026 and Westley\u2019s day. Will he get 100 head rubs today?  ",

            "answer_text": "Love is a stupid emotion. You know that tingly little feeling you get when you like someone? That\u2019s common sense leaving your body. That\u2019s love happening\u2026 Love is just a word until someone comes along and gives it a definition.  According to me, love is an emotional feeling which reminds you of someone or something. A time spent which is always worth your tears. If I look back on my memories of childhood, I can remember an ugly looking doll which I loved the most. Often my parents got me new good-looking toys, but I always held that ugly one. My parents were mad about why can't I like these beautiful things and I loved that ugly one. Probably that was my first love.  When I experienced my first stupid one-sided love for a someone I was around 14. Since then, the stupid one-sided has been constant, the definition of love has kept updating. Recently, I got attached to someone whose definition of love was quite different from mine. She is quite different than me I really find her special. That\u2019s how it goes, right? Different and Special.  My writing made me fall in love with two beautiful persons. The one who finds me special and the one I find. The one who understands me and one I tried to. The one who is my mother and the one who is currently someone.  A moment after I posted one of my answers and was re-reading it, there were two lines written by me which pushed me into this deep unending thought process of defining love. Beginning: \u201cThis answer is for my love, only credential love?\u201d End: \u201cThank you for giving me this answer love and making me believe that love hurts. Indeed it does.\u201d Apparently that time my second credential was Something Lover and the answer that I wrote was a story related to something. After slogging my fingers for 7 hours I completed the answer and now I was trying to find an answer to my own question, only credential love? Damn, why did I write this\u2026 My research began and the journey of discovering this answer was the most beautiful yet painful exploration.  The story which I wrote was witnessed by me that day when someone woke me up in the morning at 5 AM like no one before. (I asked for it, a trust) I stopped asking for the reviews of my answer because I suddenly fell in love with my writing. I wrote a few flawless poems, although lame and wrote so much that I felt like a writer. Also the last text, I received from someone was, \u201cYou are becoming a Writer.\u201d Initially, my thoughts were that all this is for the love of my game, then I thought probably it\u2019s for my writing.  Often we push our limits in love and do silly things. I also committed some similar mistake. If I was the old me, I would have slept. I was going through a rough phase of life, jobless, laptop broke down, huge financial stress, mental pain and growing physical pain, I would have been frustrated and angry. But I was happy as I was writing for that someone. After 7 hours, I spend 7 more hours in cooking her answer (which was probably quite dumb), until my hands were numb in pain. A dark answer which landed me into my dungeons of pains, often I could visualize someone alongside. The excruciating pain of numerous people who always cheated and backstabbed me was growing in my head with emotional setbacks.  Who is this someone? Someone I find very special, in her apt words Angel. I feel she might be there in my life for a long time. As a friend, maybe a crime partner, a listener, sometimes the speaker, a guide and often an inspiration. Her crisp and precise writeups, which often speaks her heart content made me fall in love with her. Maybe only her writing? Maybe words are the best language of love and that is why I could feel the pain beneath her writings. The scars of her past is very deep and unimaginable, took me months to realize.  I was getting deeply and emotionally attached to her, a feeling that I never wanted to develop. I always knew that she was not emotionally available. She probably doesn\u2019t love her own self at present, so loving anyone is long way. She is quite similar to me, trying to please everyone at own cost. She often tries to understand me and when she will, she might know what I feel at the moment. I remember all of these moments because of it being cherishable, ecstatic, jubilant, euphoric and what not. In my mind, I started thinking that all this feeling, all this imagination, all these poems, all these writeups centred around her might not be worth the time and tears later. I was into her so much that for some moment that literally saw everything destroyed and felt like dying inside. I never wanted to complicate things in my mind but it just happened\u2026  A week after I had to convey my feelings because it was killing me from inside. I was selflessly being dragged into this dungeon of dark thoughts mostly. The air between felt convoluted and something was not right with me. My draft overflow with the content that is for her. I was happy, I wrote. I was sad, I wrote. I missed her, I wrote. Missing her hurts, really. The pain was, is overwhelming. All I can, or want to think of was her. All I could, or wanted to write, should have her. What did she do to me?  Often you live through my words. Don't you see that? They say you write your heart content beautifully. Is it? Is this love? Why so much? Not because of a pretty face or an old crush, it\u2019s because I think you fill a lot of pieces that I am missing, it\u2019s because I can count on you to push me to my limits. Really, it\u2019s because I plan on winning life and I think you can help me and maybe we can have a lot of fun, if together. I don't expect and I don't want anything, because it's not the time. Not today. ",

The thoughts of this person can bring a smile to your face even when you're tired to the bones.When you can see a future for yourself, and you see that person being a part of it - You somehow manage to fit them there! You have glaring differences between yourselves, yet you don't disrespect or force your opinions into the other person's space. You just let them be! When you can dream their dreams. It excites you when they tell you what they want to do in life, and all you want to do is see them through it. When a text from them in the middle of the day can put a smile to your face. When you can spill your darkest, innermost secrets to them, and not worry about being judged for those. When love songs actually being to make sense. (Stealing this point from some other post.. LOL!)Whether it's a happy news or a sad one, you want to tell them about it first thing! When you can talk for hours strung together, and still there are things aplenty left unsaid. Even in a jam packed day or schedule - You can make time for them. Same way, even in a jam packed room - your eyes can spot them easily! You can read their eyes and read the unspoken messages. Silence doesn't intimidate you. It just sits comfortably between you - like a well acquainted friend.Seeing them smile or hearing their laugh makes your day. You try to make them feel better when they're down - For their smile matters to you!When they're sick, it sends panic waves in you. Whether it's common cold or flu, you wish it gets done quickly. You pick up their tastes and do things that they love, even if you're not a great fan of it yourself. Simply because you care about them. You think of them even when they're not around or in conversation. It doesn't necessarily affect your flow of thoughts, but in the recesses of your mind - They're always there! Most importantly, it brings out the best in both of you. You strive to be a better person or at least a person better than yesterday's version when you love. Love brings your innate strengths to the fore.",

            "answer_text": "( I genuinely didn't wanna write about this as I don't want her to read this but since she does not follow me here, I am fine ) The girl in question is my ex- girlfriend (let's say Girl A) with whom I fell hopelessly in love and dated for a few months before she dumped me and decided to move on. I never stopped loving her after she left and the breakup was too hard on me. I spent endless nights drowning my sorrows in whiskey hoping to get her out of my head but couldn't. The more I tried, the more I missed her. I even involved myself in a meaningless relationship with another girl ( Girl B ) because my friends suggested this would help me move on. That didn't turn out well because I was always bringing Girl A into our conversations and Girl B felt intimidated at times. In fact, even sleeping with Girl B didn't help because I woke up the next morning every single time and missed Girl A even more. It got to the point where I realized that this was no crazy infatuation that would die out in a couple of months as I expected. So I decided to end it with Girl B for good. I continued with my earlier lifestyle of drinking liquor with and drunk dialing her sometimes so that I could just hear her voice. Little by little, I tried suppressing my feelings for her and I was partly successful because I had cut down on my drinking even though I still missed her a lot. A few months later, she called me out of the blue and we started catching up on lost time and decided to be friends again. We would call each other all the time and share every little detail about our day and it reminded of the time we were dating and just brought all those feelings back, except this time I could see and meet her often and listen to her soothing voice everyday. Until recently, we had a fight over something stupid and I overreacted and since then, we haven't said a word to each other ever since. I want to apologise except I don't think she will forgive me because I was too harsh on her during my outburst which she didn't deserve. I still love her though and miss her dearly and here are some things that remind me why I am in love with her : Every time I see a notification on my phone, I hope it's from her.I wake up, I see a hundred texts from acquaintances, pesky relatives, football groups but not one from her - I leave the messages unread and put down my phone again.I had lost my love for travelling since my college days and rarely went out of town. She had this infectious energy that reinvigorated my love for travelling and now I effectively go on trips each month.Sometimes, I get really mad at her and want to say a lot of things but when I see her face or hear her voice, my heart melts and I forget my anger totally.She has the most beautiful eyes and I could stare into them all day long.She has a shy smile that is the most beautiful sight in the world and I would give anything to see it everyday.She likes to talk a lot and I am a good listener, she is like a walking FM that I am addicted to.She is a little chubby but she thinks she is fat and this doesn't help her confidence but this is something I never cared about.I like how her eyes light up when I surprise her with chocolates.When she gets mad, there isn't anything I wouldn't do to calm her down and lighten her mood.She gives the most relaxing back massages that anyone could ever imagine.Sometimes I feel sad or upset and I just look at her old photos and they cheer me up.I used to write her little quotes every night describing how much I love her after she went to sleep so that she would wake up to something nice each day.I could probably go on & on and never run out of reasons but I feel this is enough to tell you how much I am in love with her :) ",

So don\u2019t be surprised if he asks you to help him with his maths worksheet even when he is the master of maths ;-)He will be very protective. You wanna test this ? Try crossing a busy street along with your guy. I bet he will hold your hands and while crossing the road he will walk beside you in such a way that if a car hits, he will be the one to get hit first.He will never fail to surprise you and make you laugh.He will smile and blush whenever your name comes up. I have seen the saddest face glowing with joy.He will cook for you. He will learn to cook your favourite dish.He will be jealous if he spots you talking with some other guy. He will keep taunting you for this. Yes we can be irritating. Please tolerate us. We love you if we know how to irritate you.He will tell his mom and sister about you. The most important sign.His heart will cry when you are in pain.He will play with your hair.

He will respect your decision and won\u2019t stop loving you even if you say NO. You will have to initiate the talk if you want to have it.

            "answer_text": "Here is the story of how I knew I was in love. I had been dating a woman I knew in a desultory manner when she told me she was having a party and that there would be many women there. I am guessing she was as tired of me as I was of her. However, when I arrived at the party I discovered it was a \"sausage fest\", all men and few women. So after making a couple of passes through the room I decided I had had enough and went to find the hostess to say thank you and leave.  When I found her she was talking to a woman who was sitting on her washing machine and laughing. I found the woman on the machine totally unattractive but I joined in the convo and soon it was just myself and this woman sitting on the machine. At that point in my life I was feeling very confident in myself. I was completely in shape, training for triathlons, meeting women, coming up in my career and so on. So after a few minutes of pleasant conversation I asked this woman for her number, feeling that I was \"doing her a favor\". She wrote t on a card and I stuck  it in my pocket and left and instantly forgot all about her. A week later while doing the laundry I  came across the card in my pants and decided to grace her with my presence and called to set up a date. Yes, I know I was being an arrogant asshole. When I went to pick her up at her suprisingly lovely house she invited me in and showed me around. Not only was she an accomplished musician, she was a competeten artist painting in oils and talented and spoke three languages. She kept a beautiful, stylish house with complex gardening she did herself. I was humbled and impressed. We passed a fun and enjoyable date, with laughter, no discomfort or awkwardness or unpleasantness and I asked her for another.  Our third date was set for Sunday at 3 PM. Without any clue in my head as to what I was doing I found myself pulling into her driveway at 1PM. I was completely confused. Not only could I not wait to see here, I felt I HAD to see her. Never having been in this position before, I drove to a nearby diner and read the paper, looking at the clock every 30 seconds waiting for it to be 3PM. For the life of me I could not figure out what the hell was going on. But when she finally opened the door at 3PM it was as if I had been struck by lightening. I was in love, and had been, but hadn't known it before. But I knew it then. And I knew she  was \"the one\". After only three dates, and without any real intimacy whatsoever I knew she was the one as I had never known anything before in my life.  So being a  moron, I wrecked the relationship in a bird-brained attempt to be perfect, do the perfect things, plan the perfect dates, say the wittiest perfect thing and so on. After a few more weeks she broke up with me. \"I just can't tell who you are anymore.\" I was not surprised -- neither could I.  She later married someone else, had twins and moved to another state. Fifteen years later I still sometimes check her out on Facebook or whatever, recalling the fateful words of poet John Greenleaf Whittier, \"The saddest words of tongue and pen -- the saddest are these, it might have been.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Oh I've been waiting a long time to answer this and answer it right. I'm gonna sway around and get distracted but bear with me. Once upon a time, in this social media frenzy world, I was the user of Twitter. I'd crack the lamest jokes, come up with the worst puns and still manage to get a few likes coz obviously I'm a chick. I made a lot of male friends over dm\u2019s and somehow it was just annoying to hold a conversation (I get distracted a lot). One fine day, this person comes along and starts talking about one of my favourite vadapav joints in Ahmedabad and we didn't stop talking about how delicious vadapav really is. I'm such a fan I could eat it everyday. This person found my blog too and appreciated it quite a bit. He had fallen for me way before I even knew him. Then he \u201cslid\u201d into my dm and the approach he used was so unnatural I had to reply back. Again, being the distracted lazy bum that I am, I'd conveniently forget about replying etc. Now this person held my attention the way no one had. We talked about the universe. How it came into existence, how we feel energies, how love devours and yet frees you. Wham! One day I was in love. JUST LIKE THAT. I went \u2018wtf\u2019 because I know myself. I was a shitty lover and a more selfish person. Some days (months) later we started what was going to be the biggest fucking adventure of my life. And we've just strapped ourselves in. Now, how do I know I'm in love? Well, I love to feed him my share of food and anyone who knows me well knows I don't part with my food. I have changed in ways I never thought I would. My partner has helped me grow in a way that's so holistic and natural, my parents appreciate it. Oh and my parents love him. Every waking moment of life since I've known him, I think of him. He's the biggest support system I have. Every time I feel even a little pain anywhere he comes along, swoops me up and plants a kiss on my head. Honestly it's the best thing ever. I love being a kid around him. I love being a lady around him. His eyes speak so much, he never needs to say it to me (trust me, I've never been the reading eyes kinda gal). All I want to do is to hold him forever, to never have him feel pain, to never letting things bother him. He envelops me like a human igloo (I ain't calling you fat, Robbie). To cherish what we get bestowed with is one of the greatest gifts we give ourselves. It makes me sad to see people being with their husbands and wives and not loving each other. To see their partners as a competition. Only when you share love will you get more love. And I give full credit to my wonderful hoo-man for inculcating the values that I forgot I ever had in me. ",

            "answer_text": "Love can sneak up on you when you least expect it. I had been accepted in the American Airlines \"stewardess\" training program back when it was a more glamorous career. This happened in January and training was scheduled for September. I was enjoying my job as a research assistant in child abuse at a well respected medical center, dating medical students and interns, one of whom had already professed his love for me. I spent weekends skiing and went to Canada for a week with the local ski club where I caught the eye of   the man of the hour, an older, charming great looking fella who drank too much. His reputation for loving and leaving women was well known. Oh well, it's only for a week. I didn't hear from him when we got back, but I had plenty of attention to keep me busy. But soon the call came to go skiing. Sure, why, not? He picked me up in a Porsche. Gulp, I'm such a pushover for European sports cars. Still I knew that if I didn't beat him to the bottom of the mountain (hard, because he was a better skiier than I), he would be chatting it up with whatever woman he rode with on the ski lift. As winter turned to summer, he introduced me to sailing. Up to one end of a 26 mile lake, camp on an island, sail back on Sunday. What heavenly delight! Still, waking up one morning I noticed his greying beard, smelled the vodka on his breath and said to myself, \"what am I doing with this old drunk?\" When meeting people on the island, they would invaryingly joke \"Is she your first mate?\" And I would reply \"Not the first and not the last!\" With my leaving on the horizon in September, I still had my head on straight, although I can say it was the best \"send off \" I could possibly have imagined. Until he said he loved me. What???? And then he proposed. With a ring and everything.I did not cancel my departure, but asked for an extension. No one could believe the mighty Harry had been \"caught\", least of all me. I think we had 60-90 days of unbridled happiness before it all went south.  It was probably more complicated than this, but it seemed like the arguments began because I had the temerity to suggest we might set a wedding date. My world fell apart when we ended. Fell apart in every way. I never went to stewardess school, but my career life was a resounding success. I looked for pieces of him in men for the rest of my life. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer can change so much about your life, from how you interact with a current (or potential) partner to how you view yourself to what goals you have for the future. Think you might be in love? Gain some insight by considering these research-based signs of love and attachment. You\u2019re addicted to this person. Love changes the brain. In early-stage relationships, that euphoria that people feel appears as heightened neural activity in dopamine-rich areas of the brain\u2014areas linked to the reward system\u2014and in areas associated with the pursuit of rewards. There\u2019s even some hint of activity in the anterior cingulate, the area of the brain linked to obsessive thinking, which is a classic experience when people are falling in love (Aron, Fisher, Mashek, Strong, & Brown, 2005). As a relationship progresses into a long-term partnership, thinking about the partner activates the reward centers as well as brain areas implicated in attachment, but less so obsessive thinking (Acevedo, Aron, Fisher, & Brown, 2011).You really want your friends or family to like this person. New evidence shows that people are often motivated to \u201cmarshal support\u201d for someone they are dating (Patrick & Faw, 2014), which is consistent with the idea that the people in a person\u2019s social circle often play an important role in the success of a relationship (Sprecher, 2011). Being attuned to how your family and friends might think about your partner or potential partner is a good sign that you are becoming increasingly attached to the person.You celebrate this person\u2019s triumphs (even when you yourself fail).If you\u2019ve fallen in love with someone, you probably have an atypical reaction when witnessing them excelling at something you don\u2019t. Because romantic partners feel connected and can share the outcomes of each other\u2019s successes, romantic partners will often feel pride and positive emotions when they see their partner succeed, even at something they themselves can\u2019t do, rather than feeling negative and inferior (Lockwood & Pinkus, 2014).You definitely like this person, and this person likes you.  Liking is different from love, but is often a prerequisite for falling in love. In a cross-cultural study, researchers showed that a critical factor recognized as directly preceding falling in love is reciprocal liking, when you both clearly like each other (Riela, Rodriguez, Aron, Xu, & Acevedo, 2010). In addition, an evaluation of the other person\u2019s personality as highly desirable tends to be a precursor to falling in love.You really miss this person when you\u2019re apart.In many ways, how much you miss a person reflects how interdependent your lives have become. If you are questioning whether you love someone, perhaps consider how much you miss him or her when you\u2019re apart. Le and colleagues (2008) showed that how much people miss each other tends to correspond with how committed they feel to the relationship.Your sense of self has grown through knowing this person.When people fall in love, their whole sense of self changes. They take on new traits and characteristics, growing in the diversity of their self-concept through the influence of their new relationship partner (Aron, Paris, & Aron, 1995). In other words, the you before falling in love is different from the you after falling in love. Maybe you feel the difference, maybe others notice it, but the things you care about, your habits, how you spend you time\u2014and or all of this is subject to the (hopefully positive) influence of a new romantic partner.You get jealous\u2014but not suspicious.A certain amount of jealousy is actually healthy, not toxic. From an evolutionary perspective, jealousy is an adaptation that helps relationships stay intact by making its members sensitive to potential threats. People who are jealous tend to be more committed to relationships (Rydell, McConnell, & Bringle, 2004). Keep the jealousy in check, though: Reactive or emotional jealousy is the type that is predicted by positive relationship factors like dependency and trust\u2014but people who engage in suspicious jealousy, which includes taking actions like secretly checking a partner's cellphone, tends to be associated with relational anxiety, low self esteem, and chronic insecurity (Rydell & Bringle, 2007).Falling in love and building an attachment are a wonderful basis for a healthy relationship, but keep in mind that staying in a relationship (or, for that matter, choosing to start one) is often based on more than satisfaction and feeling good in another person\u2019s presence. Models of relationship success (such as Rusbult\u2019s investment model) show that the staying power of relationships takes mutual investment and commitment. If love is passion, security, and emotional comfort, commitment is the necessary decision made within one\u2019s cultural and social contexts to be with that person. Relationship observers\u2014and people who watch romantic comedies\u2014know that love needs the buttressing of commitment to flourish into a stable and healthy partnership. ",

            "answer_text": "Falling in love is one of the most exciting, rewarding and scariest things you could ever do. Once you\u2019re in love with someone, it\u2019s hard to remember how you lived without him or her. Of course, you were alive before you met this person, but you really didn\u2019t start \u201cliving\u201d until the two of you met. There are few things which will tell you that you in love : When after reading her message you start smiling.Seeing her in person is the best part of the day. No matter how your day must be going but seeing her always bring a smile on your face.You get angry when someone else comments about her.When you go beyond limits just to make sure that everything is perfect for her. For example: If I tried to construct a list of things I wouldn\u2019t do for her, the list would be pretty empty. When you\u2019re in love with someone, you do whatever you can to make her happy.My personal favourite : She is the first thought in your mind when you wake up and last thought before you go to bed :)When you listen to every little detail she expressed earlier and implement it afterwards to show that you really care.When her words like \u201cBuddhu\u201d and \u201cPagal\u201d(mad) makes your day.When your face lit up as soon as she calls :)When she cracks a PJ and only you laugh because she was laughing.When her mood affects your mood.The best part is when you tease her about makeup and she being fat , she thinks that I am making fun of her but I was just truly admiring her beauty.You became a better person yourself just to impress her ;)When you just create unnecessary doubts in your subject , so you could discuss it with her in person as well as on the phone. That feeling is amazing ;)When suddenly you starts listening to romantic songs because that reminds you of her.When your feelings for her are unconditional i.e. you do things for her but does not expect anything from her. If that`s the case, then you are in true love :)When her needs became much more important than your own.Sometime along the way, I feel that she is my best friend. I believe this to be true for most people who fall in love.So how many of you are in love ? ",

Oh boy/girl, you are in love with them.\"Some people can love you more in a year than others could love you in fifty. Some people can teach you more within a single day than others could teach you over the entire course of a lifetime.PS: There are lot more other answers too. I don\u2019t know much or to add something more different but i guess these are reasonable enough to know better and requite back. ATB!",

            "answer_text": "The simple answer is that you get butterflies in your stomach when she walks into the room, at least for a while when you start dating.  You think about her all the time.  You stop hanging out with your buddies to be with her all the time.  You can't imagine her not in your life.  You would do anything for her and you do everything for her.  You would die for her.  This is the positive spin. I'll let Dr. Hook explain the down side: When you're in love with a beautiful woman It's hard When you're in love with a beautiful woman You know it's hard  Everybody wants her Everybody loves her Everybody wants to take your baby home  When you're in love with a beautiful woman You watch your friends When you're in love with a beautiful woman It never ends You know that it's crazy You want to trust her Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone When you're in love with a beautiful woman You go it alone  Maybe it's just an ego problem Problem is, I've been fooled before By fair weathered friends and faint hearted lovers And everytime it happens It just convinces me more  When you're in love with a beautiful woman You watch her eyes When you're in love with a beautiful woman You look for lies Everybody tempts her Everybody tells her She's the most beautiful woman they know  When you're in love with a beautiful woman You go it alone When you're in love with a beautiful woman You watch your friends When you're in love with a beautiful woman Yeah it never ends When you're in love with a beautiful woman You watch her eyes When you're in love with a beautiful woman You keep looking for lies ",

            "answer_text": "For me I has never bee a love at first time, attraction sure, but it never moves to obsession or love , until I know someone very well. So for me love strikes during the due course of friendship and when that friendship transcends into love , I sit and look back at my actions and behavior for past few days and I am like \u201c oh, Shit you are knee deep into love\u201d. For me it is as surreal as depicted in movies. It starts with very subconscious actions like hanging out more than usual. I can be find hanging around the person a lot, so much that people start taking notice of it and first person they contact when I am missing is well, you know. Soon after my brain starts registering my restlessness , my anxiety when I wait for their replies to my text and my stomach starts to churn with excitement when I converse , which never used too happen when we were friends. I never end the conversation, the chats , it goes on until the \u2018person\u2019 ends it . I can go on for ever. Finally when it fully strikes and I realize that I wake up and sleep with the thought of the same person in my head and I smile when the thought strikes. Then it all begins, bringing up their names in conversation to know about their whereabouts when I don\u2019t see them. My eyes constantly searching for them and when finally I spot them, the smile on my face, my sinking heart and butterflies in my stomach all start working together. Just their voice lit my face, put a smile on my lips and sparkle in my eyes. Then I have this urge to get out of the limb to help them and to protect them no matter what, even if it means lose on my part. Then come the urges for physical touches , the smells and spending time alone. The final sign that now I am in love is jealousy. I become territorial and God, do I get jealous and try to intervene every other interaction of that person, not in malicious way but in that sweet rom-com way. The only difference is life do not have a background track but then what is the playlist for? When I put those head phones on every song is about us. Thanks for the question and making me relive those moment of love, it has been so long since I felt like this. Love thy name is sweet bitching poison!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "For me, I know I'm in love when I want to sacrifice some of my own time and energy, so that the person I'm in love with is happy and content with his life.  I find that people realize they're in love when they can't stand the thought of living their lives without the other person. It also has to do a little with attachment, but that's another topic for another time. But when the thought of losing someone becomes so unbearable that you think you'd rather die - you're so screwed! And you're also pretty much in love. But don't take this the wrong way - it's only a feeling, a very intense emotional impact when you think you might lose that person. Mature people obviously know that they CAN actually live without them. Another crucial thing that happens is that you inexplicably realize that the well-being, success, goals and needs of the person you love suddenly become extremely important to you.  Since people are inherently selfish and everyone lives for themselves - it's something as special as love that makes someone want to spend a lot of their own time and effort on the person that they love as much as on themselves. Finally, the thing to realize is that love can be of many sorts - parental love, romantic love, friendship love, etc. All of those require commitment and attachment on your part, and once you cross the threshold where you would get incredibly emotional even at the thought of losing that person somehow - that's how you know you're in love. That feeling builds gradually over time. Just don't confuse this with extreme possessiveness. I don't really believe in the butterflies in your stomach - that feeling is infatuation and lust, but not love.

            "answer_text": "Okay , so here it is. For example , a boy and a girl are friends . They don't talk directly to each other , but they chat and share their feelings with one another . The girl knows whom to speak to when she is depressed or is in trouble. Now , the boy , who is in his busy schedule and rigorous work , just removes a sec from his work and there pops a message on his phone that \u201c Can you help me ?\u201d and he , helps her and comforts her each and every time she looks sad or disappointed. He asks himself , \u201c Why do I get so affected when she is in trouble ? And this doesn't happen 1 or 2 times , but a good 7 8 times. He makes her laugh , cares for her every single darn time . He waits for her to come online . Whenever she is online , he puts up a msg or a greeting for her to notice and talk to her. He just wants to bond with her and ask her about her daily routine . He comes forward and wants to know about her likes and dislikes. Whenever he puts up a msg, he waits for her reply . The value of that wait is priceless. When she reaches home , he calls her to ensure that she reached home safely or not . When she is not well, he calls or msgs her to take care of herself. When she is absent , he tries to know the reason from her or her friends . He feels lonely when she isn't there present alongside him . He keeps every single promise made to her . He automatically starts behaving differently . Even when she lies to him , he happily accepts whatever she says . He cannot watch a single tear roll down her cheeks . His day goes amazingly fabulous when he sees her smiling face everyday. It doesn't matter what problem he is facing or what situation he is going through , he just walks happily due to her sight . Whenever she is around , he shies away and controls his heartbeats . He gets incredibly jealous when he sees her talking to other guys or men . When the school or college leaves , he waits for one sight of her . He smiles sheepishly when she looks at him . He feels good just by her presence . He controls his emotions when he feels her around . He takes time just to chat with her . He saves each and every picture of her in his gallery . His mind goes for a toss when accidentally she touches him . He cares for her decisions and whatever choices she makes . And last but not the least , if he truly loves her , it doesn't matter if she is with him or not , he acknowledges her decision and choices and lets her live her life the way she wants and whoever guy she wants and loves . Hence , these are the many reasons when you get to know that you have truly fallen head over heals for someone. ",

            "answer_text": "I am at risk of giving an answer that is not really an answer, because I think the real answer is that ultimately, you never really know. Unsatisfying. I know. But anyway: I was completely certain beyond doubt that I was in love with my first boyfriend. I felt drawn to him. Woke up thinking about him. Wanted everyone to see I was the lucky girl who got to be with him. The thought of him made me dizzy in a good way. There were days in school, where I simply couldn\u2019t concentrate, because my mind would keep replaying a fraction of a memory of a shared intimate moment over and over and I was unable to stop it. I was so sure I was in love - I even got a tattoo - not of his name, thank fuck, but of something that had more meaning to him than me and was meant to be a symbol of our everlasting love. Guess what? The relationship didn\u2019t last, we broke up and very soon after I had a new boyfriend. This time I was really sure. I felt even more drawn to him. I woke up and went to bed thinking about him. The thought of him made me dizzy in ways I didn\u2019t know existed before that. I almost dropped out of college for him. And you know what\u2019s really funny - he was a tattoo artist - so I got tattooed again in honour of the relationship: This time even by him. This one crashed and burned really hard. I don\u2019t like the label \u201cabuse\u201d, because there are always two sides to every story and we both inflicted our fair share of pain on each other, but the end of this relationship is still one of the worst memories I will ever have. I changed my views on what being in love meant after that. If what I\u2019d felt in these two failed attempts had really been love and love could lead to this\u2026 well, then I just didn\u2019t like it very much at all. When I met my current boyfriend, there was no dizziness. There was a lot of clarity in what we both wanted. There were lots of great conversations, lots of inspiring thoughts about ourselves and each other. We agreed on what we liked and what we wanted and how we enjoyed our time together. I\u2019ve had other friendships start the exact same way. There was no \u201cfalling\u201d involved in how we became a couple. No out of control can\u2019t-help-it crash of emotions raining down on me. I loved him as a person long before I experienced any sort of chemical reaction. The feelings I have for him now, are deep and solid. So today I am again sure beyond a doubt that that must be what it feels like to be in love, because it\u2019s just so much better and so much more profound. But I was sure the first two times, too. So I\u2019ll just have to be content with settling on this definition, because I sure as hell don\u2019t want to let him go, just to find out, if there maybe is something more. Maybe there always is something more, but there is something more in the depth of a relationship that works too. If you have to ask the question though, you\u2019re probably not. It seems to come with some kind of, most likely very misplaced, certainty. ",

            "answer_text": "Suppose if you fall in love with her!! Your hormones go wild. When you fall in love, your cheeks flush, your heart beats faster, your palms are sweaty and your head starts spinning. This is all thanks to a rush of chemicals and hormones that flood your brain and body when you fall in love. You go blind. As the old adage goes, love is blind. When you're falling in love, everything your love does and says is interesting and amazing. Every word uttered from her mouth, and every move she makes, is magical. Love blinds you to faults and screwups, and even when you do notice her, you're quick to forgive because your love can do no wrong. You're comfortable with making little sacrifices for her. You wouldn't put off your responsibilities for her, but if she is sick and needs you to help take care of her instead of going to brunch one morning, you're totally cool with that. Little things, like going to the grocery store, are better when she's around. You re-read her text messages. This is an undeniable one. You keep the entire texting conversation you have with her. When she sends you a text, you often smile and read it a couple times just for good measure. You smile when you're alone. Smile texting is the perfect example of what happens when you're falling in love. You experience weird, giddy feelings of happiness, even when you're not physically with that special person. Two minutes with her is worth more than a whole day without her. Ever get a short text from her that sends a jolt of excitement through you and puts a smile on your face for the rest of the day? Does your heart skip a beat if she calls you just to say hi or to talk about anything for a couple minutes? You have more energy As you go through your day, you feel more alive and energetic, as if you have a constant adrenaline rush going through you. You feel more productive, like you can take on the world every single day. You do boring stuff with her just to have the chance to spend more time with her. Does she have to go to the super market because she\u2019s out of fruits? Sounds like fun! No matter how boring it is or how much you\u2019d normally hate it, you\u2019d never turn down the chance to do it with her. You\u2019re endlessly curious about her. You literally can\u2019t help but be interested in every little detail about her. You do embarrassing things You do things outside of your comfort zone. You suddenly care more about your appearance. You sing. When you're falling in love, you feel so happy and carefree, you can't always keep it inside. Love is exciting; it's addicting, it's confusing and it's weird. PS : ; ",

You know you are in love when their slightest faux pas will wrong you like the greatest crime, and their slightest kind word will reward you like the most exalted encomium. You know you are in love when their attentions to another will hurt you with more pain than thumbscrews. You know you are in love when you imagine your phone vibrating in your pocket, even if its not, and check it for messages every other second. You know you are in love, when you associate everything you come across with them, even if it is in the most convoluted manner humanly possible. You know you are in love when you seek to do things on the other person's behalf even without a request for help. You know you are in love when nature becomes all the more beautiful in your eyes, and seemingly mundane sights exhilarate you. You know you are in love when you answer questions like this despite seeing several answers purporting to do the same. ",

            "answer_text": "Easy: You just know. Because you decide to love. *** I was madly in love with someone who didn\u2019t love me back. I was heartbroken. Hurt. Hopeless. My ego was shaken, shredded into many, many tiny pieces and I thought I couldn\u2019t manage to forget him. The truth is, I even refused to forget him - because of his face, his attitudes, his thoughts and the possibility and the potential of our interaction - even after a year I was still hoping he would turn to me and say: \u201cKeso, this is it - I fell in love with you and let\u2019s be together!\u201d but oh boy, it didn\u2019t happen and I was worrying I would be like that for like forever until when I suddenly realized I do not care. At all. How? I just decided to not care about it. but HOW?! I agree. It takes a lot of work. On yourself. You should love yourself in order to make such decisions. Without self-help, self-compassion (but not self-pity) you can\u2019t decide anything. Self love means developing confidence, rational mind. Self love means to know and love your emotions so much that you can control and move them into preferred direction. For example, if you can\u2019t decide whether you love someone or not, just imagine being with him in a long run - would you go for it? The main goal of every relationship is to live together and help each other grow into something significant. Are you ready to make him your life partner? No? Because you\u2019re scared and you hesitate? You are not ready for loving them. I mean, yeah, you may not have enough finances to live together, but you should be ready to PLAN ahead and making this person your goal. This is when you\u2019re sure. But what if you\u2019re not sure about them being your potential? Then it\u2019s you, not them. You should practice self-love. Because self love also means being sure and confident about your life decisions. You should love yourself first to be able to make major life decisions. Everyone deserves to be loved, and you should respect every person enough to tell them the truth. The truth that is solid and firm - you either love them or not. Forget about the bullshit media, TV series and romantic movies are telling you - it\u2019s either yes or no. There are no actual struggles, there is no timing, there are no real barriers - it\u2019s YOU who defines your reality and life. and again, you need self love to realize that. Now, what if you\u2019re already ready to plan and make them your future partner? That means you love them. Don\u2019t worry about the future - it\u2019s you who shapes it. Don\u2019t make a tragedy out of it, if it\u2019s temporary. Everything changes and accept it. and just relax, enjoy your love. It\u2019s that simple, you know. I was stuck in past and the idealized future and heartbroken in present, so I couldn\u2019t think clearly. I didn\u2019t realize the reality around me. I thought the reality was creating me and my major plans, so I didn\u2019t imagine him as my life partner. I just wanted to love him NOW! To have him NOW! Because I was not actually loving him, but I was IN love with him. Loving him means that you consciously CHOOSE them and MAKE them your life priority, and you simply know that it\u2019s your future. You\u2019re FREE at choosing your priorities. You DEFINE your future. You become one with the reality and it\u2019s the real you and authenticity who decides. Love is not a feeling, it\u2019s a verb, which is aroused by feelings. So it\u2019s really beautiful. Well, I\u2019m not saying that you should be with everyone who passes by - you can\u2019t. Simply, because of your subjective nature and requirements. Your standards. Your feelings. Because loving thyself also means having standards. The existence of standards doesn\u2019t exclude unconditional love. In fact, unconditional love is indeed quite conditionally based. We never choose someone who isn\u2019t visually appealing and we know we won\u2019t like them. We have to like them somehow in order to choose them. then we can love them unconditionally and selflessly. Everything else is just a myth and sentimentalism, that is quite overrated and is far away from the reality. It\u2019s only true in religions, movies, books, TV shows and in fantasy, generally. After the heartbreak, I realized I had an opportunity. I started loving myself, developing confidence and rational mind, to think clearly and I suddenly noticed the guy, who is my boyfriend now and now I do LOVE him dearly and deeply. Because I decided to love him. I couldn\u2019t make it work with just anybody, because real love is a byproduct of reality and self-love and familiarity and conscious feelings and something personal as well. So, all I wanted to say is that you just know, dear. You\u2019ll just know and accept the fact that you love someone. Being IN love doesn\u2019t require self love, but loving someone does. So, which one do you choose - being IN love and hurt, or really love-ing someone and being happy? Make your choice and shape it. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you know if you\u2019re in love? The answer can change so much about your life, from how you interact with a current (or potential) partner to how you view yourself to what goals you have for the future. Think you might be in love? Gain some insight by considering these research-based signs of love and attachment. You\u2019re addicted to this person. Love changes the brain. In early-stage relationships, that euphoria that people feel appears as heightened neural activity in dopamine-rich areas of the brain\u2014areas linked to the reward system\u2014and in areas associated with the pursuit of rewards. There\u2019s even some hint of activity in the anterior cingulate, the area of the brain linked to obsessive thinking, which is a classic experience when people are falling in love (Aron, Fisher, Mashek, Strong, & Brown, 2005). As a relationship progresses into a long-term partnership, thinking about the partner activates the reward centers as well as brain areas implicated in attachment, but less so obsessive thinking (Acevedo, Aron, Fisher, & Brown, 2011).You really want your friends or family to like this person. New evidence shows that people are often motivated to \u201cmarshal support\u201d for someone they are dating (Patrick & Faw, 2014), which is consistent with the idea that the people in a person\u2019s social circle often play an important role in the success of a relationship (Sprecher, 2011). Being attuned to how your family and friends might think about your partner or potential partner is a good sign that you are becoming increasingly attached to the person.You celebrate this person\u2019s triumphs (even when you yourself fail). If you\u2019ve fallen in love with someone, you probably have an atypical reaction when witnessing them excelling at something you don\u2019t. Because romantic partners feel connected and can share the outcomes of each other\u2019s successes, romantic partners will often feel pride and positive emotions when they see their partner succeed, even at something they themselves can\u2019t do, rather than feeling negative and inferior (Lockwood & Pinkus, 2014).You definitely like this person, and this person likes you. Liking is different from love, but is often a prerequisite for falling in love. In a cross-cultural study, researchers showed that a critical factor recognized as directly preceding falling in love is reciprocal liking, when you both clearly like each other (Riela, Rodriguez, Aron, Xu, & Acevedo, 2010). In addition, an evaluation of the other person\u2019s personality as highly desirable tends to be a precursor to falling in love.You really miss this person when you\u2019re apart. In many ways, how much you miss a person reflects how interdependent your lives have become. If you are questioning whether you love someone, perhaps consider how much you miss him or her when you\u2019re apart. Le and colleagues (2008) showed that how much people miss each other tends to correspond with how committed they feel to the relationship.Your sense of self has grown through knowing this person. When people fall in love, their whole sense of self changes. They take on new traits and characteristics, growing in the diversity of their self-concept through the influence of their new relationship partner (Aron, Paris, & Aron, 1995). In other words, the you before falling in love is different from the you after falling in love. Maybe you feel the difference, maybe others notice it, but the things you care about, your habits, how you spend you time\u2014and or all of this is subject to the (hopefully positive) influence of a new romantic partner.For more interesting stories, download the Lopscoop application from Google play store and earn extra money by sharing it on social media.",

This means when push comes to shove your core values are the same even though your styles may vary radically. You can survive personality clashes, but it is extremely difficult to survive principled inconsistencies. - You communicate, verbally, in silence, when apart or however it may be. You never or rarely stop communicating. Whenever you are apart and experience something new you miss having your partner by your side to tell them about it. - Even though you need each other you don\u2019t strangle yourselves. You feel the need to be together but respect each other\u2019s individuality. - You are absolutely honest about each other, your downfalls, your finances, your quirks, everything. You hide nothing from the other and feel no need to do so. - Both of you feel comfortable in each other\u2019s family environment, meaning there are no great differences, even though there is not necessarily a great relationship. - You have similar or satisfy each other\u2019s sexual needs. You know, understand and respect the sexual limits of one another. At the same time you also perceive what doors are absolutely closed and which, with time and patience, might be opened. - You have similar ideas regarding birth control and children (to have or not, number of children if any, their formation, education and each one\u2019s responsibility in the process). - Your ideas respect of Religion, Politics and other sensitive points of view are the same, similar, or at most, close enough not to generate serious or irreconcilable differences in your relationship. - You understand once you are married you are a family unto itself, and are not only willing but also obligated to each other and to this \u201cnew\u201d family over every other family relationship. - Overall you feel more complete as a couple than as an individual. - You laugh together more often than not. You have the capacity to laugh together and at the same time at each other without offense. - Each one of you wants to give the other happiness. - You both understand that all the differences, fights and troubles you survive together are but a strengthening of your ties, and you are capable of resolving these issues to your mutual satisfaction.

            "answer_text": "The first and foremost thing that one needs to realize is that there is no universal definition of Love but in order to know the answer to this question you do need to have a definition of Love. How can you answer a question if you don't understand a critical piece of it? Then how do you proceed? Having realized this problem, the second thing then for everyone who is seriously looking for an answer to this question is to realize that the only way to proceed is by developing their own definition of love. Not something fuzzy but a very crisp definition which he/she can write down on a piece of paper. Which he/she can explain to others. If you can't put your understanding of love into words then it is unlikely that you have given it enough thought. While doing this exercise, be truthful to yourself. Whatever definition you create, always ask yourself - Would you like to live with a person who follows your definition of love? Lastly, having developed your definition of Love. You only have to check whether your feelings and actions towards the specific person are in sync with that definition. If so, then you are in love. REMEMBER: Your definition of love is your own. NEVER judge any other person's love by your definition of love because they might have a different definition. If you want to find out whether a person really loves you or not, just ask them their definition of love and then silently observe if their actions fit their definition. If they are not able to produce their own definition of love, then it is likely (but not certain) that they are only infatuated. If their actions do not match their definition, look harder. Since generally its unlikely to happen that way. We tend to misinterpret others actions according to our definition instead of theirs. Having taken that caution, if it still doesn't match, then that person needs to know about it. P.S. Initially I wanted to ignore answering this question because Love is a very subjective matter, but User's response to my comment to her answer begged a separate answer to this question. Love and Infatuation are two totally different feelings. Infatuation causes a lot of anxiety, Love shouldn't do that. Love is also quite different from being in a 'Loving relationship'. Love is a one way affair, a loving relationship is a two way affair. The one way relationship isn't too bad if your definition of love is based on giving rather then getting. ",

Do you need more time to get to know each other? If you answered 'Yes' to all of these questions, wow, you feel very strongly about this person. It sounds like you're in love! If you're wondering if you're in love, this is often because you might base a decision on your answer. Be careful! Decisions should not be based just on the feeling of 'love'. You should also look at respect, commitment and trust. Ask yourself what it means to you if you believe you're in love. Don't put pressure on yourself to define what you're feeling as love. And don't let anyone else pressure you either. If you're not sure of the answer right now. Give it some time and ask yourself these questions a few months or a year down the road. You might be surprised to see how your feelings change.

            "answer_text": "1. You can\u2019t get enough cheesy love songs.I\u2019m not saying that cheesy love songs don\u2019t always have their place (I practically have Celine Dion\u2019s entire catalog tattooed on my ribcage), but there is a point at which even the most bubblegum-ready songs become the New Theme Song of Your Life. To put it in perspective, I once found myself on the brink of actual human tears while listening to \u201cHey There, Delilah,\u201d which I proceeded to put on repeat for the next 45 minutes. To be fair, I was 18 and facing down the prospect of a long-distance relationship. But still, this kind of unacceptable insanity is only excused for those in the heady throes of love. 2. You find any reason to bring them up.While there are going to undoubtedly be legitimate occasions to bring up your beloved, you might want to think about why your brain suddenly seems to make no distinction between \u201cthis incredible person I\u2019m in love with\u201d and \u201cliterally everything else on the planet.\u201d If your roommate is wondering what you guys should make for dinner, and she suggests lasagna, and you\u2019re like \u201cOh my god, so-and-so just has the cutest cat. He was totally crawling around the living room when we were making out and watching movies last night. So-and-so is such a good kisser. And has such a cute cat. You know, a cat. Like Garfield. Who is also a cat. The cat that loves lasagna. I\u2019m sorry \u2014 we can eat whatever,\u201d chances are you may be thinking of them more than would be considered normal. 3. Everything they do seems cute and endearing.There will come a time when your beloved\u2019s habits might start to err towards the irritating side, depending on how disruptive and frequent they are. It\u2019s only natural. But for now, though, enjoy thinking that everything they do is just perfect and adorable \u2014 from the way they don\u2019t replace the toilet paper roll, to the way they take one single fork out of thedishwasher to use instead of emptying it, to the way they don\u2019t cover their mouth when they cough. Scoop up all those precious germs, wouldn\u2019t want to miss a drop of their intoxicating goodness. 4. You find yourself fantasizing about a life together.If, at a certain point while looking for a toothbrush holder at Bed, Bath and Beyond, you find yourself utterly paralyzed in front of a set of matching hand towels, overwhelmed with the thought of sharing a home with this person you can\u2019t get enough of \u2014 you could very well be in love. If this fantasy extends to the kind of pet you\u2019d like, what you would call your children, and the compulsion to write your married names all over a sheet of looseleaf \u2014 you are pressed like a fresh panini. Embrace it. 5. The only thing that matters is being with them. Not that there isn\u2019t a lot to be said for intricate or adventurous outings, but one of the truer signs of love is the utter indifference towards what you are you actually doing, so long as you are with your dearest. The two of you, in fact, are more than content to spend an entire afternoon lying in bed naked, telling each other what you like about each other and generally being vomit-inducing to everyone who is not you. Outside of your little world, nothing exists \u2014 just remember to eat at least semi-regular meals in between all of your butterfly kisses. 6. You begin to retreat from society.It\u2019s not that your friends aren\u2019t awesome, because they totally are. It\u2019s just that, for at least a few weeks, you are going to just fall off the face of the planet because nothing \u2014 not even President Obama riding up on a jet ski on a tidal wave of Corona ready to bring you to the beach party hosted by a naked Ryan Gosling \u2014 is as interesting or as engaging as being with your beloved. You\u2019ll get back to them, it\u2019s cool. 7. You are constantly denying being in love.It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t believe you, love, it\u2019s just that, if your response to \u201cHey did you hang out with so-and-so this weekend?\u201d is \u201cWILL YOU SHUT THE HELL UP NANCY DREW I DON\u2019T LOVE HIM OKAY GET OFF MY BACK JESUS,\u201d welp\u2026 8. All of a sudden, you\u2019re a poet.There is an unspoken but universal law which states that any vaguely emotional blogging, Tweeting, status updating, or other forms of mass communication performed while in the heady throes of infatuation are not to be held against you. If you are up late one night and publish something along the lines of \u201cYou are the waves crashing against the sands of my beach, a depth of blue that seemed impossible to my parched skin,\u201d it\u2019s okay. We won\u2019t judge. Just remember to make them private once you come to your senses. 9. You constantly feel like the words are going to slip out of your mouth.It\u2019s an understandable fear that, at some uncertain point, you are going to see your beloved smile in a particular way while wiping a bit of ice cream from your lip while out at lunch and respond by literally exploding into a million pieces of confetti while screaming \u201cI LOVE YOU.\u201d We all know what that feels like. But it\u2019s better to accept that it is how you feel and set to finding a good way to express this, rather than suppressing it like some volcano of terrifying levels of emotion, only to erupt at some unknown moment all over the both of you. 10. Everything seems unreasonably fun and happy.Have you ever noticed how beautiful flowers are? How about how cute little kis are? And that couple making out over there \u2014 good for them! They know what\u2019s up! Oh, my god, let\u2019s get some candy! Candy comes in so many beautiful, bright colors. Everything is just so perfect. It\u2019s not too hot, not too cold. Let\u2019s go for a walk. I don\u2019t care where we go. Let\u2019s just hang out. Or maybe we\u2019ll cuddle under a blanket. I love blankets. Let\u2019s knit a blanket with our initials in it. Oh, my god, an adorable old couple holding hands! DYINGGGGGG.  Source - 10 Signs You Are In Love ",

            "answer_text": "When you're in love, you constantly try to look for them or search for them.When you're in love and you see him/her, you might feel a sudden shock in your heart and your hearts might beat faster.Your heart may pound very fast, you may be blushing or be excited and nervous. Remember to have patience in love. Timing is everything.If you end up or ended up thinking about a certain person as you are or were reading the article, its probably love.When you're listening to love songs and you think about \"that special person\", it may be a sign that you are in love.Don't rush love! Find someone perfect for you. Don't force yourself to \"love\" somebody just because they're popular, or you think you should.If just the sight of them brings a smile to your face and makes you excited, then you probably love them. Especially if just thinking of them makes you happier.If you think about him/her first thing in the morning and as the last thing at night, chances are that you are in love.If you're in love, then you will notice them for their inner beauty not for how they look.They make you get a surge of happiness or excitement, but most importantly they inspire you to be the best YOU even if they don't return the love back.If you are dating but haven't been dating for a long time, then don't assume you love them and will always love them. Making big decisions like getting married or losing your virginity may seem like a good idea at the time, but you may later realize that you don't love the person and feel you've made a mistake. Take your time, but don't be pessimistic or you may lose out on actual love.If you can't say their name without smiling, you might be in love.Don't say you are in love if you aren't sure.If you feel like you love the person, you will automatically will define them and be on their sides when something wrong happens.If you like them, you will blush and feel embarrassed around them. If you really like them or love them, you will feel self-conscious, yet comfortable around them.If you would be willing to wait for someone or stay in a certain area for a long period of time, then it's probably love.When you're in love you might not be able to sleep because you can't stop thinking about them.Do whatever is needed and best for this person, even if it's not what you want.If you get butterflies just thinking about them. Then you could be in love.You would go to the ends of the earth for that person........( example saying ) \" I would go to the moon and back for you \"If you completely trust and care for someone, but don't ever think about sexual desires, you may just care for them as a very close friend.If you feel like all you want from them is their body, then it may be lust not love.You feel awkward and out of place when you're around them, that may be a sign.You have to know if he/she checks you out.You may want to talk to the person but just don't know how to.You may not act like you like them around others but you can feel it in your heart.If you are nervous around the person and your heart \"skips a beat\" when the person talks to you, you could be in love.If you want to go wherever they are going then it might be love or you are obsessed.",

            "answer_text": "I am writing several points that I consider as signs of someone falling in love. So, these are entirely my points of view. According to me, if you can relate with the following signs, you are definitely in love: 1. When you see them, you realize that it is exactly the same face you have been searching for since eternity. 2. When you talk with them or think about talking with them, you begin to smile consciously or unconsciously for no reason. 3. You feel a unique form of pleasure which gives you butterflies in your stomach when you talk with them(in person or over text or call). 4. You feel your day is made if you talk with them. If you don't talk with them, you feel lonely and sad even though you are surrounded by other people. 5. You become deeply saddened or depressed if they say or do something hurtful, even though you are generally not bothered by life's trivia. 6. This person has become your weakness and you know it. However, you still seek a lot of strength from their presence in your life. 7. You don\u2019t need the confirmation from others that you are in love with this person. You begin to feel deep inside that you really have fallen in love(even if you never have had a single crush in your entire life). 8. You are eager to know more and more about that person. You might begin to take interest even in things that they like which you never liked earlier). 9. You want to spend most of your time with that particular person and it feels like heaven when you are with them. 10. You can miss them all the time, 24x7. 11. At times, when you feel very nostalgic or miss your childhood, thinking about or talking with the person gives you a lot of relief and instantly changes your mood. 12. You consider yourself lucky and fortunate to have them in your life. You consider their presence in your life as a God\u2019s miracle. 13. You can listen to love songs all the time and never get bored(even though you never liked to listen love songs much). You can relate with each and every love song in the world since the day you met them. 14. You may find yourself singing love songs when you think about them. 15. You actually wish you had met them earlier in your life so that that phase of the life before you met them would be as joyful as it is after you met with them. 16. You love to surprise them with gifts and don't feel like your money gets wasted if you spend it on them, even in large amounts. 17. You will feel jealous or sad if some other person flirts with them with especially with better credentials or looks. However, you are ready to sacrifice them for their happiness if they also like that other person. 18. You will always cherish and never regret falling in love with them even though they hurt you. You might just say- \u201che/she was the best mistake I ever made\u201d. In short, your heart continues to shower love on them despite the hatred for them in your mind(for their wrongdoing). 19. You would want to express to them directly or indirectly that you love them to see their reaction, feel lighter or expect a relationship from them. 20. You want others i.e. your friends and family members know this person and how much they mean to you. You feel proud to have this person in your life no matter what. 21. You are always ready to fight for this person verbally or physically with anybody who is causing them any kind of distress. 22. When you are with them, you unconsciously don't like to use your mobile at that time. You always want to give them upmost attention. 23. You respect them, their feelings and opinions. You hardly ever contradict them, not just because you don't want to ruin your impression in front of them but also because your heart doesn't allow you to contradict them. 24. You will care about this person to the extent that you daily give them some piece of information that might be useful for them in present or future. It can be anything like a useful tip or technique related to something. 25. You tell them your secrets that you generally don't share with anyone. You have a lot of faith and trust in them. You might also call them your \u201ctrue friend or best friend\u201d. 26. Even though it has been just a month or so since you have met them, a voice in your head tells you that your feelings for them won't end easily or will last for several years now. In fact, they really do last for several years. 29. You are not infatuated towards them and you know it. You consider physical intimacy as secondary. The primary thing or priority will be their presence in your life that you admire the most. 30. If you are good at something like writing, you will write poems or songs for them but not specifically to show them. You just cherish the pleasure you seek during the process. Thank you for reading! I hope you have a wonderful day ahead. :) ",

            "answer_text": "It's one of the most common questions that leads people to Google their way to my work: How do I know if I'm in love? Sometimes, people even find themselves asking, How do I know if I'm in love ... enough? Odds are, if you've taken a minute to ask yourself this question, you might have come up with some answers like these: I'll know when I'm in love because I'll feel it.Love is a feeling.You just know.I feel alive and thrilled with I'm in love.When I'm in love, I always want to see my partner. I miss him/her when s/he is away.When I'm in love, I'm never bored.But the truth is that none of these answers describes real love. They describe infatuation. Infatuation is defined by a feeling whereas real love is defined by action. In fact, what we tend to refer to as being \"in love\" is essentially selfish. It's an attempt to measure love by how the other person makes you feel, instead of by tangible actions on your part that require you to give and show up for the commitment of loving. Western culture upholds the feeling of love as a godlike realm and the gauge by which we measure the \"rightness\" of a relationship. How we set ourselves up for failure with this definition of love, for anyone who has spent time exploring the inner realms knows that feelings fade. Feelings are fickle. Feelings are not a reliable yardstick for determining the sustainability of an intimate relationship. So what is real love? Real love, first and foremost, extends from a place of fullness inside oneself.Real love is giving.Real love is connection.Real love is friendship.Real love includes a genuine desire to learn about yourself and grow with each other.Real love will push you to your edge around areas like intimacy, sexuality, attraction, time, money, anger, and control.Real love assumes a position of responsibility about these issues, which means that you recognize them as originating inside of you and, as such, own that they would emerge in some form with any partner.Real love takes time to learn about and nurture.One of the most damaging beliefs in our culture is that you should know if you're in love right from the beginning. The truth is that it can take many years to learn about real love, and the more you fall in love with your own life and can connect with a reliable source of creativity and connection, the more you can give and receive love in a healthy way.

Your world seems  empty without them.You can't get them out of your mind.You kept thinking what they're doing right now.You get that funny feeling in your stomach when you think about him or her.You keep having visions you kissing them or hugging and holding hands.Think about the quality of the time you spend together. You spend as much time as possible with him/her, and don't want to be apart.You talk to them continually, share your ideas and your enjoyable times and events together.When you're with them you have no other doubts of who you want to be with or where you want to be, because right there.You'll treasure a gift that he or she has given to you, even a very small gift.Figure out whether you think about a future with this person.You want to introduce them to everyone and to show them what you have found and are developing together.You want to know his/her family. The names of his/her brothers and sisters and parents.You always think that your name and his/her name sounds perfect together.These are all the kinda feeling we come through when we fell in love..

There is no person on this planet I trust more than her, and I do so because she has earned it many times over.I am terrified of her getting hurt.I am the happiest I have ever been when she is around.I sleep better when she is there, and I am happier on mornings when I wake up next to her.I delight in seeing her smile and I feel good when she is happy, especially when I've helped make her happy.I miss her when she isn't around.I have promised myself and her that when we have problems (and we do), we will address them together and become closer because of them. I do not use them as justifications for breaking up and I do not leave her.I am fond of the idea of spending the rest of my life with this person.My monogamy with her is natural. Yes, I have committed to her and have promised not to sleep with anyone else. But even if we did not have such a commitment - I don't want to sleep with anyone else. That doesn't mean I'm not attracted to anyone else, but I would just rather spend the time with her.Differences between love and infatuation, since they share some of the above symptoms.  The feelings are reciprocated.I have a lot of previous dating experience.If we were to break up, while I would be terribly hurt, I would be capable of taking care of myself in every way. When I was infatuated in the past, losing the girl's attention would have meant losing my purpose in life.I do not look to her to give me validation, and I do not view the fact that I am in a relationship with her as a source of validation.I do not feel like she is exploiting my feelings for her. She gives me as much attention and affection as I give her. She has never hurt me or used my feelings for her as a tool to manipulate me.I do not avoid difficult problems in order to preserve the relationship. I know the relationship will be preserved because we face difficult problems together.Thanks for the A2A Diniel. ",

            "answer_text": "This is my new favorite subject of wisdom, awareness, healing\u2026and ecstatic days ahead. (Hope) Let us be \u2018in love\u2019 with the air we breathe, the water we drink, the land which feeds us, the animals who share our world, our precious self\u2026and each other. In order to answer this question with anything other than old worn-out and wisdom demolishing assumptions and bs..we have to define what we are calling..\u2019 In Love\u2019. We are a trinity\u2026as many of us have heard in some way or the other. A body (vessel for experiencing), A mind (operating system), and of course, to allow it all to get up and move (Heart)\u2026universal energy animating, connection, and adding consciousness to experiences or, in other words, \u2026life, God\u2026or my favorite..Love. I have read studies where they have found out our heart actually \u2018registers thoughts and divine emotions. So if you hear your..\u201dstill small voice\u2019 the one who loves and somehow is found, in many cases, all-knowing, intuitive, and downright magic, realize you are connected through your heart..and not your computer system provided to navigate this world of separation. Being \u2018in love\u2019 is about the true flowing together in this essential love energy.. no one is stopping the flow, there is no need\u2026they are in love. Ever wonder if a tree is conscious? A flower? Do they simply grow and die without ever knowing they lived and made me smile..or feel comforted when I was alone..strong and steady standing there for me..also appearing to be alone, stuck..forgotten, powerless\u2026truly unseen and empty of the ability to love? Be conscious of the fact that a tree breathes what would harm us, then gifts all the whole earth's life-sustaining oxygen\u2026shades us, houses us, feeds us, burns to warm us, allows us to grow and breathe while standing steady or reclining beneath..is this not love in its most perfect defining? So the tree loves me..and I know it..if I find a second to notice it does..the reason is..it adds to the allowing of my essential energy which makes me conscious..alive..seen..known, welcome and connected. Its being..increases mine * fulfillment, joy, peace and the ability to love myself and others through truth and awareness with no motives but for all to live ecstatic\u2026because of the walk\u2026\u2019in love\u2019 or we could say\u2026 the exhilarating ride of life that we are alive only to experience..not for some cruel and unfair tests..but for this..to experience and contribute to love. Intentions have also been proven to change molecular patterns in water causing chaos and what appears to be destroying one another amongst the molecules or beautiful..symetrical, and harmonious flowing patterns. If we are aware of love in the consciousness of all life..then we will have the same intentions towards that life..we will stand in front of a flower or tree..or little animal..or each other..and add more and more of the love energy..we have noticed from them\u2026where there is two or more..there I AM..flowing joy, life, health, peace, power, allowance\u2026which is all..love. Get in that flow..you know it? What is heartache? I believe our heart aches when our essential flow of consciousness of love is blocked, slammed shut..not allowed, devalued or ignored. Hope seems so far and unavailable, joy can\u2019t even be remembered..and pain becomes life. When we feel loved and seen, this energy is easily allowed to flow freely..and we feel amazing. (because our heart energy is flowing..connecting to life) Obviously, for most people, this experience is best felt, enjoyed, increased and maintained, expanded through this essential connection with another person..a lover. You can get there with the tree..but way more intense with another speaking, touching, free-willed being. Before we can be in love.. we have to open the flow up. Our flow of love energy is often shut by fears, anxieties, traumas, false beliefs, cruel self-talk, judgments about self and the world not being enough\u2026and these are all secretly and overtly painful, not because they are truth, but because they block the flow of truth, life..and love. Once we can open our hearts to ourselves, we then can and will want to so much..open our hearts to another. When those two love energies are allowed and flowing\u2026the two are in love. When one closes up their flow..with judgments or fears..we call this the work of \u2018baggage\u2019. And it is\u2026it takes us out of that flow of love..elation..ecstasy of being known and allowed..just where we are suppose to be and throws us back into fear. This happens often in relationships when the two are not self-aware and self-fulfilling but depend only on the other to keep the previously closed flow of love energy moving..and at first, it's all roses and floating\u2026 but that wears off..because there is no foundation except the other person. The other person can not be responsible to keep you full\u2026only to enjoy and enter with you..into your fullness..with theirs. And, as I have already written here.. where there is two or more..there I AM. Be in love with your own energy and flow of light..but first, you need to notice it. THEN you will notice this same flowing energy in another (a connection which can last a whole lifetime and maybe beyond)..and connection can be so easy..flowing. Welcome to being in love\u2026 Warning.. you may feel like you are in love easily if someone validates your beauty, encouraging your heart to open and allow some flowing\u2026 when you rarely or never do. But this never lasts\u2026you are vulnerable to increased heartache when the validations don\u2019t come regularly from the other, because you can not or will not validate self (you can not get your worth because of the opinions or actions of others..this is not love\u2026but illusion)...you will start to shut down because of fears and judgments. Once the fears and judgments come in..the flow of joy and peace..fulfillment stops and the suffering starts right back up again. Can those in love\u2026scream and hurt one another over illusions of what is real and important? Self-love, validation, and awareness..are where we start our journey into love..into the arms of one who opens and allows and increases all that we are..as we do the same for them. Signs that we are \u2018flowing together in love\u201d? Where there is love\u2026 there are no judgments, lies, hiding, or fear. Where there are fear and judgment..there is no opening for love. Where there is love\u2026there are no limitations.. Be in love with yourself\u2026open your heart to your own beauty, worth and love\u2026so it will be open to another\u2019s, and close your mind to all your judgments..be your greatest lover..and another will come who is open the same..and both will fall\u2026right in..flowing in ecstatic love energy and life..together..whole and always increasing for each other and all life. Sound like utopia?..well good, I meant to do that! Blessings and Truth.. -Leann ",

            "answer_text": "Once you are in love with someone, It\u2019s hard to believe how you lived without him till now. Of course, you are alive before you met him but you really didn\u2019t start \u201cliving\u201d until you meet him :) I am sure everyone experienced love differently in their life but I would like to say for sure that anyone who has experienced it, knows It\u2019s the best feeling ever you felt in your life. Let me share my experience here. I remember when I first fall in love, I was 16th in 11th grade. Here are some points to know you might be falling in love :) When he comes in front of you or his name blink on your phone you\u2019ll smile automatically and feeling happier.Thoughts of him comes in your mind frequently and randomly.You start blushing when someone take his name or asking/talking about him to you.You notice small details about him that others can\u2019t. I mean a little small change too.You become addicted to him. If you don\u2019t talk to him once, you\u2019ll feel like day is incomplete or something missing.You enjoy reading all conversation repeatedly that you had with him and smile when you are alone. :)His mood literally affects on yours. You always want to see him happy and you also involved him in your prayer.You love to talk to him a lot. You\u2019ll always find alibi to talk to him and sometimes you are running out topics to talk still don\u2019t want to hang up the call. LOL!You\u2019ll start taking interest in all the topics and things that he likes or related to him. i.e.His favourite Movie, Sports, Books, Food Dish, Music, Songs etc. will become your favourite too.He\u2019ll become your first priority with whom you always wanna share everything like small thing that happen in your life.He become more important and you care him a lot. His important and special days become yours and you become more excited and waiting for it desperately. i.e. Birthday, Interview, Exam etc.You miss him a lot most of the time and feel lonely when he is not around you.You always stalk him secretly on social media and watch his picture all the times.You get amazing feeling like you are flying when he sits beside you, handshake or touched you accidentally.You feel jealous sometimes when someone else or he attracts and likes to other.You get visions like you holding his hand while walking, hugging, and kissing to him etc. something romantic.You\u2019ll also think and check his and your name sounds perfect together.When you listen some romantic songs it feels like song\u2019s lyrics tells your own love story by itself. :)You\u2019ll imagine his/her name in your mind while reading all these points.So, after reading these points. Do you feel all the feelings for someone? If yes, then congratulations !! You are in LOVE !! Enjoy :) ",

            "answer_text": "You can feel a breeze of love once in a while with some person when you two fall in sync. However, being in love is like falling in love with the same person over and over again for multiple reasons and sometimes for no reasons at all. Here are some reasons on top of my mind (sorry for being cheesy): 1. When you wake up and you see that person and you fall in love with her again. And this starts to happen everyday. 2. When you think of something funny and you can't wait to share as you know that you will fall again for her when she is laughing. 3. When she is the best cook (after your Mom) and you are a foodie. And whenever she cooks something you fall for her one more time. 4. When you see how smart she is, when she is all independent and doesn't need you for all the small things in life. Still she will call you in kitchen to open a tight bottle sometime and give you a peck for being so strong(physically). 5. When you can't get over the fact that you are the LUCKIEST person out there. 6. When you are talking to some friends or you are in a meeting and suddenly you think about her and suddenly there's a broad smile and some blush on your flush. Other people might think that you have lost it completely but you know that there's this permanent happiness in your life. 7. When you can be you, a baby, a jealous person, cheesy, a PJ cracker and all those ugly and bad things which you think would drive a girl away but still she loves you from all her heart then you can't help it. If someone accepts you for what you are with all your faults you can not  not fall in love with her.  8. When you stop enjoying movies alone as you will miss your partner for even the slightest of romance is displayed on screen. 9. When you start writing a list in this answer and then so many points keep coming and you start missing her again. 10. When you can relate to depiction of love in poetry, movies, songs and philosophy. These songs won't feel absurd anymore. You start understanding why these people have not gone out of business from centuries. There are so many more things which can be listed. There is no sign from the universe that you are in love. You have to notice those small small things yourself. I will tell you one thing that when you are in love you will come to know that you are in love because there's this feeling which you would have never experienced in life before. A complete stranger becomes so close in such less time, it's a miracle and nothing less. I hope and pray that everyone finds love one day and be as happy everyday as I am and this world will be such a beautiful place! ",

You want to go out of your way to do anything that you know will please him/her\u2026.. You might even feel a hint of jealousy when someone else joins you both and seems to take more than a passing interest in your partner/ SO. When intimacy occurs, you instinctively are totally at ease with each other, your SO forgives any unfortunate mistakes and you both can have a good laugh about it afterwards. I think you have pretty much cracked it if you have most of these feelings, let's hope that your SO also shares them\u2026.. Happy Bonding\u2026\u2026.\u2661\u2661\u2661 ",

            "answer_text": "Hmm!!!!!! Love! First of all, even if you match all the traits depicted by fellow Quora geniuses, don\u2019t jump on to conclusion that you are in Love! It\u2019s very different and you yourself will get to know that yes, he/she is the person with whom I am in LOVE! No need to seek advice from Quora :P!Next up, talking of the traits from which it can be concluded that, you are ATTRACTED to a particular person (again making myself clear, NO LOVE :P), there are many kind of attractions, such as, you are attracted to a person\u2019s aura, a person\u2019s humor or you may be sexually attracted to a person. Yes, I said sexually attracted. It is nothing wrong in being sexually attracted to anyone, till the time you do something creepy, stupid and unacceptable to society. Even, I was very much attracted to 4\u2026.I suppose 5 girls in my life\u2026..including my teachers :P. But that was all fault of hormonal changes and the male chauvinist society we live in where till the time you meet your love of life, you just think of women as an object of pleasure and nothing more. Nevertheless, I will not loose track of answer. Ahh!!! The traits now, Firstly you always keep on thinking about him/her (very common in the beginning of any affair or one sided affair ;))Now once this phase is over, you tend to think of her even when you do the thing you love the most. Like in my case, I used to be a fitness freak and I always thought that, Gym is one thing, where no emotions, bad/good/sad could ever touch me, but once I was ATTRACTED to someone special in a special way, she became my motivation even in Gym.You think of different (sometimes a bit desperate) ways of talking to him/her. You tend to flaunt your assets (intellectual, physical, monetary) in front of him/her.Most importantly, you will experience a split personality disorder :D (funny but true). when you think of your certain activities carefully, you will think that, \u201cOhh! It\u2019s not me at all!\u201d Your behavior will be completely compromised by the presence/ absence of that special one. Like in my case, my life revolved around three things, food mom and books, but once I got ATTRACTED to someone, I somehow, started paying attention towards my appearance, my looks etc which was very uncommon.Most of all you will be emotionally unstable, you will, for no reason, erupt on someone and for no reason start crying.These are few things, and after you start dating that one and spend time you will automatically come to know it is love or ATTRACTION! Cheers!",

            "answer_text": "Take a little break.When you\u2019re with other people, split up and mingle. Try your best to stay engaged in the conversation. If you find yourself zoning out and looking around for your crush, the potential for love is there. If you catch them stealing a glance at you, the feeling might be mutual. 2 .Note your physical reactions. Consider involuntary responses when you\u2019re around your crush. Look out for rapid heart rate, hot flashes, shaky hands, and sweaty palms. Notice whether you suddenly clam up out of fear of what to say. Reactions like these signal lust and infatuation, not love. 3. Evaluate your generosity. Consider how often you share your possessions with this person (or how prepared you are to do so). Imagine they want to borrow that rare vinyl album you just bought at auction. If you share or are willing to share, it could be love. 4. Consider how often do you make sacrifices This doesn\u2019t mean giving up your career plans or letting your crush take advantage of you. It does mean giving a little to brighten their day. Think about the last time this person was sick. If you canceled your weekend binge-watching to take care of them, you could be in love. On the other hand, if your first reaction was to complain, it\u2019s infatuation at best. 5. Pay attention to mirroring Love makes you feel comfortable. In relaxed situations, you\u2019re likely to imitate the other person\u2019s actions, even if you\u2019re not aware of it. Make a mental note if you catch yourself taking a sip of coffee almost at the exact same time they do. It\u2019s not a surefire sign of love, but it increases the likelihood. 6. Evaluate your responses to their success This is especially important when your crush succeeds at something you\u2019ve failed at. For example, they were awarded the promotion you were vying for. If your first reaction is to throw a party, you\u2019re likely in love. On the other hand, if you mumble a disappointed \u201cThat\u2019s nice\u201d and avoid them the rest of the day, it\u2019s just infatuation. 7. Consider your larger social circle Think about the number of friends and family members you\u2019ve introduced this person to (or want to introduce them to). Ask yourself how important it is that they like this person. If you\u2019ve introduced them to your best friend(s) and closest family members, and if you really want them to like this person, you could be in love. \u201cMay God help you to find your true love friends\u201d ( If you are reading my answer for the first time, you may also follow me for my other answers, hope to see you soon again, till then Chao! ) ",

            "answer_text": "Love is a series of choices. The first choice is based on many many factors, including chemistry, principles, logic, humor, intelligence, body type, where we are in our lives, what we want/need\u2026 the list goes on and on, and the weight of each factor varies depending on the individual. Based on these factors, we either choose to begin the process to love or not. If we decide to enter this process, the action of loving can bring \u201clight switch\u201d moments. The way he looks at you. How hard she makes you laugh. The notes he hides in your purse. The way she makes you feel when you don\u2019t feel anything. But like an airplane flight, there is turbulence. The fights. The disagreements. The little things that bother you. His socks. Her shopping. You start wondering if you\u2019ve made the right choice. Once you are in doubt, you have to make another choice: to continue to fly with this person or jump out of the plane. This choice is based on a thousand other factors, again depending on the individual and where they are in their journey. If you decide to jump, the scary free fall will either make you stronger (grow) or miserable (depressed), depending on whether you see your expiration as a rebirth or a death. But sooner or later, you\u2019ll find yourself back at the airport waiting to board another plane. Then you hit turbulence. Or maybe there is no turbulence. Maybe you\u2019ve changed your mind about the destination. Either way, another choice. Fly or jump? Love is making a choice every single day, to either love or not love. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s that simple. Either to continue the process or not. We fall in and out of love when we\u2019re in relationships. Read that again. Because people think if we\u2019re not head over heels for someone, we shouldn\u2019t be with them. Our feelings fluctuate, depending on the relationship but also how happy we are in our own lives. And yes there is drift and if you drift so far that you don\u2019t know or like yourself anymore, maybe it is time to jump. Just know that there is a difference between feeling love for someone (caring about a person) and loving someone (choosing to love that person). You may have love for someone forever. But that doesn\u2019t mean you choose to love that person forever. The choice to love is not a feeling; it is an action. That is why it is so difficult. It requires you to do something, and I\u2019m not just talking about buying flowers. It might mean putting your wants aside. Also, like chemistry, the ability to love is not a constant. It is a variable. It fluctuates, depending on where you\u2019re at in your life and what you\u2019re struggling with. Sometimes it is easy to love. Sometimes it is extremely difficult. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s always a choice. Keep loving folks :)  ",

If you don't talk to him for one day, just one day - it feels as if something is missing from your life!You can't imagine your life without him. All the small/big decisions 'first' involve him, and then something else.You can't resist yourself from involving him in even your smallest decisions. His opinion becomes a necessity!You cry at the slightest sight of him being hurt. He tells you that punched someone and broke his hand - it's you who cry while he enjoys!He becomes more like your family. You want to tell your family about him, and if you can't tell them, you tell your cousins, or people who can keep your secret!Talking about 'him' is fun. You can talk about him all day, every second. You never get bored of it.You see his family, as your family, and you care for them like you would care for your family members.You can't see him upset. Even a change in his voice tone disturbs you and you kick everything aside just to attend him.He becomes the priority! No matter what you are doing, whether it's an exam preparation or you are in a meeting with the President - if he needs you and it's an emergency, you will 'willingly' give him your attention! It's not like you have to, it's like - you will. Involuntarily, without thinking - you will.His birthday is the most important day of the year! You plan your entire year around it, so that you are free that day and can do something special for him. If you are in long distance, you 'try to' plan a surprise so big that he remembers it for months! :)His important days are your important days. If he has an interview - you will be equally, hell even more nervous! If he has an exam, it's you who will be restless. If he falls sick, it's you who will worry more than him.He is more important than yourself. Suppose you both have exams on the same day - if you love him, you will make sure he studies well, and if he's careless about it, you study his subjects, make notes, parcel them to his city, so that he can study and pass - while you are also preparing for your subjects side by side! Phew. I used to send him notes of subjects like VLSI, Micro-controllers etc back when he was in Chandigarh. I might graduate as a Computer engineer this year, but I have also studied around 50% Electronics along with him :p While sending him notes, I used to add random stick notes on top of important chapters, reminding him to study them more attentively. And on his last exam day, he did this - (Clicked on 21st December, 2014 - last exam of his engineering degree!) Yes, that's a very blurry picture, but I wrote \"All the BEST. I Love You...\" on the note, and he wrote - \"I LOVE YOU TOOOO\" and sent me the picture of the stick note. And since that day, I concluded one thing - this man can't click a photo properly! ",

You love her unique smile \u2013 unique from every other smile you\u2019ve ever been given. She gets you to do things you never thought about doing before. She gets you to laugh. She gets you to daydream about what life would be like with her, and you hate the thought of life without her. I get it. We\u2019ve all been there. Done that. And then it doesn\u2019t work out. That\u2019s okay. Most things don\u2019t work out. But we're not in tomorrow. Always ask yourself: What am I going to do today. Today is the only day that matters. So ask this today and be honest:  Do you want the same thing out of \ta relationship (presumably, if you love her, you want a long-term \tcommitted relationship) Do you both have similar values \tabout friendships, places you want to live, luxuries you want to \thave (or not) Do you like the way she treats you \tand is sensitive to what you want?Ask these questions every day. If the answer comes up \u201cno\u201d then talk about it with her why. Being with someone forever (getting married) means you want to spend 50 years with a person. That\u2019s never happened before in history but its happening now because of longer life spans.  So you need to ask those questions every day. And for that day, and that day only, you know.

            "answer_text": " It is a very common question, \"How can I tell I'm in love?\", but it is not an easy question to answer. What feels like love to one person may be nothing more than attraction to another. Some people fall in and out of love quickly and often while others are never really in love as much as they are in lust. This can get confusing when you are a teen because romantic love is a relatively new concept for you and you don't know what to expect. You are overwhelmed with all sorts of new feelings and social pressures. They are confusing. When you are in love, you are sort of paranoid when the person comes around. When you see them, you are trying to make yourself more to something that you know they'll like, even if it means pretending to be a person that doesn't know who they really are. When you are in love, you can't describe your feelings and you feel so blind because love removes all the pain you feel. When you come across your crush, you feel like you are melting and as if you are going to faint. Sometimes, when you feel that you want to faint, you try and play around that you fainted, just to fall into his/her arms. When someone says \"Love is blind, as far as the eye can see\", it's best to believe it. You know you are in love when you see them and you go tingly and warm. You know when you are into space. When you are in love (been there).....well, when you first start going out you are all nervous to see them....but then after a couple of months you don't get nervous any more but you still feel this giggly feeling...you feel like you are floating and you are sooo happy and you want to spend so much time with this person it's great...but take it slowly, others aren't always as ready as you are for love. You know you're in love when all you can do is think about them day and night...when all you can do is fear of losing them, someone else replacing you...you find them to be the most beautiful person whom ever existed...Everything they do is right in your eyes and they can do no wrong.. That person makes you feel special and you want to be with them 24/7...Its more of an emotional connection..That person makes you want to be a better person...you do things for them you never did to anyone else before..you just know you're in love (a feeling)..When you find the love of your life time stops with everything else and he/she is the only thing that moves... You never know when you are in love unless you meet the following 3 criteria: The love is unconditional.The love is forever.The love must be in both of you. I think Love is when you hear his/her voice you melt. When you look at there eyes and you notice the color for the first time, and its the most beautiful thing you have ever seen. when you run to them with any issue you may have and you KNOW that they will do all in there power to save you as best they can, even if its something small. and they love you for just the way you are, they love every little weird face and silly laugh you have to offer. That to me is perfect love You know you are in love when all you can think about is that special person. When you haven't talked in awhile, anywhere from ten minutes to ten days, do you long for his/her voice? ..

Not even to make you happy. --Love is when you care what they do, but don't worry about what they are doing.  --Love is when they say or do something insignificant and you feel, \"SURPRISE!\"  --Love is when you miss them, but don't require them. --Love is when they are right all the time, even when they are wrong. You might be wrong. Who knows? --Love is when you love the other people who love them. --Love is when you see who they are. Not when you see who you want them to be. --Love is when you're afraid to lose them, but you don't try and \"keep\" them. --When there's drama, Love is when you both wrote the script together.  --Love is when they are upset and tell you and you count to two before you respond, \"You're right\". --You love them when you keep yourself clean and you sleep well and eat well. --Love is when you forgot to tell them something... all the time. --Love is when you can't sleep and are feeling sick and anxious and its  3am, but you reach out and touch them and now you are feeling a little  better. --SURPRISE!  --Love is when they are sick and there's nothing you can do so you listen to them. --Love is when they want to do something and you don't, so you don't and everyone feels good about it. --Love is when you just think \"laugh\", and they start to laugh. --You love them when you can still love yourself. This isn't a list of what you SHOULD do when you are in love. If you feel \"should\" then you might not be in love. These are things I feel when I'm in love. Love comes and goes. And  comes and goes. It's ok to not be in love. And it's okay to be in love  forever. ",

You wake up with his thoughts and go to sleep with him in your mind. The first thought in the morning and last thought in the night will be about him.You make yourself available for them all the time.You will never have enough of them, no matter how much ever time you talk, text or spend together, you always wish for some more.You place them above all your priorities. In fact they take the topmost place in your priority list.You can\u2019t stand if anyone says even a word against him and that makes you furious and even dislike the latter.No matter how many ever compliment you, a compliment from him makes your day.Million jokes might fail to cheer you up, but a mere sight of him cheers you up.You are always in the process of making new plans to surprise him.Your days seems to be incomplete if you don\u2019t talk to him at least once.The presence of him brings a million dollar smile on your face.When it comes to his problems or needs, you attend them first even if you have an exam the next day.When your phone beeps, you blush at the sight of his name on the screen(be it a text or a phone call).Amidst a bunch of people, your eyes always search for him and never fail to notice him with in seconds.Even a little thing that he does for you, makes you the happiest and you will be on cloud nine.You know that he is not perfect, but it doesn\u2019t matter to you and you are perfectly okay with it.When you fight with him, all that you think about is the best times that you had with him.You miss him the very next minute, right after being with him for the whole day.He is the only one who can make you very happy and can also hurt you the most at the same time. You are ready to go to any extent to fight for him, and you don\u2019t care what other people think about him.Even if you are deeply hurt and angry with them for what they have done, you love them so much that you can\u2019t shout at them as you don\u2019t want them to get hurt in return.Even a mere thought of losing him makes your heart beat fast and you feel skipping a heart beat is much better than losing him or forgetting him.",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHow do you know if you truly love someone?\u201d The feeling is more than surface, it is lasting, it grows. It isn't just physical, the chemistry is also spiritual, intellectual. You find yourself letting the walls down, allowing them to get closer than you've allowed anyone else to. You value their input, you want their \"voice\" in your life. You find yourself wanting to simply see them smile, know that they are safe, you make time for them because you honestly care about how their day went. You'd move heaven and earth to protect them. You offer your strength when they are hurting. You'd fly around the world to give them a hug. You'd pull them back from the edge when they feel like everything is lost. You pick up the phone and write silly messages just to make them laugh, because it's like holding a diamond in your hand when they do. Their dreams, their passion, seeing them succeed becomes your happiness too. You place them first. You can't wait to hear their stories, learn from their experiences. You suddenly find that no one else will do. You find yourself wanting the things that you never thought you would. They become the exception to every rule your heart ever made.

I just can\u2019t stand the smell. Ask Bhaiya.  Scene- On a video call with \u201cHim\u201d He was taking some medicine. Roma- What happened bae? He- Nothing. Stomach upset. Roma- Must have been chomping on huge truck of junk. Why do you do this? He- Cause I love food okay.  Roma stormed into the kitchen, the very next day. Since then, over the span of three months, I managed to cook at home what he eats out- Yes! I did that! (Do not pay attention to the presentation, I just clicked to have a check) A basic chocolate cake- A basic vegetable pizza- Shahi Paneer Roasted Paneer- Fried momos (I was a novice, excuse the weird shape) Paneer cheeseballs A lot of Chicken New Year\u2019s cake- I learnt to chop vegetables, including onion-  I know, they\u2019re enough of not-so-well-presented food in shiny cutleries and mint and basil here and there, but hey, I did this out of love.

Late night video calls, distance relationship, you see?I never am pissed off, for he forgot my birthday (which he never did by the way), but over the fact, he slept for only 2 hours, when he knows, he needs 7 hours of it.My calendar is full of red crosses, counting back days when I\u2019m going to meet him next.My gallery is full of screenshots of him sleeping, eating, applying an ointment, arguing, combing hair, making all the faces in the world.Going to a public space while him being in the town, makes my mind go crazy on what if we bump into each other?I used to hate recording my voice. And here I am, singing him to sleep now, or maybe when he gets all upset.I had been infatuated for 4 years, until I confessed. Since then, I have always been in love. Every day, every hour, every moment since then. ",

When you smile for no seeming reason like you are the cat that just ate the unsuspecting canary,  Apparently friends they were not. All is the shining eastern orb glowing  a natural high that is better than any thing you have experienced. A single kiss on the lips can make the blood race and your cheeks grow hot as you feel yourself carried away by desire, and  a touch drives you insane..  You can't get enough of each other, smells are like the aroma of the finest perfume no one could duplicate.  Your limbs turn to jelly and thinking of anything other than what ishappening now is impossible.  When you look into each others eyes the recognition is there that says yes to anything  that might happen and  hope that it does. Love isn't that word or down anywhere  it isn't an amalgamation of different feelings it is synergistically located in the brain which broadcasts scent unrelenting,  scent that opens magic. Paradoxically,  it is everything and it is nothing.  You can't escape and you don't try.  You wish to feel a trap that dips deeply  into  passion no one should have to escape this moment.  The music in your head is like no other boys band or  symphonics  heard.    Each sound is an echo of your beloved's  breath is that a pant?  Your heart like a hammer  Hold me, kiss  me, the pleasure flows through  the lovers growing  in intensity to  crescendos and spirited spasms then hot lava, unstoppable, escaping from secret places urgent, spurting bubbling white scent until a single tear signals that they are come to a resting point which is damp on limp curls of black and gold. And rest after they come, to the end they beg not to.  inevitably  they must   sleep and are carried lashed  on the fluttering wings of black birds and brown sparrows  while  lovers sleep restless and dream of the morn-lovely exhaustion.  Above the moon moves in  orbit a black and white cat ponders, the stars rush the night treetops - points of light black skies beacon, there the moon awakened trails,  its spells carried on strands of light awakens them and looking at one another they are 2 lovers again wrestling as one.  Their new acquired taste for tawdry rose petals luscious  virgin apples coupled with blood, miniature bites on shivering skin of ebony or pearls.  The wine mocks through its glass unfolding paintings of red nipples and baying  hounds at fresh scent,  masters seated on magnificent dappled  and brown mounts,  snorting at hounds too close the pitched sound of the horn baying across meadows tells all the hunt has begun.

Falling in love with someone is scary because, for the most part, it is completely out of your control. The heart wants what the heart wants. When the elation, the nerves, the butterflies, the anxiety, and the euphoria all come together, somehow you just know.  When you are in love certain things tends to happen like - When time goes by in fast forward and you desperately wish there was a pause button on life so you could be with them forever, frozen in a perfect moment.When you forget you\u2019re hungry and all you can think about is how amazing the other person is and when you wake up and the other person is the first thing that crosses your mind and the thought of them immediately makes you smile :-) When you are on text then how suddenly the time of about 4 to 5 hours at night goes you didn't realise. And you always feel good after talking no matter you feel sleepy or not but at that moment you just feel that this talks never stop :)When you trust them enough to tell them and share your deepest, darkest secret, and you know they won\u2019t run away. You feel comfortable enough to be at your most vulnerable, and you know they will try and protect you from your demons and fears. When all you want to talk about is the person you\u2019re falling for. How sweet they are. How caring they are. How similar you two are. You want to tell the world everything about them and inform everyone especially your freinds about the story how you two first met.All of these things can be signs, but the moment you realize you actually love the other person, you just know. It hits you like a ton of bricks. It knocks the air out of your lungs and you feel amazing :) Keep smiling :) ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Ravishankar. And thanks for the A2A. Well, you know - you'll probably hear the same answer from many people who have been in a longer-term relationship. It's kind of difficult to imagine if you haven't experienced it yet. But they will all smile and say \"Oh - you'll know!\" It's true up to an extent. The problem can be that there may be cultural variations which complicate things. In the US, everyone makes such a big deal out of \"dating\". To a European (or maybe just to me), this whole dating thing is a bit of a puzzle. In Europe, things aren't so complicated. \"Well, yeah, we hang out a lot together and have sex, but he's not by bf...\" Weird. I don't know. But I'm old. So what do I know? But back to your question. If your brain melts when you see him or her. If your pulse goes all staccato, if you simply can't help grinning like a fool wherever they are near, if the way they smell makes you dizzy... chances are that you are in love. (Or a bit drunk, perhaps). If you like a guy or a girl fine, but don't feel like your head is going to fly up into the sky and explode like a big firework, then you like him / her, but you aren't in love. Let me add something, if I may, in the hope that it will help you avoid grief in future: Being \"in love\" never lasts. Once the first three months are over at the latest, reality catches up with you. You will have had your first arguments. You will have seen one another with your early morning \"oh my god, is it Monday already? I feel like I haven't slept a minute and I have a headache\" face. You will start to miss the feeling of excitement when he or she is coming to visit. It'll become more everyday. this is when many people break up because they are disappointed. This is sad, because they are starting to see the real person behind the pretty, always happy and smiling mask of their new partner. The big difference between being in love and loving somebody is that you cannot love somebody you don't really know. You know, people expect rainbows and sparkly feeling to last and when they fade, they think they have failed. Wrong. They are starting to see the real person - and not the person they think their new partner is. Things start to get more honest. Each partner sees that the other has good days and bad days. Love grows from this understanding of your partner, of knowing this person with time almost as well as knowing yourself. And wanting to be with this person. Of being stronger as a couple than as single people. Of being a team. Of trusting one another implicitly. Of feeling that the worst day has just become better, just because you are together again. Of respecting and genuinely liking your partner and not wanting to be with anyone else. Of knowing what makes them laugh, what their favourite food is and how you can cheer them up when they are down. And this feeling - this feeling can also fade, but often lasts on and on. I have met old couples - over ninety, who hold hands and are simply happy to be together.  So there's hope for us all! All the best. ",

            "answer_text": "Your actions says it all. The love makes us do unbelievable things in the end right? Well, it was morning 7. He was never a morning person or a early bird. But his inner urge to have a small talk with her made him do it. He was checking her last seen status in whatsapp. 6.15 AM- last seen today at 1:05 AM. 6.35 AM- last seen today at 1:05 AM. 7.05 AM - last seen today at 1:05 AM. 7.21 AM - last seen today at 1:05 AM. Finally after waiting for almost 2 hours, her last seen changed to online 8.02 AM- Online. & it was now the time for his brain to make some ways to have that talk. Brain : let's put up a status in whatsapp so that she can know that we're online. Heart: No, no. It's too risky. She will know it. What will she think of us then? Brain :ahh you coward! Let's forward her a message. Wait, let me check some good morning messages in the internet. Heart: don't you think that will look like a bit cheesy? Brain(angrily) : do you want to talk to her? Heart: :-( Brain : Let's do a thing, we can put a message in that group where she is a member as well. Heart: Yesssssss, let's do this. What he did then? He did put up a message in the group & was constantly checking message info to check if she did see that message. Then? He then started to read their previous conversations for the umpteenth time. Well Well, if you did wait for someone like this then you're in love. If you're mind & heart had this types of conversations then definitely you're in love. The time you're talking with that person ; if you want that time to get freezed then you're definitely in love. That's butterflies in stomach, that goosebumps, that urge ; these all are part & parcel of the feeling called love. POST CREDIT SCENES: After much struggle, he sends her a joke. For which, she replies `so funny!! :D `. He then reads this message several times & decides to focus his career on becoming a comedian . However a flying chappal from mom was enough give him some brains. :D ",

            "answer_text": "YOU DON\u2019T FIND LOVE, LOVE FINDS YOU. And after that its your CHOICE that you provide it a haven in your heart or not. I believe true love happens unkowingly, it is not something which can be planned and fabricated. Before you read further, think about your loved one so as to savour the depth of the words. It is true love when what matters to you is the heart of that person. Looks, money , status , some personality traits or good qualities are secondary and play a vital role in the beginning and sustenance of a relationship. Naturally interests, mentality, behaviour, sanity and such things carry a lot of importance but what pulls you towards that person is their inner self.Love is when you don\u2019t let GIVING UP be an option in your relationship even after fights, differences, arguments, disappointments & heartbreaks.Love is when seeing them vulnerable makes you strong enough to pick up both of you.Love is when you completely ,not only accept but adore a person the way they are.Love is when you can endure any amout of pain for their well-being and happiness.Love is when their presence electrifies you.Physical, emotional as well as mental intimacy are desired and are a NEED in true love.Love is when their mere existence magically strengthens us towards the harsh realities of life and makes this world seem a lovely place.If these are some of the strings which connect you with someone, then believe me ,you are in UNCONDITIONAL love with that person. Never ever let go of that person.(if the feelings are mutual) When you do things SELFLESSLY for someone only then there is LOVE otherwise it is just an illusuion. Yes, respecting and liking that person, caring for that person, wanting their happiness are all vitalities of love. But some signs like - Every romantic song adding colour to your life, your heart beating frantically in their proximity, heart craving for their attention, you being possessive about them, eyes yearning for a glance of them, your thoughts commencing and terminating with their thoughts.. Can\u2019t be the basis of judging that whether you are in love or not. Such things do happen when one falls in love, considering what kind of person one is. But many a times these are just thoughts woven by our mind making one forget the difference between reality and imagination. Teenagers easily fall prey to it as they are yet to overcome the \u2018Opposite sex attraction\u2019 science and are still pretty immature to understand it. So if you have found your true love , then you are very fortunate , because it is indeed very rare. As everyone is not capable of embarking on the journey of LOVE and continuing it forever . All the best!!.. May your love keeps blooming and never perishes. Thanks for reading till the end :) Feel free to opine. ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes it can be hard to distinguish between loving someone and being in love with someone. The problem lies within loving everything about someone and wanting to be with that person 24/7 while doing anything for them regardless of it being something you don\u2019t want to do. To give you an example, there\u2019s this girl that I can\u2019t stop thinking about. I\u2019ve known her for years and every time I think about her I imagine being with her and supporting her and sacrificing the world for her. I\u2019ve tried to convince myself that: It wouldn\u2019t work, we have different interestsShe\u2019s kind of a lot younger than meShe mentioned something about her religion that might or might not have something to do with dating (want to respect her personal and religious journey)If I made any moves or were to be rejected, I\u2019d have to see her again (because we both volunteer for a non profit)She\u2019s in college and I wouldn\u2019t want to influence her future career choicesThe world doesn\u2019t need more babies (sounds really cynical but you\u2019re actually saving the world from overpopulating)Some of the above shows my insecurities but it\u2019s how I\u2019ve tried to make myself not be in love with her. If none of this (convincing yourself you\u2019re not in love with this person) works, and I know this can\u2019t be healthy but it\u2019s worth a shot, then you\u2019re in love. In my experience, this is how I know I\u2019m \u201cin love\u201d with someone\u2026Why? Because I can\u2019t stop thinking about her and wanting to be with her even though I\u2019ve tried endlessly to persuade myself into believing that I\u2019m not in love with her. But just because I\u2019m in love with her doesn\u2019t mean we would be perfectly fit for each other because I haven\u2019t pursued her! I just know I\u2019m in love with her. I haven\u2019t tried to pursue her and she doesn\u2019t know my intentions so it doesn\u2019t help me to know if this is Love or not. Assumptions can get you into trouble because they solidify a concept in your mind. A concept of the type of relationship you think and then believe to have with that person. I don\u2019t know your situation but you need to find out if he/she feels the same otherwise everything will always be platonic. And right now, I\u2019ve convinced myself for other reasons that our relationship is platonic. BUT. If you want to avoid this \u201cidea\u201d of the relationship that you\u2019ve formed in your head about that person being questionable, be straight up and ask. Bottom line: If you\u2019re asking yourself \u201cAm I in love?\u201d Then you probably are. The quickest but hardest way to know the answer to the real question \u201cIs this love?\u201d is to actually pursue the person. Ask him/her on a date or do a few one on one hang outs to see how things go. It\u2019s the only way.

Well\u2026Godspeed my friend and don\u2019t assume, just ask and pursue! That\u2019ll answer your question real quick. ",

            "answer_text": "i have stpd, which is a personality disorder that makes it very difficult for me to have close relationships with anyone. so for me it was pretty easy to tell that i was going to fall for my boyfriend when i agreed to meet him in person. he only lived 40 minutes away, so it wasn\u2019t too big of a deal. but i wanted to take things slow because i\u2019m naturally opposed to the idea of trusting others and spending time with others. after about a month of being in the \u201cwe\u2019re not dating but we have hour-long phone calls every other night, and send suggestive memes to one another hourly\u201d stage, he brought up the idea of going on an actual date and i said yes. immediately. without thought. to put this action into perspective, i have acquaintances of close to a decade that i cancel on with the slightest hint of anxiety. we met at a coffee shop that is literally a block away from my house, and i walked there in the snow and nearly froze my nose off just to meet him. also because there was no way in hell i was getting in a car with a stranger, right? the coffee shop closed at 5pm, and after we discussed the many exciting things to do in my hometown on a sunday night (such as drive to Target and play Mario Kart in the gaming section, and then walk to the Dollar Tree and buy some candy or drinks, and then go to a park and sit inside his car and listen to music while staring at the snow) he smiled and said \u201clet\u2019s do it then!\u201d this was the second action that made me realize i was in for it. i got into his car. the third? less than a week after our first date, we had our first kiss. and by first kiss, i mean we sat in his car at the park in the dead of winter and absolutely destroyed each other\u2019s mouths until the early hours of the morning. we were like stupid, horny teenagers. (we were 18, so technically we were stupid, horny teenagers\u2026 but i like to think i\u2019m mentally at least 30.) we rinsed and repeated this routine for about a month, until i was ready to let him into my home. as of right now, i\u2019m not sure when it happened but i\u2019m definitely in love with him. i could probably find a moment every day where i think, \u201ci\u2019m in love with that man.\u201d i think it happens when you\u2019re not waiting for it, sometimes when you don\u2019t even want it. the universe is cruel that way. if you\u2019re not sure if you love your partner the way you expect to, then maybe it\u2019s not what you feel, but how you percieve it. maybe you don\u2019t know how it really feels until it happens. maybe you\u2019ve felt it before and didn\u2019t know it. all i know is that i\u2019m in love. i haven\u2019t a clue how i know that. i\u2019m sorry this isn\u2019t of much help, but maybe it\u2019ll ease your mind to know that the universe isn\u2019t going to let you run yourself ragged trying to figure it out forever. when it is time, you\u2019ll know. trust yourself and be open to your emotions.

            "answer_text": "Here are 7 symptoms to check if you\u2019re in love : 7. Hormonal changes  It\u2019s already known that a group of certain hormones is responsible for strong feelings. The release of these hormones makes people experience romantic feelings and passion that they can\u2019t control very well. But men\u2019s signs of falling in love are different from women\u2019s. At first, their emotional and sexual preferences match: men become more romantic, tender, and attentive because of oxytocin, while women experience a burst of energy and a high sex drive because of testosterone. But unfortunately, when the level of hormones returns to its normal state, women feel a lack of attention and men miss the number of intimate moments. 6. Voice changes  The changes in our bodies don\u2019t stop when the period of passionate love ends. For example, our voice still changes. According to one study, when a woman speaks to her beloved, her voice unconsciously gets softer and higher. On the other hand, other research revealed that women can manipulate their voice pitch making it lower with more vibrations to be more attractive. But the thing is, men unconsciously prefer women whose voice pitch is high and \u201cwomanly\u201d. It\u2019s all about our instincts: such a voice indicates that a woman is caring and reliable, and is ready for a long-term relationship. A lower voice attracts men only physically as it\u2019s mostly about sexual interest. 5. Uncontrollable blushing  A guy or girl of your dreams comes into your life, smiles at you, and passes by. It may not seem like something special but your cheeks are already red and you can\u2019t do anything about it. Modern psychologists found out that blushing is actually useful and can make you more likable. According to one theory, it\u2019s a natural reaction to the fear of being \u201cfound out\u201d. Psychologist Ray Crozier has interviewed many people about situations that cause them to turn red, and he found that it most typically involves the potential exposure of something private, not connected to embarrassing situations. The blushing may be a physiological reaction to the shock that your secret could become public. But how can this cause an attraction to another person? It\u2019s easy: in such cases, your reddened face shows that you want to avoid excessive attention, giving the impression of a shy and less narcissistic person. And if we consider the fact that blushing is uncontrollable, we may say that it\u2019s one of the most reliable features of honesty. 4. Men\u2019s bones get stronger.  Here\u2019s some good news for men! Studies at the University of California in Los Angeles show that married men and men in long-term relationships (especially those who are older than 25) have stronger and healthier bones. But here\u2019s one important takeaway: a relationship or marriage is happier when a woman is caring and supportive. During this trial, it was found that if a woman wasn\u2019t tender and loving, there was no high bone strength revealed. 3. Dilated pupils  Eyes play a really important role at the beginning of a relationship, and the eyes\u2019 changes and movements are the most reliable signals when it comes to understanding our mood while spending time with our beloved. Scientists have already proven that pupil dilation depends not only on light but on our emotional state as well. That\u2019s why loving people look into each others\u2019 eyes: they\u2019re unconsciously trying to see if this can be seen in the person they\u2019re in love with. 2. A painful state  Confusion, nervousness, mood swings, loss of appetite, and fatigue are also on the list of symptoms that are caused by falling in love. Our bodies let us know that we\u2019re plunging into really strong feelings. Cortisol, a stress hormone, can be one of the reasons for our suffering because when a person is falling in love, they experience lots of emotions and great stress. For example, blood vessels in our stomach constrict and we feel nausea. As a rule, all unpleasant symptoms go away when our relationship becomes more stable and there\u2019s no more uncertainty. But sometimes these feelings can come back like during a wedding or if something goes wrong in a relationship. 1. Superpowers  You\u2019ve probably heard about people doing impossible things in emergency situations: mothers have lifted cars with their own hands to free their child. The things is, love and fear literally give us superpowers. And it happens to more than just parents, it\u2019s also present in people in love. This is due to the oxytocin that is released into our systems when we fall in love and it can actually increase our tolerance for physical pain. That\u2019s why people experiencing this strong and beautiful feeling think that they\u2019re able to do anything for their beloved. The last one kinda proves that true love does exist. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cLove is mystical,it gives you ability to heal,transform and strengthen your soul\u201d. Biological basis of love: Day dreaming about the person, you feel his/ her presence. You get driven away by their thoughts. Their face brings a smile on your face. You feel that he/ she is exceptional and drowned in their thoughts. Mere sight of your love can give an impulse to your brain that begins releasing dopamine and serotonin, which not only increases your focus on person but also gives you immense pleasure. Almost a drug like effect! These chemicals regulate sleep, hunger, emotional behavior, activity, now we know why even a mild rift in love can lead to anorexia and insomnia. Infact, heart racing, sweating, mood swings become more common when we are in love and these chemical begin regulating our bodies and mind.  However, apart from biological aspects that affect the mechanism and dynamics of body. Behavioral changes also become more evident- We make attempts for the special one, to make them feel special.We become open to any amendments that may be asked for.We change we change for better (no noticing of other men or women), we begin accepting their past, the differences we have. forgiving and forgetting their mistakesWe spent too much time in grooming and dressing up. More focused on how we look and how we present ourselves before the loved one.Behavior modification is something we all do especially when the relationship is green and at an early stage.we tend to become cautious about words we choose in our conversations,and for their feelings as well.We begin planning for future, marriage vacations and begin seeing life years from now.You prioritize your special someone, everything else takes a back seat. You miss your workout because she is on call with you, Your plan with your friends are swapped because she/ he is on Skype with you.You care and you are concerned for their well being, you are worried when calls are not answered or a message is not seen for a long time, his/ her no see leaves you bewildered and annoyed too.Thus, when in love, a cumulative effect of everything turns you into something you never thought you would be. Sometimes it's worth if you can govern your feelings. otherwise it brings contrition if you loose the reins you have hard time curbing your emotions.  ",

If you want to know how to do it, please follow the method below. What would be your future without your partner If you really love him (her), you can't imagine what kind of future you will have without him (her). Whether you want to move to a new city, have children, stay abroad for a year, or realize any dream in the future, you should think that your dear one will always be with you. If you can't predict and imagine life without your partner, it seems that you may really love your partner.  Can you spend hours without your lover in your mind If you have a healthy relationship, you will allocate your time to other things instead of imagining what he or she is doing at the moment every five seconds. But if you don't have any information about him or her in your mind for a whole week or a month, you probably like him very much, but you haven't reached the stage of love. Here are some other signs that mean you fall in love with him. When you are reading or watching a movie without him, you will wonder what he thinks of the work. When you try on new clothes yourself, you will consider whether he will like your dress. You text him, call him, if it's just to say hello to him or listen to his voice, then you may really fall in love.  Do you respect each other's opinions or opinions If you love him, you will attach great importance to the other person's point of view and care about his or her ideas, whether in your next career choice or in the political situation of your country. But if you don't fall in love with him, you won't care about the other person's emotional input and his attitude towards everything. Here are the signs that you love him. When you're making big decisions, you can take your partner's point of view into account. If you are in trouble in society, you attach great importance to his opinions on your next plan. If you care what he thinks about news, politics, art, or something else that's important to you, you may fall in love with him. Does your partner want you to improve yourself Even if you are satisfied with your partner, you should not just be satisfied with your current situation. Although it is very important to coexist peacefully with your partner and establish a happy love relationship, being with him should help you to elevate your life to another level and make you the best of yourself forever. If by the side of your lover, you are trying to correct your shortcomings and constantly improve your personality, you may really be in love.  Are you willing to help your partner Love is made up of giving and receiving. If you really love each other, your pay and return should be equal. You'd love to surprise each other with coffee or desserts from her favorite bakery, and you don't think it's a waste of your precious time. Whether it's teaching your partner to make the perfect hamburger or complex math problems, you'll be happy. ",

            "answer_text": "I remember, about 10 years ago was when we first talked to each other. We were about 5 or 6. He once bullied me about my weight (what a peice of shit! He was just as chubby as me as a kid!) and we, at some point, became worst enemies in preschool. Until one day, we had some conversation that didn't include us fighting, I didn't remember what he said, but I do remember the promise we made. \u201cPromise we're not going to bully each other anymore? We're now best friends!\u201d \u201cPromise!\u201d That was how I had my enemy turn to my friend, then maybe considered him my childhood crush. After 10 years, we we're still good friends. Of course at some point we had separate groups of friends and we weren't together everyday for 10 years straight. I had a crushes on other boys and he had crushes on other girls. That wasn't until 7th grade, we became as close as before, and I remember telling him he was my first crush. Little did I know what I felt as a little kid will come back. It's been 3 years, and that hasn't changed. I still feel butterflies around him. He knows I like him, I told him 2 years ago. Telling him didn't change anything or make anything awkward, which I'm glad for. I enjoy his company. He didn't directly tell me he doesn't like me back, but I'm pretty sure that's the case. Now, how do I know I'm in love? Well, after hours of thinking, I thought although I like him, I felt alright even if he didn't like me back. All I wanted for him is to be happy and be made happy by someone, even if that someone wasn't me. I felt satisfied from the thought that he's laughing and smiling and feeling great. What I've learned through all those years is that real love makes you selfless, not selfish. Love doesn't make you think only of your happiness, but also the happiness of the one who you hold dear. <3 ",

            "answer_text": "Some weird symptoms you may experience when you fall in love: 1. When you fall in love, your cheeks blush, your heart beats faster, your palms are sweaty and your head starts spinning. All thanks to a rush of hormones that flood your brain and body when you fall in love. There\u2019s nothing you can do about this. After all, love is blind, doesn\u2019t know whether to disturb mind or heart.  2. You wake up and go to sleep thinking of someone other than yourself. The truth is this phenomenon is usually subconscious and automatic, almost like your mind is programmed to do so. Though, it is nice to think of someone beside you. 3. You smile when you\u2019re alone. We all noticed this. You could quite often smile when he or she texts you, when you hear a song, see his/her picture on Facebook or when you just think of that person. So, little things like these will make you smile quite often than usual because you are just so ecstatically in love. 4. You do embarrassing things. Love will make you do embarrassing things because when you\u2019re falling in love with someone. You will do almost anything to make him/her happy, no matter what other people may think. 5. You do things outside of your comfort zone. Just to make him/her happy, you are ready to do anything even if it is not your cup of team. For example: a boy ready to go for shopping and carry shopping bags, though he don\u2019t like. Similarly, a girl could sit and watch \u201cSports\u201d Channel just because her love like watching it. Sometimes doing these things can open your mind to new activities you might enjoy. Especially when you are doing them with the one you love. In short, sub-conscious feeling of love makes us crazy, but it also makes us happy. Love is exciting, addicting, confusing and weird. Though, we all want to love and get loved.  Hope this helps. Thank you! ",

            "answer_text": "I say \u201cbahhh\u201d to everything else that was written in reply. Being in love with someone should be looked at in an entirely different light. True Love has nothing to do with any of that. Your ACTIONS dictate whether you are- or aren\u2019t. Specifically, your actions toward that other person will tell you everything you need to know. Look in your heart, you know what I say to be true. When your actions are in line with your feelings, then, only then, can you say you are really truly in love with someone. Love for someone else, being in love with that person, requires a firm hand (not abusive by any means), a tender heart, and\u2026 ACTIONS. It also requires that you truly love yourself, first. Honestly, from what you wrote, it doesn\u2019t sound like that is the case. You might love her (sounds more like \u201cnew relationship\u201d love to me), but to be truly in love with her, start acting like it. If your heart or mind wanders, it wasn\u2019t real. The other person doesn\u2019t consume you, like you have described in your various musings about her; that is all more insecurity in yourself than anything else, it seems. When you strive to be the best you can possibly be in every aspect of your life, no roadblocks, no fear, and you want to do that so she has everything she could ever want\u2014 not just things, but the physical and emotional trust that comes with knowing that you will never harm her in any way- then you\u2019ll be in love. You must give everything. It\u2019s risky business, love. But the payoff is a life well led. ",

            "answer_text": "What a hot item, yaar. Chotu, one of my friends said while pointing his finger towards a passing by girl. Don\u2019t do that. I warned him. Just chill, man. This is not the first time, I am doing this. He said. That\u2019s why I am telling you not to do it. I don\u2019t like it. I replied. Boys are used to do these things. Even girls like us this way. He said and laughed. You are out of your mind. So, better behave. I yelled at him. By the way, I don\u2019t know any girl who likes teasing. So, whenever you guys are with me, better not to do this. Oh, common man, you are living in old era. this is young generation, we should do more fun. Another friend said. You all are rascals. I scolded them. I don\u2019t like these things. It\u2019s okay. Just look at this one. Chotu argued. I gave him a rude look and slowly turned back. This is the story when I was in the first year of my college. As I belong to a small town, there, friend means boy is friend with boy and girl is friend with girl. You can\u2019t have the luxury of bigger cities, where, a boy can be friend with a girl or vice-versa. So, when you can\u2019t have a company of girls, some idiotic people do these kind of things. Especially college going boys do these kinds of things to look cool like bunking classes, teasing girls, fighting over nothing, etc. Like all boys, I also used to do many of those things except teasing girls. Anyways, lets continue the story. I couldn\u2019t see her face as she was walking away from us and her back was towards me. She wore a red and yellow mixed coloured suit. As I couldn\u2019t see her face, my eyes followed the part of her body which was uncovered. That\u2019s her feet! First time in my life, I realized that someone can have such beautiful feet. It was very fair with mixed red and pink color. That thought immediately followed by another thought. If she has such beautiful feet, how beautiful she might look like. That thought ignited my desire to see her face and I became restless to see her. I was desperately hoping her to look back. Perhaps, Chotu realized that and he shouted, turn back. I immediately covered his mouth in ordered to keep his voice down but till then she heard his voice. She stopped for a while and turned back as fast as she could. Then, first time I saw her face. I hadn\u2019t seen her before in the town. She was very beautiful, big black eyes, fair cheeks, naturally red lips. My heart started pumping fast. I never felt like that before, I got totally lost in her beauty. She stood in her place for some time. Then she proceeded towards me. There was too much anger in her eyes because she must had thought that I called her like that. For a second, I thought she was going to slap me. But she came near me, looked into my eyes for few second and warned me by pointing her finger on my chest. Then she turned back and went away in anger. I remained still at my place. What happened bro, did you like her? Chotu asked. What. Shut up, you speak anything. I came to my senses and replied hurriedly. Something must has happened. He again said cunningly. No, not at all. Let\u2019s eat samosa. I said to divert the matter. After that, I came home. I tried to read but couldn\u2019t. I tried to sleep but couldn\u2019t. Every time, I tried to do anything, her face used to come before me. The way she turned, her beauty, her anger, her courage when she was warning me, the whole scene, started repeating over and over in my mind like filmstrips. The whole night I was awake, and I don\u2019t know why I was smiling while remembering every scene that happened. Something totally new was happening with me but I was not able to understand what it was. Next morning, I dig some information about her name, home, school, etc from my sources and then I started chasing her without her knowledge. I started roaming around her house, school and other places just to have a look of her. For many days, neither I tried to speak to her nor I tried to come into her attention. Although many a times we crossed paths, but I used to cover myself by showing that it happened accidentally. I was not able to understand, when I had nothing to do with her then why the hell, I was following her. It started happening every day & became my daily routine and it started hampering my other routines. One day Chotu came to my home. \u201cWhere have you been man?\u201d He asked. I just looked at him, smiled but didn\u2019t answer. \u201cWhat is the meaning of this smile?\u201d He asked again. \u201cNothing.\u201d I said, and started playing with a ball. \u201cWhat nothing? Neither you come to college nor you attend cricket practice. You didn\u2019t even meet us. What happened to you brother?\u201d He asked worriedly. \u201cYou will not understand.\u201d I replied with a smile and kept doing what I was doing. \u201cTry me!\u201d He caught the ball and said. \u201cDo you remember that girl, whom you were teasing that day?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, that item!\u201d \u201cNever talk like that about her, ever.\u201d I grabbed his collar and warned him. \u201cOkay, chill pill. I am sorry man, what about that girl?\u201d I slowly released his collar and told him about my feelings about her. \u201cAre you in love with her?\u201d He asked out of curiosity. I looked at him for a second then deeply exhaled and told him. \u201cI don\u2019t know but whenever she comes before me, I forget everything. Whenever I see her, my heart starts beating very fast. I feel like, I can do anything for her. I don\u2019t remember anything except her. I am not even liking my favorite things. If this is love, then yes, I am in love with her.\u201d \u201cYou are a gone case man.\u201d He said and we both laughed. Love at first sight. ",

I will be answering from my male point of view ie How do you know that you love a girl? So you know you are in \u201cdeep love\u201d with a girl when:- You attend the super sleepy & boring morning lectures in college just to catch a glimpse of \u201cher\u201d or you prepare a topic beforehand that's to be taught in class next day, in order to impress \u201cher\u201dYou do not stare at her \u201ccurves\u201d and her \u201cassets\u201d rather you lose yourself by looking at her beautiful face and get drowned in the ocean of her sparking eyes.Your eyes automatically rests on the curls on her hair or the mole on her face but immediately move off your eyes once you see her looking at you.You crazily think of talking with her, but once the situation comes, out of extreme nervousness you start stammering and finally end up falling short of topics of discussion.Her WhatsApp or Facebook dps are saved in your phone's gallery and you later stare at those photos with blank eyes in the moments of solitude, realizing the epitome of beauty she is. But out of shyness, you refrain from commenting on her photos.She's your last thought when you go to sleep and your first thought when you wake up from sleep.You feel sad because she doesn't reply to your messages even though they are \u201cseen\u201d by her or when she takes too long to reply to a \u201chi\u201d, it makes you feel so unwanted.You feel jealous of the guys with whom she hangs out and you feel like hitting the guy who tried to hit on her.Although you \u201csmile\u201d when she calls you as her \u201cbest friend\u201d while she likes the guy called \u201cX\u201d, but your heart gets broken into thousands of pieces.You feel dejected on realizing that you are not more than a \u201cfriend with Benefits\u201d for her, whom she merely used at her hours of requirement. You being severely wounded by \u201cCupid's arrow\u201d decide to give importance to the other priorities of your lifeBut the wounds caused by Love doesn't get cured so easily. Only Love can heal the wounds caused by Love and this form of love is what we call the \u201cMotherly Love\u201d the purest form of love that ever existed in our Nature. Thank you for reading. ",

            "answer_text": "How do you know if you're in love? People who are in love generally feel a powerful sense of empathy toward their beloved, feeling the other person's pain as their own and being willing to sacrifice anything for the other person.Can't get that girl or guy out of your head? Daydreaming about the person when you should be working? Imagining your futures together? These dizzying thoughts may be signs of love. In fact, scientists have pinned down exactly what it means to \"fall in love.\" Researchers have found that an in-love brain looks very different from one experiencing mere lust, and it's also unlike a brain of someone in a long-term, committed relationship. Studies led by Helen Fisher, an anthropologist at Rutgers University and one of the leading experts on the biological basis of love, have revealed that the brain's \"in love\" phase is a unique and well-defined period of time, When you're in love, you begin to think your beloved is unique. The belief is coupled with an inability to feel romantic passion for anyone else. Fisher and her colleagues believe this single-mindedness results from elevated levels of central dopamine \u2014 a chemical involved in attention and focus \u2014 in your brain  ",

            "answer_text": "This question reminds me of a story I read sometime back about a man and a woman meeting in an art gallery and discussing their views on love. Neither of them had fallen in love before and they both seemed to be under the impression that love is not necessary in order for a man and woman to live together as a couple. It's always possible to live together and just be friends. To convince themselves of this hypothesis, they decided to give living together with each other a try since they felt they could be good friends and had common views on matters of love. However, just to be sure, they pondered over the question of 'In case love did happen, how would one be able to tell?' After giving it some thought, the man said, 'Maybe if I ever happen to use my money for buying cigarette on something else instead...something for you, that is, I would say that's love.' The woman, listening to this, replied, ' Well, if I ever happen to worry about you being late for dinner, I'd know it's love'. Thus they defined 'love' in their own ways, accepted each other's definitions and went ahead with living together as a couple. A few months later, the man came back home late one night and found the woman sitting on a chair waiting for him. Seeing she hadn't touched her dinner yet, he asked, ' Everything all right? Why haven't you eaten yet?' The woman looked at her, held her gaze for a few seconds and then gave a faint smile before saying,' I think it's happened for me, you know! I was worried about you getting so late and so couldn't eat'. Now the man seemed troubled and he stood still for a while saying nothing. Then he came towards her, went round the chair and placing his hand on the chair's back sighed, ' I wanted to buy you a book and spent my money on it instead of buying cigarettes. I wanted to find the right kind of book and that took me a while...' Define 'love' your own way and you'll be always be able to tell. ",

So, what makes it possible to determine if a man really likes you? Love can be very delicate. And when you add to that all the social obstacles to overcome, you can quickly find yourself overwhelmed by confusion. For centuries, people have struggled to solve the very complex mystery of love. Think of all the poems, stories, paintings and statues that have been inspired by love and the quest for it. The reality is that every human being has a different love story, and since we are all unique, our stories are different from each other. Here are some signs that love could be on your doorstep. Share this list and do not forget to leave a comment! 1. He is curious ... ... smaller things that do not really matter. He took note of how you drink your tea, not just in case it should make you one, but because it also reflects one aspect of your personality. Actually, it's a small detail that does not say much about you, but it's related to you. Think about your favorite singer when you were ten: did not you want to know his birthday and his favorite food? But why? No, of course, that does not make you a stalker, you just wanted to get a little closer to something you liked, and it could be similar to what your man is doing with you. 2. It does not just give you attention ... ... It's just that he can literally stop himself from doing it. He's not just looking at you, he's obviously struggling to look away. It is not a question here of \"examining you\", although he did it at first. It looks at you even when you have a messy bun or sweat, or even while you are jogging. 3. He encourages you Whether you give a public address or participate in a ping pong game, he is your biggest fan. He likes to see you win. He cares about your happiness and fun activities that bring you happiness. Learn more about love from this article. ",

            "answer_text": "We were dating for a while at the time this incident happened. One day I was trying to make a hole on a bag's trap, and I accidentally let the knife cut me. It was so painful and I bleed a lot. Yet I was calm and neutral, asking my boyfriend for helping me. He freaked out, and I was laughing at him saying, \"Look at you, freaking out at this thing! I'm good, no worry!\" Then few days later, one evening my boyfriend was washing some plates, and somehow he managed(!) to break one bowl which later cut himself quite badly. His left hand was covered in blood. I was standing by the window when I turned back to look at him and realized what went wrong. Now you should know that I didn't cry when I cut myself. But when I saw him with his cut, I bursted out crying. My tears kept falling I could not even explain why. I rushed into my room, my brain repeated desperately \u201cFind something like a bandage or plaster\", and I fully acknowledged that I need anything to stop the bleeding, but I just couldn't. My hands were almost shaking and my muscles seemed to stop working. There was an intense, burning pain in my chest that I've never felt before, I felt like there were thousands of knives stabbing in my heart, my lungs, my chest. My body temperature went up as I struggled to figure out what to bring him. When I managed to bring (instead of only what was necessary) the whole medicine and plaster box, his bleeding finally stop. He was looking at me like he want to both laugh at me and hug me at the same time, while still I felt the pain and I was sobbing for a long moment after that before I could completely calm down. That was when I knew I were in love. It felt like his bleeding fingers have some sort of connectivity with my physical status. It reminded me of a scene in one movie from the Twilight series (I know you might say this is lame but haha) when Bella sacrificed herself for Edward when he was tortured, since she didn't want him to suffer. \"Kill me, kill me. Not him\". People with extreme sensitivity might have these feelings easily from probably ordinary things, but for most of us, I suppose it is love. It is love that we feel happy when your partner is jubilant and hurtful when he/ she is sad/ in pain. We become emotionally vulnerable when we are in love, and there is a strong connection between the other person's situation and your own. Often our emotions are unpleasant when our partner is unhappy, depressed, anxious etc., and the pain is extreme when they suffer severe health issues, or when they pass away, for instance. As with most things in life, romantic relationships are, for many of us, a double-edged sword: while most find it wonderful to love and be loved, developing intimate emotional ties to someone makes us emotionally vulnerable\u2014vulnerable not only to being hurt by our partner's opinions of and feelings toward us, but also vulnerable to being affected by our partner's bad moods. - There is a thing called broken heart syndrome, believed to occur when someone loses a close partner or spouse. Death of a spouse is recognised as one of the most stressful things that can happen to a person. But as well as the mental anguish and grief (which are themselves very debilitating and not to be dismissed), many forget that stress also has a physical component. Stress can cause numerous physical ailments, and if the stress is sudden and serious enough, such as if a spouse dies, then these ailments can be very serious, affecting the heart.

You see her everywhereYou cannot stop thinking about herYou dream her and an awkward awake while dreaming about loosing her.You always think what you will do when she will be with you.You start assuming that she is already with you and you start behaving like this and then later you realized it is just an assumption and then you smile at yourself. (Most dangerous symptom)You already started giving respect to her parents even though you dint meet them yet.Your heart started pumping more blood when you see her name written somewhere or you heard her name from someone.You stalk her everywhere and want to know each and everything about her.you go to her place to see her but don\u2019t talk due to lack of courage or there is nothing to talk and then you ask yourself \u201cwhat the hell am I doing here\u201d.You already accepted her all future apologies, her bad habits and her loopholes.You don\u2019t want to spend a single minute without her and you don\u2019t want to loose her if she will be yours.You are ready to sacrifice everything for her, in fact you already started sacrificing.You always want to help her either to make her happy and to fulfill her dreams or to spend more time with her.If you driving or riding, you started assuming that she is with you (second most dangerous symptom as this can cause an accident)If you are having these symptoms, Congrats, you are in LOVE my mate, in short you are screwed up completely, now only god will hep you. Can\u2019t say Good Luck because that is not going to work .. :D :D :D :D ",

            "answer_text": "You know you\u2019re in love when she\u2019s all you think of. You know you\u2019re in love when she\u2019s all you dream of. Back in college, I used to have a crush on this girl. Boy, I used to be crazy about her. So crazy, that at one point I was convinced that I had fallen for her. Absolutely hated the feeling. It\u2019s a beautiful feeling though. There\u2019s nothing like it. Nothing better than it, yet nothing worse off. You find poetry in her movements. You find certainty in her actions. You find beauty in pain, pain that is self-inflicted, and not on others. Your threshold to nuisance is set to infinity. You\u2019ve never been calmer, but your insides have never screamed louder. You\u2019ve never lived like this before, and you\u2019ve never felt more alive. And oh, the butterflies. Thousands of them that you feel in your abdomen. The feeling is infectious. It spreads like cancer. But a one that could cure you of any illness. It glides like a butterfly, stings like a bee. It kills you from the inside, yet your life has never been more \u201clivable\u201d. You feel weak at the knees, but the rest of your body has never been more strong. You could have done a thousand crunches, a million planks, but your abdomen would have never felt a beating like this before, beatings from the thousands of butterflies that circulate in your stomach. You\u2019re no longer the most important person in the world. Your brain turns its back on you. It switches side when you need it the most. But your heart has got your back. It is true what they say about love, after all. Love is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. What struck me was definitely \u201cunstoppable\u201d. And she? Most definitely \u201cimmovable\u201d. There was a point in time when she was all I used to think of, from the second I wake up. She was all I used to think of all-through the day until the second I sleep. Heck! She used to conquer most of my dreams. When love hits you, you change as a person. You become soft. Suddenly you\u2019re the most empathetic person in the world. The world starts making more sense. You finally understand what all these poets have been writing in their poems. You realize that it is a beautiful world after all. The flowers, the plants, the grass, the birds, the sky, the clouds, the rain, oh dear the rain are things you newly develop an affinity towards. You\u2019ve never felt more helpful before. You\u2019ve never felt more helpless before. Do you ever realise that when you view a bird, a majestic one, you forget the sky behind? Similarly, when you see her - the world behind her fades, freezes, and ceases to exist. \u201cYou know you\u2019re in love when you can\u2019t fall asleep because the reality is finally better than your dreams\u201d - Dr.Seuss  To end things, it feels like you\u2019re flying. You\u2019d know you\u2019d break when you fall, shatter when you fail. Everyone around you is going to tell you the same. But when you meet someone worth it, who are we to say? You\u2019d choose to fly anyway. *Image courtesy: WikiHow ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A :) 1. When you are in love, you see everything as beautiful, you may think that it is so Bollywood type, but in reality, it does happen and the reason is simple when we are in love our heart remains happy and a happy person cannot see anything ugly 2. You want to be with that person 24*7 because the feeling you got with that person is indescribable. 3. You share your happiness, sadness, failure, success, and everything that matters in your life with that person. 4. You want to look beautiful or Smart for just that person. 5. You get worried about him/her if he/she does not responds to your call. 6. You want to listen to his/her voice every time because his/her voice sounds like a melody to us. It Keeps our heart at peace. 7. You want to dress according to his/her choices(not because he/she forces you, but you want to show that person how much he/she means to you) 8. Whenever you talk to that person or meets with that person, you start getting excited and nervous at the same time, nervous not because you are uncomfortable with that person but because of the fact that you want to be perfect for that person and do not want to commit any mistakes. 9. Surprising that person(Sweet and Happy surprises) becomes your favorite hobby. 10. You start doing something which you rarely do, like if you do not cook but you start cooking for that person just to see him/her smiling. There are so many ways to know that you are in love, but the main thing is you came to know about it because that feeling is really beautiful, that\u2019s another thing that later it brings pain to you, but at that moment that pain does not matter. It\u2019s good to be in Love because loving someone makes us realize the actual meaning of Love, taught us the meaning of sacrifice and happiness. Have a good day :) Thanks for the 400+ views :) ",

I always get attracted to girls who : are good writers and poetsare good singersare good in studyhave great presence of mindare filled with good charactersare beautiful ( men have been admirers of beauty for a long time. It's our default setting, not our fault.)Actually we all travel through roads, meet new people and see new people in news or at social media. We get attracted with them . Wow ! How superb she is. But attraction with these people are temporary. We forget them when we find or see new one. Actually \u201cattraction\u201d is a temporary feeling. And we are made to forget these all. But Love is a permanent feeling or you can say it works in long run. We can get attracted to many persons at a point of time but we are in love with only one. Following are the symptoms that you're in love with her or him : You can't propose easily a person with whom you're in love. You always have fear may be she or he got angry.You wanna see her or him daily but when she or he comes before you, you begin to hesitate or your heartbeat goes faster.Whenever you see couples in a movie or in any public place, you start to imagine yourself with her or him.When you're angry with your family or the whole world seems nonsense, you wanna talk with her or him.You wanna kiss her or him and sleep with her or him but for lifetime.You want a baby like her or him.If you're in group of your friends, when you laugh, you stare that person most whom you love.You like her all acting and girlish drama and always try to please her.( This point is only for boys)You may remember any person at night to fulfill your loneliness but even when you're busy in your work in daytime, you miss her or him and her or his talkings.You visit her or his social media profile often. And check a single comment or like.You may be not talk with her or him for a long time but when you get chance for talking , an hour seems to be a second.When you love a person truly, you love her or his demerits too.When you get options to choose between \u201cEmma Watson\u201d and her, you choose her.(for boys). And between \u201cLeonardo dicaprio\u201d and him, you choose the latter (for girls).Your true love always motivate you to achieve higher goals in your life.( It never hampers your study or career)Adding more points : 15. You're thinking about that person while reading it. 16. You can wait for her or his acceptance for a long time. 17. You get fired or become sad when somebody says something wrong about him or her. Edit: 18. You can never forget birthday of your beloved or lover. 19. His or her name becomes password of your ID or cellphone. 20. When you're in love with someone truly, you take greater risks for her or him. True love provides you courage. 21. Her or his whatsapp chat becomes your favourite bookmark. You re-read it again and again. 22. You begin to represent as a nice person before his or her parents. Either you begin to show more love for his or her parents or begin to get scared of his or her parents. Adding an amazing symptom : 23. You begin to love her or his name, too. You may show interest in the person of his or her name. ",

            "answer_text": "This one by Bob Marley defines love the best, I believe... \"Only once in your... life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you\u2019ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can\u2019t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it\u2019s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn\u2019t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day\u2019s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there\u2019s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you\u2019re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there\u2019s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that\u2019s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.\u201d -Bob Marley ",

And some clues are obvious, and some are not? It\u2019s kind of like that. Love means wanting to see the other person again, and soon. Love is about wanting to get close to that other person. Love tends to be a bit confusing. And for lots of people, feeling love for someone is a bit disturbing. It may be disturbing, when one is otherwise comfortable, to have these \u201clove\u201d feelings intrude. And love is a bit idealistic, too. Like the other person is just the best ever. Kind of ridiculous, when you think about it. But then, how nice is it if someone loves you, and thinks you are just the best ever? And the other part of the issue is that you may be wrong. Or, about as bad, that you are in love, and the other person\u2026is not. Not even close. That is very disturbing. So there is some risk involved. This can be very upsetting to some people. As a result, most people are kind of cautious about saying they love someone. ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, how do you know that he doesn't feel the same way about you? Just express your feelings for him and see what happens. The worst thing that can happen is he can reject you. But sure he'll know that you have feelings for him. May be situation may change after that. People like people who like them. But don't get disappointed if he rejects you. Things will get together very slowly. Be patient. Be very patient. That is the only thing you can do. I don't know what to call this situation. Love or not. These things happen to people in teenage and their twenties. It is because of hormones that develop in this stage and everything you feel is because of that. I say this because I never came across an old man or a kid saying that he is in love with a girl. You don't feel the same about him after your twenties. Say him that you love him because you don't have to regret about it in the future. If he rejects you, no problem. He'll realize your value in the future. And I'm not sure whether you fell for his physique and external appearance or you fell for him thinking that you both understand each other well enough that you could both live together and you both have something in common to share and can solve each others problems and stand up for each other and be happy. Answer this question to yourself. Clearly don't cheat yourself in answering this question. If you choose the first one and even if he accepts, it'll not survive long and you'll regret in the future. If you are sure that he's THE ONE then express your feelings for him.Don't think about the other girl. There isn't any perfect couple. Just the understanding between two people makes them perfect instead of their appearances.Even if he rejects, don't feel sorry for yourself or for him. You said what you felt and he said what he felt. His feeling are as important that of yours. He has his life too just like yours.If he accepts then all happies.. :) But just tell him and wait what will happen.If he doesn't know you have feelings for him,, how can he accept in the first place? You'll never know for sure what will happen until you tell him.. ",

            "answer_text": " A record number of women said they had fallen in love with The Bachelor\u2019s Ben Higgins this season. Maybe these women were caught up in the allure of exotic dates and romantic gestures or maybe some of them were really falling in love with Bachelor Ben. Love is both exciting and confusing. So how can we tell when we have really fallen in love? A lot happens in our mind and body when we\u2019ve fallen in love. We get feelings of euphoria, passion, and happiness. There are clues Bachelor Ben should notice that can help point him to the right woman. Here\u2019s how to know what true love looks like: 1. Thinking About Them Constantly When you\u2019re in love with someone, they\u2019re your first thought in the morning and your last thought at night. Your mind frequently thinks of them and the time you spent together. When you have good news you want to share it with them first. When you\u2019re stressed out or had a bad day, you want their support before anyone else\u2019s.  2. Time Together is Meaningful A big difference between love and lust is how you spend your time together. If you\u2019re spending time together laughing, talking about things that are important to you both, and being yourselves around one another \u2014 you could be falling in love. If the majority of your time together is spent hooking up and being physical, then it\u2019s probably lust.  3. Miss Them When Apart When someone becomes a huge part of our lives, time away from them is difficult. If you find yourself missing someone immensely when you\u2019re apart, and then you are over-the-moon excited about seeing them again, it\u2019s a good sign love is in the air.  4. Want to Talk About Them You can\u2019t help but talk about your new beau to family and friends. You find small ways to bring them up in conversations. Every chance you get you name drop them. You speak praisingly about them. 5. Accepting of Their Imperfections No one\u2019s perfect. But when you\u2019re in love with someone, you don\u2019t find their imperfections and quirks annoying. You actually like her loud, cackling laugh or the way he is so meticulous with everything in his garage.  6. Rather Do Nothing With Them Than Anything Else You\u2019d rather spend time with your loved one, doing nothing, than going to the most exciting event with someone else. You simply want to be with them. Being in their company trumps doing anything else. 7. Thinking About the Future You start to picture a life together. You can\u2019t imagine your life without them and you start thinking long term. You want to spend time with their family and friends to get to know them even better. As opposed to liking or being infatuated with someone which is so much more focused only on the here and now. ",

            "answer_text": "IMO, falling is the key word here. Love is actually a sacrificial \u201cextreme empathy\u201d in wanting the betterment for another (or others) and has zero return expectations This is why \u201cloving\u201d and not wanting to be discovered by the recipient, is the highest form of a sacrificial \u201ctrue love\u201d. That means that if you want something (like \u201cto be noticed\u201d) then that love is already tainted. But of course we mix the mate selecting and mating rituals with this \u201ctrue love\u201d and that can easily mess up the \u201ctrue love\u201d part of the equation (because we are genetically drawn to mate). With all that said, \u201cfalling in love\u201d is actually an infatuation and most commonly, it is a result of the mating ritual of \u201cI would like to mate and procreate\u201d with that person. Yes, we use very romantic words and images for this process (and that is as it should be given the importance of this process). So it is the \u201dbeing tipped over\u201d sense of falling (losing your balance) that is the essence of falling in love. We have an image in our mind (a mix of past experiences and innate beauty traits, including language and body language) hinting at \u201capproachability\u201d or even the opposite: impervious (confident and disciplined). It is said that Cleopatra was not as physically beautiful (in our current definition of that) but knew language and body language that was irresistible to most men (if/when she chose to display it). We also know that Marilyn Monroe learned and used coy and available physical and language displays as lures for men and many men were lured (JFK, for one).   Those are more obvious examples of what some men find attractive. Women generally have a different criteria and seek a confident and capable male so they can be on the look out for displays that align with that. Below are some well known exaggerated metaphors for this more traditional match. That traditional match is deeply programmed in our genes and of course, is tempered by our individual experiences since birth. A hint of this remains in us (IMO) and is certainly part of the \u201cmaybe I found the right one\u201d in our unconsciousness (if not consciousness). I believe this is the root cause of the \u201cfalling\u201d sensation of romance in the pre-mating ritual. It can be a beautiful process but, due to it\u2019s fundamental power in/over us) is highly prone to manipulation as well :) Lastly, remember, if you have very little experience with men or women \u201cdisplaying\u201d their availability you may be \u201cbowled over\u201d the first time you see someone making those displays. So proceed with caution: It might be your inexperience (inability to remain balanced) that is causing you to fall, not the other person\u2019s \u201crightness for you\u201d. That can be like a naive person seeing their first impressive colorful product advertisement so they impulsively run out and buy the product (and regret it later seeing that it was only an advertisement). :) Good luck!

            "answer_text": "Day before yesterday, I was talking to one of my college friends. He: Yaar, I love Sonika (name changed). Is she single? Me: Umm, I don't know. He: But she's your good friend. How can you not know this? Me: Dude, chill and don't be desperate. You don't even know her properly. Love does not happen this way. He: Yes, yes, I know. Don't tell me.  I know a good friend of mine, she's in relationship with this guy for almost four years now. They both were batchmates for two years but didn't talk much. Both were the toppers of their respective sections. On the day of farewell party, they had their first pic together and talked a little bit. After final exams, they came into touch and started talking. Soon, they became friends. They shared their goals and targets.They talked about their family, life, people, world, cosmos and what not. They became best-friends. Fast forward to three-four years, they are a happy couple. Their thoughts and intellect level match. They both are complementary to each other. When my friend was in severe depression, he was there to make sure she'd taken her meals properly. He was there to tell her that everything will be fine. He was there to make her feel special at her worst. He was there to love her even when she wasn't having enough love for herself. And when he needed her, she made sure that she was his strength and not his weakness. She was there with him all throughout like his armour. They both love each other selflessly without expecting anything in return. So, whosoever you think you\u2019re in love with, Can you love him/her selflessly? Can you be there with them in their worst? Can you sacrifice your happiness for them even without letting them know that? Can you? Love doesn't have to be intentional (as in the first case). And if it's intentional, it's not love. You don't plan to be in love. It just happens. From being acquaintances, to friends, to best-friends and then girlfriend/boyfriend. It's a long journey. You're in love when you think about them before thinking of yourself. You're in love if you fall for their heart and not face. You're in love when you find perfection in their flaws. You're in love when he/she is in your heart and not on your mind. ",

I know when honey moon is over and I know what it looks like, feels like.I have experience and a wealth of it to know.I have given time for the chemicals/infatuation to flow dry and find, that I feel more than I did for her before.I admire more than her body. I love her personality, her care for nature, for the world, her concerns about other people, her freedom in which she dares and is bold to meet no matter what. And I so the same with her.Her sexual confidence, how she\u2019s comfortable in her own skin and open to share all with me, without shame and guilt. That\u2019s a woman with guts, courage and self awareness.Don\u2019t get me wrong. I am a man who likes a woman body, and I need to be attracted to her but then it gets deeper, because to keep a man like me, a sexual lover, a woman needs to have more\u2026compatibility if you will.I know because I would cross oceans, climb mountains, face whoever if I need to, without any problem because I love her. Any problem, whatever society says, relatives say, I don\u2019t care. I am committed to loving her.That we are comitted and we don\u2019t let anything like distance, worries about what others think, and any challenges. We always talk with certainty and we say..\u201cWe will find a way my..\u201dAnd we always do.But in all things, regarding love or infatuation, it is due to the knowledge and experiences. These alone let me know that it is really love.While others grow in dissappointments and cautiousness - I grow in never being afraid to feel infatuated and nor if it grows into love. I love both of these feelings and I understand them well.They are a gift but for the naive, for the immature and the inexperienced, they can also be their curse, downfall and a prison for them.",

            "answer_text": " Love is hands the down the best feeling to experience in life. There is a certain time in the relationship when you begin to have feelings and emotions that you have not experienced before. I knew I fell in love with my partner when the thought of her would never leave my head. Being in love was not something I have ever experienced prior to meeting my fianc\u00e9. When I\u2019m with her all I want to do is give her the world because of how great of a person she is. Love is something that is developed over time with patience and the intent to grow. How do know if you\u2019re truly in love? Time vanishes. When you\u2019re with your partner it just seems like time disappears. This happens because you are so in the moment with that person time seems to go away. Love makes time feel unreal and you get to experience being in the moment. Being fully focused because that person captures your time. You don\u2019t mind spending time with this person and they\u2019re captivating.You Forgive each other. Forgiveness is the key to growing your love for each other. When two people are in love it\u2019s easier to forgive because you take the entire relationship into consideration. It\u2019s important to build the habit of forgiving each other for getting upset or forgetting to do something. Make an agreement with each other that when you upset with one another that it\u2019s not the intent.You communicate. Communication is the most important component to a strong relationship. When you can communicate with each other and be honest that\u2019s love. It\u2019s when we are able to tell the other person what is bothering us and not expecting them to know what the problem is. When you love someone communicating with them will not feel like it\u2019s a challenge and it\u2019ll come with ease. Make the agreement to be honest with each other and to talk when you feel hurt or something is bothering you.You\u2019re committed to growing. When you are in a relationship begin to take the right steps to grow and strengthen it. This means that the two of you are willing to make agreements on certain disagreements. Make the commitment to hold each other accountable for accomplishing your goals and dreams. When you help each other grow in life it will make the relationship stronger and love more certain.These are some of the key factors that have helped me determine what \u201clove\u201d may be. There\u2019s 7 billions people on this planet and we all experience emotions differently. I do assure you that if you apply these principles to your life they can help strengthen your relationship and connection. Love is beautiful. Thank you so much for reading! Please reach out to me if you have any questions! ",

            "answer_text": "True love takes work. No love will last forever (without effort), as people change over time and memories fade. The short of it \u2014 you know you\u2019re truly in love if the other person is worth fighting for, despite every hardship, every argument, every unintended (and sometimes intended) insult; whether they\u2019re sick or healthy, poor or rich, hurting, depressed or happy, and all sorts of places in between (provided they\u2019re not abusive). And also, if they think of you that way. Now, I\u2019m only 31, so I don\u2019t have the most life experience to share this from, but I have been with the same woman for the last 10 years now \u2014 not because there are \u201cmagical\u201d sparkles that flutter about us whenever we\u2019re near each other. Not at all. We\u2019ve committed to work through all our pain, hardships, trials, issues, etc. And that has been worth it. Knowing that she has my back, even when I have a bad day and accidentally snap at her (or our kids). Knowing that even when she does the same, I can trust that she will be willing to work through it. When we were financially tight, we were stressed, but we trusted each other, and worked together. What I do know, is that my parents are still together, since 1980, and my grandparents were able to celebrate their 70th wedding anniversary together, before my grandpa died. They\u2019ve definitely worked for it. My dad tells me many times that his parents would fight, have issues, terrible moments, but they worked through it and remained married and in love in such a way that even I, as a child, was able to see it, and to the day my grandpa died, last year, despite my grandpa developing Alzheimer\u2019s and nearly forgetting my grandma. My parents, likewise, had their share of issues \u2014 financial, work hours, etc. But they worked through it, and are still, to this day, incredibly affectionate with each other (my dad still grabs her butt\u2026 yeah). My wife and I also know that her parents (if you\u2019d call them that) didn\u2019t work at it, and were divorced under 5 years. Her mom married 3 times, but never attempted to make it work \u2014 it was always the guy\u2019s fault, somehow, some way (even though she\u2019s borderline narc). So, once again, you know that you\u2019re truly in love when you know that other person is worth fighting for, and they believe the same of you. ",

If you have truly found your love then go, hold, grab and hug her and whenever you get time, just say and express to her how much you love her coz it takes a very long period of your lifetime to find such a kind of love.

            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A , User-11569400653600125630 Firstly I wanna confess here, that I am in love \u2764\ufe0f Next question instantly striked to your mind , with whom ? Right na ? Ahmmm\u2026. The one and only my parents and my brother :-) Then next question came in your mind that I asked her, how do you know if you are in love ? Why is she giving such stories ;-) Now, Let's come to the question, how I get to know that I am in love with my parents and my brother :-) Here I go, When I realised, My happiness is the only reason of their happinessThey will always stand up for me whether I am right or wrongThey are my strength as well as my weaknessThey sacrificed their life to make my future brightWhenever dark clouds appeared in my life, they pampered me and consoled meThey trust me and I trust themI feel safe whenever I am around themI come first in their prayers and they come first in my prayersThey feel absence of my presence, whenever there is some special dayWhenever I was ill, they asked me, are you ok ? Calling again and again after some time to check whether I am ok nowThey always miss me whenever I was in hostel, still I am in hostel, I am sure they are missing me and I am missing them. This I realised when they used to call me and asked me same question everyday, when will you come home ?Every decision for the sake of my family, like buying something household, whether renovating my home, for every little thing related to my home and my family, they ask for my advice, which made me feel specialI can bear anything, any type of pain, but I can't see tears in my parents eyes and vice- versaWhenever I felt hungry, they will instantly get tons of food in front of me :-DThey always think about me first then for anything else.They can't imagine their life without their children and I can't imagine my life without my parents and my brother.Whenever I was sad, they noticed my sadness and asked the reason for my sadness, even If i was smiling to hide my situation or pain.They love me a lot, but still has courage to handover me to someone else.They don't want to bound me, but want to see me flying like a bird.I am not going to stay with them for my entire life, as every girl has to leave her home after her marriage, even then they are educating me, caring for me, want to see me happy, sacrificing their life , so that my future should be secured, who else than parents can do like this for me.Then I realised that only parents love is unconditional and true love So I am in love with my parents and my brother, by realising these emotions, feelings, I came to know that I am in love :-) Love is love whether your love is for your parents or parent\u2019s love for their children, friend, any person with whom you want to spend your entire life, but these things can make you realise that you are in love You can relate these things with anyone, with whom you want to know whether you are in love or not ? Because definition of love always remains same :-) Happy reading !! ",

            "answer_text": "Well, falling in love can be a glorious feeling, as long as the other person feels the same about you. When you start falling in love, your life is all about that person. They are constantly on your mind. They are your obsession. Your first thought when you wake up in the morning is about them, and so is the last thought before going to sleep at night. You get absent-minded, clumsy, and look lost in a daze. You smile at them, you wanna be around them, you wanna talk to them all the time, you want them in your world, and them only! You are just head over heels in love with everything they say and do. You get their phone number and talk on the phone (Assuming they like you enough to do give those digits to you!) You can also connect to them on a social media platform. The only thing left to do is ask them out, where you continue the closeness, where one day, they feel these things for you. It is really mindblowing! Let me be clear. Falling in love can be awesome, but it can also can be a bad thing. If that person doesn\u2019t feel the same, then you are in a one-sided, or unrequited, situation. It does you no good if you are in this situation. You need to fall in love with someone who already likes you a lot, and is attracted to you. Falling in love with someone who simply likes you as a friend could be a bad situation, but sometimes can grow from friendship to love. Just make sure you are both on the same page before letting those feelings happen. You can usually tell when you both are feeling something special for eachother. ",

The person who is your perfect love. Your half. The person with butterflies hovering all around. And rainbows shining out of their butt. As per the legend, you are supposed to locate each other, guided by nothing more than a sheer instinct. And when the magical moment happens, you unite in a blissful union and live happily ever after. Making babies and sailing Mediterranean. At the same time. Then you keep growing older and getting crunchier. The puberty is long over but the magic didn't happen. You kept waiting and waiting. You kept searching for your true love in the cold shiny eyes of strangers. But it didn't come. So, you sort of give up on that idea quietly. You stash it away as far as you can. It was just a silly childhood theory after all. You pair up with whomever seems a proper choice and get on the best you can. By the time that fails, you don't even think about your \u201clove\u201d anymore. Then, someday you freeze in your tracks. Because there's something about that someone you just met. That your mind is just so excitedly stubborn about, as a dog with a fresh bone. You get closer to have a better look. For sure, it's nothing. But no, it sure as hell does look like your silly teenage dream. Except that it's not perfect. It's somewhat misshapen and tied to this person with flaws and reality. Frustrated, you try to swim away quickly. And then you realize that you can't. It hurts. The more you try to swim away, the harder it hurts. So, you return. And feel whole, for the first time in your life. Together, you can rule the world. Apart, you can't even tie your shoes. You're paralyzed by the all-consuming fear of losing something precious and irreplaceable. The Universe tells you to be together. No matter what. You're in love. ",

When our heart skips a beat at their sight, or their approach. When we begin missing the person, the moment we loose sight of each other. When talking all day about that person, to our friends and family doesn't seem enough. When we sleep with his/ her thoughts, and wake up with the same. When dreams revolve around him/ her. When his/ her choices seems the best in this world. When his/her priorities becomes ours. When a single hurt to that person brings in a great hurt in us. When his/her life aim, becomes our priority. When we think of all possible ways, and make efforts to make that person the happiest in this world. When his/her voice becomes the greatest music of all times. When we crave to keep listening to the deep down talks and thoughts of that person and some where keep relating ous own. When a mistaken touch gives a goose bump and we keep on recalling the scenario, if it just happened ? When our eyes stops resting on anyone else but that very person, when it comes to feelings, love, life. When mind frames, multiple imaginary scenarios of a happy life, full of love with that person. When all the love songs, begin to top our playlist. When being called the greatest bathroom singer becomes a moment of pride. When we think of all great stuffs to gift that person, just to bring a smile and to make him/her feel our love and compassion towards them. Every time when our heart skips a beat at his/ her smile, and wishes to god , to preserve that smile forever. When we crave to live forever, an eternal love life with him/her. When a single thought of misfortune, gives chills, and when our hands join tighter and head kneels lowers amidst the almighty, to be in favour always. The list is an endless one, I can go on forever. I guess I should stop for now, with this message, that \u201c Love is the greatest and the strongest feeling of this world\u201d. If ever you get this true feeling, Accept it, Confess it, and never let that person go, let the Love grow, forever and ever.  ",

You can only love one person at any given time like this cause there is no time, room or capacity in your being to give yourself & of yourself. It is the total opposite of lust. You want their body, mind & spirit. You take the good with the bad. You love their truth & can put up with their lies if they can give plausible explanations. It\u2019s not about you; nor just them but it\u2019s about us & we (are one unit). How can we be better (together). You share your time, talents & treasures with each other. You become better because of them. You don\u2019t mind being vulnerable & transparent because you trust them with your secrets. You\u2019re consumed in your conscious & subconscious with positive thoughts about them & us; in your dreams & it\u2019s a nightmare without them. In Love is you & them together, forever. WE IS ONE!

            "answer_text": "Let's first start with a description of love. There are several types of love; I assume you are referring to romantic (or eros) love. Love is an act of giving. True eros love is a deep and steadfast mutual DESIRE to GIVE of ourselves to each other. Therefore, it is crucially important to understand that love is not a duty or obligation of some sort; it is a shared passion. As a desire, love is steadfast and very persistent. It compels us to act. If we don't it \u201cnags\u201d at us. It draws attention to itself and demands response. This is because love has a gravitational pull, and it is very hard to resist. :) Love makes us feel good. Good about life, good about ourselves, good about our future. Love is GOOD and it literally produces good and \u201csweet\u201d fruits. Love, sweet love. There is nothing bitter about it. There is also nothing fearful about it. Love overcomes fear. Finally, love begets love, so it stands to reason that authentic love makes us love ourselves more. This is why lovers often remark \u201cI love myself when I'm around you\u201d and \u201cyou bring out the best in me.\u201d :) There are many great love songs with such titles. Love compels us to express ourselves in so many ways, it literally makes us want to sing! So now I pose the question back to you : do you love them? Only you know if they make you feel the ways in which I have described above, particularly with respect to good feelings and and the gravitational desire to gladly, passionately and mutually give of yourselves to one another. May you love deeply and be loved deeply in return all the days of your life. -A man who is blessed to know love deeply. ",

            "answer_text": "LOVE IS NOT A FEELING. LOVE IS A DAILY CHOICE. Why is it so rare for an individual to understand what love is? These questions and the attempts at their answers make me feel so awful because I know how much devastation this flawed perspective and definition can bring to a persons life. So many deaths have been caused by people misunderstanding what love is. So many deaths could be prevented by simply having better education on love. So much value has been wasted, all because people refuse to humble themselves long enough to grasp what love truly is. LOVE IS NOT A FEELING. LOVE IS A DAILY CHOICE. Everyone seems to think that love is a feeling, just because it can be used in that context. Someone says that they love going bike riding, or they love driving, or they love hanging out with friends, then they associate love with a feeling. It is true, there can be plenty of emotions that accompany love, the emotions range from blissful when cuddling to pure rage when someone they love is in critical trouble. These emotions and strong feelings are not the indication of whether love is real, the thoughts and actions the individual chooses indicate whether the love is real. When you're a parent you can\u2019t believe that love is based on feeling and still be a good parent. Your children are DEFINITELY going to make you feel like strangling them. They are not going to be producing that lovey-dovey feeling in your heart 24/7. Neither will anyone on this earth EVER be capable of giving you those feelings for long periods of time. It\u2019s just not ever going to happen, and anyone who says otherwise is either selling something or trying to make themselves feel better about their own wasted lives. LOVE IS NOT A FEELING. LOVE IS A DAILY CHOICE. Learn to avoid so much of life\u2019s pain right now by grasping those capitalized words in the bold text. Love is not a feeling, love is a daily choice. Your emotion will follow your action regardless, that\u2019s why you need to be the one to control love, don\u2019t let your understanding of love control you. So many people in today\u2019s society are mesmerized by the Hollywood fake idea of love. It\u2019s infected so many places, so many institutions, even all across the academic world this is such a flagrant issue. We have this fear of being rejected and abandoned, yet we won\u2019t stay committed to others unless we are getting those \u2018lovey-dovey feelings\u2019 at a guaranteed frequency? Come on, let's think a little harder here, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to flip the roles and find out that you\u2019re asking for something you\u2019re not willing to give yourself. No. It\u2019s not anyone else's responsibility to make you feel good. Regardless, you shouldn\u2019t even concern yourself with anyone else\u2019s responsibilities but your own. In a relationship, seek to love without keeping a record, seek to love without expecting anything in return, seek to love out of genuine love! LOVE IS NOT A FEELING. LOVE IS A DAILY CHOICE. THE END.

When I was a teenager, I would have probably said something like \u201cwhen you think about the person almost non-stop and just the thought of them makes you smile and you can see the 2 of your together forever.\u201d I would\u2019ve given you the typical juvenile answer but, of course, I would have thought it was prolific, haha. In my 20\u2019s, after a couple disappointing long term relationships and a few short term dating fizzles, I probably would have said you know you\u2019re in love when you don\u2019t worry whether or not they\u2019re going to take care of their shit!\u201d Haha, yeah, I was very frustrated and I hadn\u2019t yet realized that I was the common denominator in all the situations. Mmmhmm. Now that I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s, I think that love is a feeling that isn\u2019t complete by itself. What I mean is that love can\u2019t exist in a vacuum. It needs compassion and understanding and encouragement and constant reassurance and, above all, it needs faith. As a species, I think we mistakenly think that love- romantic love, that is - is supposed to be all hearts and butterflies and rainbows and we forget that 2 people are usually attracted to each other because they are the mirror image of each other; we gravitate to those who are strong where we are not and vice versa. And it\u2019s a good method, for sure, narcissistic as it may be, haha - the trouble comes when we find a point that we both think is our strong point, and we don\u2019t know how to agree to disagree. My boyfriend and I are both Alpha; both have been the \u201caggressor\u201d in our previous relationships and when we first got together, anytime we got to one of those points where we both thought we knew we were right, you know, one of our \u201cstrong\u201d points, it was Clash of the Titans version 4.0. I\u2019m no shrinking violet and my boyfriend had never been with someone like me. It took us a while to make our adjustments, but it was quite the spectacle for my neighbors, I\u2019m sure, haha. So, how do I know I\u2019m in love? Because I still want to be here tomorrow. :) K ",

And he laughed and told them \u201cThere is no pretty girl coming in my gym these days so i don\u2019t find any inspiration to go.\u201d Well I didn\u2019t say anything but I felt bad. And I was thinking that he doesn\u2019t love me now. Then in the morning it was usual routine and I was busy with some household works. He: \u201cDivya, can you come\u201d Me: \u201cWhat happened?\u201d. He: \u201cHave you seen my black jeans.\u201d Me (Shouting): \u201cIs this all my responsibility? Can\u2019t you even take care of your own stuff. I have got so much to do and instead of helping me, you want me to find your jeans. Seriously this is too much!\u201d He didn\u2019t utter a single word. Still i searched and handed over that jeans to him. He smiled and hugged me with emotional eyes & pinched my cheeks. And said: \u201cThank you janu\u201d. Me: \u201cTake it now and from next time please do take care of at least your own things.\u201d We both went to office. In evening after we returned. He (Smiling with naughty expressions): \u201cSee, I have ordered these grocery items for you.\u201d Me (feeling good): \u201cOkay thanks, but why you are saying that you have ordered for me. This is for both of us not just for me and anyway it\u2019s very easy to order anything online. One day you do my tasks and then you will know how difficult it is to manage everything.\u201d He laughed and hugged me and said: \u201cYes, you are right janu\u201d At that moment I not only knew that I am in love with him but i also knew that he was in love with me too.  Answering this question. You know you are in love with someone when you fall in love with them everyday over and over again despite their flaws. \u2764\ufe0f Thanks for reading. \ud83d\udc9e Check out my stories on Instagram: @divyasharmagoyal ",

            "answer_text": "It's different for everyone but for me it has to start in a certain way for me I don't know why but for me to be able to reach that level of love to being considered as being in love. Like I can be attracted to a person and still love them but if a certain person and I've only met 3 people in my life that had struct me that way. 1st one I married then she widowed me 2nd rejected me because of misunderstanding about my intentions. She thought I was a player. 3rd was when I was in med school this blonde one. But yes I cant say I fell in love with all of them but I can say I fell for my first could have strong for the 2nd and 3rd blondie I could've just because it seems I can only fall in love if they attract me in a way that I act well hella timid. Lol it's wierd I can be all playful and funny creative but if say they walk in the room or I come in contact around them you'll see me put my head down and be extra quiet\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. I cat controll why I react like that. But the heart does what it wants and I guess bright eyes get me crazy. And them 3 got em. Honey brown, Green, Blue. Everytime I can honestly say if I had a choice I can honestly say I don't why it's only if I am triggered to react like a nervous highschool kid it seems only through that action out of me can bring out that omg I think I'm catching feelings emotion out of me.. I havent been in plenty of relationships but but I've been with 1 for 18years .(she passed away April 2020) 2nd got engaged the day before I asked and then rejected me the told me she didn't know I was Interested . 3rd moved out of country. Overall Im not tripping there's a lot of people for me to meet. And yes falling in love can't happen unless I'm all highschool crush actions and no I can't control what makes me that way?? Wierd Hope this made sense I tried to explain the best way I can. Goodluck and Godbless \u270c\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Love feels different for everyone, but it tends to display a few common patterns. One could also argue that love has phases to not confuse infatuation with true, genuine care. Nonetheless, I\u2019ve known my partner for five years, and we\u2019ve been intimately, emotionally, and spiritually committed to one another for four years. Phase 1: A chemical reaction Photo by Ryan Graybill on Unsplash  I open the door and a wave of sounds and scents crash into my face. Music is blaring from a stereo system I can\u2019t see yet, and the sweat and yeast invade my olfactory as if it were attempting to take over an enemy\u2019s territory. I step inside and close the door behind me. As I look for a familiar face a woman walks past and smiles at me. A male raises a glass to me from across the room to say hello and welcome\u2013he must be the host of this party? I walk further inside and find a dining room table surrounded by at least fifteen people. A woman at one hand tosses a plastic ping pong ball across the table. Her arms shoot up above her head. She cheers. The crowd erupts in elation. I scan the crowd to try and find my friend who invited me to the part, but he\u2019s nowhere to be found yet. Walking through the main living area and down a hallway, I start poking my head into rooms to see if I can find him. The fourth door had promise. I nudged it open and heard voices. I poked my head inside and made myself known, \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cWhatsup?\u201d I step inside and see my friend, Zack, sitting on a bed. Four other people at around the room, either on the floor or in a chair. And that\u2019s when I saw her. Her hair blonde. Her eyes green. A toned body only a committed athlete would wield. A glass of clear liquid in her hand. Nails short but clean. My palms went a little clammy. My breathing shortened. I felt a rush \u201cChris? You in there, bud?\u201d Zack had been talking to me, but I stopped listening the moment I saw her. As he introduced everyone, Zack pointed at each person. I shook their hands, but I couldn\u2019t stop glancing back over at her. It was nothing profound, but the moment I saw my current partner, I felt a desire, craving, need to get to know her. I saw her appearance, and it attracted me to her. I then heard her voice, and I had to keep her talking. Eventually, we went on a few dates, and I was sold. We had to be together, but not unless she agreed with me. Phase 2: What\u2019s trust got to do with it? Photo by ANDRIK LANGFIELD PETRIDES on Unsplash  \u201cWe agreed to be open.\u201d \u201cI am being open.\u201d \u201cNo you\u2019re not.\u201d \u201cI slept with him. What more do you need to know?\u201d For the first 8 months of our relationship, we agreed to be open. This meant multiple partners, open communication, and the freedom to explore ourselves. It was a fun eight months, but it ended with a heated argument about how much information would be shared and how we began to feel about one another. At the time, I felt crazy. I thought I was the only one growing to love her, but she felt the same way. A funny thing happens when we begin to care for someone. We become vulnerable. We bare our softer selves, the secrets and the insecurities. We begin to trust our life to someone else. Share it with them. Expect them to be there for us. Unfortunately, my partner and I both felt betrayed, and here is why: Our open relationship at a certain point began to betray our core beliefs and values. Sure, we agreed to be open. We both were collegiate athletes holding up 3.8 GPAs or higher respectively (she\u2019s smarter than me). We didn\u2019t think we had time to \u201cworry\u201d about a \u201creal\u201d relationship, so we focused on having fun. The opposite happened. The openness evolved, and it became a friendship. That friendship, through intimacy, understanding, and compassion turned into trust. If her and I were to go to the next level in our relationship, we had to make a commitment to one another, monogamy. This isn\u2019t to say everyone has to be monogamous, but for her and I, it\u2019s a core value and belief. Until we made that shift, we weren\u2019t going to be together. Sadly enough, the decision to be monogamous took 12 months of not talking to one another. We separated. I graduated from college. She had one more year. I got a job, and she studied and played her chosen sport. Phase 3: Commitment, loyalty, and growth Photo by Pablo Heimplatz on Unsplash  I met a few friends at a restaurant downtown on a Friday night. We decided to celebrate a friend\u2019s promotion, another friend\u2019s birthday, and a third friend\u2019s pregnancy all at the same time. We ordered a few drinks. We ate. We had a good time all around. As we left the restaurant, Mike suggested we go give a new bar a try. It was down the street within walking distance. We all agreed, so we went. We got a table, got seated, and then looked around for a waiter/waitress. This bar apparently did have them. We had to order our own drinks at the bar. I volunteered to get the first round. As I walked up to the bar I heard a familiar laugh. Then I heard a familiar voice. I leaned onto the bar top and looked to my left. There she stood with a few friends, enjoying a drink and conversation. I never thought I\u2019d see the woman I started to love ever again. We separated on a pretty clear agreement: No talking. No stalking. No thinking. I\u2019d done my best for the last 12 months, but it was pretty tough. She made me tick. She gave me butterflies. I wanted to be the best for her. I wanted to help her achieve her dreams. The bartender got my order. I waited, trying to ignore her down the bar. Then I felt a tap on the shoulder. As I looked, I smiled. I knew it was her. \u201cChris, what\u2019re you doing here?\u201d I pointed over my shoulder, \u201cHere with a few friends. Celebrating.\u201d She stared into my eyes. I stared back. The bartender set the five drinks on the car top. I could feel the bass of the music in my fingers, and my heart beating out of my chest. The same feeling I had the night I met her overwhelmed me. \u201cThat\u2019ll be\u2013\u201d She kissed me. Whatever the bartender had been saying disappeared into the ether as my lips pressed against hers. She pulled away. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m\u2013I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cI thought we were over?\u201d I asked. She grinned at me. I kissed her back. For the last four years, my partner and I have been living our values and beliefs together. We\u2019re building loyalty, and we support one another no matter the cost. It\u2019s a mutual agreement on what we believe love should be and how it should be lived. We\u2019re building our lives\u2026 together. So how do you know if you\u2019re in love? Do you feel attracted to that person? Do you trust that person? Are you loyal to you and that person\u2019s definition of love? These are simple questions that require time, energy, and honesty with self and someone else (or more people, if you live that way). How you feel, experience, and define love will determine if you are in love or not. It\u2019s simply a matter of listening to yourself, inquiring if the other person feels the same way you do, and living life together. ",

Hopefully your thinking brain sees the danger of the instinct, and purchases safe sex gear/birth control to use. Once this 1\u20132 year long lust state evaporates, you will see if you actually had LOVE. Then you will STILL want to stay with this person because they get you, you get them, and you have alot in common, especially in key points of how to live your lives. It\u2019s useful to get a jump start on that last bit by knowing the person quite well before you ever jump in the sack together. A few months doesn\u2019t really cut it. I\u2019ve never been that patient; I only married my \u2018soulmate\u2019 because I knew her through highschool and we stayed friends through our 20\u2019s\u2019 when I was making mistakes on a bunch of other inappropriate chix. You\u2019ll know they were wrong for you when the relationship breaks up somewhere around 14\u201320 months. It\u2019s an error to stay just by stubbornness. ",

If you feel a spiritual connection with them.You feel you' ve known them before. If when your at work or studying but your mind is always on them. You wander about their well being.When you see them even after only a few hours its like a cool drink in the desert for your soul. If your more concerned for their well being than your own. If you worship their flesh. If they a perfect in your eyes no matter what the world says. If you accept them flaws and gifts included, not wanting to change them. You could live without them definitely but what kind of life would that be. Guys she\u2019s gonna make the best man outta you, your gonna become better for her, because of her. She will humble you by her kindness, you will realize she loves you because you are you, no other reason. She accepts your flaws even when you dont. She is your better angel. She will never misguide you.You will serve her and support her as she will you and cheating or lying will not cross your minds. She will be your best friend closer than blood.You will feel comfortable telling her anything and she you. You will love the sound of her voice, the light in her eyes her ,the thoughts in her head. You will desire to know all of her ,pleasure her and listen to her. You\u2019re dreams will weave together. You will know how to harm her but only to protect her. You may be suprised when she protects you. She will forgive you for any mistakes you make as you will her because being straight with her is like breathing.You' ll make great love and have greater conversations. Your strengths and weeknesses will have a strange way of complimenting each other.She wont need your need your money in fact she wont want it but the fools we are as men we give it as if we are heroes. But what is given is is good for both of you.No longer will you fight this world alone. Fear will leave your life. You will be a pair. The world will have to bow before you two because together your unstoppable. If any of these statement align with your relationship hold on to that person for all your worth. Because love truly is the sweetest wine but true love well thats the stuff of gods. ",

            "answer_text": "Falling in love is one of the most exciting, happy and scariest things that could ever happen to you. It's hard to remember how you lived without that person. Of course, you were alive before you met this person, but you didn't start \u201cliving\u201d until the two of you met. For everyone, love is different. Even the definition of love is extremely personal, but I say for certain that anyone who's felt it agrees it's the best feeling ever. The best part of your day That person is always the highlight of your day. If you love someone, you never get tired of him. No matter how amazing your day is being, your special person will make it better. Your love is always the first person you think about when you wake up and the last person you think about before you go to sleep. It is the first person you want to tell when something good happens. If something bad happens, this is the person you look at for support. Love is selfless. You are the most important person in your world until you met him. When you are in love, his needs become much more important than your own, definitely first! That is just how love is. Your needs always seem trivial in comparison to your significant other's needs. When you're in love with someone, you do whatever you can to make the person happy. True love knows no limits. You are never afraid to express your feelings in public When you're truly in love, you want everyone to know. You are not bashful about your feelings by any means. You love the imperfections Your love is the most beautiful person, and of course, he does have some imperfections. But, to you, they're not imperfections. They're unique qualities and everything you love. Love is the ability to know and accept the other person's faults. It's difficult to imagine a future without that person in it. This is the reason you will plan long-term about everything that matters because all you want is a life with this person. Being in love makes you feel secure, confident and safe. When you are in Love you are not afraid of commitments. You experience a terrible pain if things may end. You definaly know you are in love. \"There are plenty of ways to die, but only love can kill and keep you alive to feel it.\" \u2014 Leo Christopher ",

            "answer_text": "Love can be many things but to me, love is selflessness. This quality is very unique and only the closest people can love us selflessly,for example,our parents. I think you don't need any kind of explanation to justify this. They simply put us fisrt in everything. We are thier first preference. Their love is unconditional and very real. This need not be parents all the time, in some cases even our siblings, friends and relatives (rarely) can love us selflessly. Only when you are in love, you will be able to put their happiness before yours, their success becomes your pride, their problems become yours,their happiness becomes yours, their family becomes yours ,and so on. Selflessness is one of the things that show that your in love with someone so when you realize that you are selfless with someone that is when you are in love! Edit: Let me share a story about a girl. There was an athletic tournament in her school. Everyone was having a good time watching their friends playing, running ,and so on. She was eagerly waiting for the running race that was because her crush is participating in that. Finally,the race has started he was ready at the starting point. When he heard the sound he started running but her eyes were only on him. Everyone started shouting the names of their friends and encouraged them.She could not shout but her heart shouted his name and prayed for him to win.He was running so fast that all others were a few steps behind, on seeing this she stood up in her place and clapped so hard that her hands turned red. When he passed the finishing line her face was overwhelmed with so much of happiness and pride but she could not share this with anyone.He was jumping and hugging his friends and here she stood behind everyone not moving her eyes away from him , smiling like a idiot His victory was her pride,that is how she realized that she was in LOVE!

            "answer_text": "We started out just a school mates. And when my relationship of 3 years ended badly I began on a long path of self destructiveness. Drugs, alcohol, sex, unsafe behaviors to forget the pain I was in. Eventually we crossed paths in the summer and he was looking for something casual. At the time I didn't have the capacity for anything more than casual. So I agreed. No strings attached, just booty calls. So whenever we got the urge he'd come pick me up, often in the early morning hours. 1 am, 2am. We'd do our thing and I'd go directly home. No long stays, no meaningful talks. Just sex. Except there came a time when eventually he stopped taking me home right after. We'd watch a movie together. Or go out somewhere. Even play board games. I'd stay the night in his bed and sometimes he'd even cuddle me. Which in all honesty made me cringe, but he was a nice guy and just because I was incapable of romantic feelings didn't mean I had to be rude to him. It wasn't one big moment that I fell in love with him. It was all the small things he did for me. Introduced me to his family, who welcomed me with open arms.Was there for me, even if I never opened up to him about the shit I went through. Just understood that I was a little fucked up and didn't judge or pressure me.The way he'd sometimes put his hand on my thigh when he drove us places.The way he wasn't afraid to sing horribly in front of me. The smile he'd flash at me whenever he caught me staring at him. Even the way he was confident with his body. The first time he urinated in front of me he just did it. No shyness, no apology, no making me stop what I'm doing. And something about that kind of confidence was attractive. One night I found myself holding his hand and I looked our entwined fingers and I realized that I loved the feel of his calluses on my soft painters hands. I loved the feeling of his rough stubble on my lips. I loved that he made me feel something deep inside of me. A part once so abused I thought it was dead, and somehow he breathed life back into it. That's when realized I had fallen in love. ",

For those of you who don\u2019t know, in Ahmedabad, this festival is celebrated with enthusiasm that literally reaches the sky. After a long day of flying kites and enjoying delicacies, the sun had finally set. I was sitting on the water tank on the roof of my building. Music was playing - the genre and volume was good enough for me to get the \u201cfeels\u201d. Following the pitch darkness that appeared in the sky, sky lanterns started appearing, accompanied by occasional fire works. Within few minutes, the sky was filled with lanterns - everywhere I could see dots of fire in the sky - giving it an ethereal beauty, for it was the first time I had seen the sky itself celebrating a festival. And in the moments that I was still trying to digest the surreal beauty of my surroundings, the thought of her appeared, from no where, in my mind. And the following few minutes I did nothing but mesmerized over how even the mere thought of her could make something that was already ethereal, more beautiful. And in that moment, I guess, I realized I had fallen in love with her. . The whole point of narrating this incident was to highlight how I think you know you love someone - when, at the least expected of times, their thought fills your heart and mind, following which you cannot help thinking anything but them - that\u2019s when you know you are in love.

Days where you laugh, days where you cuddle, days where no one can stop you from being happy with your partner, days where you promise you'll always be with them through the best and through the worst. The test comes when you're there on those painful, troubling, sleepless nights and you know you love them because when everything told you to leave you stayed because for some reason you believe this person is worth growing with through sickness, through health, through the bad days and the good, you have chosen to stay. That is when you truly know you love them with all of your self. ",

This is when you feel that you are in love.When you wake up, the first thought is of her. The first thing you do after waking up is checking your phone for a message or call from her that you missed by any chance. You change yourself so that she may like you and adopt several things she likes even if you have to leave some of your most loved routines. Changing or avoiding your own opinion just to agree to her, so that she may not be upset with you. You'll want to talk to her everytime, every single minute of the day and at the end of the day, you may end up fighting because she doesn't give you enough time. This is when you are in loveLove is, when you wake up daily and think about how you'll spend the whole day to make it better for both of you. Dress the way you want to, not to impress anybody. When you can share your own opinions, and respect her opinions also. You'll do the things you love to do because you know that she'll always support you. You'll be yourself, there will be no fake layer, irrespective of the fact that you are so hard to handle as a person. And at last, even if you don't talk for the whole day, you send a Good Night text to her daily and won't sleep until she replies back. Love is a beautiful feeling. It is not limited to a guy or a girl, a married couple or some high school sweethearts. Love is present everywhere between every two persons who care about each other and accept each other for what they actually are. Thank you for reading. ",

Also if someone could pls shout out the name of this movie that would be greatly appreciated because I\u2019m in need of another rom com as wholesome as the Before trilogy and a little less humiliating than He\u2019s Just Not That into You because I cannot STAND to watch it for the 968th time. I BEG. Clich\u00e9s pending: Most of the time it\u2019s only really in heartbreak that you realise you are/were in love, or at least what you thought was love anyway. It\u2019s the point at which they\u2019re no longer in your life physically but you can still feel their presence. Whether you\u2019re walking down the street, listening to a song, drinking your favourite milkshake, they\u2019re still there. You see it wasn\u2019t just the street, a song, or your milkshake. It was our street, our song and our favourite milkshake. Everything literally becomes tainted by them: movies and songs on into whole spaces, cities and experiences, emotions and it\u2019s like you\u2019re walking over their footprints constantly everywhere you go (both physically and mentally). Whenever you make a judgement about something it\u2019s not really you making that judgment anymore, it\u2019s like they\u2019re whispering in your ear but not saying anything because you already know what they\u2019d say, it would be the exact same thing as you. Their voice is essentially your voice. Being in love is an alignment. It\u2019s like two parallel lines that never touch but instead fill the space between them. They\u2019re running along at the exact same speed but never touch because they simply cannot, and that is the sadness of it all. But who knows, it\u2019s all a mystery. You\u2019re probably in love with someone in a completely different way than they are in love with you. So just don\u2019t push them off into the sea, because I guarantee you they\u2019ll find another fish in the meantime. ",

I promised in my halting, joking, yearning way that I\u2019d come be your family wherever you are. It was all I could give. It was all you would take. A year ago I realized I was homeless. A month ago you realized you\u2019d found yours. It isn\u2019t with me and I should have seen it coming, but \u2014 what do I do now with all this space I\u2019d saved beside me for you?  You were once the hero in all of my daydreams, high on an improbable white horse and my most trusted brother-in-arms. It took all of your cruelty to disabuse me of my silly notions; I still wonder if it ever exhausted you, playing the villain to an unwitting victim. At night I drifted into uneasy sleep only to find you walking into my nightmares and ask me with your empty, haunted eyes if I\u2019d ever been devastated. I woke up to find you\u2019d sent word for help. I went charging into your wreckage and burned with you. I came out with my candy-coating melted off and my soul stirred into perpetual flames. You never came out at all.  I almost regret never deifying you. You\u2019d have made a wonderful god, high up on your golden pedestal, smiling benevolently at your misguided worshipers. You sit beside me instead, and your smiles are conspiratorial, and your pedestal is imaginary at most and gilded at best. I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. I wound your pride every chance I get and you tear down every semblance of patience I\u2019ve ever managed to construct. We fight when everyone\u2019s watching and laugh when we\u2019re alone. We both know this is all we\u2019ll ever have. I wonder if you ever wanted more. I wonder if I ever wanted more.  I don\u2019t know if I fell in love, or just loved as one does. All I know is that there are names etched into my heart, for better or for worse, that\u2019ll forever haunt me. It is what came of it that mattered. It is what I make of it that matters. ",

Youbounce between exhilaration, euphoria,increased energy, sleeplessness, loss ofappetite, trembling, a racing heart andaccelerated breathing, as well as anxiety,panic and feelings of despair when yourrelationship suffers even the smallestsetback. These mood swings parallel thebehavior of drug addicts. And indeed, whenin-love people are shown pictures of theirloved ones, it fires up the same regions of thebrain that activate when a drug addict takesa hit.

Central dopamine may beresponsible for this reaction, too, becauseresearch shows that when a reward isdelayed, dopamine-producing neurons in themid-brain region become more productive.5. \"I'm obsessed with him\"People who are in love report that theyspend, on average, more than 85 percent oftheir waking hours musing over their \"loveobject.\" Intrusive thinking, as this form ofobsessive behavior is called, may result fromdecreased levels of central serotonin in thebrain, a condition that has been associatedwith obsessive behavior previously.(Obsessive-compulsive disorder is treatedwith serotonin-reuptake inhibitors.)6. \"I wish we could be together all the time\"People in love regularly exhibit signs ofemotional dependency on their relationship ,including possessiveness, jealousy, fear ofrejection, and separation anxiety.7. \"I hope we stay together forever\"They also long for emotional union with theirbeloved, seeking out ways to get closer andday-dreaming about their future together.8. \"I'd do anything for her\"People who are in love generally feel apowerful sense of empathy toward theirbeloved, feeling the other person's pain astheir own and being willing to sacri?ceanything for the other person.9. \"Would he like this outfit?\"Falling in love is marked by a tendency toreorder your daily priorities and/or changeyour clothing, mannerisms, habits or valuesin order for them to better align with those ofyour beloved.10. \"Can we be exclusive?\"Those who are deeply in love typicallyexperience sexual desire for their beloved, butthere are strong emotional strings attached:The longing for sex is coupled withpossessiveness, a desire for sexualexclusivity, and extreme jealousy when thepartner is suspected of infidelity. Thispossessiveness is thought to have evolved sothat an in-love person will compel his or herpartner to spurn other suitors, therebyinsuring that the couple's courtship is notinterrupted until conception has occurred. [5Strange Courting Rituals from Around theWorld]11. \"It's not about sex\"While the desire for sexual union is importantto people in love, the craving for emotionalunion takes precedence.  A study found that64 percent of people in love (the samepercentage for both sexes) disagreed with thestatement, \u201cSex is the most important part ofmy relationship with [my partner].\"12. \"I feel out of control\"Fisher and her colleagues found thatindividuals who report being \"in love\"commonly say their passion is involuntaryand uncontrollable.13. \"The spark is gone\"Unfortunately, being in love usually doesn'tlast forever. It's an impermanent state thateither evolves into a long-term, codependentrelationship that psychologists call\"attachment,\" or it dissipates, and therelationship dissolves. If there are physical orsocial barriers inhibiting partners from seeingone another regularly \u2014 for example, if therelationship is long-distance \u2014 then the \"inlove\" phase generally lasts longer than itwould otherwise.
