            "answer_text": "To clarify the question\u2026 When introducing the basics of logic, one ordinarily begins with propositional logic and then proceeds to predicate logic. Alas, the examples of propositions typically either use \"real-world sentences\" (e.g., \"The Great Pyramid is in Egypt\") or, when strictly mathematical, use quantifiers implicitly (e.g., \"10 is an even number\" -- which of course really means \"there exists an integer k for which 10 = 2 k; or \"an integer that is a multiple of 4 is even\" which similarly involves quantifiers implicitly). For a short introduction to logic I'm writing, I need some simple examples of propositions that deal only with mathematical objects, not real-world entities and that do not, even implicitly, involve quantifiers. And I want to use these in order to provide instances of conjunction, disjunction, implication, and equivalence. What are some such examples? I am willing for the examples to use familiar terms such as \"integer\" or \"natural number\" along with equality and inequality. But not expressions such as [math]2 \\in \\mathbb{N}[/math]\" that explicitly involve sets of objects. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s hard to find useful statements in mathematics that don\u2019t involve quantifiers 1. You can show small numbers are prime without explicit resort to quantifiers. Since 2 doesn\u2019t divide 5, and 3 doesn\u2019t divide 5, and 4 doesn\u2019t divide 5, therefore 5 is prime. The only prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of 91 are 2, 3, 5, and 7, so if 2 doesn\u2019t divide 91, and 3 doesn\u2019t divide 91, and 5 doesn\u2019t divide 91, and 7 doesn\u2019t divide 91, then 91 is prime. 2. Here\u2019s an argument I had to give to explain why [math]0/0[/math] does not equal [math]1.[/math] You can find several statements in it that don\u2019t involve quantifiers. Assume that [math]0/0=1.[/math] Then [math]2\\cdot(0/0)=2.[/math] It follows that [math](2\\cdot 0)/0=2,[/math] then [math]0/0=2.[/math] But [math]0/0=1,[/math] so [math]2=1.[/math] Since [math]2\\neq1,[/math] the assumption that [math]0/0=1[/math] is false. Therefore [math]0/0\\neq 1.[/math] ",
