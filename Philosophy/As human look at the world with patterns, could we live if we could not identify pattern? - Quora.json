            "answer_text": "There is always pattern and lots of confusion in everyones personal life that we dont see pattern. Everything is cyclical unless you are positioned twords progression. Even then you are doing similiar tasks which are cyclical but wish to be something new so arise to a challenge thus u spiral upwards as you do this new function cyclicaly till you realise theres more . In fact we are more afraid of seeing pattern then not. We truly want to believe everythings random. When you stay in one spot mentally, physically, emotionally you see the world change around u and yet most people whom see this pattern and sameness also change and become gods in there own universe getting what they want from whom they will. But if u sit in silence u see everythings on repeat for most people\u2026 and they love it. ",
