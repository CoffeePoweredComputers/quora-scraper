            "answer_text": "You are right nothing is perfect and yet everything is perfect. It is the perspective of every being, now from tiger point of view a jungle should be full sheep and for sheep the perfect situation will be when there will be plenty of food and no one to eat them. As you can see the meaning of perfection can change drastically depending upon the what type of being you are and what you want and need. Now for some time we achieve perfection and then suddenly we realise there is more potential. Is there a way to achieve perfection? yes there is, if you look around you, the whole life is trying to achieve a perfect balance with the environment around it. The best spicy which has reached almost perfect balance is plants and trees, they have been here for the longest time and you will see that there is minimum effort they seem to be easily manage life without even moving around the earth. Every being try to achieve maximum while doing least amount of effort, it is also called efficiency. As you can see we all are also working towards achieving maximum efficiency, more efficient appliances, more efficient car, machines, food and what not. So in the broader sense the whole life just wants to BE, and just BE without effort. This is what yogi and Dhyani\u2019s do, this is the whole approach of life to be with least effort. ",

According to me Perfection is nothing but we can say is a skill which everyone has inside him. We all are perfect in our own way, someone is perfect in talking, someone is in flirting, someone is in gambling, someone in studies, etc. Perfection only and only comes by burning, by practicing, by fighting. A quote says Eat it, Drink it, Live with it Until you achieve it! This is called perfection. And the person who had achieved his /her dream is perfect. Thank you! ",
