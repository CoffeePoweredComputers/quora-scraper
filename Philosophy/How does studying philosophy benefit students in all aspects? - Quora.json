            "answer_text": "Q. How does studying Philosophy benefit students in all aspects? (1) Thanks for the A2A. (2) As a student, learning, when decanted to its essence, serves four objectives. Trains you on where and how to source information and knowledge, and after sourcing, how to process the information and knowledge. Teach a man how to fish, and he\u2019ll be fed for life.Trains you to think, looking at, pondering, analyzing things from different perspectives, different framesets, different paradigms, different consciousness.Teaches you subject matter, such as Math calculus, Chemical equations, WW2 history, Shakespeare\u2019s The Taming of the Shrew.Self-discovery. Peel the onion that is you. Scientific talent. Love for the Humanities. You may be a future Nobel laureate. A Yo-Yo Ma.(3) Philosophy feeds into all four of the above. There\u2019re is no absolute right or wrong in philosophy, so it\u2019s a great cognitive ballpark to free-range and hone your thought process.

Philosophy touches all aspects of life: Everyday life, ethics/morals, religion, politics, science, math, art, linguistics, etc. Infinite opportunities to get exposure to human nature, and most of all, your human nature to idealise. An expansive discovery journey that starts and ends with you. Here\u2019re some illustrations. (3a) Are you living your life right?

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s a structure, a kind of cage lowered around truth that if it is practiced extremely well lets it escape between the bars in huge amounts. Practiced badly - then the cage is a cage, confining & concentrated on for its own sake. Philosophy is of the conscious mind & that can get in the way of intuition which is the most direct path to our deepest intelligence, genius creativity, feeling & all most valuable. It needs to be used carefully. Everything is a necessary tension between order & chaos. Philosophy is of the former. ",
