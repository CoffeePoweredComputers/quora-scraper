            "answer_text": "No. Nor are they necessarily synonymous. But the Greek origin of the word, \u201csynonym\u201d, when we analyse it carefully, refers to words which are frequently, \u201ctaken up together\u201d, since they have often had something in common. But we must be selective of the correct word for each occasion inspired by the context of our sense that any words are similar. Some synonyms emerge simply where people or culture have been lazy others perhaps after a word has lain dormant and so uselessly merged it's definition with another. It is necessary to discern synonyms rather than merge them in order to make a good choice. It depends upon the purpose of course, and it is difficult to be sure of whether it is one's incorrect reading of these potential synonyms or a repetitious yet incorrect cultural display of them which has anybody think them equal. Not all on-line dictionaries can be trusted on this and back in the bookstore, where the elders and their oldest ones are best, a fat paper dictionary will be fully up to date but even with archaic roots and some etymology listed. Ultimately, you choose. ",

            "answer_text": "Ethics are a code of conduct while values are the ideals that shape that code. Ergo, one way to make the distinction is that values can inform ethics but ethics can\u2019t inform values\u2014there\u2019s something of a one way ticket. For instance, my value for human life is the reason for my ethical practice not to go out of my way to cause harm to another human being. My not-going out of my way to harm human beings is not the reason for my value for human life. My value for human life is prior to my action and my action represents an interpretation of my value. So I suppose it could be said that ethics are (moral*) values put into action or at least in abstract terms of a criteria for action, even as rudimentary as \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong.\u201d *Of course there are other species of values that prima facie don\u2019t have much to do with ethics\u2014for instance, asthetic values.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "No. They are very closely related, but they are not one and the same. Values are spiritual or material things that sustain or fulfill human life. Spiritual values are love, friendship, aesthetic pleasure, technological ideas and things of that sort. Material values are food, clothing, shelter, means of production and things of that sort. Ethics is the philosophic inquiry that is meant to discover, understand, define and prove the code of values or value system that comes from the requirements of the human nature evaluated according to a standard of value, that is human life, and in relation to a moral purpose, that is human flourishing.

            "answer_text": "Ethics is a subset of values or a part of the values domain. Ethics has value to many and some values are part of ethics. Ethics is basically a personal morality and professional morality which relates to a clientele that is being served. An example of ethics is a secular moral code such as- in nonemergency situations- don\u2019t destroy biodiversity, don\u2019t lie, don\u2019t be inefficient, don\u2019t steal, don\u2019t commit adultery if married, and don\u2019t murder. Value is any idea, concept, ethical principle, human, animal, plant, or material possession which you like a lot and think it has important relevance to your life. Many things in life have a monetary value. Then there is character, integrity, wisdom, children, friendship, empathy, ambitiousness, etc. which are valued but usually don\u2019t have a price tag next to them. ",
