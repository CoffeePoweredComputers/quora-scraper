            "answer_text": "Science = Art. They are the same thing.  Both science and art are human attempts to understand and describe the world around us. The subjects and methods have different traditions, and the intended audiences are different, but I think the motivations and goals are fundamentally the same.  I think one of the most primitive innate 'needs' of humans is to understand the world around us, and then share that understanding. We need to understand because we are terrified by things that are unpredictable, that don't make sense. I don't care how crazy you say you are, how much you think you like adventure. Unpredictability and senselessness are stressful. They drive people to suicide. It happens in war. It happens as a result of neurological diseases like schizophrenia. Scary movies are all about unpredictability and things that just cannot be real. We crave order. We crave predictability. We share because we are social creatures. The success and failure of others is meaningful. We are bound up in this world together. All in the same boat, so to speak. Thus, when we have information, we like to share it. Even if it's trivial. Who doesn't gossip? Who doesn't like to be the bearer of news? Who doesn't like to show off some new insight? Everyone loves to talk about themselves, share their viewpoint, make their opinion heard. Quora and Facebook and telephones and books and movies are all about sharing our points of view and seeing the world through another's eyes and experiences. At this point, I could make up some evolutionary 'just so story' about how sharing our perceptions with others made us successful as a species. And you would like it, because it would make sense. And you would like it because I shared it. And we would all feel good about it, even though it's complete nonsense that I just pulled out of my ass. So... does that make it science or art? It doesn't matter. Both artists and scientists strive to 'see' the world in new ways, and communicate that vision. **  When they are successful, the rest of us suddenly 'see' the world differently. Our 'truth' is fundamentally changed. Both scientists and artists with nothing new to reveal are failures. Scientists and artists who cannot communicate their insights are failures. It takes both skills to make a successful scientist or artist. Scientists who can communicate but have nothing new to say are frauds and hypsters. Artists with new views of the world but who cannot communicate them effectively are crackpot fringies. Scientists tend to struggle more gaining the new insights. Artists tend to struggle more with the communication. Both often work hard to gain the background and skills that will help them be successful. That's why there are prestigious schools of science and art. Scientists do experiments over and over and over, trying to pin down some new aspect of reality. Once they have their new understanding, there are pre-arranged traditional modes of communication that make that part easier.   Artists often start with the new vision, then work through 'periods', in which they explore how best to get the message across. They have shows. They seek feedback to help them understand what 'works'.  Artists and scientists often need to invent new concepts and technologies to accomplish their goals. Both science and art have useful 'spin offs.' Applied science is technology. Applied art is decoration. Technology and decoration are applications of science/art for practical purposes. Technology and decoration make life easier. But they don't change how we fundamentally perceive what is around us. Science and art do. Art = Science.  ** I used visual art analogies, but I think this is true for any art medium, including music, written word, spoke word, dance, mathematics, and cooking. ",

            "answer_text": "The processes of art-making have contributed substantially to the development of science. The Greek word Techn\u00ea ( \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 ) is relevant here - it's usually translated as craft or art, but also the root for \"technique\" and  \"technology\". Artists developed concrete skills of combining minerals to produce pigments, firing ceramics in kilns, casting metals. Artists also discovered the techniques of linear perspective, which is in essence applied geometry. Art has also played an important role in illustrating and making clear scientific breakthroughs, especially since the 18th century. Take photography as an example - it was discovered using the applied understanding of optics and chemistry, then developed as an art form through other technical developments. Throughout its history, it has been used for scientific observations as well as an art. By the 1840s, photography was used for botany (Anna Atkins) and astronomy (John Draper August Busch, J.A. Whipple). ",

            "answer_text": "yes, frequently.  That was a subpremise of the book \"Godel, Escher, Bach\" (though I personally found it nearly unreadable).   Almost everything in music has a science behind it whether it is music theory or instrument construction or auditorium construction. In the visual arts you have photography (both still and movies) which involves the science of optics.  A lot of painting involves geometry.  The theory of color is a science.  There is a lot of psychology behind how perception works and how this influences our notions of beauty and optical illusions and the translation between 2D vision and a 3D representation of the world. As was mentioned below food and cooking has a lot of chemistry behind it.  If you're looking for new things, I think the perception of smell is not amazingly well understood (in comparison to optical or audio sciences). I'd be hard pressed to come up with a fine art that hasn't been scientifically decomposed and in many cases has lead to new scientific insights into a field. ",

Back in Paracelsus's day in 15th-century Europe, healing others was considered an art. A lot of intuition and folklore went into discovering and developing the medicinal uses of plants. For example, he and others of his time believed you could observe a plant's affinity for a human organ or system by the way the plant was constructed. ",

The design of what is called the \"base\" of an origami model used to be done by trial-and-error plus the intuition, skill, and idiosyncratic methods of an origami artist. Over the course of his career the American artist Robert J. Lang formalized the problem of base design and solved it by implementing a piece of software. See his book Origami Design Secrets:   ",

I see a lot of truly magnificent art in representations of natural objects as well as for explanation of observations, processes and hypothesis.Even the earliest discovered forms of art would not have been possible without an understanding of natural processes, and that is science.Need I talk about the Science of Music?True there are people one could definitely define as \"Scientist, and others can definitely  be called \"Artist.\"And there have been many in our history that could accurately be called \"both.\" ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, basic laws of origami(the art of paper folding) can be explained through some mathematical concepts. Origami has many real life applications, for example the deployment of air bags in vehicles was developed by studying the concepts of origami. And the concept of rigid origami(replacing paper with some card boards etc) has been used for the deployment of solar panels in satellites. On top of that it is a very handy tool which can be used to explain tough 3D geometrical concepts which are impossible with just pen and instruments. And this is just barely the surface, if we scratch more then we can find many mathematical problems in this art of paper folding. ",
