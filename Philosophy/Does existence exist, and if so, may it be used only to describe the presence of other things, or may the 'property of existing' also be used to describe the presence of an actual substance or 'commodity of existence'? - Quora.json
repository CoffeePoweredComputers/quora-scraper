            "answer_text": "Of course existence, exists!  You have written this question, and I am responding to you. Now, whether we exist as separate discrete objects or commodities, or only as different aspects of the same whole.(Are you talking to me, or to another part of yourself?)Is another question, altogether. That is a classic philosophical reflection, which cannot be proven either way or the other. On the same line of thought, whether things exist in a 'real time and space' or within a form of cosmic imagination, is also impossible to prove. However, one might argue, that even if everything 'only' existed as thoughts of a cosmic mind, within that mind's structure, it has created individual, discrete, units, which then can interact. If one would then choose to accept this conception of things, then not only do 'we' exist, but 'we' are also 'commodities of existence'. LOL, (whatever that means, on any plane of reality). Gary ",
