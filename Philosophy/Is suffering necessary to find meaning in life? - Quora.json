            "answer_text": "Before analzing the question I am going to give a preemptive answer in the negative (in order words no).Before it can be determined whether suffering is a prerequisite for discovering meaning in life the main terms in question must be delineated. First suffering. It is difficult to objectively define suffering due to the fact the it is intrinsically subjective- because it is an internal state athough it can have external effects for example in the case penury or poverty- and different people will differ in what they regard as suffering (think first world problems :)). However for our purposes suffering can be defined as a period in a person,s life which they consider extremely undesirable. Now let's look at what the meaning of a person life is ? It is tempting to just point out(unhelpfully) that life as no known objective meaning so no maxims such as perquisites can be established. However I am not so lazy.  The meaning of a person life is obviously subjective by definition so I can't define it  objectively. Also if you have read any or my previous answers you would know I don't believe in a divine purpose for life. Nevertheless I do believe that an individual can find their own purpose -something that defines them and definitely do not believe that  suffering is a key factor in finding this purpose. Given, occasionally people do find their purpose after periods hardship (this are the stories the media enjoys portraying which is why it is assumed that this is always the case) however more often people find their purpose through less arduous means like reflection. I for instance feel the purpose of my life is to try and an understand as much about the world as I can; and I didn't have to lose a leg or my family to find that out ;). So to reiterate my initial stance I still answer in the negative. ",

            "answer_text": "Suffering is necessary unless you are unable to find meaning in life otherwise. According to psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, a holocaust survivor,  We can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering Suffering is meaningful only when the other possibilities are not available.Frankl gives the following example for the meaning of suffering:  Once, an elderly general practitioner consulted me because of his severe depression. He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two years before and whom he had loved above all else. Now how could I help him? What should I tell him? I refrained from telling him anything, but instead confronted him with a question, \"What would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive without you?:\" \"Oh,\" he said, \"for her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!\" Whereupon I replied, \"You see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it is you who have spared her this suffering; but now, you have to pay for it by surviving and mourning her.\" He said no word but shook my hand and calmly left the office.
