            "answer_text": "In my understanding time is a delusion. How we measure time? We compare a periodic motion (the motion of the Earth around its axis, providing day and night, around Sun, providing the 4 seasons, periodic motions in the clocks and watches etc. ) with the motions and the processes around us, and within us (e.g., the heart beating, etc.). At each such small part of the periodic motions some processes have been carried out and we and the environment around us are changed. These processes ar practically motion at different stages. We \u0448\u0430\u043a\u0435 \u0443\u043f at the morning, we have some feelings, then comes lunch, then evening, the seasons changed, we become older, everything is changed. All these processes are related to the increase of the entropy which is one directional, i.e., to its increase. Hence, by mentally relating te periodic motions to the processes which are occurring within us and around us we obtain the illusion of time. Because the entropy is always increasing the time has on direction from the past to the future. Thus, time is a comparing of motions only, it is not a substance having both physical or chemical properties. ",
