Wait\u2026that\u2019s right, they can\u2019t. Because they are simulated too. And if you are a simulated character in a simulated world, you can\u2019t \u2018do\u2019 anything that you are not programmed to do by the parameters of the simulation. For some reason people find it hard to grasp the fact that being in a simulated world means being a simulated person. And as such, everything you do or say or think is determined by the simulation itself. But fortunately there\u2019s no reason at all to think that is the case. Why it doesn\u2019t matter whether we\u2019re \u2018living in a simulation\u2019 ",

Comes down to you can't.. either you already decided how your life will be, so any attempts you feel you are manipulating it.. are a mere manifestation of your own creation. Or something else dictates your experience.. either way.. you can't alter it. I mean by all means try.. and if good comes your way, you will attribute that to \u201cyou altering destiny\u201d But you can't if that was/is a thing.. Very peridoxical\u2026 ",

Also is believing its a simulation much different than believing in fate or intelligent design? In a lot of ways a simulation is better than Atheism (me). In Atheism there are no save games or redundant backups. :) just the 80\u2032s 8 bit \"GAME OVER\" ",
