            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll begin by going back to Socrates. He thought that artists, creators, and poets were inspired to make art. What poets cannot do, unfortunately, is have philosophical wisdom about their art. Creative types may be great at making something beautiful, but they may be unable to provide a logical analysis of their own work. More recently, Suzanne Langer has written that artists create meaning through specific forms of expression that are different from meaning created by logical argumentation and analysis of concepts. Philosophers analyze arguments and ideas. Artists create a different kind of meaning. Carnap claimed metaphysics (theology & existentialism) and art are similar insofar as they were meaningless in a technical sense. Many 20th century thinkers will say that meaning is a matter of logical and accurate use of empirical concepts and claims. Carnap also singles out Nietzsche as a figure who straddles the world of both art and philosophy. The (grand?)father of existentialism avoided mixing up the two by keeping his metaphysics in the form of poetry or fiction whereas his proper philosophy was based on empirical meanings. ",

            "answer_text": "Socrates said in the Apology that the poets are among the worst interpreters of their own works: they create without understanding, on the wings of their inspiration; but when they discuss their works they rely on their uninspired reason and falter. But Homer\u2019s epics as well as Aeschylus\u2019 and Sophocles\u2019 are clearly not the work of pedants whose geniuses have quit them. They are in themselves a work of art and mark the supreme high points ever of artistic Greek tragedy. In Nietzsche\u2019s first book, The Birth of Tragedy, which it is far from being his best book, but the \u201cAttempt at a Self-Criticism\u201d that Nietzsche placed at the beginning of the \u201cnew edition\u201d of 1886 is in the words of Walter Kaufmann, \u201camong the finest things he ever wrote.\u201d Perhaps no other great philosopher has written a comparable preface to one of his works. Certainly this self-criticism which Nietzsche applied is far superior to most of the criticism which other critics have directed against The Birth of Tragedy. At the time, though the book opinions still differed, as they do about all of Nietzsche\u2019s works, F. M. Cornford, one of the leading British classicists of the first half of the 20th century, known to generations of students for his translations of many Platonic dialogues and his remarkable commentaries, said in From Religion to Philosophy (1912) that The Birth of Tragedy was \u201ca work of profound imaginative insight, which left the scholarship of a generation toiling in the rear.\u201d First of all, The Birth of Tragedy is, for all its flaws, one of the most original, suggestive, and influential studies of Greek tragic art ever written. Perhaps only Aristotle\u2019s Poetics excels it. It is one of Nietzsche\u2019s central points of the book that one cannot be fair to the achievement of the Greeks and the triumph of those powers of restraint that Nietzsche called Apollonian unless one first behold the unharnessed Dionysian artistic energies that the Greeks harnessed. Socrates is introduced in The Birth with a reverence befitting a god. Of course, Nietzsche\u2019s critical powers do not spare even gods, and he finds Socrates deeply problematic. Indeed, the two chapters (14 and 15) in which the discussion of tragic art and its death at the hands of Socrates reaches its climax, but the second high point of the book suggests that but for Socrates Greek culture might have perished altogether; also that \u201cthe influence of Socrates necessitates ever again the regeneration of art\u201d; and finally even that we need an \u201cartistic Socrates\u201d thus making philosophy and art relevant. Apollo and Dionysus reach a synthesis in tragic art; this synthesis was negated by Socrates; and now another synthesis is needed, an artistic Socrates. Could Plato be meant? On the contrary. Those who feel that Nietzsche is unfair to Socrates and that Socratism is not opposed to tragic art should reconsider Plato\u2019s resolve, in the Republic, to tolerate no tragic poets in his ideal city, as well as the older Plato\u2019s remarks on tragic art in The Laws. The \u201cartistic Socrates\u201d is Nietzsche himself. He looks forward to a philosophy that admits the tragic artistic aspect of life, as the Greek artistic poets did, but does not sacrifice the critical intellect; a philosophy that denies Socrates\u2019 optimistic faith that knowledge and virtue and happiness are, as it were, Siamese triplets; a philosophy as sharply critical as Socrates\u2019 but able and willing to avail itself of the visions and resources of art.
