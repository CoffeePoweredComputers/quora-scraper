Consider: All ravens are black.All not black things are not ravens.These two statements are logically equivalent. So I pull out a white handkerchief and say \u201cThis is not a raven.\u201d I have proved that all ravens are black. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Contradictions are always false (so inconsistent, both internally and with anything else). Tautologies, on the other hand, are always true (so consistent with anything, whether equivalent or not). Contingents (sometimes T sometimes F) must be internally consistent to be possibly T, and so any equivalent must be consistent also. ",
