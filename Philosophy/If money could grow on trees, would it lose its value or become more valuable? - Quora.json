            "answer_text": "The Aztecs used to use cacao beans as money, and cacao beans grow on trees. The Aztec emperor used to drink 50 cups of cacao every day just to show how rich he was. So this isn\u2019t as implausible as it might first seem. We can imagine that instead of printing presses, the treasury department has farms with genetically modified trees with $100 bills for leaves. But it would probably be more expensive to tend groves of trees and harvest the leaves than to just print paper coupons in a controlled environment. In any case, the cost of producing paper money is pretty small in relation to the value of paper money. Supposedly a bill costs about $0.06 to print. But most money isn\u2019t created as paper bills, but rather as electronic money. Paper bills only represent a small fraction of our money supply, so whether those bills are printed or grown wouldn\u2019t make much difference. ",

I have no idea what that would be like ",
