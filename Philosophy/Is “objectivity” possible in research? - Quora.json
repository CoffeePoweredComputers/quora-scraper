            "answer_text": "Subjectivity is the view of an individual. As larger numbers of people and larger communities participate, objectivity grows. Eg. Peer review provides higher levels of objectivity, in theory. However, as the community grows in strength and cohesiveness, it becomes more of an individual, and become more subjective, it becomes more bureaucratic, making decisions based on established rules, ensuring that research conforms to or is \u201csubject to\u201d established rules. Peer review can be strongly influenced by community, can drift to be more subjective to community beliefs. For a research paper to be published, it must be subjectived to peer review, a bureaucratic, subjective process. Absolute objectivity is only possible when everyone holds the same beliefs. But when everyone holds the same beliefs, they become subjective. Objectivity is not necessarily better, not necessarily right. It is possible, for example, if everyone understands that the earth is flat that their research takes that understanding into account. It's harder to recognize that when everyone understands that the earth is round, their research is subject to that belief. It is not possible to be totally objective in research, because total objectivity becomes subjective. Sometimes large communities polarize in various ways and then research becomes subject to that community. This is currently the case with medical research. Conventional medicine is currently polarized away from objectivity in many ways: The commercial community drives and controls recognized medicine research. The FDA only approves products. Non-product treatments receive little attention. Almost all medical research is subjectively oriented to profit. If someone is cured using an unprofitable technique, it remains subjective - no communities are interested in validating it. If someone finds a beneficial technique the next big problem is how to convert it to a product and get approval. This process takes years and many important ideas and techniques are simply abandoned. Conventional medical research is polarized towards statistical data and away from anecdotal data. In theory, every individual piece of data in a statistic is anecdotal, but this reality is ignored. Anecdotes tend to be more subjective until they are included in statistical studies and gain statistical levels and become more objective. Many specific cases must be excluded from any statistical analysis. That's how statistics work. Conventional medicine is polarized towards treatments for diseases and away from cures. Cured is simply not defined medically and no medical research into non-infectious diseases defines cured patients. If researchers dared to define cured clearly, independent of treatment, they would need to acknowledge cures that occur on the non-tratment arm of a study and to study those objectively. Every cured patient is a specific case, an anecdote. Every cured patient has an individual cause of the cure. Cures are subjective, by definition. Treatment benefits can be defined and measured \u201cobjectively\u201d within the study community. However, without a definition and understanding of cured, there is no ability to know if a \u201cbeneficial\u201d treatment is moving patients towards or away from cures. Statistical data is often simply wrong and often necessarily ignores many important facts to provide statistical validity. In clinical studies, for example, all improvements on the placebo arm are lumped into placebo effects - and the details are ignored. There is no attempt to learn from non-treatment improvements - those are not on the profit path. The conventional medical research community is polarized and over time becoming more polarized against alternative medicine. This leads to obvious subjectivity when we notice, for example, that almost every major sports team has a chiropractor on staff, because they understand the benefit, but there is little medical research showing the benefits of chiropractic treatments and lots dismissing it. Research into vaccines is perhaps the farthest from objectivity of any research. Pro-vaccine forces work tirelessly to ensure that no anti-vaccine research takes place, and if it occurs, to ensure it is not published - often for reasons far from to research objectives. Wakefield's paper, for example, was retracted for bureaucratic reasons which did not in any way challenge his data or conclusions. To your health, Tracy Author: The Elements of Cure ",

            "answer_text": "no. Objectivity is out of our reach. Most of people tend to give answers derived from common understanding of general relativity by mixing example of Galileo calculation of speed from special relativity. But what they mean is relativism. So we live in kind of strange mixture of definitions of deterministic world and relativism which frankly has nothing to do with relativity. It's closer to Nietzsche than Einstein. And we tend to stop by stating that we are biased. But in fact it's even worse \u2026. and\u2026 a lot\u2026. worse than that. Because it's not a relative angle for observation of objective reality. Even subjective reality is mostly false. In phenomenology and quantum mechanics it's impossible to even make any measurement without changing the outcome entirely. So not only the object is obscured but it's not even possible to observe it subjectivelly because it became different entity without any possibility to reverse its state in a deterministic way. So the object cannot be seen and the subject is in fact not an observation but CREATION of reality. That's why in fenomenology You cannot subtract measurement from apparatus. And sure enough it's exactly how human perception works. Approximately 5% of the data coming in are subjective the rest is the system filling in the gaps with produced artificial background. And this is obvious not because our input peripherals are not good enough, which they are, but because we cannot analyze input in real time in high resolution. There is just not enough power and there is no need to. It's more efficient to focus and fill the rest with some probable noise. So to say that we are subjective or biased is to assume input is real and it's coming from outside. But it isn't. That's also why for instance philosophy steering politics is so dangerous\u2026 as in political correctness\u2026 it subtracts itself from apparatus \u2026 our biology living an illusion of human mind being paramount to apparatus. No. Apparatus is 95% and it's more real to us than anything coming from outside. We live in artificial world where even this 5% is constantly altered to fit 95% of imaginary creations. That's why mathematics is so important but physics gives it a flesh of apparatus. If some unexpected result is found first You question the apparatus. And this is also why we chronically cannot understand each other\u2026. 95% is artificial and our own. So.. You have to be extremely critical not only to Yourself but to the community as well. I mean remember Thomas Khun and his \u201cStructure of scientific revolutions\u201d. ",
