            "answer_text": "Some of the major refutations are based on solid foundations and are the reasons Simulation Theory is still a theory and not a fact. These are; We have a pretty good understanding of our universe at an atomic scale and so far there is no evidence to suggest that the matter we observe is in fact not real/simulated. This is a tricky one as proponents of ST can't back that statement up with facts, but it is a crucial assumption that underpins everything that the theory is based on.Also, there is no evidence to suggest that such a simulation could be physically built. Although, one or more levels of simulation within simulations would be feasible given only a modest expenditure of computational resources in the real world. I think Elon Musk said it's likely that once 1 simulation has been created then there could be infinitely more created from within those simulations at no cost of real resources in base reality. It kind of goes hand in hand with the Big Bang and Multiverse theory if you ask me, as once a simulation has been created it would appear instantaneously and there would be infinately many of them.My favorite is the fact that the universe is under no obligation to make sense to us. We understand computers and if the universe is essentially a computer then by definition, we can understand the universe. If we start using the tools of computer science in conjunction with the hard sciences and get real results that tell us more about the nature of reality, then we are likely heading in the right direction with ST.We could always just keep changing the facts until the theory fits. Much like how the theory of gravity had to be tested and better understood before it became a fact. Simulation theory needs to go through the same process. So asking and answering the right questions to categorically denie the theory is the only way this idea will sink or swim. It took a crazy smart 20 something super genius to articulate the theory of gravity in a way that could be truly understood. He used the language of mathematics to express this and his equations correctly explain how apples fall from trees. The theory became a fact. Like any developmental process it needs to be approached from both sides. That's is to say we should be looking at ways to shoot down the theory with the same luster we have for the acceptance of the theory. Going back to your statement about you being the only sentient being and everyone else being an AI. This is an age old philosophical debate stemming from the fact that an observer (you) can only observe things from your perspective and not from another observer (me). This can be refuted by me inverting the question. If I know I\u2019m real, then you could either be real or an AI or we could both be an AI. However, if you know you are also real then we are both real. The truth is, I can't know for a fact that I\u2019m real and neither can you. Leaving us with the only alternative - we are both an AI.

            "answer_text": "The problem of simulation deals with the age old problem of other minds. It lies in the philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, and perhaps the philosophy of social sciences. It requires a concept of mind, a medium of communication or language, and the ability to deal with other people. These people presumably have born with a mind, created their own mind, or learned their mind to present. If one can overcome the hurdle of fixing one\u2019s mind, or at least possess a stable concept of mind, then one can learn the necessary language and social science to deal with other people. It remains hard to fix someone else\u2019s mind, as far as one can observe activities, behaviors, actions, or just movement. Take note that we assume a few more concepts to even observe people, such as space and time. But aside from that point, we need an educational, or agreeable language to understand or interpret the sounds, marks, movements, or otherwise physical gestures as a crude term. If one can make contact with other people with an agreeable language and social science, they can develop this further to learn more about the other people, and their presumed minds. They can also deal with shared minds, that others refer to as collective minds, collective intelligence, collective unconscious, or sense of shared experience. Take note that one assumes a self during this encounter, or at least the concept of mind, language, and social science translates to the concept of self. If one can successfully deal with one\u2019s own mind, one\u2019s language, one\u2019s social science, and their analogs with other people, other people\u2019s minds, other people\u2019s language, and other people\u2019s social science, then one and the others can together deal with collective versions of the same concepts. This immediately suggests a related but different concept in the space and time, or physical container for these one person and shared people experiences. People have suggested that the experience within physical terms resembles a computer, or computer program. It suggests that the physical container, also called reality, universe, or world possesses the space and time of a computer that houses memory and processing. This analogy does not come far off current advancements in computer technology, and the ability to cover the sensory systems, organs, and sparse way people can contact their environment. This same requirement of organism allows one and others to understand themselves, inner experience, or own minds. The successful debate and livable condition with a computer program declared to govern the reality, universe, or world should cast to the domain experts of the discipline. The people who study physics, among other people who study different subjects, have gotten the grant to study its nature. They can talk among themselves, with their learned and grown minds, learned and grown language, and learned and grown social science, special to physics and the study of the nature of reality. And they can tell us the thing we deal with, when we point out into the assumed space and time. ",

            "answer_text": "I will refute simulation theory, which is a theory I have espoused, without understanding what I really mean. Swedish philosopher Nick Bostrom, a hero of mine, postulated that it is likely we are living in a simulation, created by advanced human players who assuming a role similar to how computer games are played today. I now understand that we are not playing in a simulation per se, but rather we are having a dream in our eternal brains that seems as real as any simulated experience might be. In other words, we choose, as advanced human beings, to experience what it would be like to be mortal, in a dream state (i.e., we are now dreaming that we have having this mortal experience), even though we are perfect and have always existed as perfect advanced human beings. This may seem like a distinction without a different, and perhaps it is; if so, I have not refuted the simulation theory, but rather I have proposed this is a dream, rather than a simulation. ",

I have given an example that reality is much more plausible in our day to day life. If it was simulation, freewill would have been badly mauled. That is not the case. Kindly read my answer as: Sohail Ahmed's answer to Is there any conceivable way to test whether or not we are in a computer simulation? The religious aspect includes a partial freewill given to us all. Simulation theory does not take that into account. That is how I would treat the refutation logical. ",
