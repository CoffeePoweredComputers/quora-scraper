            "answer_text": "Not minding what happens. I can\u2019t speak for all Taoist, but for me, this is the fundamental trait; acceptance of the world as it is, as it is happening. That\u2019s not to say you have to like what is happening, just to not resist it. Acceptance of what is anchors you in the present moment and allows you to experience more fully what is happening there and then. If you resist what is happening, you are avoiding that engagement, and so missing out on the fullness of the experience. There\u2019s an old saying that Life always serves up the experiences you need for your growth as a person. Not necessarily what you want, but always what you need. So embrace it, don\u2019t resist it. It\u2019ll just keep happening until you learn the lesson from it. This trait has been described as going with the flow. ",

            "answer_text": "Daoists tend to be humble and have a healthy appreciation of nature. They like to practice Qi building exercises like Qi Gong, Ba Gua and Tai Chi. They also like Meditation. Daoists take great pleasure in things many people take for granted, like a waterfall, clear blue sky, starlit and moonlit night, birds flying by etc. They aren\u2019t bothered about material gain, being given praise or getting involved in gossip. They are generally calm and modest people and \u2026above all;content!!! She could have some flaws, like not being able to moderate drinking rice wine or something!!! ",
