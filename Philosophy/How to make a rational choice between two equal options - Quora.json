            "answer_text": "If the two choices have equal outcome, then you should be indifferent as to the actual choice. Whatever the outcome, and assuming that we designate the first choice as A and the second as B, getting the same outcome has equal probability, whether you choose A or B. If you can find another reason to prefer one over the other, this reason will not have anything to do with probabilities. In his introductory book on probability theory and inductive logic, Ian Hacking mentions a similiar situation, but with a lottery, and in his example, A is one winning sequence, and B is another winning sequence. So, which one should you pick? Well, A (\u201c1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\u201d) is as probable as B (\u201c39, 36, 32, 21, 14, 3\u201d). But, suppose that other consideration come into play, as Hacking explains: \u201cThe very large prizes are split between all the people who choose the lucky numbers that win. It may be that most people like irregular-looking outcomes like B. They cannot believe that a regular sequence like A would occur. So fewer people choose sequence A than choose sequence B. Hence, if sequence A is drawn, the prize may be bigger, for each winner, than if sequence B is drawn.\u201d Source: I. Hacking, An Introduction to Probability and Inductive Logic (2001) ",

            "answer_text": "The rational choice is one that maximizes your expected welfare (and that of other stakeholders). If the two options are truly equal, then there is no benefit to any deliberation or analysis. Indeed, there is only the opportunity cost of better things you could do with your time than deciding. Therefore, it is best to use a short-cut (heuristic), in fact any short cut. Pick the one that feels best or just flip a coin. Then get on with your life. I hope that helps, Brett Decision Fish: Decide For Yourself ",
