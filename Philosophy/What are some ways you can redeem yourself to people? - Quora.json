            "answer_text": "are some ways \u201cI\u201d can redeem myself?! I am sorry to have to say this but, the only person I have to do that with is my grandmother & she has passed a long time ago. Although she was no longer here on this earth, I made her a promise. You see, she always complained about this, that or the other. My older siblings said she did it to get attention. So, in October of 1992, she begged me to come back to live with her. Her complaints were same as before. At this particular time though, I lived too far away, I owned 10 dogs, 1 cat, & 2 rabbits. In March of 1992 I went up to Tennessee for almost a week & while I was gone my landlord had called animal control & they took away all my animals. Upon my return, I was able to recover them except 1 dog came down with a neuromuscular disorder & I had to pay to try & save her. She was my favorite. She lost control of her ability to walk. Each day I bathed & fed her. I tried to make her life as \u201c normal\u201d as possible, considering. The veterinarian said she would never walk again. Within 3 months or so, along with bathing her daily, feedings, medications, massages & prayer, she got the use of her legs back! My step-father promised he would take care of my animals while I was in Tennessee. He lied! I vowed to never leave them again. Now, October 1992, my grandmother, bless her wonderful heart is asking me to abandon the only family I have, besides her of course to come & live with her once again. It hurt me to say no, but considering the traumatic experience I had just gone through; I had to say no. It was not until a week later that I arrived at my mother's house to use the shower & do my laundry as usual. We had just had a major hurricane here & I had no lights, phone, or running water where I lived. Upon my arrival, my mom informs me that my grandmother is in the hospital. She has had several severe heart attacks & the next one the doctor said would be fatal! I jumped in the shower & dressed as fast as I could. I drove a 100 mph to the hospital immediately. I cried, actually sobbing as I drove like a bat out of hell, I do not know how I managed to arrive safely, I could not see the road! As I ran up to the elevator, hopped on to her floor; I arrived just as the doctors called it, DOA 1 minute before. I asked to see her immediately. They walked me in. I ran up & hugged her & asked her why she couldn't have waited an extra minute?! Tears began to fall from her eyes, I knew she could still hear me as I cried & continued to ask her why! I told her I loved her & how sorry I was. I explained to her that had she told me she knew her life as she'd known it was coming to an end, I would have found a way to take care of her when she asked the first time! Ever since I vowed if anyone ever needs me for anything, I'd spend my eternity helping them out. I have done so as I promised, that day on November 1st 1992. ",

            "answer_text": "Every day is a great day when you intend it to be ,Life will be easier if you learn to let go of who you used to be & what could have been,You\u2019re human. It\u2019s okay to make mistakes & learn from them ,It should always be okay to talk about your feelings,Examine your fear . Examine your sadness. Examine them to see if you need to love yourself more,Forgive yourself & anyone who has ever harmed your interest. Peacefully detach from them ,Never regret enforcing your permanent boundaries & losing temporary people,Use what happened to you to heal & help others around you,When you feel drained after you hang out with someone, it\u2019s time to go ,Show kindness & compassion . Life with no passion sucks,Implement measures to stop the same thing happening again,If you wanna redeem yourself don\u2019t take stuff personally . Feel , hug , heal & re-parent your inner wounded child . Be at peace,Your actions are your conscious choice. Your actions create your future. You\u2019re the conscious creator of the reality,Just Chill.!!",
