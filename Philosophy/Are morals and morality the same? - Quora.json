            "answer_text": "Morals are the guiding principles that\u2019s driven by a desire to be a good person. Morality is how we differentiate our actions between good and bad. My morals tell me murder is bad. Morality tells me murder is okay if it is intended to intimidate others to follow my morals. That should be a joke, but unfortunately it isn\u2019t. For too many people it isn\u2019t enough for them to be moral, they must force their morals on others in order to feel fulfilled as a person. This mainly occurs with those who are religious. ",
