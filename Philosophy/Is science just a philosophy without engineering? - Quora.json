            "answer_text": "I would like to think so - after all, I'm an engineer. Unfortunately, I can't quite agree with the premise.  Science is very much philosophy  in that its roots lie in Natural Philosophy however scientific theories require evidence to support their underlying ideas and, in this sense, are distinct from \"mere\" philosophy. Engineers like me aren't trying to discover the laws of nature, we're trying to apply them to make sure our bridges don't fall down and our electronic devices work as designed. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIs science just a philosophy without engineering?\u201d Engineering is technology and technology is not science. Science seeks knowledge, technology applies knowledge to the making of things. However advanced science requires measuring instruments and other tools produced by technology, so science and technology are constantly interactive. Science is a branch of philosophy, formerly known as \u201cnatural philosophy\u201d. The cogitations by scientists such as what may exist in distant galaxies are philosophy, rather than science, because they extrapolate beyond what has been determined by science. ",
