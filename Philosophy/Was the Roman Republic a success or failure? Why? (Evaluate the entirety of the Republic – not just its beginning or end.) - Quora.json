            "answer_text": "The Roman Republic was phenomenally successful for its first 400 years. In 396 B.C. they conquered the neighboring Etruscan city of Veii. They fought three long wars against the Samnites, finally defeating them in 290 B.C. In 387 B.C. Rome was sacked by the Gallic Senones under Brennus, (\u201cvae victis\u201d) but were they were ejected by Marcus Furius Camillus (\u201cNon Auro sed ferro, recuperanda est patria\u201d) Between 280 and 275 B.C. the Romans fought Pyrrhus of Epirus to a stalemate. Although technically victorious, the victories were at such great cost to Pyrrhus that he is quoted as saying \u201cOne more such victory and we\u2019re ruined!\u201d Rome then fought three wars with Carthage, between 264 and 146 B.C. The first two ended in treaties on Roman terms and the third ended in the total destruction of Carthage. Rome certainly did not win all their battles; in fact Hannibal inflicted three major defeats upon them, including the Battle of Cannae where 50,000 Romans and their allies perished, but they fought on to victory. During the second century B.C. Rome turned its attention toward Greece, defeating both the Macedonian kingdom and the Seleucid kingdom. The Greek historian Polybius, ca 200 B.C. to ca 118 B.C. was awed by Rome\u2019s success. In the introduction to his histories he wrote: For who is so worthless or indolent as not to wish to know by what means and under what system of polity the Romans in less than \ufb01fty-three years have succeeded in subjecting nearly the whole inhabited world to their sole government, a thing unique in history? Or who again is there so passionately devoted to other spectacles or studies as to regard anything as of greater moment than the acquisition of this knowledge? What happened in the first century B.C.? The Romans were still very successful militarily. They defeated the Cimbrii, a German tribe who invaded Italy. They fought a war with the Socii, Italian tribes who were angry because they were denied citizenship, and defeated them. They then defeated Mithradates Eupator the Pontic King who had carried out a massacre of Romans and Italians in his kingdom. They defeated Jugurtha, the Numidian King who sought to eject the Romans from his kingdom in Africa. But then the Romans were engaged in a series of civil wars. Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who had defeated the socii , Mithradates and Jugurtha defeated the forces of Gaius Marius, the general who had defeated the Cimbrii. The Marians, under Quintus Sertorius carried on the struggle in Spain but were ultimately defeated by Sulla\u2019s allies Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius and Gnaeus Pompey. In 73 B.C. Rome faced a major slave rebellion led by the gladiator Spartacus. It was eventually put down in 71 B.C. by Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompey. Civil wars continued to plague Rome during that century. The Marian reforms abolished the property requirement for joining the Roman army, but had the effect of giving generals essentially a private army loyal to their commander and not to Rome itself. After Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon many of the Roman aristocrats, including Pompey and Cato the Younger fled to Greece. Caesar defeated Pompey at the battle of Pharsalus, defeated Cato\u2019s forces in Africa and defeated the last Pompeyan resistance under Pompey\u2019s son Gnaeus at the Battle of Munda in 45 B.C. Caesar declared himself dictator for life but was assassinated in 44 B.C. After Caesar\u2019s assassination, there was a long power struggle between Caesar\u2019s heir, Octavius, and his former Master of Horse, Marc Antony. In 31 B.C. Octavius\u2019 general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa defeated Marc Antony and Cleopatra at the battle of Actium. They both subsequently committed suicide. Although maintaining a pretense of keeping some of the forms of the Republic, Octavius essentially established a monarchy and the Roman Republic came to an end. So the Roman Republic was successful for centuries, but faltered in its last decades due to civil strife. ",

            "answer_text": "Republican Rome started as a tiny town that no one outside its own corner of Italy and ever heard of. By the time the Republic gave way to Augustus\u2019 Imperium, Rome had conquered southern Gaul, Spain, northern Africa, Egypt, most of Asia Minor, Greece, and the southern Balkans. On the way they defeated the Carthaginians, Macedonians, Ptolemaic Egypt, and the Seleucids. Rome became the preeminent military, naval, trading, and economic power of the ancient world. The last vestiges of its power would not be erased for 1500 years. The language they spoke would evolved into the tongues spoken by almost half the people on the planet. Their system of concernment heavily influenced the founders of the US. I\u2019d say the Republic did pretty well. ",
