            "answer_text": "Easily. As a geologist, I have spent a lifetime studying the Earth. During the vast majority of Earth\u2019s history, there were no humans. There is no evidence for humans in deposits older than about 3 million years. The Earth is over 4 billion years old, so 3 million is less than 1/10th of a percent of the Earth\u2019s age. Trivial. Negligible. Vanishingly insignificant. For a geologist, imagining a world without humans is pretty much exactly what we do. ",
