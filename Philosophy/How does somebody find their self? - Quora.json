            "answer_text": "I love this Question! How do you find pure metal? You meat it up and pound it, and all the dirt that has clung to it comes off and floats away. When we feel like we are losing our self, really, it is the things that have clung to us, our circumstance and heritage that is burning away. When you feel you have nothing left, what you see is who you are. You are the part that can\u2019t be destroyed. Ideologies and habits can be destroyed, but you can\u2019t. You are inherently an intuitive awareness, an imaginative intellect, and a passionate will-power. All those only get stronger and better when tested. The harder you test an ideology or habit the harder it fails, but the more you test your awareness, your imagination and your will-power, the stronger and better they become. If I could recommend a book, it\u2019d be Conflict and Connection: Anatomy of Mind and Emotion Good luck! And know when it feels like life threw you in the oven, that it\u2019s the only way to ever find out who you are. ",
