            "answer_text": "The word \u2018theory\u2019 itself perhaps has negative connotations - and if your process of learning music theory involves being formally examined on it, then for some people this may potentially take the joy out of their experiences with music theory. Aside from the process of how you go about learning theory, I think it depends upon the choices (both conscious and unconscious) you make in applying the music theory knowledge you\u2019ve acquired in your practices/arrangements/compositions, as well as when you listen to music. I think a relevant factor here is considering the multifaceted ways in which people find joy in music. Some people particularly connect to a song\u2019s lyrics, its harmonies, rhythm etc., or a combination of some/all of the above. For me, perhaps because my musical experiences mainly involved playing musical instruments & orchestras, I\u2019ve become somewhat predisposed to resonating more with the instrumentation of the music I hear and play. Music theory furthered my ability to decipher the instrumentation of a song/piece, and overall deepened my passion and connection with the music I listen to and play. Just as music theory may contribute towards how you enjoy music, it may possibly work the other way in some respect. I\u2019ve heard of some people who are well-versed in music theory, but had the tendency of falling into the trap of being preoccupied with following particular rules & forms of music theory (to the extent that they feel they wish could \u2018shut off their brain\u2019 from being analytical with the music they make/listen to).

            "answer_text": "Nothing can take one\u2019s joy - one has to surrender it. I sometimes wish I had formal training, believing (with the benefit/hindrance of 20/20 hindsight) that I would\u2019ve accepted the discipline and retained my creativity and independence. But then I am told by trained players that they couldn\u2019t dream of doing what I do, and still others who said that if I were \u201cproperly trained, the music would be better served\u201d - agreeing with both statements - and figure that I\u2019m right where I oughta be. Music theory is a way to understand the how and why of music. Not the only way, mind you, but a way. Not unlike Pimsleur and Berlitz and Rosetta Stone - 3 ways to learn an language, but certainly not the only 3, and not nearly as effective, as enriching nor as enjoyable as listening to, speaking with, and learning from native speakers. Some people abhor book learning. Some bristle when being told what to do; others can\u2019t tolerate being corrected. For such people, it might seem that a music theory course is sucking all of the joy out of their relationship with music. But as with any relationship, do not allow anyone to define how or why you feel what you feel about anyone - including music. I will say this, though: music has its own language and glossary, just like ballet, judo, poker, race driving, hiphop and tennis. It can be tough going for someone who doesn\u2019t understand basic vocabulary - verbally and musically. ",

            "answer_text": "That question does not have a straight answer because it depends a lot on the context you\u2019re in. We can\u2019t by any means, conceive an orchestra director, that doesn\u2019t dominates music theory \u201cin his sleep\u201d. On the other hand, if certain music genres are translated into musical notation, we end by finding out that it will carry more text instructions than music notation. When I go to the internet, searching for music sheet to work out one or another solo or piece of traditional music (Irish, for instance), I find lots of ways to write the same piece. Why? Because people is trying to write the expression in music notation and it is usually difficult as it is a type of music that uses a lot of twists and turns for which there are no proper music signs. Sometimes, the very use of the compass bar, should be dismissed because it brings confusion into music that is not compass oriented. So, musical notation has its\u2019 very important place, but sometimes requires so much concentration that is counterproductive. Nevertheless, knowing music theory and dominate it, will help you a LOT. And will bring you much additional joy (even when you chose not to use it). On the other hand, knowing musical theory in the context of composition is absolutely essential and will make of you a much better composer. The knowledge of how scales work and sound, how general aesthetics command the composition process, how you can take advantage of certain technics, and much more, will make a huge difference and will bring you joy and success. I don\u2019t mean you have to use what you learn. I mean you can choose. You will be free to choose the best option instead of being limited by ignorance. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the situation. First of all, nothing good comes with very little effort. Starting to learn some instrument means learning the basics like theory, because those are the skills you will be using subconsciously when you\u2019ll be learning to play something complex. It would be fair to say that I hated my first 2\u20133 years of the musical school exactly because of the boring math-like chord-building crap, but when it came to playing real pieces of music, Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, especially with Bach, came the understanding of the importance of all those scales trainings, fast arpeggios exercises, because Bach is considered to be the inventor of polyphony. If we take the collection of his Inventions, it becomes different, you\u2019ll need your skills applied to the both hands because you\u2019ll be playing two different melodies with each hand. That\u2019s why they made us play scales with both hands. So musical theory is just a tool, another feature that will help you grow as s musician, no matter what instrument you play. I forgot all the theory even before my music academic training was over, because I used my ears instead, that worked great. Until many years later, I took a guitar and learned to play it, there was a moment, whenI realized that I cannot become a better guitarist if I don\u2019t recall all the theory, at some point every musician stumbles across this \u2018problem\u2019, it is like arithmetics or simple divisions and multiplications in math will become more and more complex, but you can always use a calculator, if you figure out how to make a correct input of what you need to count.

            "answer_text": "Why should it? Perhaps if you have a lousy teacher, who squeezes the joy out of music theory, or who places the theory at a higher plane than the music, you could have that effect. But when you learn music, your brain is continually taking in emotional and logical information - and intertwines the emotion and the logic. Human beings are made to wonder why things happen and how they work! When I was a child, I batted on a primarily emotional plane. I swung the bat as hard as I could, and would not let anyone give me advice. I eventually figured out my own theory, and developed a way to swing smoothly and make a lot of \u201csingles.\u201d But not until my last few years, playing softball when I was 60 years old, did I discover the theory of making a powerful follow-through. For the first time in my entire life, I hit a ball over an outfielder\u2019s head and got a triple! Was theory exciting or not? But you ccan flunk theory, and still be a great musician; the theory is in you, but just takes an amorphous existence. ",

            "answer_text": "Hey Michael; I'd say it partly depends on your musical personality; and also on what theory you study, and where you get your theory information from. Some musicians do without theory study, and even having a teacher; but most of the ones I've run into on Quora have said they were very glad when they finally got around to it. The theory that I learned REALLY helped and speeded up my ear training and expanded my improvisation ideas. And this was pretty traditional tonal Harmony I learned. I've learned to stay away from more recent modal and less tonality centered approaches that are intellectually more confusing. Music theory for me, has always added to my joy, and music appreciation.

Here's an analogy that may be helpful: People built homes out of different materials without drawing plans for a long time, they just did it. Then someone figured out how to draw and design before building, and architectural mathematics entered the picture. You don't need a smidgeon of theory to have fun banging on a drum or strumming a guitar, but if you want to compose a symphony, music notation will help you inform the players and share the parts with efficiency. The hardest part is sight-reading two-handed piano music notation. Each hand has its own clef (French for \u2018key\u2019) and they have different rules. My first instrument was voice. Learning to follow a melody was quite easy as there was only one clef to \u2018decode\u2019. The problem came later, as I mentioned, with piano. There are some musos who are theory geeks and have all kinds of fun with it. Others want to play so bad they skip it. Theory is the map, music is the territory. Be aware of that and you will enjoy both without confusion. ",

It\u2019s like how learning to type fast allowed me to get my thoughts rapidly and fluidly onto paper. Music theory allows me to play/write rapidly and accurately, gives me great direction expanding harmonically or in whatever direction. It teaches me what\u2019s standard and what\u2019s not. It\u2019s a tool. I never let it control what I do. Learn the \u201crules,\u201d and break them with a purpose. Or probably more often, follow them in your own unique way. A useful analogy. When I was learning about poetry in English in high school, I got turned off to it and felt creatively stifled because I succumbed to elitist pressure that using normal rhymes or whatever was somehow beneath \u201creal poets.\u201d Don\u2019t let that kind of thinking stop you from creating enjoyable music.

And the most important (and funny) aspect of art is: creation\u2026 By all means, make your own music from the very start. So imagining music is more important than theory. Find out melody notes by trial and error on your instrument of choice. I prefer the classical guitar because I can sing at the same time and it does not cover my voice, but mostly because most of the music I imagine is classical/folk/pop. The only bit of theory I know is how maj/min/7th chords are formed. If you do not know, you may end up using more unstable/dreary chords, which may even be ok for some pieces. But more than theory, a lot of tries and experimentation are needed to make a good arrangement. You\u2019ve got to play and play and play the same songs many times, adding more and more variations. Theory can help to select what sounds best amongst many choices, but the last judges are your ears and your feeling. ",

Yes, absolutely, a focus on music theory for its own sake can certainly strip all the passion, excitement and joy out of music. Music knowledge is just like learning a new language, and the learning is pointless, and the time wasted, if it is not applied. However, if gaining knowledge is achieved through the process of doing, through performing and/or composing with the notion of focusing on what is needed at the time, then you can see the relevance of the knowledge and gain confidence through the application. This is refered to as \u201cjust-in-time\u201d education, rather than \u201cjust-in-case\u201d. If you can see context and relevance as you gain knowledge, then each new piece offers you new options.

Mostly what the accompaniment is doing. Music Theory gives you a leg up on hearing what chords are being used, etc. Also it allows you to actually make an accompaniment. One of my last violin teachers forced me to identify what chords I\u2019d play over my pieces. Then he\u2019d play backup. It\u2019s much more fun to play a boring etude with someone else playing with you. Finally you\u2019re not going to always have a part written out. With jazz and folk music a lot of the time you\u2019re only going to have the chords. As a violinist you\u2019re going to have to know the notes in those chords and figure some accompaniment out. If you have to solo you have to know what scale or scales go with those chords. ",

And the flowers by the side of the road still smell as sweet whether they are \u201cjust pretty flowers\u201d or \u201caugmented sixth chords\u201d. There might be a very short adjustment period where one will be thinking more in theoretical terms, and will feel like their pre-existing natural joy in music has been taken away forever. Don\u2019t worry. That phase doesn\u2019t last, and then you will have a tool that will make your music-making (and listening) stronger and more assured than ever before.

You can appreciate structural beauty in longer forms that would otherwise seem to ramble on. You can listen with a more open mind to music from other cultures\u2014provided that your theory is sufficiently generalized. Learning theory is a way to get closer to the thoughts of those who wrote the music you listen to, which allows you connect with them more intimately. Having knowledge of music theory is a little bit like having a translator: you can access more and more since someone has already written down what something means. ",

Theory is just a collection of ideas that are part of a musician\u2019s possible list of tools, to understand some possibilities of music, the external and internal sides of music. Theory can\u2019t and doesn\u2019t determine the content or form of music, unless you\u2019re trapped in the 17th or 18th century and are creating repetitive and lame dances for the Friday evening livingroom of an aristocrat. Or live in Nashville. I DID personally experience a collision that made me choose between theory and music. After learning Grade 4 piano, I was taken off the \u201cgrade\u201d piano learning system (which uses carefully chosen songs of different styles to advance your understanding and abilities, including of music theory components) and put into the purely theory-based Royal Conservatory of Canada teaching system, which dropped most \u201csongs\u201d in the teaching, and went into learning \u201ccircle of fifths\u201d and theoretical things, but there was no playing of music to be the reward, the outcome of this learning, it was just a constant hike through subject after subject of theory, with NO REGARD whatsoever, on who I was and what I wanted, what music creation or styles of music I could play if I learned this \u201ctheory\u201d. It certainly wasn\u2019t asking me what I wanted to learn or why! So, after about 2 years of this, I just lost all patience and walked out on my teacher one day after DEMANDING to apply this stuff to play music, and it wasn\u2019t going to happen. The teacher got pissed and said he could teach me in two weeks how to play all the rock and roll in the world, but the course was the course and that\u2019s all he had to teach. I wasn\u2019t quitting on him, I was quitting on the inhumanity of this experience, this stupid process, and I walked out. I\u2019ve written a nice lyric about that experience. I continued to be highly interested in music, in advancing in my abilities and understanding. I released a CD of 100% my own music, in 2003, and played all the instruments and recorded the whole thing myself. I have more music being worked on for other music and literature projects.

I was about 12 or 13 when I began to grasp chord theory. I also could figure out the relationship between chords when listening to them (e.g. I- IV). Around that time, instead of simply listening to music my brain would start to analyze it. Since then, that\u2019s the way I listen to music \u2014 well, Western music anyway. It\u2019s a blessing because when a student wants to learn a certain song I don\u2019t know, I have it covered; same with being on a gig.

            "answer_text": "It largely depends on two factors: 1) How it is taught 2) The predisposition of the person concerned. Now I loved music theory! So much so that as a teen I voluntarily studied it to an advanced level and gained diplomas in it. Mind you, I had an inspiring teacher I looked up to. He at the time was the only blind doctor of music in the UK and had gained his doctorate in bygone years when you had to be able to work papers in 8 part harmony and counterpoint, as well as work an exercise in 8 parts for double choir. Although these skills had long vanished, I asked him to train me in them. I enjoyed the challenge! Of course, to get to that level of study you first need to learn the basics. But I had the motivation because I knew where I wanted to go. And motivation is key. Theory may well seem a joyless experience if you can' t see the point of it. However, even at the most basic level it is music literacy and, at least for a classical musician who learns from the printed page, vital. I would draw an analogy with learning a language: Is it sufficient merely to be able to speak it, or do you need to be able to read it and write it as well? Well, just speaking it will certainly help get you by on your holiday, but if you aspired to proficiency, you would need to take things further. And by the way, it is thanks to the invention of staff notation, developed around 1000 years ago, that classical music has attained such a high level of sophistication. Once composers could conceive their ideas on paper, more complex textures involving counterpoint became possble. ",

I could hear music and know (at least on a basic level at first) what was going on, the note and chords involved\u2026 in band class it made sense why the trumpets and the saxophones had different notes\u2026 It answered a lot of questions for me.

            "answer_text": "This is a great question and a tricky one\u2026 A musician should have some insight about music theory because there is much to learn and it can help connect the dots. Take a C Major scale and learn intervals, chord qualities, convert to melodic minor, harmonic minor, etc. After you\u2019ve done that, close the books and play music you enjoy. When I was in college, I spent hours analyzing classical music. It was great for my musical development. However, I went home, looked at my CD collection, and just froze. Which CD am I supposed to listen to? That unforgettable moment made me realize that too much analysis was interfering with my enjoyment of music. I spoke to a friend about it. Peter is an excellent guitarist who graduated from Peabody. He confessed about music theory burnout as well. His advice was to let go of the analysis, play what you can, listen to what you love, and return to music theory when you\u2019ve hit a wall. It\u2019s a delicate balancing act; you need both. However, too much of anything is not going to yield great results. This is a deeper conversation than music\u2026 One final thought is that I have a problem with people who brag about not reading music, but claim they are better musicians because they figured it all out on their own. Really? You mastered music without any help? Books are a bad idea? Pushing your ceiling level is a bad idea? Schooling is a bad idea? Being open minded is a bad idea? In sum, knowledge is still power and being a musician takes one or more lifetimes to truly master. www.evanj31drum.com ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cDoes learning music theory take the joy out of music?\u201d Not at all. It helps you advance and make better music, thus increasing your joy. Theory, at least in a jazz context, helps me understand why certain things sound the way they do, why they sound like other things, why they sound different, and what sounds good when. And it gives me the tools to know how to brnach out and create new things. It also helps me learn tunes much more quickly by using the language of theory to create a common code for patterns. For example, the bridge to I Got Rhythm in B-flat is D7 - G7 - C7 - F7. Theory tells me that in any given key, the bridge is III7 - VI7 - II7 - V7. Knowing the roman numeral system allows me to see and describe musical structure in any key. If you know theory, you can talk about \u201ctwo-five\u201d patterns with another musician, and you\u2019d both be on the same page. As for creativity, I was at a concert recently, when Steve Wallace (bass) started soloing on a chorus by starting with (if I recall) an F#7 chord instead of a C7 chord, which the music called for. Now, such a substitution is called a \u201ctritone substitution.\u201d The pianist, Mark Eisenman, was therefore tasked with coming up with the harmony for this new direction that Steve took, and it was quite exciting. Without a knowledge of the tritone substitution, and the harmony around it, they would not have played the section in this very interesting way. At any rate, speaking for jazz at least, your practice sessions need to include these activities: instrument technique (fingerings, tone production, flexibility, whatever)pattern, exercise practice (to become accustomed to common patterns so you can learn new tunes more quickly)learning theoryimprovisation. This is where you play whatever you want, and apply what you\u2019ve learned so far, listen to yourself, write down spontaneous patterns, and give yourself the permission to screw up.So, no, learning theory does not take the joy out of music as long as you apply the theory and give yourself permission to improvise and create music.

Music theory is really just a bunch of names for tricks, so that we can remember them and use them when writing music, studying other people's music, or trying to figure out songs by ear, etc. In my opinion, it has a lot to do with your teacher, and you; but generally speaking, learning music theory is a really, really good idea!

Because most of the students that I've ever taught have no interest in learning music theory I have had to keep the lessons at a level that the student can enjoy. As the student progresses musically I sneak in little chunks of theory. This without using the \u201dT\" word. Too many people have a negative idea of what music theory really means. Music theory simply is a way of organizing and opening the door to more musical ideas. This in turn allows you to see more possibilities in the chord progressions you choose. It also allows you to view a wider range of possibilities when you improvise. ",

Music is ephemeral sounds in a room. It is NOT inkspots on paper. Music is not even recordings of music, particularly NOT Internet distribution of music in file compressed downloads and streaming music. The only way to learn to receive and create maximum joy from music is in the room with living masters playing. The most extreme case I have seen is music students and professors reading scores at concerts. They are taking the limited exposure to a composition and performer and diluting it with symbolic visual information. Paper pedagogy and YouTube are why too many conservatory graduates today are mere score slaves, imbuing slightly more expression into scores with slightly more \u201cerrors\u201d than MIDI score renderings. An exacerbating factor is the adoption of \u201cpop\u201d recording techniques, with isolation, overdubs, splicing, headphones and artificial reverb in sterile studios instead of playing the entire arc of the composition in a living , breathing room with live audiences. Human is Better Than Perfect. ",

Our textbook was a collection of Bach chorales, and THE CONTRAPUNTAL HARMONIC TECHNIQUE OF THE 18TH CENTURY by Allen Irvine McHose. I also learned (the hard way) that some p;kano or keyboard experience helped a lot. I had my first piano lessons as a college freshman and always regretted that i hadn\u2019t started much younger. Having said that, after i received my degree and got out in the field, I learned more music theory with a baton in my hand in six months than i ever learned in a college classroom.

Practically, understanding theory and musical form makes learning music easier, especially if you are memorizing music. Instead of thinking of a group of notes as a difficult spot, you can see it as part of a scale or chord or sequence, thus making it easier to learn, especially if you have applied your theory to your practicing - in other words you have mastered different scale forms, chords, and chord progressions. Musically, you are better prepared to understand and execute the composers\u2019 intentions. Basic theory should be incorporated into musical training, and much of it is. There is no need to make it dull. Poor teaching of any subject can kill the joy. Higher level theory (college level) is generally taught in classes, but must be applied in music making and listening to be relevant. ",
