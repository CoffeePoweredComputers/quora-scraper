            "answer_text": "Virtue is defined as behavior showing high moral standards. I\u2019m sure most people would say that is very important indeed, even those who do not have such high moral standards. However, some people regard virtue as meaning female virginity. That bears only a historical relationship with the real meaning of the word virtue. (and to avert confusion the word \u2018virginity\u2019 is the better word to use. The older a woman, the more likely (statistically) it is that she will no longer be a virgin. But that does not reduce her status except in prejudiced eyes. And the only other person that may need to know would be her doctor. It is really no business of anyone else, including a potential partner. Unless of course she is the victim of rape, in which case she should receive maximum support and the rapist should be caught and punished. So in the sense of the word that means virginity, it is completely unimportant except in the mind of the person concerned. ",

            "answer_text": "It depends what you mean by virtue. In Aristotlean Virtue Ethics, virtue is defined \u2018excellence\u2019. Virtue could be determined by the mean between two excesses, so bravery is the mean between brashness and cowardice. In this sense, virtue is moderation. Now, I don't know about you, but the idea that one must consistently find the mean between two excesses to respond virtuously to a situation is a bit exhausting, but hey, who said philosophy was simple! In my opinion, virtue is an important thing to strive for, but not the most important thing to attain. We as human beings are far too flawed to truly exist virtuously, but the pursuit of virtue, moderation and measurement is something that we could all benefit from. ",

If you believe, instead, that a life lived in accordance with an intuitive sense sense of right and wrong, justice and injustice, and adherence to the promptings of the heart even in the face of (bloodless) rationalistic thought. than the pursuit of and adherence to \u201cvirtue\u201d is the highest human calling, even if one believes in a transcendental God of religion. (See the Book of Job, who, as God himself declaims. walked upright and eschewed evil.) ",

            "answer_text": "Among things of high inherent value on earth is sentience. Importance is one quality, one dimension of what has value. Within the scope of sentience is cognitively organized consciousness able to create meaning. It is a capacity of persons. And they are the reflection of this organization, possessing, nurturing and expressing it. The reasons for this are found in the connection of value to valuing. Cognitive consciousness is the source and substance of subjective valuing and the necessary appreciator of objective value beyond that. Without it, nothing of value would be valued. Virtue is a range of qualities and abilities that marks excellence at being a person, at possessing and expressing inherent value. It is high value heaped onto high value, high value in action. Generally, the virtues were divided into moral and non-moral\u2014for example, intellectual, artistic, athletic, practical in a more general sense. Those which pertain to excllence at simply being a self are primarily moral. Together they compromise integrity\u2014the integration of highest virtues. ",
