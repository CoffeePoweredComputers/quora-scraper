            "answer_text": "No difference at all. The word \u2018Christ\u2019 is the Greek version of the Hebrew word, \u2018Messiah\u2019, which means \u2018Anointed one\u2019. Properly spoken or written, it is \u2018The Christ\u2019 but English typically drops the definitive (\u2018The/our/your/\u2026\u2019) when speaking of a single directly identifiable entity (Like saying \u2018Jehovah [the/our/your] GOD\u2019) The word \u2018Christ\u2019 is a title and identifier and can be used before or after the pronoun (personal name): like \u2018Sailor Sam\u2019 and \u2018Sam the Sailor\u2019 (remember that properly, it is \u2018Jesus THE Christ\u2019) See also, John THE BAPTIST. His family name was \u2018Baptist\u2019\u2026 it was the title of his vocation (a Baptiser). In an corrective, also, Jesus should never be called \u2018God the Son\u2019 as \u2018God\u2019 was never a \u2018Son\u2019 (Nor indeed was \u2018God\u2019 ever a \u2018Holy Spirit\u2019. There is ONLY ONE GOD and that is \u2018The Father\u2019 (which means: \u2018Creator, he that brings forth, brings into being, the Head\u2019). If \u2018the Father\u2019 brought forth \u2018the Son\u2019, how can \u2018the Son\u2019 be \u2018God\u2019? ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019ll be some difference, forensically analyzed. I think such differences are important to people who differentiate themselves and boost their appearances in little ponds. The communication is equal, usually, for both word-sequences. There\u2019s a truth in those words relative to prophets and reality. I believe in Jesus as a person to be at one with as we all are with each other independent of time. All great leaders are prophets who unify people with each other and all true prophets. Differences of description/name relate to humans trying to hijack local natural spiritual beliefs about the meanings of words like \u201cprophet\u201d and \u201cchrist\u201d and \u201cjesus\u201d and any other sacred names. Conventions, within bovine male-dominant social-political clubs, impose obedience to leaders who elevate themselves into dominance then enforce their views about differences. Canonical-dogmatic words and interpretations can be human frailties and errors such as to render even the words of prophets into misinterpretations. Parasites and predators tend to pose as kind leaders yet they act as if they presume they are more important than those they pretend to care for. Such fake leaders trick other people into being subservient enough to kill other people for the short-term benefit of\u2026 parasites and predators. The most powerful aspect of the trick is to falsely interpret the words of prophets then impose those interpretations as legal and deadly rules for other people. Some may refer to a person who has been \u201cchristed\u201d and others may refer to a person as a superstar \u201cchrist\u201d example of a human being. Others may refer to a person who is real in multi-dimensional space and time and who is one with all prophets and who is liked to all of us. We are all part of the same person. Some say a particular person is the \u201cson of \u2026\u201d as if being loved by and at one with \u2026 is different for a particular prophet. My answer (re the question above) relates to loving unity led by people who\u2019ve got close enough to unity as to be say \u201cChristed\u201d which is is our birthright as exemplified by our prophets. There\u2019s a peculiar aspect of how spirituality is talked abou. The differences between the order of even two words can cause millions of deaths . An invention of an ancient empire tried to unify the empire using religious rules and punishments related to spirituality. The techniques took thousands of years to mature and, now, the habits of thinking about word-differences command wars. Descriptions of spiritual beliefs defy being put into words accurately per se; such communications have to be between people as spiritual beings having a human experience so we use noises to help our perception systems later find appropriate words to mark the occasions of communicating. Slight differences, between various noises and sequences of noises, are exploited by mediocre people who purport to be leaders and, in their own mind are leaders. Such parasites are often predators purporting to have exclusive interpretations of abstract spiritual beliefs which are common to all of life. The difference between the word sequences as in/and \u201cwhat is the difference\u201d (above) is too large for me to get into historical details which other people know about but for which I have no energy nor time to spend on that sort of information. My view of the question is that it refers to the whole deal about people killing each other because of words about spirituality. ",
