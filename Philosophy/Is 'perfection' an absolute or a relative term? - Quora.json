            "answer_text": "\"Perfection\" is a rhetorical trick. A wil-o-wisp that you chase into a swamp of impossible ends. Perfection is an imaginary beast like the unicorn, concocted by Plato, and perpetuated by his bastard children, the modern religions.  Perfection is a tool of self-torture and self-induced enslavement. It is the father you can never please, the wet hillside you can never peak, the nightmare hallway that stretches before you, faster than you can run.  Perfection is a means to isolation and failure. For as long as he is the one we seek, we ignore or rebuke the \"good enough\", who are our fellow travellers, and our journey ends in nothing but bitter regret. Perfection is not an absolute or a relative term. It is a fiction. A lie. A false friend, and a vicious enemy of the good. ",

            "answer_text": "It's based on the context and how you define what it means to be perfect. If you deem a house to be perfect because it's big and in a rural area, well, what you really mean is that it's perfect for you. Someone else might like a house that's in the city, and your perfect house wouldn't be perfect for them. \"Perfect\" can also be defined quantitatively. If you get 100% on an exam (assuming there's no extra credit), then you received a perfect score since you got all the answers correct. ",
