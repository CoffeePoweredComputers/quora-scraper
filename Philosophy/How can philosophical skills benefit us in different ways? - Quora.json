            "answer_text": "Yes, but it depends on the skills. Far too many students of philosophy are never challenged to apply what they have learned. First, in America, we don\u2019t teach philosophy in the public schools, so many students are not even familiar with logic before entering university, Why? That's not clear but most teachers understand that getting someone started in a subject at an early age is absolutely crucial and this means that philosophy for them, if they come to it late, is not going to be properly engaged with normal human lives. Very few young people in America get a chance to do even a little philosophy in their whole lives. And the misunderstanding resulting in the population generally are becoming dangerous. I\u2019m referring to how the nonsense which is thrown between so-called \u2018liberals\u2019 and \u2018conservatives\u2019 is absolutely infantile, a disastrous show of ignorance. It doesn\u2019t help that people like Chomsky make a claim to political reasoning when, in fact, they are just like childish debaters refusing to understand and deal with all the objections which hover over their obviously biased accounts of international affairs. The least philosophical training should achieve is that people learn that listening carefully to your critics is an essential skill for building a fair and stable society. ",
