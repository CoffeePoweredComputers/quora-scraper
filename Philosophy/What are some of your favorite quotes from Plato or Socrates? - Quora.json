            "answer_text": "One of my favorite ones is the one I put below from Timaeus, because it puts clearly such a big part of Plato\u2019s philosophy - the division of the reality into the domain of truth and the domain of guise. The opposition is present allover Plato\u2019s dialogues, sometimes represented as the quarrel between philosophy (truth) and rhetoric (guise), or the difference between spiritual (truth) and material/external (guise) qualities, sometimes in the ontological and epistemological senses, which are most clearly put in the below fragment of Timaeus (in my own translation): \u201cWhat is this thing that exists forever, not ever having a beginning, and what is the thing that comes to be over and over again, never actually existing? The first one can be understood through rational comprehension, being the same at all times, the second one through opinions created by irrational impressions, becoming and perishing, never truly existing.\u201d \u03c4\u03af \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f42\u03bd \u1f00\u03b5\u03af, \u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bf\u1f50\u03ba \u1f14\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03af \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u1f00\u03b5\u03af, \u1f42\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5; \u03c4\u1f78 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03b4\u1f74 \u03bd\u03bf\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bb\u03b7\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd, \u1f00\u03b5\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u1f70 \u03c4\u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u1f70 \u1f44\u03bd, \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b4\u1fbd \u03b1\u1f56 \u03b4\u03cc\u03be\u1fc3 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1fbd \u03b1\u1f30\u03c3\u03b8\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03bf\u03be\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd, \u03b3\u03b9\u03b3\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd, \u1f44\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03bf\u1f50\u03b4\u03ad\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5 \u1f44\u03bd Plato, Timaeus, 27d-28a ",

An honest man is always a child.All men\u2019s souls are immortal, but the souls of the righteous are immortal and divine.Be slow to fall into friendship; but when thou art in, continue firm and constant.Death may be the greatest of all human blessings.He is richest who is content with the least, for content is the wealth of nature.It is not living that matters, but living rightly.Worthless people live only to eat and drink; people of worth eat and drink only to live.Not life, but good life, is to be chiefly valued.False words are not only evil in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil.",
