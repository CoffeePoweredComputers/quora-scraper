It could be considered wrong but not immoral for a person to eat desert the ice cream sundae, cake, pie, etc before dinner. Its not immoral to tell somone helpful tips aka constructive criticism but still wrong to do it in a jerk manner. No doubt wrong to freakin compare a reboot or remake to the original if its only done for the sole purpose to not evulate the remake or reboot on its own merits.

What makes a wrong immoral often is when its undeniably it helps to create pain, destruction, strife, etc.It could violate the 10 commandments along with other things commanded in the Bible. Or any other  system whether of a religon or not religob used where a action can be evaulated as immoral or moral.I believe your familar with cultural relativism where its what the culture values and says that he or she lives in. These are as vast as model cars. There are times its obvious other times it isnt.To get a woman to break up with a boyfriend is sabatoge.To be with someone just to make their crush jealous is using a person negatively, and it gives one a false impression that leads them on.To use a car but not fill it up with gas will create resentment and anger.To find any fault with someone because of envy or jealousy creates hostility.If a person intentiinally gives false or misleading information it helps to have a person make a bad decision or decisions easily.The whole scapegoating of a person or a group. This creates a horrid mentality that people  aren't responsible for their actions nor do they have to take responsibility for their actions instesd find a scapegoat. Obviously a society won't prosper if these actions are considered moral along with vast others.Vices intentionally and constantly used in human interactions where its obvious it can't help humans flourish and prosper.

            "answer_text": "What specifically makes a wrong immoral?  The moral code you use to compare it to... assuming you *have* a moral code to compare it to. If you have no morals, then it is difficult to see whether or not something that is wrong, is also immoral.  If you do have morals, then you would already know if something is immoral, regardless of whether or not it was considered \"wrong\". Is it wrong or immoral to execute criminals?  Is wrong or immoral to kill enemy combatants in war?  Is wrong or immoral to kill your neighbor because he plays music too loud? Three cases where a conscious decision ends the life of another human being.  Your morals decide which is immoral.  There are those who believe that ending ANY human life for ANY reason is immoral.  There are those who believe that killing in war is a necessity, but otherwise even capital punishment is wrong.  There are those who would never take a life themselves, but believe that capital punishment is necessary in a day and age when criminals are actually being made better criminals in the correctional system we currently have.  Then there are those who live by the moral code of \"Fuck with me and die.\" So... what makes a wrong, immoral?  The same thing that makes anything else immoral.  The moral code it is framed within.
