            "answer_text": "My impression: I don\u2019t think the person or association who expressed that claim sought justice, because it does not always hold. For example, judicial delay to discover and reject a prospective juror who would interfere in the use of DNA evidence would aid justice. If discovered during jury deliberation the DNA-unbeliever could be removed from the trial. Perhaps some citizens sincerely believe their opinion that a judge\u2019s decision or jury trial verdict is justice. U.S. jury trials seek exoneration of the accused rather than justice. When injustice is expected, verdict-delay is favorable. Justice enters the civic arena when a fellow citizen was wronged. Only then are descendants of \u201cthe good People of these . . . States\u201d (quoting the 1776 Declaration of Independence) and the civic citizens according to the 1787 U.S. Constitution (We the People of the United States in order to . . . ) called on to take responsibility for harm done. As descendants of the 1787 \u201courselves\u201d we are their \u201cPosterity\u201d and the \u201courselves\u201d to the coming generation, and therefore may accept the proposition that is proffered in the U.S. Constitution. Dissidents reject the responsibility for justice. Thanks to erroneous legislators, judges, and lawyers, our judicial system calls for prosecution-vs-defense lawyerly-competition rather than impartial determination of harm and guilt. Non-unanimous judicial opinion has gravitated from justice to the victim and to the good people to leniency toward the criminal. The victims of this tyranny are not only victims and their families and friends, but the faction We the People of the United states, who pay for viability. Judicial procedures leading to accusation are continually improved such that written law-enforcement may approach statutory justice. Prosecutors act on ineluctable evidence using the latest inventions to improve reliability of the evidence. For example, DNA is reliable for discovering either innocence or guilt. The role of prosecution and defense is to present and debate the evidence beyond reasonable doubt. The role of jury members is to discover which presenter failed to eliminate doubt. Reliability of DNA evidence is not a juror\u2019s responsibility. Consequently, the process for vetting jurors ought to discover and reject candidates who have a split view on DNA: OK to exonerate but not OK to convict. In a population that is split 50:50 for violence, impartial jury verdicts are possible with 7:5 verdicts and are statistically impossible with 12:0 verdicts. Unjustly, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Ramos v Louisiana (2020) unconstitutionally opined 6:3 that Louisiana ought to provide 12:0 jury verdicts. Louisiana\u2019s rule came in 1880, as soon as French-influence could take effect in meeting the state requirements of U.S. Amendment VI (1791): \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d The 2020 SCUS opinion unconstitutionally hinged on colonial-American English-precedent for 12:0 juries, which was corrected to 9:3 by French-influenced Louisiana in 1880 and to 10:2 by England in 1967 (to lessen organized crime\u2019s influence on jury trials). In other words, 1967 English precedent followed 1880 Louisiana justice and reformed centuries-old English law. If the U.S. Supreme Court eventually corrects this tyranny against We the People of the United States, we will be able to make the case that justice delayed is justice denied. The Dred-Scott opinion is another example of justice delayed. ",

            "answer_text": "Literal decades of suffering and fighting is an injustice to the victim. In this VA case, sixty years. For a Veteran, Disability Payment Is Long in Coming In many cases, those in power delay court cases and appeal using resources those fighting the government don\u2019t have in order to grind them into submission. The EPA and BLM were famous for this. The Institute for Justice and Pacific Legal Foundation have fought cases where people were not allowed to build a home they had permission to build for years. In one egregious case, the man had bought land with permission to develop oil rights in the 1980s. The environmental activists in power fought it despite them buying the land and paying for permission, forcing his widow to fight through 2020 for the right to develop the property. Imagine the government stealing money from you and forcing you to wait years to get it. And if you die, your case is probably over, because your heirs may not be able to fight further or the courts throw it out. On the flip side, justice delayed is a violation of the rights of the accused. Sitting in prison for years waiting for a trial is an abuse of power and violation of the accused\u2019s rights. Letting someone file a sex abuse case or some other accusation 40 years later is unfair, too, because memories are fuzzy and records critical to your defense are gone. ",
