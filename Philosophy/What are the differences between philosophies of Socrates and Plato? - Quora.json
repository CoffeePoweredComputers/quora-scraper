            "answer_text": "This is very difficult if not impossible to answer. Since Socrates did not actually write down his philosophy, (it is recorded by others, especially Plato) we don\u2019t actually know where Socrates ends and Plato begins. A reasonable conjecture is that Plato\u2019s early Socratic dialogues such as Euphythro, Apology, and Phaedo, probably best represent the words and philosophy of Socrates himself. Above all Socrates seems interested in getting people to think for themselves, and challenging peoples own ignorance. Starting with the middle to late dialogues, such as The Republic and Timaeus, the \u201cargumentative\u201d Socrates we had in earlier dialogues turns into more of a mouthpiece for specific metaphysical and ontological theories, especially what has become known as the theory of the forms. This is probably where Plato begins to assert his own thought. However, the delineation above is really conjecture. We have no hard evidence to go on. ",

            "answer_text": "Nothing. There is much hypothesis that Plato created Socrates to protect himself. It is easier to say controversial thoughts by saying a teacher told me or citing someone else. The story is that Socrates was tried and found guilty of passing on treasonous ideas. Plato can relate these controversial ideas and philosophy by saying this is what Socrates told me in what sounds like reporting an event. The last day of Socrates before willingly drink ing poison.
