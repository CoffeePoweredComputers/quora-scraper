            "answer_text": "Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. And so they are not at all in common. The Nihilist says: My existence has no meaning. The Taoist says: I don't need meaning to exist. The Nihilist says: My existence has no purpose. The Taoist says: My existence is my purpose. The Nihilist says: Nothing has value. The Taoist says: Everything is valuable to me. ",

            "answer_text": "Nihilism is defined as the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. Often associated with extreme pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. A nihilist would believe in nothing, have no loyalties, and no purpose other than, perhaps, an impulse to destroy. Taoism emphasizes being in harmony with the Tao which simply means \"way\", \"path\" - the laws of Nature. ",
