            "answer_text": "Aristotle was a student of Plato, but diverged significantly from Platonic philosophy, at least to the degree that the latter can be determined (better translations would be a help). For Aristotle only the particular was actual, the \u2018ideas\u2019 of Plato were generalizations helpful in classifying the actual. Aristotle was interested in the particular, the actual along with the possible and the potential. This scientific bent focused on viewing things in as many contexts as possible to see how they behaved, much the opposite of mathematical science which as far as possible seeks to eliminate context. The difference between the possible and the potential is that while the possible is only possible, the potential will be actualized given the right circumstances. He founded many of the current main branches of science via an ontology that determined the areas of study of those sciences: physics (motion), biology (life), economics (primarily household), ethics, poetics etc. As late as the 20th century Heisenberg went back to Aristotle\u2019s determination of space as illusory in order to invent quantum mechanics. Heisenberg also stated though that in the final instance Plato was right - that the fundamental particles have nothing we would term \u2018material\u2019 (mass, force etc.) and are therefore purely ideational. His literary technique was to begin with the common view, then progress through problems with it, continuing in each chapter beginning with the view with which the last chapter ended and discovering issues with it. This representation of his thinking was sufficiently believable that for nearly two millennia thinking as a whole was thought as representational. This is a more complex form of dialectic than Plato\u2019s dialogical form, in which characters exchange points of view in a debate form. Part of the difficulty, particularly with the later works of Plato, lies in determining which of the opinions Plato sides with, and in many cases Plato\u2019s thinking takes elements of both. This is unlike the early dialogues in which Socrates essentially acts as a stand-in for Plato. Aristotle also invented Koine (Common) Greek, an artificial language meant for trade. When St. Paul distinguishes \u201cthose who speak Greek\u201d from \u201cbarbarians\u201d he intends those who speak Koine and therefore take part in civilized trade. Koine is as far as is known the only successful artificial language, i.e. it became a common tongue by assimilating words and phrases from numerous other languages such as Persian and Hebrew. Aristotle formalized deductive logic with the syllogism, however far from viewing it as a means of judging thought, his formalization was simply to consistently win a then-popular parlour game. It was successful in this to the degree that interest in the game itself waned. ",

            "answer_text": "What are the relationships between Plato and Aristotle? Plato and Aristotle are probably the most important names in Ancient Greece, as far as philosophy is concerned, and they are, without a doubt, those who left behind them the most coarse works within the Greek authors, leaving their names engraved on the history. That Aristotle was a disciple of Plato is a known thing, however, these two did not coincide in everything and Aristotle knew very well how to ignore Plato's current and his world of ideas to analyze the real and the tangible, a question to which he advocated his he works, differentiating himself greatly from his former teacher. His works gave rise to all the advances of later thought, many times locating in different corners of thought, or approaching in other areas, laying the foundations for all later western thought, most of the time based on one of them two. Plato and Aristotle established the beginnings, therefore, of philosophy as we know it today, because undoubtedly philosophy and the history of thought would be very different if these two authors had not existed. Although on other occasions we have stopped to investigate who Plato was, today in Supercurioso we intend to unravel all the disagreements in the relationship between Plato and Aristotle.
