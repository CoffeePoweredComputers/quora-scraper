            "answer_text": "You might want to define \u2018objective\u2019 first. It\u2019s cheating not to have a definition\u2014if you have no definition, then the question is opinion-based (what some might call, perhaps wrongly, \u2018philosophically subjective\u2019). Philosophers have been known to say that some ideas are definitely a priori like how if there are two things which can be distinguished as two things in any way then that is objectively two things, whether they are similar or different. However, that is regardless of whether there is subjective metaphysics or not\u2014subjective metaphysics says the two things we distinguish are part of our own perception, whereas objective metaphysics says that those two objects are things others can also distinguish. It gets muddier, because there may be some things which we can distinguish as two things which are part of our perception objectively, whereas there may be other things which are objective, but which are not part of our perceptive apparatus. Here we see that what makes something subjective is that it is part of our perceptive apparatus (senses, opinions, and so on), and what makes something objective is that it is \u2018out in the world\u2019 or \u2018fits an outward category (empirical, physical, an entity, etc). So, your original question may be making a blurry distinction between objective / subjective in the metaphysical sense, and objective / subjective in the more linguistic / semantic sense. The sense of metaphysical subjectivity is not really what is meant by the question of whether something is our opinion or not\u2014because our opinion could be wrong, just as our senses could be wrong. So, if we mean \u2018objective senses\u2019 that could be true subjectively or objectively, whereas our opinion could only be true objectively. Metaphysical truths on the other hand must be subjectively or objectively true\u2014and it is not their subjectivity that makes them false. Metaphysically, something can be both subjective and objective simultaneously, just as a real person may have real perceptions of the real world. I suppose you could call this the Calculus of Subjectivity: if we have a real person having real perceptions of the real world, then there is an element of truth unless there is an element of subjectivity. The only true subjectivity then becomes true perception, because it is impossible that subjectivity exists outside perception. The real world and the real person, however, are objective. This type of vocabulary, such as \u2018perceptive apparatus\u2019 and \u2018metaphysical sense\u2019 is the kind of thing Hume and Kant were fishing about in their big treatises. Sometimes what Kant means is externally objective as far as the internal, placing the external first. Not that the world is you\u2014rather, that you are your world. \u2014Early concepts of identity ",

Intrenched with the necessary steps of defining the terminology and establishing agreements on what will count as acceptable evidence for answers includes resolving the private language problem and theories of knowledge issues. Reason, and scientific methodology mandate the repeatability of observable events, conditions, \u201cthings\u201d and all experiences and phenomena be possible by a variety of different, independent individuals for there to be knowledge. In contrast to this, many accept the validity of \u201cmiracles \u201c, unique, individual experiences unrepeatable and un-shareable as also constituting legitimate knowledge. Due to the realization that every individual can be mistaken about any experience, memory, or interpretation, the \u201cprivate language problem\u201d dictates that you can\u2019t have knowledge and certainty without the concurrence of independent minds duplicating your experiences and conclusions. Independent repeatablity and verification if accepted as a necessary and only condition of \u201cobjectivity \u201c would allow the objective . If miracles and only once upon a time, or only to one mind experiences are accepted as legitimate knowledge then the subjective can also be objective. I doubt that holders of either position will soon grant proprietary claims to use of the word \u201cobjective \u201c to \u201cthe other side.\u201d Therefore, your question seems currently unanswerable in any significantly meaningful way.

I might not be able to do better, so here it is: Only a subject, that is, a conscious mind like ours, can ponder the question of \u201creality\u201d. Neither objects, from the quantum to the cosmic scale, nor lower life forms can manage that. In that sense \u201cbeing real\u201d is a subjec-tive question. But there is no reason to assume that subjects, as well as discerning their own reality, should not be equipped to discern an autonomous reality that is other than themselves. In fact it is quite evident that such a reality (constituting objects and the physical phenomena associated with them) preceded the emergence of the subject in the universe by billions of years. In very abbreviated summary, and without seeking to state hard and fast definitions, Karl Popper suggested three categories of reality, calling them worlds 1, 2, and 3. World 1: the physical. World 2: mental events or processes and experiences such as consciousness, thought, and feeling. World 3: ideas, constructs, compositions, theories, and so forth generated via world 2. That the inhabitants of world 3 are real, though intangible (until instantiated in some way) can be seen all around in the effects they have had on the planet (world 1). ",

What you\u2019re getting at, while awkwardly stated, is that the true nature of an object can be decided in isolation from our particular experience of it, to varying degrees. The concept of objectivity is clear, it refers to the nature of things as they are, independent of how they are perceived by us, the subject. Since our very consideration of the object requires our senses, complete objectivity is only an abstract ideal, never attainable. However, between ultimate objectivity and the contrast in perception of two observers, there is room for at least some objectivity. ",

Your question amounts to whether there is a real distinction between them, or if it\u2019s just nonsense masquerading as fact. Thomas Nagel, in The View from Nowhere, does a very good job of explaining why we need the concept \u201csubjective\u201d to refer to aspects of our experience that are uniquely personal, like my own experience of the color red. On the other hand, what\u2019s \u201cout there\u201d in public can be discussed without reference to those subjective concepts. So the distinction is a real and occasionally useful one. Of course some of us are better at drawing this distinction than others, we all know people who simply cannot be influenced by facts. ",

In all other cases, yes, the subjective is fundamental \u2014 because it is the necessary condition for any perspective as such. But remember, 'subjective' does not just mean 'an arbitrary opinion'. Subjective means a \u2018view upon the world', which is necessarily constrained by being limited in comprehension (bounded in space-time), as well as of course being limited for human beings epistemologically. This is why science and mathematics are distinguished, because they respect and explicate their conditions of limit. By doing so, they can each tend towards objectivity. Fiction, then, is under no such obligation (but must explicate its function as fictive, else falls into what can be called myth or deceit). The so-called 'omniscient narrator' so frequently found in literature is a key demonstration of this condition of speaking in objectively objective terms, that is, from a logical point of view. ",
