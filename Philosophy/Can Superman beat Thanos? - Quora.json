            "answer_text": "The real question is\u2026 \u201cCan Thanos beat Superman\u201d\u2026??? Superman:  vs Thanos:  With the Infinity Gauntlet it's not even a contest\u2026 W/O the Infinity Gauntlet\u2026 \u201cNo\u201d\u2026!!! \u201cNada\u201d\u2026!!! Or to quote Thor\u2026. \u201cNay\u201d\u2026!!!! Superman outclasses Thanos in every category.. Strength: Superman is power incarnate, his strength is legendary in the DC universe, he is without doubt one of the most powerful beings in the entirety of the DC continuum \u2026 Able to even stand up physically to the very Gods themselves\u2026   Superman can move entire planet's and stars with his bare hands ...  Yeah that's 9,750,000,000,000,000,000,000 sextillion tons\u2026 Hell, he has movde an entire Solar System ..\u2026 And I'm positive that's definitely heavier than the Earth\u2026   Although Thanos is immensely powerful physically, and is capable of manhandling both Thor and The Hulk simultaneously, who are arguably two of the most physically powerful beings in the Marvel universe, he is not capable of moving a planet, star, or a solar system with his own physical strength\u2026  Speed: Superman traveled \u201c45 Billion\u201d light years in under 60 days a ftls, even passing through several black holes in order to return to earth\u2026  It has been theorized that Superman actually bends time and space around himself when traveling out of earth's atmosphere into deep space \u2026..  Hell he\u2019s so fast, he can literally circle around the planet and catch himself\u2026 (kidding) But yeah, he's really fast\u2026!!!  Thanos is not capable of flying or moving at faster than light speeds on his own \u2026.  But he has been shown capable of beating the \u201cEver Living Shit\u201d out of beings who can\u2026!!!   So at the very least, he is immensely fast in timing and reaction speed\u2026 Durability: Superman\u2019s durability is legendary, and allows him the invunerability to not only withstand, but survive one of the most powerful forces in the entirety of the DC universe, Darkseid\u2019s Omega Effect at point blank range, with no disconcernable effects\u2026. Although in this instance, he was supercharged after flying through the atmosphere of the Sun \u2026.   Superman has survived a blast from Imperiex Prime at point blank range, a being who has the very power of the \u201cBig Bang\u201d at his finger tips\u2026 Something not even Doomsday was capable of withstanding\u2026    And although I give Thanos an A+ for not only tanking a blast from Galactus, but getting him really pissed off, he did beg Galactus for mercy\u2026    But in his defense, who wouldn't \u2026??? Seriously though, all BS aside,Thanos is durable enough to not only walk right through one of the most powerful beings and forces in the entire Marvel universe, Black Bolt and his incalcuably powerful voice, but did so with litte effort or injury, then dropped Black Bolt like a bad habit\u2026!!!   But in my personal opinion, Imperiex would defeat Galactus\u2026!!! Imperiex Prime: Big Bang\u2026  Galactus: Power Cosmic\u2026  Hey wait a minute\u2026 Didn't Galactus survive \u201cThe Big Bang\u201d\u2026??? Anyways, considering an unrelenting and unremorseful Superman can do this to Darkseid, I doubt he is going to have much problem with Thanos\u2026 \u201cInsert Thanos here\u201d\u2026  Or he could just do this to Thanos\u2026 (Yep that used to be War World)\u2026  But hey, Thanos has eye beams too\u2026lol  \u201cWarning\u201d\u2026!!! \u201cWarning\u201d\u2026!!! \u201cWarning\u201d\u2026!!! This is merely a personal opinion and in no way makes me right, so there's no reason for any Marvel or Thanos fan to get angry or agitated and cry like a little girl\u2026!!! So please feel free to rebuttle, I look forward to your comments\u2026 \u201cKirk Out\u201d\u2026 One to beam up Mr. Scott\u2026!!!! ",

            "answer_text": "You are Saying \u2018Can\u2019 he beat Thanos so the answer is YES but \u2018Should\u2019 he be able to beat Thanos? NO. Superman should not be even able to beat Darkseid alone but he has been shown to atleast defeat Darkseid temporarily in a battle and Thanos was made after Darkseid so it is safe to say that Superman can. Both Darkseid and Thanos are much better heavyweight fighters than Superman but still supes manages to take on Darkseid. Let us see about Thanos :-  Superhuman Strength: Being an Eternal, Thanos has superhuman strength, endurance, reflexes and agility. He is nearly invulnerable, able to endure extreme heat, cold, energies, radiation, and poisons. Due to his genetic heritage, Thanos is immune to aging or disease. Telepathy/Mind Control: His mind is invulnerable to most forms of psychic attacks.He can read the minds of an individual and use it against them. He has even mind-controlled Hulk to whom usually psychic attack do not work because of extreme anger. Energy Manipulation: As his mutation allowed Thanos to absorb the cosmic energy, he through his mystical techniques augmented his power and is able to control the cosmic energy in the way he needs it to like emitting cosmic energy blasts from his hands,eyes, body and so on.He can also use this energy to create a force-field as his shield. Endurance: His God-like physiology along with his mutation and techniques,experiments and dark magic he concocted over the years allows him to be highly durable in a fight.He has easily brushed off the attacks from powerful beings in the universe.He even survived a full blast from BlackBolt. Intellect: Thanos was born with superhuman intelligence and has spent much of his life acquiring knowledge. While in the service of Mistress Death, he spent a great deal of time gazing into the Infinity Well and learning \"secrets\" of the galaxy. Immortal: In the story line \u2018The Final Threat\u2019 Thanos is turned into stone and is dead for good.But after years of death of Thanos, Mistress Death senses an imbalance in the Universe i.e Thanos had become so powerful that his sudden death caused imbalance in life and death in Universe and to remedy this error Mistress Death revives Thanos which leads to Thanos being Immortal, A True Immortal. All of the above and MAGIC. You can clearly see that even in his normal form Thanos is far stronger than Superman. So my answer will still be what i said in the begining: Superman CAN beat Thanos But he actually SHOULD not be able to. ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely. DCEU Superman is a bit nerfed but I'd say is a 30000-40000 tonner.. He struggled with a huge metal tower as a very young man. His strength continues to increase. He is like the Captain America of Kryptonians with his genetic diversity.His deficit in training made his fight with Zod similar to a completely untrained Captain America fighting a prime Punisher or Mel Potter. If an untrained Cap had to fight Black Widow, Brock Rumlow (with Mel Potter approximating the Giant Kryptonian and Black Widow the female Kryptonian) he'd get battered like Supes in Man of Steel. An untrained Cap with a Vibranium shield would eventually win ,but a lot of walls would be smashed: and Cap might have to snap Rumlows neck to keep him from shooting a civilian. This analogy is a bit imperfect as Cap is more vulnerable to human weapons than Supes is to Kryptonian weapons. Someone might get a few bullets past untrained Caps shield and no more Cap. The tectonic plate thing in Justice league is an outlier: and I'll ignore it even if other forms of Superman could do even more. Pulling a ship is far from lifting it. We have to remember Wonder Woman could stand up to Superman a bit in Justice league. A fourfold difference in strength would be reasonable. She is also not quite as Strong as Steppenwolf by herself. With Aquaman she is stronger and able to pull the New god down. This with raising a sub and tanking massive blows from Supes puts Aquaman at about an eighth to tenth Cavill Supermans strength. Cyborg would be slightly weaker than Aquaman. Affleck is the strongest screen Batman but a little short of his most powerful comic book counterparts. Thanos easily beats Hulk so a fairly newly transformed Hulk is a lot weaker than Thanos but still close enough to land Blows. Thor is always short a bit but can Withstand Thanos best blows. Here are some strength estimates Beginning of Infinity War Thanos. 900 ton deadlift. 500 ton pushpress. Gauntlet Thanos 2000 ton deadlift. 1500 ton pushpress. Beginning of Infinity war Thor 250 ton Deadlift,200 ton pushpress StormBringer Thor 900 ton deadlift 650 ton pushpress. Briefly much greater when swinging star. Overweight Thor 450 ton deadlift ,300 ton pushpress. Soundly beaten by pregauntlet Thanos but not really injured by him. Depowered Thor. 1400 lb deadlift and 800 lb pushpress. Could beat special forces like children but was useless againstLoki and The Destroyer. He left it to the Warriors Three until they were overwhelmed.Showed his worth fighting without powers so got them back. Beginning of Infinity War Hulk: 700 ton deadlift,500 ton pushpress.Gave an ungauntleted Thanos only a slight Workout. Hulk varies with anger but was definitely over 1000 tons at times in the Avengers. DCEU Steppenwolf: 10000 ton deadlift, 6000 ton pushpress. Battered by Superman but not critically injured Aquaman: 3000 ton deadlift 2000 ton pushpress Helped Wonderwoman pull down Steppenwolf and raised submarine to the surface. Seemed a bit weaker against Manta but movies are never consistent. Wonderwoman: 8000 ton deadlift, 5000 ton pushpress. Couldn't quite match Steppenwolf in strength by herself. Did give Supes a bit of a fight after he awoke. Like Superman; her powers increase with time. Cyborg 2000 ton deadlift, 1500 ton pushpress. Very powerful but Steppenwolf ripped his leg off. Flash: 6 ton deadlift, 3 ton pushpress. Like Quicksilver superhuman strength is just to absorb the speed. The Kid in Incredibles doesn't have superhuman strength but can only do bursts of 350 miles per hour and half that sustained. Even Slow movie Flash is capable of at least 80 000 miles per hour. Any character above half light speed is absurd even in a fictional context. Batman: 975lb deadlift, 550 lb pushpress. Based on his Workout he is a powerhouse. He could throw men with ease. Superman was only semi psychotic and confused when he woke or he wouldn't have held back more when he hit Batman than the Metahuman Justice League members. Even then; Bruce needed his armour to not be out of action for months. Superman. 30 000 ton deadlift, 25000 ton pushpress. Much stronger than any other character in Justice League Generally Superman is much stronger and tougher even than Thanos. No one gives figures in the Movies and characters like Cap can be much stronger than their ratings on the Marvel website. Given Hulk was able to reverse the Snap-it should be easy for Supes. In fact ,though a less realized character; and not quite as well played (despite the brilliance of Chiaran Hinds): Steppenwolf seems a fair bit stronger than Gauntlet Thanos on a purely physical level. Thanos would beat him with the Gauntlet though. So Thanos could best an early non flying Superman\u2026but that's about it. ",

            "answer_text": "No Superman can\u2019t beat Thanos, Thanos has him out classed in every aspect except speed, which is useless for Superman because Thanos can react to characters like Silver Surfer who easily outclasses Superman in speed. Thanos could use Telepathy to put Superman down instantly, if he so wishes he could also just beat Superman to death. Thanos easily tanked blasts from Odin  However, if this is the version of Superman that will fight the mad titan, Thanos in a all-out fight to the death, then Thanos will be annihilated and will just last for a couple of minutes:  \u201cSUPERMAN PRIME ONE MILLION\u201d Kryptonian physiology: as a Kryptonian, superman's body naturally absorb and process energy from a yellow and or blue sun, this gives him the following powers below:superhuman strength(later became god-like strength): supermanone million has been able to hit with the force of 10 octillion megatons, which puts his striking power at around 15.8 undecillion megatons, which makes sense since he was able to one shot Solaris, a living sun.* God-like heat vision: superman's heat vision(before one million) can reach the temperature of the core of the sun which is around 27 million degrees F, enough to burn and destroy a planet since a small fragment of the sun is more than enough to do so. but superman one million's heat vision can reach up to 42.6 quadrillion degrees F  From boy, to man, to hero and finally God, the one that started it all. * God-like speed:superman one million's speed should be around 26-27 quintillion MPH making him one of the fastest being in the DC universe, though that is as fast as calculations put him, superman one million's strength and speed have been confirmed to be incalculable, meaning he constantly breaks his own records. God-like stamina: powered by the yellow and or blue sun, superman's stamina is basically limitless, though his powers can be drained if the battle last too long or he exercises the use of his heat vision too often, but as superman one million, superman's stamina is limitlessGod-like durability: an average supernova hits with the force of almost 10 octillion megatons, regular superman survived a supernova, since superman one million is a \"million\" times stronger, if not more, he can survive way more than that, as it is confirmed superman one million can destroy multiverses which contains countless stars. Golden God God-like reflexes: superman one million can see objects moving faster than the speed of light. he can also see at a subatomic level, meaning he can see atoms, and the very fabric of the universe.Super breathSuper hearingFlightsuper agilityinvulnerability: he survived 2 planets crushing on him and a supernova.along with all these basic powers, superman one million also posses God-like powers such as: nigh-omnipotencenigh-omnisciencenigh-omnipresencemeaning he can do anything, be anywhere at once and have all the knowledge of the universe, since the beginning of time, it is unclear to what level he holds these abilities but it must be really high since he was able to recreate his home planet and bring back the dead, each of these feats require knowledge and power Reality alteration: the ability to not only bend but break the very rules and laws of physics and reality at will, the user of this power is above physics, above laws and above reality. to a user of this power there is no such thing as impossible or what's right and what's wrong; for example, they can turn the sun into water(depending on how powerful the user is with the ability) or turn water into whine(like Jesus did), basically bending and breaking reality.Creation: apart from resurrection, superman one million is said to have the ability to create life from nothing.Thanos  Thanos' strength has increased to such heights that he can shatter planets with single blows and defeating classic heavyweights like Thor and Silver Surfer in a matter of minutes.Apart from above Thor level physical strength, Thanos also has vast level of matter and energy manipulation, to the point that he could manipulate matter in another universe. Thanos has been a classic Silver Surfer enemy, meaning he's obviously about a Herald level energy and matter manipulator. Thanos can manipulate and project energy to such extent that he even damaged Galactus, throwing the Devourer of the Worlds off his feet and breaking his mask, which is a part of his armor. Thanos also uses his energy manipulation to create force fields that can withstand attacks from Galactus, Champion and Odin Borson, all of whom are at least universal level characters.Telepathy- Thanos also excels at telepathy, to the point of being even better than Charles Xavier.Magic- Thanos is a talented magic user, able to cast very strong spells. One such example is he time when he cursed Deadpool with immortality.Intellect- But the greatest wepon Thanos has is perhaps his intellect. Thanos is the most intelligent being in the Multiverse, aside from the Omniscient characters. Thanos has mastered every science in the Multiverse.Invulnurability- Thanos is mostly invulnerable. He has survived three point blank screams from Black Bolt back to back without any damage whatsoever, keeping in mind that Black Bolt subdued Terrax, then Herald of Galactus, with a single scream. Normal superman can\u2019t beat Thanos but superman prime may have a chance. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a respect thread for proof that Thanos feats are consistently superior to Post crisis Superman and Darksied.  Thanos is also a god. That's why Mistress Death had to give him god-cancer in the Infinity Quarry in order for him to be beaten.   In the scan belowThanos specially explains that he has the blood of the Olympian gods flowing through his viens.  Here the Inbetweener calls Thanos a demigod.  \u2014Below I compiled a list of relevant feats. This in not all of them however-- Here Thanos and classic Drax destroy a planet as a mere side effect of their fight of their fight. Classic Drax the Destroyer could rip entire Star's apart with his bare hands.   Let's talk about Thanos Invulnerabilty/Durability Below Thanos shows his incredible Invulnerability/Durability by \u201cintentionally\u201d standing face to face with an exploding gas giant. Just in order to study it.   In the 2003 Thanos series \u201cSamaritan\u201d; Galactus blasted Thanos and ultimately drained so much of his power in the process that he needed to feed again. it's important to note that Galactus was stated to be well nourished before the physical confrontation ever took place. As stated below.  A short while later in the same story Galactus nearly completely emptied himself of energy just trying to brake through Thanos force fields.  Here a couple of scans later after Galactus blasted Thanos he admitted that it drained his energy. But it wasn't enough to kill Thanos. Galactus has destroyed three star systems with a single attack before. Thanos showcases multi-solar system level durability/invulnerability.  Below in during the Annihilation Wave story arc; Galactus is shown destroying three Star Systems in a single attack. Yet he isn't capable of destroying Thanos without risking killing himself due to energy loss.  And how does Thanos invulnerability/durability compare to characters like the Hulk, Thor and Gladiator or the Silver Surfer? In the story arc \u201cInfinity Finale\u201d Thanos fights along side of several of the top bricks in Marvel in order to defeat an amped up Annihilus. Everyone else is killed around Thanos. But Thanos tanks everything that Annihilus can throw at him.         Thanos also has extreme top tier telepathic power and abilities. Here he shuts down the physical incarnation of the Beyonders mind after a short fight.   And here he takes control of one of Galactus most powerful herald's mind the fallen one.   Here Thanos enters Galactus mind gives a respectable battle to the world devourer.   And before anyone attempts to claim that it was because of Moondragon that he was able to do that feat. Just remember that Thanos has already defeated her in a 1vs1 telepathic battle before this ever occurred.  Here Thanos force field not only easily tanks blows from the Hulk but Thanos one-shotted him at the same time.  Here Thanos Battle's his son Thane to a standstill. Thane at the time had the Phoenix force.  Thanos destroyed a planet in the process using his own power.  Here Thanos showcases his use of magic by cursing Dead Pool with immortality. Because he was jealous of Mistress Death's interest in Dead Pool.   Here Thanos shows that he is immune to Reality Warping.  Here Thanos battle's Tyrant.    Tyrant is so powerful that it was surmised that his battle with Galactus destroyed entire galaxies.   And before anyone claims that Thanos had a power up from the orb that he stole from Tyrant before this fight, allow me to remind you that it was later revealed that Tyrant has hundreds of power orb's at his disposal the entire time.  Here is the video of the full fight between Thanos and Tyrant.  Thanos stole a single power orb in order to provoke Tyrant into fighting him.  Here below Thanos showcases matter manipulation by transforming Scragg the Skrull into stone.  Here below Thanos showcases telekinesis.  I could go on and on about how Thanos stalemated Odin or how Thanos has done other things using his own powers. But the point is that neither New 52 Superman nor Post crises Superman have the damage output nor the versatility to take on and defeat Thanos. Based on feat's. At best Superman would prove an annoyance. If Darksied has trouble with Superman then he definitely would lose to Thanos as well. As Thanos is waaay above post crises Superman's pay grade. Here is a video of the full fight between Thanos and Odin that took place in Adam Warlock and the Infinity Watch. Thanos stalemated Odin.  Superman got knocked out by flying into a moon. He wouldn't even be able to get past Thanos shield's. Let alone do him any real harm.  Although in the past few years Thanos has been written into Avengers storylines because of his connection with the movies. Marvel seems to be changing their comic book cannon to fit the cinematic universe more and more. But before the MCU came out Thanos was NOT consistently an Avengers villain. Thanos has had many solo series over the past 20 years. Avengers characters occasionally show up in them. But mostly it's Thanos facing cosmic level threat's ",

            "answer_text": "So the question is CAN superman beat Thanos. The answer is yes. I\u2019ve seen some other answers here say that he has no chance, but he does have a chance. While Thanos has a high chance of winning, Superman has fought and defeated Darkseid.  Now everyone knows that Thanos is inspired by Darkseid, and Darkseid has been shown to be much more powerful than Superman, yet Superman has beaten him. Yes, Thanos has beaten people like Thor, Hulk, Champion and more, but I still feel Supes has a chance. He will always push his limits and somehow win, such as when he knocked out World Forger, an easily multiversal level being, with just one punch after sundipping for a few seconds.   Advantages for Superman Speed- Superman has always been one of the fastest comic book characters, only slightly slower than The Flash. Thanos has many combat speed feats, but not many travelling speed feats that I am aware of that are superior to Superman\u2019s. Advantages for Thanos Intellect and Experience- Thanos has shown himself many times to be a very cunning opponent, with lots of tech and strategies that he could use to give himself an advantage, such as when he fought Champion.  Now, I\u2019m going to say that Darkseid>Superman, and more or less equal to Thanos. Thanos should be a bit more powerful, and should win more often then not, but Superman is never someone you should underestimate. Now on to DCEU and MCU versions. Both versions are quite nerfed in the live action versions, like all comic book characters on screen, with possibly the exception of Captain America. However, Thanos was nerfed much more than the rest, with or without the Infinity Gauntlet. In the comics, he defeated Eternity, and imprisoned many of the most powerful beings, such as celestials, Galactus, Odin and more. Yet, he was defeated in the MCU by Thor.    As you can see, Master Order and Lord Chaos are imprisoned as well, but they were able to kill the Living Tribunal before, when the multiverse was born again, and the cosmic hierarchy was not set yet. But in the MCU, he was defeated by Thor with Stormbreaker, (which was never used by Thor in the comics, only Beta Ray Bill).  Thanos in the MCU had pretty much none of his usual energy powers or tech, and simply seemed like he had super strength, healing and low levels of superhuman speed. Superman on the other hand hasn\u2019t been nerfed nearly as much, being capable of moving continents, and reacting to the Flash. Comics Superman vs Thanos- Thanos takes this maybe 6/10 times, unless Superman uses his writer manipulation, or if he sundips, or if its SA Supes. Superman vs Thanos/IG- Thanos takes this 10/10. It\u2019s no contest unless you put more powerful versions of Supes like Strange Visitor. Other Versions of Superman vs Other versions of Thanos- If you include Thought Robot, he pretty much beats them all, unless Jim Starlin comes up with a new version of Thanos. Astral Regulator Thanos might possibly win though, but it wasn\u2019t canon when he \u201cdefeated the one above all\u201d. Otherwise, Strange Visitor Superman beats Thanos w/ IG, but possibly not Thanos w/HOTU. MCU vs DCEU Superman(Post-JL) vs Thanos(EG, with sword, but no stones) - Superman takes this maybe 8/10 times. Thanos just doesn\u2019t have what it takes in the MCU. Superman(Post-JL) vs Thanos(IG in Infinity war)- Thanos should take this. But as I\u2019ve said before, he was beaten by Thor, so Supes might be able to take this. ",

            "answer_text": "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I literally laughed after hearing this question. Superman doesn't stand any chance against thanos with or without Infinity stone. Even if you compare strongest version of superman that is cosmic superman and strongest version of thanos that is heart of universe thanos from comics you will notice that marvels writters created heart of universe thanos and old king thor just to counter every move of cosmic superman. So thanos wins big way. If we talk about standard superman and thanos now. Thanos is literally the darkseid and he collects knowledge off every technology, power, and magic across the universe like braniacs and has fighting skill of many form of martial Arts even more than batman. And he is master strategist and warrior and fought many battle and have experiance of many years even more than wonder woman. Thanos wins in big way actually he will stomp superman since he will be the First person to force him to use the ability of flight and energy manipulation. Since most of DC fans might not know, just like batman thanos doesn't use his power and Technology untill and unless Required. If you talk of strength thanos is more powerful compare to superman. Many of you might argue that Captain Marvel took hit from thanos. Actually she was absorbing power from power stone and space stone and when thanos saw that he immediately took out power stone and punch her away. If you think laser beam will do the job then you Must watch end game again in which ironman used his chest core combining with thor's lightening but it didn't do shit. If you think cold breath will break thanos armour or weapons then you are completely wrong as those armour is made of uru metal which is the hardest metal of all or equivalent to nth metal of DC. But many of you will say Scarlet witch a. K. A wanda broke thanos' armour and weapons that's because she is the daughter of magneto and his ability along with Magical power recieved by her due to mind stone helped her in Breaking armour and twin side blades sword, however storm breaker is an exception since it has far superior Ancient asgardian magical power to hurt and Kill an omnipotent entity. So only thing in favour of superman is his speed but we saw it already How thanos grab SpiderMan who was Annoying him by help of Doctor Strange's portal trick. And now imagine him grabing superman and killing him instantly with his sword. Most importantly his telekinesis ability with slow down superman while fighting him. In movies however thanos used telekinesis just to bring back his twin side blades to his hand which actually surprised Iron man Captain and thor when blades changed its direction. Thanos will stomp superman like a rat dog without his Infinity gautlet. Thanos has power of flight and can even throw laser projection from his eyes and has Experianced gained in countless battles over thousands of year. He even studied and collected knowlege of various life form and powers, martial Arts , Nigh-Invulnerability, curse casting, telekinesis, immortality, superhuman reflexes, very High healing factor, energy manipulation, telephaty unlike in movies mantis will fail to stop thanos in comics and even magic when he captured Dr. Strange.He often employs a transportation chair capable of space flight, force field projection, teleportation, time travel, and movement through alternate universes. It is like facing darkseid and brainic at the same time. Let\u2019s talk about comic version of Thanos. MCU Version is much weaker\u2026 Everything in the MCU is weaker\u2026 Except maybe Happy Hogan? Never mind, let\u2019s get on with it:  Thanos is a mutant in his race of Eternals. His mutation is due to the Deviant Syndrome. Thanos\u2019 power is amplified to a higher degree compared to the average Eternal. That said, the average eternal is VERY strong. Some examples of normal class eternals are Sersi. I would say he is on the level or slightly higher than that of Skyfather tier. Comic Thanos is literally the smartest, strongest, everythingest character in the universe other than what is basically the gods. For good measure, he shoots energy blasts out of his hands as well. Even without any \"stones\" (gems in the comics) the only way even all of the Avengers combined can beat him is because he subconsciously beats himself. Thanos possesses abilities common to the Eternals, but amplified to a higher degree through a combination of his mutant\u2013Eternal heritage, bionic amplification, mysticism, and power bestowed by the abstract entity, Death. Demonstrating enormous superhuman strength, speed, stamina, immortality and invulnerability among other qualities, Thanos can absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy, and is capable of telekinesis and telepathy He can manipulate matter and live indefinitely without food, air or water, cannot die of old age, is immune to all terrestrial diseases, and has high resistance to psychic assaults. Thanos is considered one of the most strategic character in the comics and has in hand-to hand fighting. Thanos is a supergenius in virtually all known fields of advanced science and has created technology far exceeding that which is found on contemporary Earth. Thanos possesses the superhuman physiology of all Eternals, granting him superhuman strength, endurance, reflexes, and agility. His skin in nearly invulnerable, particularly against heat, cold, electricity, radiation, toxins, aging, and disease, and he can survive indefinitely without food or water even before his \"curse\" from Death left him immortal, unable to die. His mind is also invulnerable to most forms of psychic attack, and can project a psionic blast of energy as well as blasts of plasma/cosmic energy from his eyes and hands. Immortality: He is an extremely old being and has been called almost impossible to truly kill.Superhuman Strength: He has tremendous amounts of bone and muscle power, which was seen to surpass the Hulk's extraordinary physical power and beat him into unconsciousness.Superhuman Durability: His physical constitution is extremely durable, being able to wield the power of all the Infinity Stones and physically touch them without any damage or injury. He could even take on tremendous amounts of physical damage and still continued on with his mission.Let me show you some of his fears. His energy projection has vaporized and alternate version of hulk which was almost unkillable. He has gone hand to hand with Thor, Hulk, Silver Surfer. He took everything the silver surfer could throw at him, and he came out saying:\u201dare you finished?\u201d (Mind you, the silver surfer has a fraction of the power cosmic) He survived a blast from Cosmos.    Manages to STOP mjolnir  He survived a black hole 2 light years in diameter, which evaporated. A black hole that size which evaporates would put out the energy equivalent of multiple galaxies. And he came out with a few scratches. He is durable enough to withstand the power of the Phoenix Force.  He took on a blast from an enraged and fed Galactus, whom used so much power that he was hungry again. In the battle against ANNIHULUS, he was fighting next to Thor and when annihulus shot his weapon at them, Thor was vaporized but Thanos survived. That blast vaporized Gladiator, and other heroes on the same level as them. He withstood a direct blast from Black Bolt\u2019s voice.  Thanos has vast superhuman strength to a level that he is able take on Thor, Hulk, Beta Ray Bill, The Champion and Tyrant etc.  That\u2019s just some of his feats on his powers. Comic Thanos is extremely powerful, even without the Infinity Gauntlet. Since in MCU movies all characters have been downgraded in movies, Many Viewers believe that marvels heroes are weaker compare to DC but on actually they more of the same.  THIS IS JUSTICE LEAGUE 100\u2105 IN MOVIE  THIS IS JUSTICE LEAGUE 1\u2105 WITHOUT SUPERMAN. DCEU did the same thing by downgrading their characters but make an exception with superman and shazam it was like superman is 99 \u2105 of justice League and others superheroes were Show pieces in movies unlike in comics. So answer is thanos will Kill superman literally and figuratively because he will force him to use flight, energy manipulation and telekinesis which he doesn't enjoy. MOST POWERFUL VERSION OF THESE CHARACTER:- SUPERMAN PRIME 1 MILLION AND COSMIC ARMOUR SUPERMAN IS CONSIDERED MOST POWERFUL VERSION OF SUPERMAN SINCE THEY ARE COMPLEX MULTIVERSAL ENTITY WHO HAVE 50\u2105 CHANCE OF WINNING AGAINST OTHER COMPLEX MUTIVERSAL ENTITY.  And  HOWEVER SUPERMAN PRIME 1 MILLION IS NON CANNON WHILE COSMIC ARMOUR SUPERMAN IS A THOUGHT ROBOT WITH THE MEMORY OF SUPERMAN AND ULTRAMAN. BUT FOR THE SAKE OF MERCY WE WILL STILL COMPARE THEM WITH THANOS WITH HOTU OR HEART OF THE UNIVERSE THANOS WHO IS HYPERVERSAL ENTITY AND HAS THE POWERS JUST LIKE DC'S LUCIFER AND MICHAEL DEMIURGOS IN COMICS. The Heart is an object created by the One Above All, to bind the balance the of Good and Evil in the Multiverse. With the heart, you gain immense power to be essentially the fabric of all Creation.  Now how powerful was Thanos with the Heart?Well\u2026\u2026.. he was powerful,He described the power beyond imagination. Its was much more powerful than both the Cosmic Cube and Infinity Gauntlet.  It gives it\u2019s wielder Omni-Reality. Which more or less meaning in all present of the Universe so basically Omnipotence and Omnipresence.  The Heart is absolute to the point that Thanos can change anything in Creation or add upon in.  Eternity who is the embodiment of the Marvel Multiverse and the personification of Time, was defenseless against Thanos and couldn\u2019t defeat him.  He can casually beats the Celestial.  He literally absorb everyone including Infinity, Eternity, and The Living Tribunal.  Yes, he did destroy everything including the Universe itself.  He also had the power to bring back the Multiverse back.  So Thanos with the Heart was one of the most powerful characters in Creation and his power was unmatched by everyone. For the reference All Tier of character is given below. Street Tier Characters:-Teams like Kickass and normal people with mastered arts such as Nick Fury, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Captain America, etc. Continent Level Characters:-Teams like Avengers(not including Thor, Hulk and Iron Man), Fantastic Four and Guardians of the Galaxies(not including Drax and Gamora).

            "answer_text": "Current Superman? Well dude\u2026 NO.  Superman had to struggle to beat basic Thor. Now let me show you all something.   Thor with Warriors Madness defeated Beta Ray Bill, who is arguably above BASIC Thor, and Silver Surfer at once. Two Superman level opponents disposed of together. But, that wasn't the height of the madness.   Thor obtained the Power Gem. MCU fans, the movies have given you an idea of what this means. You essentially have a dude that is an already enhanced beyond Superman level guy with the power gem. Guess which villain fought him on even grounds?        Judging based off the CANON crossover that was referenced in CANON several times\u2026 Thor is roughly equal to Superman at base. This Thor was AMPED to the point that he beat someone at his base power with minimal effort. See what I am getting at? Here is another big baddie that beat 5 Superman level opponents at once.  Tyrant. Gladiator, Silver Surfer, Beta Ray Bill have straight up overpowered Thor before like Superman did, albeit easier. Morg could have. Terrax would not have won against Thor. Regardless\u2026  Easily dispatched. Guess which villain fought Tyrant alone and did better than these 5 did at once?   Thanos. These scans are out of order. But, this is Thanos. He did better alone than 5 Superman level opponents did together.    Stuff like this is why people always place Thanos so high up. We have active comparisons between Superman and Thor that let us know where Superman stands in Marvel. Where he stands in Marvel is NOT on Thanos level. JLA vs Avengers was referenced again. Google it. It is mentioned. This man?  This purple guy here is not someone Superman can beat alone by turning the dial up to 11. People seem to think he is similar to Darkseid, but I will tell you this: he hasn't caught any beatdowns from baseline Thor like Darkseid has from baseline Superman. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanos has no known upper limit to his strength. Death herself boosted his power to obscene levels, giving him strength enough to go head to head with the Silver Surfer, Terrax, Tyrant, Hulk, Thor, etc. He even fought Thor while the Thunder God was augmented with the Power Gem (one of the Infinity Stones). He can augment his strength the same way Silver Surfer does, by tapping into the ambient cosmic energy in the universe. This is the heart of Thanos\u2019 power. Superman does NOT beat him for strength. Thanos is every bit as strong as Supes, possibly stronger when augmented. He\u2019s not as fast in movement, but every bit as fast in reaction time. He can project insane amounts of energy, pure energy as a concussive force, \"magnetic\" energy, infrared heat-beams from his eyes, and disruptor beams, unilaterally striking separate targets with his optic blasts as well as use his mental link to his techno-mystical chair to form vastly powerful energy shields, barriers, and force-fields. His blasts have been capable of knocking down the likes of Thor and The Hulk. He was also able to slightly damage Galactus' armor and blast him off his feet. Thanos possesses psionic abilities. His mind is invulnerable to most forms of psychic attack, and his psionic attacks are powerful enough to fell even skilled psionic opponents. He has demonstrated some ability to manipulate matter on the atomic level, similarly to other Earthborn Eternals. On one occasion, he turned the Skrull, Skragg, into stone. Thanos seems to be at least partially skilled in magic, evidence being him cursing Deadpool to be unable to die. Here\u2019s the kicker: Thanos is ridiculously tough. His invulnerability was also augmented by Death after his resurrection so he is nigh invulnerable. He has withstood at point blank range planet-destroying attacks without any harm. He has withstood blasts from the Silver Surfer unharmed. He withstood a battering from an enraged, Power Gem-wielding Thor with nothing but a bloody nose. He possesses such an incredible resistance to injury that he has been shown to survive point-blank blasts from Odin and Galactus. Thanos has withstood three full screams from Black Bolt, one at point-blank range, without any significant damage. He survived being subjected to an artificial singularity. Bottom line: if you\u2019re judging the Mad Eternal by his MCU appearance you are grossly underestimating what he\u2019s capable of. Even without the gems, this is a being who could end Superman, if Supes left his plot armor at home. ",

Sentrys is easily more durable then supes, Thanos also took a full power god blast of Thor while Thor was wielding the powergem, Thors god blast was able to hurt galactus without powergem, he also took a full power attack from Silver Surfer, wich only make his nose bleed a little bit. Thanos can use magic to curse people, Thanos healing factor is at least as good as the one of deadpool, he is extremly intelligent, can fly, can teleport, can absorb and controll energy, can controll and manipulate matter, can use telepathy, is a extremly skilled hand to hand combaten, can use mind controll, can cast illusions, can create force fields that where able to trap hulk and nemor at the same time, was able to avoid silver surfers cosmic awareness, was able to resist reality warping, can teleport people by zaping them, he ones createt a black whole wich was so powerfull, thet it sucked in every thing with in a radius od 2 light years, still he survived withou any damage, he made a clone of him and galactus wich was stated to be twice as strong as as Galactus, Thanos withstood an attach from him without dying, should I go on? Thanos completly stomps supes, also for the one who said Supes Prime one Million would beat Thanos: If you take the strongest version of superman, then you have to take the strongest version of Thanos as well, wich is Thanos with the Heart of tge Univefse, this version of Thanos completly shits on superman prime on million, he Killed all abstract beings of the universe with ease, including: the living tribunal, Eternity, infinity, Galsctus, the stranger, lord Order, Master Chaos, and many more then he absorbed then and got even mor stronger, he would completly kill superman prime on million.

            "answer_text": "No. Even pre-Crisis Superman would struggle to give Thanos a nosebleed if he went all-out. We're talking the full and concentrated power of six big bangs, at minimum, to merely draw blood. And Thanos\u2019 strength and power is commensurate to his durability. Thanos is also faster than the Flash, near as can be measured, by a factor that is probably different than 63, for all that that is the number I have arrived at. Superman, in the current continuity, is actually a bit of a slowpoke by Justice League standards, unless he's given leave to accelerate in a straight line. Even pre-Crisis Superman relied more on hax than raw speed to cross large distances with the kind of speeds at which Thanos casually functions. Further, Thanos is a telepath on par with Professor X and Moondragon, though his offense is ever so slightly lacking for his level, which he easily makes up for in defence. Due to the way Marvel telepathy works, any skilled telepath could trivially solo almost every mind in DC. Having a power the full size of the World Tree and the capacity to harness pretty much all of it even without the Mind Gem (indeed, Thanos has successfully defended his mind from a Mind Gem-enhanced Moondragon) makes for a truly terrifying foe. And said telepathy comes with a capacity for soul manipulation, as all Marvel telepathy does by default. And then there's all of Thanos\u2019 intellect and technology and magic to consider, which covers most situations and abilities admirably. Superman is screwed. And all of the above refers to base Thanos, without the Infinity Gauntlet. Describing the Infinity Gauntlet as anything but overkill in a scenario like this is the height of folly. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanos possesses all 6 of the infinity stones- undefeatable things. Thanos can use the stones as his main offense and defense. things he could do are off the charts: he could set a time loop so every single time he dies he \u2018respawns\u2019 in front of superman\u2019s face and blast him with the power stone. if he is in an unfavouable situation he could just teleport away. he can use the mind stone to mind control superman, and using the reality stone turn him into rubber bands like he did to mantis. the reality stone can turn reality into something else, and imagine removing superman of all his power with a clench of his fist. and if superman is able to punch and kill him first, he just respawns. now to his basic powers. his strength is insane as he could defeat the hulk, annoy galactus, defeat thor and hulk and black bolt( a dude who can whisper and destroy a planet) without even looking, kill a god (loki), kill heimdall, a person who could see into the future and even destroy the avengers without a hitch. Superman has insane amounts of strength- he\u2019s able to lift basically everything, and basically shatter a planet with a poke. He has indomitable will, laser eyes and basically has celestial-like power. He could one punch k.o. thanos, destroy titan, and when he respawns continually kill him until Thanos gets annoyed, not superman. The only stone he has to be afraid of is the reality stone: removing him of all his powers. Now time to fight! Thanos arrives and superman punches in his face and he is knocked unconsious. Superman knows that if he kills Thanos, he will just respawn. He gets nearer and tries to remove the gauntlet. He removes the gauntlet and- easy win! Except that he finds out Thanos is using the reality stone- he grabs superman by the neck and blasts him with the power stone while using the space stone to make sure he doesn\u2019t move. Thanos then finds out that Superman is basically unkillable even using the power stone and un-clenches his fist. Superman\u2019s reflexes are much faster than Thanos\u2019s, and he rockets towards the sky and loops down and punches the planet they are standing on. Superman flies away at beyond light speed to the nearest planet. Thanos teleports away too and snaps. Superman dies. Or superman could have punched the time stone after 30 minutes (movie time) of fighting since you have to entertain the audience. like seriously, thanos could have snapped or superman could have destroyed the time stone long ago, but movies are like wait until the last second and make sure you aim for the chest not the arm using stormbreaker or punch batman in the face. anyways back to topic. I would say both are equally matched, but Thanos might have a slightly larger chance of winning. ",

            "answer_text": "When thinking of super characters, we tend to think of them in the form that we read about. In my case, the version of Superman is Silver Age. That was the Superman who towed a series of planets connected by an impossibly string chain. This Superman was before Darkseid or Mongul. If we carefully read the summary of SA Superman powers, we read that he is invulnerable. Of course, he was not. If he is vulnerable to magic and kryptonite, then he is not invulnerable. However, without either of those irritant, it is said he is invulnerable. That was not the opinion of other DC characters, it was a statement found as a primary source. The definition of invulnerable is \u201cimpossible to harm or damage.\u201d That is easy to read and understand. Indeed, when reading DC during that era, Superman simply never got hurt. Now to the point, Thanos without the Stones is not at SA Superman\u2019s strength level. and since Superman is invulnerable (not nigh-invulnerable as they would say in Marvel-land) Thanos would not be able to harm him. Unless, the Stones are magic, Superman would still be invulnerable and thus not harmed by them. True, Thanos could will Superman away someplace, but I think Thanos is more competitive than that. There is no Kryptonite in the Marvel universe. And Superman is vulnerable to kryptonite \u2014 that is primary knowledge. However, kryptonite are fragments of the planet Krypton. Something which is manufactured to be like kryptonite would be missing a key factor \u2014 it is not a fragment of krypton. Though Thanos defeated Eternity who represents all beings in the Marvel Universe, he does not represent beings from DC. When it comes down to it, who ever wins is chosen by the writers. ",

Let\u2019s ask, can Thanos or anyone beat Superman? Not if they\u2019re from this galaxy (the Milky Way). Kal-El is from the Andromeda galaxy which actually ate up the Milky Way\u2019s twin sister galaxy. The Andromeda galaxy is nearly a thousand times larger than the Milky Way. Beings from there are incredibly stronger than beings from here. The Infinity Stones won\u2019t help, they are born out of the Big Bang of the Milky Way and not the Andromeda Galaxy. Most importantly, Kal-El contains within him the Codex from Krypton; this is the essence of life for over a billion unborn Kryptonians; it is what makes him truly immortal. No one can compare to him.

Also the scene where Thor and Thing get whomped by Thanos gets a lot of play but the other page where they combine and beat the stuffing out of Thanos rarely makes an appearance.  And no one ever mentions the time ordinary puny human Ka-Zar beat Thanos. Heroes win. That\u2019s what they do. The villains should be more powerful to make the fight inspirational, but ultimately the hero should find a way. So simply put, yes. If the story needed Superman to beat Thanos, he would, handily ",

Without the Gauntlet Thanos can only rely on his strength and Superman has both Strength and invulnerability whilst Thanos is durable, but he\u2019s not totally invincible. Could he throw him around? Yes, because he wouldn\u2019t be the first Super Strong being be it hero or villain to toss around Superman. With the Gauntlet he\u2019d have a bigger advantage, hell even be able to psychologically damage Superman by recreating Krypton and destroying it over and over again. However while it\u2019s abilities in reality warping rivals that of DC\u2019s 5th Dimensional beings, it\u2019s still a glove made of gold and Superman who has pretty much been able to turn Coal into Diamonds could shatter that thing scattering the stones. Or worse, if Supes got his hands on that thing, he\u2019d probably be able to put Thanos into all kinds of hell before imprisoning him. But either way considering that Thanos is Marvel\u2019s answer to DC\u2019s Darkseid it may start with this.  ",

Thanos would dominate superman because superman represents the Elioud nephilim while Thanos the Mad Titan represent the Naphilim a superior race of nephilim giants. But not suppressed Superman represents the dragonoid celestial race that fathered the nephilim race as a whole and who are far larger and more powerful than even the largest and most powerful of the nephilim races the Great Giants which is symbolized by Galactus. As a result Superman unsuppressed would annihilate Thanos. This fight actually occurred in real life when Noah prayed to have the nephillim race placed in hell. God unleashed the same species of mountain sized dragonoid celestials you see on Dragon Ball Z which superman is based upon to crush the nephillim race and to send 9/ 10ths of them in hell. Most of the Naphilim or the race called Titans whom The Mad Titan is a caricature of were placed in hell and have resided hell for thousands of years ",

Superman has faced villains like Thanos before and won, the most obvious being Darksied, whom Thanos was modeled after (you can even substitute the Killing Glove for the Infinity Gauntlet, on inspiration). Thanos has a really strong fan-base thanks to the Infinity Gauntlet storyline, and that brings along a sizable amount of fanw@nk. Thanos fans seem to forget that while he\u2019s the consummate schemer, he repeatedly loses in his plans of mice and men, even when he\u2019s loaded for bear with magical items of incredible power like the Infinity Gauntlet. He tends to defeat himself, and is far from unbeatable. Thanos has been beaten by Squirrel Girl. Squirrel Girl.  That\u2019s a pretty damning scene. ",

If Thanos DOES have the Infinity Goblet, then Superman would lose. Since Superman\u2019s family does have strong and unbelievable powers he could win EASILY, but Thanos on the other hand, he has a goblet with VERY powerful stones on it, so Superman would have probably 14\u201315% on beating Thanos with the goblet. To be honest.. it all depends on how they fight, their strength, and how they plan their battle. I hope this answers your question, and if not I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t give you more info.

            "answer_text": "Well I'm a little biased since I'm a big Superman fan BUT if we consider each of their feats I would give it to Superman. Honestly it would have to be whomever took the first proverbial shot. Knowing Superman is a Goodie Two Shoes that would obviously pose a major problem for Supes from the start. If both of them being at their full potential Thanos wth 66the Infinity Gauntlet ALTHOUGH it was said that the Infinity Gauntlet will not work in the DC universe in that case IT WOULD BE OVER FOR THANOS IN 10 SECONDS Thanos would NOT be able to take all of superman's powers and abilities. But I'd rather go with FULLY POWERED Thanos and Superman NOT HOLDING BACK for fear of hurting his opponent as he once stated to Darkseid before he pummeled him, more than likely it was his Avatar, from They are weaker than the true Darkseid.But this is Thanos if Thanos uses the infinity Gauntlet and Suprrman his strength, speed and invulnerability I think if Superman is able to avoid getting hit by Thanos Infinity Gauntlet and Superman hits him as hard and as fast as he did Doomsday it would be the end of Thanos. But I doubt it will be that easy as Thanos is extremely intelligent not just powerful.. The bottomline is IF Superman does not go full out one Thanos with everything hes got from the beginning and Thanos manages to use the Gauntlet on Superman its VERY likely Superman will lose BIG TIME since Thanos can do a myriad of feats with the Infinity Gauntlet that after weakening Supes it would be ALL OVER for my favorite superhero\u2026 Those are the facts even though I Hate to admit it!

Thanos can take a better beating than Steppenwolf, but Thanos would fall to Superman, even with the Infinity Gauntlet (but only minus the Time Stone and Reality Stone). With those stones, Thanos would beat Superman until Superman calls a friend, like the Flash then uses the Speedforce to travel back in time a smack Thanos down before he got the stones. The Reality Stone is an odd one as even though Thanos warped reality (Drax cubed, Mantis is shredded, etc.), turned Wolverine to a skin sack (comics), Superman would eventually overcome that issue by believing in himself and again he would not fight Thanos on his own, because of the gauntlet.

In movies thanos has complete control over space ,time,power,reality, mind & soul. Can teleport, shot energy beams powerful enough to shatter planets & many other things including reality wrapping & time manipulation. While superman is just fast & strong & can shot solar energy out of his eyes. Thanos can wipe him with a snap or worse can turn his suit into kryptonite. Now in comics versions. The strongest version of superman is superman prime 1 billion or the thought robot. Both of these characters r nearly as powerful as nigh omni beings like living tribunal or Lucifer Morningstar. On the other hand the most powerful versions of thanos in comics is HOTU thanos (heart of the universe ) which is basically thanos becoming omni. He oneshotted all the nigh omnis of his verse in that form. So both in movies & comics superman can't defeat thanos ",

Because let's be real, if Superman did fight Thanos, it'll be nothing short of a Doomsday scenario. With the gauntlet, Thanos being omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent and more, Thanos wins immideatly. No question. Thanos with the IG VS Superman Prime 1 million, well since both can basically do whatever the f#%+ they want, out of 100 battles, 101 result in the destruction of the multiverse. Hope that helps. ",
