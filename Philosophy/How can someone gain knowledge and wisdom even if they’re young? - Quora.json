And ask you these questions. And these questions if it goes handwritten every day write. Here comes another text from the radio. They have described exactly what wisdom is. Good luck. Wisdom - The art of wise living Author and director: Dorit Kreissl \"60 years and not a bit wise,\" sang Curd J\u00fcrgens once. He was right, because the widespread view that \"age makes wise\" is fundamentally wrong. Wisdom is multidimensional, based on knowledge, experience, judgment, values and emotion control. The supreme discipline around wisdom, the highest goal that a person can achieve, was philosophy, which already bears the \"love of wisdom\" in its name. Today the question of a successful life is scientifically investigated and answered less by philosophers than by psychologists. The \"Berlin Model of Wisdom\" was created as early as the 1980s. The psychologists developed empirical models to investigate general and personal wisdom. For the latter, they established five criteria, five skills, on the basis of which the wisdom level of the test subjects was assessed: They tested factual knowledge, practical knowledge and strategies for making decisions, coping with difficult life problems, thinking in contexts as well as the ability to tolerate and affirm universal values. Age Wisdom - Dealing with the Time Remaining Author: Mechthild M\u00fcser / Director: Eva Demmelhuber Ageing requires courage - because losses increase with age, because physical limits are shown, because one loses abilities and friends. This is humiliating in a society where youth and performance are at the forefront, and can have devastating effects on the well-being of the elderly, especially as nothing has prepared them for aging. The end of life, a true vale of tears? It doesn't have to be that way. Those who turn their attention to what they still have instead of what they have lost, who can appreciate the abundance of the past decades, feel grateful. Those who can assume that life is never as perfect as the glossy brochures suggest a happy existence are happier, because marriage and professional life are often only half successful and children go their own way. Looking with cheerfulness at one's own mistakes and still not remaining silent in the face of the misery and injustice in the world helps to get out of the circle around one's own state of mind. And thus also to win a piece of freedom for oneself. ",

            "answer_text": "Typically, people really only learn from their mistakes. Unfortunately, some don\u2019t even do that. Understand that a mistake isn\u2019t a mistake if you learn something from it. Then it is a lesson. Some of these lessons cost more than others. Don\u2019t follow the herd. By that I mean don\u2019t blindly do what everyone else is doing. These types of people aren\u2019t paying attention and miss so many opportunities to gain knowledge. Wisdom is what you do with what you know. No one receives an answer unless they ask a question. Ask. Desire the truth rather than peoples opinions. Don\u2019t create opinions that are not based on truth. If you are ever wrong, do not be offended by the person who points it out. A person who desires wisdom loves to be corrected. They would rather admit fault if that means in the end they have more truth. But if you are going to be corrected make sure the person correcting you is able to support their correction. When they do support it, thank them and consider them a friend. ",
