Special Relativity on the other hand, shows us with the relativity of simultaneity that the idea of a gone \u201cpast 3D space\u201d and a non-existent \u201cfuture 3D space\u201d is false, simply because there\u2019s no such thing as a single, real \u201ccurrent 3D space\u201d.Someone in relative motion at a distance from me can be in my moment, while I am not in his moment. And over there, he\u2019s thinking the exact same about another moment of mine. This shows that complete 4D spacetime is already set, all of it real and happening, but the intuitive assumption that this moment dictates the next just happens to be wrong. Quantum mechanics merely shows us that the next moment can\u2019t be fully predicted by this current moment. But then again, this idea of causality is not at all part of our physics anymore for some time, now (check Sean Carroll at 8:26 - 8:55):  So moments are connected to each other with certain patterns, but they don\u2019t dictate each other fully towards only one particular direction, as we used to have taken for granted.

            "answer_text": "Quantum mechanics is non-deterministic because it has to incorporate two incompatible properties into one whole. It has to explain how an object can behave as both a wave and a particle. These two concepts are incompatible in classical physics because a wave is a nonlocal disturbance, or a spatiotemporally distributed phenomenon. On the other hand a particle has the general property of being spatiotemporally localised. That means you can assign a position and momentum to a particle. The problem arises when we consider the Young's double slit experiment. For light, which we associate as a wave, the interference pattern is easily explained. However for single photons, the interference pattern disappears, leaving individual photon arrivals. However if we wait long enough, the pattern of photon arrivals matches the interference pattern observed with light. Photons are detected like particles but their detection location is still governed by the interference pattern. Furthermore, you find exactly the same behaviour when dealing with electrons, or neutrons or single atoms\u2026 This is wave-particle duality. Indeterminism is exhibited in inability to predict the location of single detection events. We only know the probability or likelihood of detection in a certain location. What's more, there is no known additional information available locally that can restore determinism to the quantum world. That follows from violations of Bell's inequalities, which have been demonstrated many times. ",

            "answer_text": "Here is my understanding in a nutshell. If what I say is incorrect or incomplete, please let me know. Quantum mechanics admits both deterministic and non-deterministic interpretations which make identical predictions for the outcomes of physical measurements. Because the predictions are identical, the question of which interpretation is correct cannot be settled by experiment. So the short answer is that quantum mechanics cannot tell you whether the universe is deterministic or non-deterministic. But this answer is probably too cautious to be of much interest. The principal rival interpretations are the Copenhagen Interpretation (non-deterministic) and the Many-Worlds Interpretation (deterministic). The Copenhagen interpretation maintains that the outcomes of physical measurements (such as the time taken for a uranium atom to decay) are irreducibly random, that is, inexplicable in principle. The many worlds interpretation agrees that the outcomes have to be treated as if they are random but it explains the apparent randomness by attributing it to ignorance of the quantum state of the measurement apparatus. (See Vitktor Toth\u2019s answer to Is The Many-Worlds Interpretation of QM deterministic?) Chapter 2 of David Deutsch\u2019s The Fabric of Reality is a brilliant account of how the many worlds interpretation explains the result of double slit interference experiments. \u201cBrilliant\u201d because Deutsch achieves this without any reference to the formalism of Quantum Mechanics (there is no mention of waveforms, Hilbert spaces and all the rest of it) but the key word here is \u201cexplains\u201d. The Copenhagen interpretation cannot explain what is going on; it merely invites us to throw up our hands.  ",

            "answer_text": "If we understand \u201cdeterminism\u201d in the classical Newtonian, Laplacian physics sense, yes it does. Contrary to what Laplace believed, even an arbitrarily detailed knowledge of the present state of a system will never allow you to predict precisely its evolution in time. But it must be said that the definition of \u201cdeterminism\u201d has also evolved. Chaos theory proved that deterministic laws do not mean predictable outcomes, not at all, systems governed by chaos follow perfectly deterministic laws and yet the outcome is completely unpredictable. Furthermore, the effect of any system such as a conscious being attempting to determine the state of a system has also been found to play a role in the outcome, since the interaction with the questioned system has also an effect on the outcome which can not be predicted deterministically, this is the infamous \u201cfreewill\u201d if we believe in it. So in summary I would say that a universe with Life is most apparently non-deterministic, in big part but not only because the way QM laws work. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give you two answers. In Quantum Mechanics there is no mechanism that describes, for example, where an electron is, or what sequence of events may be triggered by that electron, until a measurement is made. Therefore QM leads to the idea of superpositions, and different physicists have different ideas about when they end. In Quantum Field Theory (my favorite theory) everything is made of fields and these fields obey deterministic equations. However there are two processes that are not described by these field equations, so they are \u201cnon-deterministic\u201d. The process are creation and collapse of a quantum. Even if we knew the exact state of a system at a given time, we couldn\u2019t predict when they will happen. Here\u2019s what I wrote about quantum collapse in Chapter 10 of my book (you can read the whole chapter free here): \u2026 so far as we know, quantum collapse is random. QFT does not explain when or how it happens. All we know is that the probability of collapse is related to the field intensity at a given point. The idea of randomness was troubling to Einstein: I find the idea quite intolerable that an electron exposed to radiation should choose, of its own free will, not only its moment to jump off, but also its direction. In that case, I would rather be a cobbler, or even an employee in a gaming house, than a physicist. \u2013 A. Einstein (letter to Max Born, 1924) However, 25 years later Einstein softened his stand. In a 1950 speech to the International Congress of Surgeons, after describing the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d for giving up causality, he concluded by saying: Will this credo survive forever? It seems to me a smile is the best answer. \u2013 A. Einstein (Physics Today, June 2005, p. 47-48) While the problem of randomness is not solved by QFT, at least it has been pinned down to a specific event. It is no longer a vague phenomenon related to the role of the observer, as in QM; it is a physical event that happens with or without an observer. Maybe someday we will have a theory to describe it, but even if it is truly random there is nothing inherently contradictory about that. It may not be what we expected but, like Einstein, we can always smile. ",

            "answer_text": "Strictly speaking, quantum mechanics is deterministic. The problem is, it is deterministic in \u03c8, since if you know \u03c8 now, you have an equation that will tell you what it is whenever for whatever defined change of conditions. The problem is, \u03c8 is not directly measurable, and worse, it almost becomes a matter of opinion as to what \u03c8 means. Notwithstanding that, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a statement of the law of conservation of energy, and energy remains conserved at the quantum level, as does momentum and angular momentum, with one reservation - any determination has an inherent level of uncertainty, which in my interpretation of quantum mechanics (explained in my ebook \u201cGuidance Waves\u201d) is due to action being discrete, not continuous. Thus while you can never measure position and momentum to within a quantum of action, the momentum never becomes more uncertain. By that I mean, if I fire particles towards the moon, and try to measure the momentum.position on the roof, the Uncertainty is h, and if I try to do it on the moon, it is still h. (Some people consider it can be h/2\u03c0, and others even less. This is a matter of what you think the Uncertainty Principle says exactly, and exactly what you think action is.) Most other problems in quantum mechanics depend on how you interpret what \u03c8 is. This in turn depends on whether you think there is a wave (pilot wave, my guidance wave) or there is not (Copenhagen, Many Worlds). Strictly speaking, there is no way to distinguish between these because in most cases they end up more or less predicting the same, or the differences cannot be measured. As an example, if you consider those variations in the UP, you could prove me wrong if in a single determination of linear motion you could prove you could make a measurement with less uncertainty than h, but ow do you do that? Similarly, I outline two experiments that I believe will give different outcomes to the standard theory, and in principle they would distinguish between them, but the standard theory might then change to account for the new observations. So, it is not indeterminate, but equally it is not classically determinate either. In my opinion it is determinate if you restrict yourself to the conserved properties, thus you can know the momentum if the position is totally indeterminate. ",

QM attempts to provide an output without identifying the activities of the process. Another way of looking at this is to call it empirical. You can model things statistically through correlation without understand the underlying processes. Of course it only works if the correlation holds true and you have no way of knowing whether it always will. If your theory is fundamental or mechanism based then you have every chance of predicting when relationships will be broken and whether the quantities that you are actually correlating are really that significant in the first place. The bottom line is that we do not currently have an accepted fundamental theory of the sub-atomic. Until such time as we do, then we have no choice but to base things on statistical correlations. These are not deterministic, but that does not mean that the reality which they are attempting to model is non-deterministic in nature. It just means that we are unable to make our predictions in a deterministic manner. ",

The agreement over a period of a hundred years has been perfect. The existing QT formalism is a minimalist tool. It does its job. But maybe quantum mechanics is not the final story? Maybe its statistical nature is just due to our ignorance of some deeper (\u201chidden variable\u201d) theory that is just as deterministic as classical theory and would let us predict individual events, not just probabilities? It turns out experiments (inspired by the work of Jon Bell) have ruled out the existence of local hidden variable theories which can reproduce the successes of QT. Quantum Theory, with its fundamentally probabilistic description is currently the best description of fundamental laws. Classical deterministic physics is an emergent approximation at the macroscopic level. The world is not what it appears. ",

At best, Quantum Mechanics calls into question the vitality of Newtonian Determinism, which is a scientific construct and not a metaphysical paradigm \u2014 and even with respect to that issue, there is a healthy debate within the scientific community. The bases for this answer are set forth at Does quantum mechanics undermine hard determinism?, which can be read by clicking on this hyperlink. ",
