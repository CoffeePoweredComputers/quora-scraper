            "answer_text": "Perhaps the most interesting philosophical argument is, \"What makes a human, a human, as distinct from any other creature?\" The philosophical underpinnings of that have shifted considerably in the last 30 years, since the distinctions where we once drew a line, have proven to be mistaken, again and again, and again as we discover those \"human\" traits and abilities have not been exclusive to humans at all. Planning, logic, a sense of \"self\", a sense of time, problem solving, tool use, all have been discovered to exist in the \"natural world\" of animals, and even, to some extent in plants. Another favorite of mine was one of the favorites of most people. It seems to be taken as unshakable logic by most who hear it, and for that matter most who teach about the author, but Rene DesCartes' pronouncement that stripped of everything else he was sure that, \"I think, therefore I am.\" (or in his case, writing in Latin, the language of scholars of his time), \"Cogito ergo sum\"  (the \"o\" ending on Cogito indicates, inherent in the language of Latin that the first person is speaking and the root of the verb means \"to think\" or \"to hold a concept in one's mind\" or possibly \"to have a thought\" all of which are slightly, very slightly, different shades of meaning) and \"sum\" is the present singular tense for the verb meaning \"to be\" or \"to exist\".  Now, I admit this is a philosophical tenet to which I devoted a great deal of thought, initially, and then again over the many years since as young philosopher (okay, high school student) myself, I have revisited in trying to explain to other people where DesCartes overstepped and made a whole bundle of unsupported, or at least questionable assumptions to arrive at the \"Cogito ergo sum,\" conclusion.  Let's start with the last thing I mention in the paragraph above. While it seems completely logical and reasonable that, of course, every language has a version of the verb meaning \"exist\" or \"to be\", that assumption would be wrong in one very prominent and well known instance (or the report of an historical incidence, which we generally take to be a truthful account of what happened, to the best of the reporters' ability to tell the story). We are told that Moses went up into the mountain(s) where he saw a burning bush that was not consumed by the fire. Several explanations have been offered about that, including that it was very high in oil content, and it was therefore only the oil that was burning and not the wood or the bush, or that something has sparked a vent of natural gas (methane) that was burning in a corona around the bush without consuming the wood as combustible material itself.  But that is not my point about the story. The modern telling of this story has become that Moses was spoken to by god. (or \"God\" if you must) and was given by inspiration to write down the ten laws by which all Hebrews must live. However, when \"god\" spoke it's \"name\", it was a word Moses had never heard. The word is now know to biblical scholars as the \"tetragrammaton\", reported by First Century Jewish historian Josephus to be \"four vowels\" is usually translated in English as a word pronounced like: \"JAWAY\", or really \"Ya Way\" though more often written as \"Jehovah\" and usually thought of (in English anyway) as four consonants. But at that time, a first person singular of the verb \"to be\" (which is say, \"I am\") did not exist. Or so I was told by some of my teachers who were Rabbi's or the brothers of Rabbi's. It was overly obvious to everyone that if you were standing there, speaking, that you exist, and was not considered (if it was ever considered at all) to be anything that one would need to say. Now, there are any number of a jumble of four letters in Hebrew (or more accurately, in Aramaic, the language spoken by Jesus of Nazareth and the people of that time and earlier).  Since it is tricky at best to reproduce the Hebrew characters here, I will use the English ones that represent, roughly the Hebrew characters, that have been interpreted (and note that it was an interpretation because the oldest texts available of the Hebrew sacred book are from about the 10th century, which attempted to copy the earlier versions, but were also concerned with correct pronunciation (and therefore interpretation too) including vowels which were generally not even written into Hebrew in ancient times.)   But in English this is usually written as the four consonants YHWH. This is sometimes translated into English as meaning \"I am that I am\", although that is also an attempt to add meaning to the sequence of letters. Other people have twisted it into a pretzel, so they claim it to mean, \"I am whatever I become.\" The closest translation that I can interpret (for myself, and I have only had the tiniest of beginners Hebrew classes) is \"I am I am\". Now that interpretation has the implication, if looked at closely, that seems to me means, \"I am\" in the very broadest, but also in the most specific sense of that sentence. \"I\" represents everything that exists. The \"am\" is saying just, \"exist\", in the sense of that first person singular that didn't have words to express it in the Aramaic/Hebrew of that time. So condensed, \"I am I am\" is just \"I am.\" The \"god\" of the Hebrews was necessarily a singular god, because \"he\" (it) was all of existence, everything in the universe that ever was or ever would be. Quite simply this reflects a Protestant version of the \"Lord's Prayer\" in which the phrase goes, \"Thine is the power and the glory, for ever and ever without end.\" Which brings me full circle back to Rene DesCartes.DesCartes, in choosing the word \"Cogito\", has not gone back to the \"assume nothing\" that he thinks he has done. He has gone back to a level in which he assumes that he is an individual person, separate from all other persons, separate from all other things and separate, in particular, from god (not a good thing for a religious scholar, I would think).  And further he assumes that such an individuated being can, in fact, hold a thought, or have a thought. Really, I am pretty sure that a flatworm is not me, and I am not a flatworm (or rather not entirely a flatworm) but does a flatworm have \"thoughts\"?  And if it does not, then why would you assume that you have thoughts, Rene? And separate from \"God\", Rene? Really, even though you believe your \"God\" to be omnipresent. Omnipresent means \"everywhere\".  Everywhere, really? Everywhere? Including inside you? Isn't that \"part of everywhere\"? Then how can you know that your thought is your own, and not just part of \"God's thoughts\"?Now let's just take the religious bias out of this thought process. How do you know, Rene, that your thoughts are not just a partition of a very large mind that has constructed the entire universe as an illusion for you to contemplate. It is put together using a particular set of rules which must be obeyed (laws of physics and mathematics, botany and chemistry, etc.) but that meanwhile other \"partitions\" of the same mind are under the illusion that they too are independent beings with free will and self-determination, when they, too, are just observers of a set of possible future conditions for a \"playroom\" this great mind may or may not construct out of some actual substance that it has not yet invented.And let's look at the choice of Latin (instead of French in your case) as a choice of language in which to communicate your thoughts. Does the meaning of the first person singular form of the verb \"sum\" have the same shade of connotation that you wish to convey? Is what the originators of the Latin language meant by \"exist\" the same as what you mean? After all, there was no first person singular for Moses until he heard it in the mountains.  And the meaning of those four written consonants is so widely disputed that although religious Jews are not premitted to write or even say the name of their god, often substituting the term, \"ha shem\" or \"shema\" or \"shma\" (a word that means, \"the name\"), but then they also use the word \"Adonai\" (or \"Adoni\") since they are not allowed to say \"God's name\" and yet, alternative interpretations of the tetragrammaton claim that the four written letters representing \"God's\" name translate into the Hebrew letters that would spell out, \"Adonay\" (pronounced \"A doh nye\" [where \"nye\" rhymes with \"bye\" or \"buy\"]). Specifically, (again quoting from the Wikipedia article on the tetragrammaton) the letters, aleph, hataf patah, daleth, holem, nun, kametz, yod. These that spell out Adonay. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton if you want to see the actual Hebrew letters, side-by-side with the Hebrew letters that form the same shapes (roughly) but spell out Jehovah (yod, simple shewa, heh, holem, waw, kametz, heh). And remember, Rene, that there was no first person singular for the verb \"to be\" in Hebrew, are you sure that \"sum\" is what you mean in Latin, or is it closer to, \"Je pense, donc je suis!\" Perhaps that isn't one of the truly great philosophical arguments. It is, to me because I see it as a challenge to DesCartes while it is also an \"enigma, wrapped in a mystery, and shrouded in the fog of ancient history.\" I also find it fascinating that according to the account of Moses and the ten commandments, the god of the Christians, the Jews and the Muslims (all the same god, according to all of them) has the name, \"I am\". Or at least that's what Moses claims his god told him. Who am I to call Moses a liar?  Well, not today anyway. Sincerely,Stafford \"Doc\" Williamson ",

            "answer_text": "There are three branches of philosophy. It will be a chore to indulge your thoughts with peripheral and extraneous nonsense. Can you be more precise about what you are wanting? I sometimes sign off my commentary with the following bit of advice. I hope the readers will take it as a kind gesture, and of my hope for humankind. If one values truth and honor in one\u2019s life, then no one should accept any religious or spiritual doctrine as a guide for that life. Be a skeptic. Question everything in your life and what you think you know. Use the bywords of Honor, Truth, Reason, and Logic in your life and you will be much happier and more fulfilled for doing so.
