            "answer_text": "I don't think that an eye for an eye is just , not even in the case of murder. Everybody has the same chance in life of becoming a murderer in any given instance. It\u2019s just a matter of bad luck that causes some men to do ghastly things like murdering their wives and children. Of course, those unfortunate men who do that usually commit suicide afterwards, so they are not even arrested, as they are already dead when the police arrive on the scene. But, generally speaking , human beings are prone to fail in their lives in smaller or greater degrees. There is nobody who is not a potential murderer. There are just people who have been lucky enough to avoid becoming murderers and those people who have been unlucky and have become murderers. It is not right to punish criminals for any crimes that they might have committed. One can only protect the society from criminals by closing them inside safe and comfortable institutions. I don't believe that God allows anybody to judge another person. A human being cannot judge another human being. So, thieves and murderers, and all other sorts of criminals should be housed inside comfortable institutions where they cannot influence the society at all. They must not be punished in any way at all. ",

            "answer_text": "In primitive Judah, this may have seemed just, because revenge had been achieved and a rough and ready punishment exacted. It probably worked well enough in a society that could not imprison felons and manage their sentences and remissions. Of course, \u201cworked well enough\u201d is not the same as justice and certainly does not deal with morality. Today, we would say that to remove one man\u2019s eye because he intentionally removed another man\u2019s eye is neither moral nor just. We would certainly say that to remove a man\u2019s eye because he accidentally removed another man\u2019s eye would be grossly immoral and unjust. So, what about murder? The dead person will get no sense of satisfaction from the death of the alleged perpetrator. So, apart from a fairly meaningless revenge, would justice or morality be served by the execution of the alleged perpetrator? You will guess from my repeated reference to \u201calleged perpetrator\u201d that one concern is if the wrong person is convicted. Morality requires that we never execute a person if it is even remotely possible that there is a miscarriage of justice. And justice can not be served if another innocent person has died because of errors in the prosecution case. Lengthy prison terms are more moral than execution. Prison terms can also be commuted if extenuating circumstances come to light or if the convicted person is subsequently found to be not guilty after all. The person who is in this case the victim of the justice system can never get back the years spent in jail, but can at least live the remainder of life in freedom. ",
