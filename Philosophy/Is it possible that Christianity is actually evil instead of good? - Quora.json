            "answer_text": "The problem dosnt necessarily come with the whole concept of Christianity, but with the fact that not everyone who professes to be Christian is necessarily in any kind of relationship with the God of the Bible. hat sounds absurd, because after all.. Why else would one go to a church after all. \u2026 WHY???? The true truth though is that not every person who goes to a church is actually born again and so are not in relationship with God, Who is Spirit, and cannot be reached purely by intellect or the reciting of incantations. (religious experiences) so that just because you go to a church dosnt make you a Christian, but Christians go to church because they have a relationship with Jesus Christ. and so although they may be used to attending a church on a Sunday and enjoy all the artwork, and singing hymns, and may even feel uplifted by the sermon, all it will ever be is a very peripheral religious experience, unless Romans 10:9-10./John 3:3ff. We cannot dispense with the governing truth of the Word of God as said by Jesus\u2026 \u201c I AM THE WAY THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE. NO MAN COMETH TO THE FATHER BUT BY ME\u201d So that in the absence of following Christ's instructions (John 3:3ff) \u201c you must be born again\u201d it is only a strangely eerie somewhat spurutualisti querky expetiencec with a Person you do not know in a virtual world of spiritual unreality. So that instead people try to relate to this anomilie through ritualism, and keeping all the \u201claws\u201d, like the Pharisees, who rigidly folliwed the letter of the law as bring redemptive, and doing good works, thinking that they could earn their way to salvation. It is often here where the problem lies, in that the Word of God is not only applied by religious men who have no Romans 10:9\u201310 relationship to God and ignore the commandment to love one another as Christ lived the church, and change or slightly adapt the Word to suit their own principles or philosophies and politucal or church ambitions, basically putting other words into the mouth of the Word of God. Thus is hugely condemned as in speaking of the Book of Revelations 22:18-19 especially, \u201c I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them God will add to him the plagues described in this book.. and if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book. So that I would imagine the same pretty much goes for the Word of Christ, as the Word of God and then the Apostle of Christ.. So that throughout history men have tried to redesign and realign the Word to suit their own agendas (even edititing out certain parts and denying the truth thereof)\u2026nitvrealusing that what they have done is not sanctioned by God but will never pass go with God, and all it makes of them is deniers of the Word and rejecters of the Truth. So I would say that the religious mess that is often what we see and experience and that makes us question the validity of Christianity is the direct resut of the fact that man may try to exist adjacent to God, whilst having no true relationship with God and carries with him his poor witness in which we see very little evidence of either love or compassion, but rather selfishness but cmplety forgotting that God is love and that we are told that he who has not love hath not God, and that if God is not your Father, then the devil is your father\u2026and it is then the devil\u2019s evil works you will do because every tree produces fruit of its own kind. Unless ANY person and EVERY person-likewise repents and personally receives Jesus Christ as their Lord and Saviour, confessing Him with their mouth before men (Romans 10:9-10) they will remain sinners, separated from God, not because they sin, but because they are born with the sin nature of Adam. . And sinners sin and continue to this day to oppose the Word of God. Even Jesus, the spotless sinless Son of God who lived amongst men as a man and yet never sinned, said\u2026 \u201c why do you call me good?? Only God is good\u201d but here's the problem.. Man has wilfully decided to ignore the very first Commandment that they should have no other God, so do not put God first, and forget altogether about the Holiness of God\u2026and instead substitute the Word with the philosophies of men.. which cannot pruduce Godly fruit. It's this effect that we see in the world around us\u2026the full effect of the sin nature of mankind\u2026\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Yea, it is. The whole concept of morality in Christianity is evil. Christianity tells you to sacrifice for others. Why? Take the shirt off your back and give it to a beggar. Why? So that you can be a slave to anybody you meet? So that your life is simply to be a servant? That\u2019s not right, that is evil. You should live for yourself, make yourself happy first. Rationally. If you do it rationally then you will want your neighbor to do good in life, and you can help someone in need of it doesn\u2019t infringe on your own goals. But only if it makes sense in relation to your own life. Never sacrifice. I can\u2019t explain it very well because I\u2019m not much of an orator. But google \u201cobjectivism\u201d. It\u2019s the only philosophy that promotes human life. ",
