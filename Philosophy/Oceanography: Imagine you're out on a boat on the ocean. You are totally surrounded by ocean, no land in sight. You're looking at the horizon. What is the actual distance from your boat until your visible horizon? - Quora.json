            "answer_text": "Geometry tells us it is the square root of (2* earth's radius*height of your eye + height of your eye squared)  This gives a distance to the horizon on smooth surface of just about 5 km if your eye is 2 meters above the water. The distance is proportional to the square root of the height so if you were 8 meters off the surface you could see twice as far - 10km. If the object you are looking at is the same height as you, you would double that.  This may not seem to match your experience. And much of that reason has to do with refraction which is also somewhat dependent on temperature (mirages being an extreme example)  ",
