Merely eating \u201csomething\u201d if they were literally on death\u2019s door would not be enough to stop the downward spiral. The body, in all likelihood, would not be able to process the solid food. It would take hospitalization with lots of fluids and a gradual training of the body how to eat again- if they weren\u2019t too far gone. Age and fitness level would definitely come into play in this scenario. ",

Your stomach won\u2019t produce enough acid to dissolve the food, your guts won\u2019t let through enough nutrients, and besides the quantity you can swallow while you are dying is ridiculously small compared to the needs of your body.
