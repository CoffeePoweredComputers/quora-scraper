            "answer_text": "Actually I bet kind of. Aliens would have the concept of nouns and verbs. A thing is a thing, no an action. I suspect this may be universal thing that sentient beings figure out and reason about. Aliens would also have the concept of math. Numbers that you can do stuff on. I suspect they\u2019ll also have the concept of math functions, because you want to talk about operations compactly. It\u2019s not a far leap from nouns and verbs to get Object Orienteed programming. It\u2019s not a far leap from math to get functional programming. Logic programming may be a unique thing; declarative programming well maybe. We have binary and quantum computing tech; and very fast simulatious graphics cards thst we do our AI in. I suspect, if aliens can debug the simulation at all, it would fall into one of these 5 categories. If it\u2019s an ML type environment like we have today with TensorFlos but 1M years advanced\u2026 I bet their biological entities can\u2019t understand why their model did something odd, like sometimes we can\u2019t explain why our model did something odd (see \u201cOh turns out Amazon\u2019s magic new hiring algorithm is bias against women\u2026.. \u2026. because we didn\u2019t feed it that many successful female candidates. Right. Oops.\u201d). So maybe. it won\u2019t be written in Java, or have English variable names, and maybe not even in text, but if you dig down it, I suspect, will be something like what humans would create because entities start at the same place: numbers, math, needing to give names to different types of things.

In most of the simulations I\u2019ve been involved in, we simulated accurately at macro scale, but when we got down to really detailed transactions we were prone to say, \u201cOh screw it - let\u2019s just assume it\u2019s a linear function.\u201d Sometimes we got away with it and sometimes it messed up the answer something awful. Hey, it just occurred to me - I wonder if quantum weirdness is just the same laziness on the part of the cosmic simulation engineer?  Credit: Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal ",
