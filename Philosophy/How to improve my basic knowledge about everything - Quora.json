            "answer_text": "I like to think of knowing many things as of the magical glasses \u2013 the more you know, the more you can see. And as the old maxim goes, \u201cBeing stuck in one field of specialty is nothing short of being blindfolded. You can go throughout life without being able to spot all those enchanting intricacies coming from the expanded perspective.\u201d It couldn\u2019t be any more accurate. Of course, we don\u2019t have to know everything. But will it hurt to learn just a little bit from many areas of knowledge? Were we created to be stuck in one groove all of our lives? The most important logical foundations which will allow you to build a wide array of skills is reading (and not just one but a variety of topics)!!! Reading is how we discover and invent new things. Books, magazines and even the Internet are great learning tools which require the ability to read and understand what is read. A person who knows how to read can educate themselves in any area of life they are interested in. We live in an age where we overflow with information, but reading is the main way to take advantage of it. And that's why the old saying goes, \"The pen is mightier than the sword.\" Ideas written down have changed the destiny of men and nations for better or worse. The flow of ideas cannot be stopped. We need to read and research to build on the good ideas and expose the bad ideas before they bring destruction. Only by reading can we be armed in this never-ending, life-and-death struggle. But the most important reason to read in order to improve your general knowledge is that it develops imagination. TV and computer games have their place, but they are more likely amusement which is a non-thinking activities. With reading, a person can go anywhere in the world...or even out of it! They can be a king, or an adventurer, or a princess, or... The possibilities are endless. Non-readers never experience these joys to the same extent.  ",

            "answer_text": "First, why do you want to improve your \u201cbasic knowledge\u201d about everything? How do you think is it going to add to your life? Do you think it will improve your personality, make you a better talker, make you smarter, or do you just want to improve your general knowledge - what exactly do you hope to gain from it? Being knowledgeable is a good thing. But you cannot be knowledgeable about everything and there\u2019s no need for it either. If your aim is to improve your personality or simplify your life, start with things that are most pertinent to you on a day-to-day basis. I don\u2019t know what you do, but all of us either study, go to work, or have certain interests. So start from there. Read books and/or sign up for blogs that relate to your areas of interest.Set up RSS feeds on your phone (Flipboard, Feedly, Appy Geek are good apps for that).Find people you could talk to about your interests. This is vital. You need to expose your views to a broader audience to expand/deepen your own understanding. If you cannot find anyone in real life that can hold such conversations with you, find relevant online forums for the purpose.But remember to start small and remain specific in your quest to improve your basic knowledge. Make a list of things that, if you were to know more about them, would actually enhance your life. Potential subjects could include technology, health and nutrition, the DIY field, or even how to bargain, etc. And as your understanding of these things improves, move on to other topics. But never forget to ask this most important question to yourself \u2014 why do I want to know more about this? Because there is no dearth of topics and subjects in the world, but unfortunately our time on this planet is extremely limited. So use it purposefully. Hope this helps. ",
