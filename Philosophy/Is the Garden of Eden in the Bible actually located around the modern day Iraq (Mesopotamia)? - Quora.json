            "answer_text": "The only thing the Bible tells us concerning the Garden of Eden\u2019s location is found in Genesis 2:10-14, \u201cA river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold\u2026The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Asshur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\u201d The exact identities of the Pishon and Gihon Rivers are unknown, but the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers are well known. If the Tigris and Euphrates mentioned are the same rivers by those names today, that would put the Garden of Eden somewhere in the Middle East, likely in Iraq. However, even a small local flood can change the course of a river, and the Flood of Noah\u2019s day was more than a localized flood. The Deluge completely changed the topography of the earth. Because of this, the original location of the Tigris and Euphrates is uncertain. It could be that the modern rivers called the Tigris and Euphrates are simply named after those associated with Eden, in the same way that Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, is named after the town in Judea. If the Middle East region is where the Garden of Eden was, and if crude oil is, as most scientists believe, primarily decayed vegetation and animal matter, then it stands to reason that the Middle East is where we would find the greatest oil deposits. Many people speculate that the vast stores of oil in the Middle East are the result of the decomposition of Earth\u2019s lushest organic materials in the Garden of Eden. While the oil in the Middle East could be the dregs of Eden, but those who promote such ideas are simply theorizing. People have searched for the Garden of Eden for centuries to no avail. There are various spots claimed as the original location of Eden, but no one can be sure. What happened to the Garden of Eden? The Bible does not specifically say. It is likely that the Garden was completely destroyed in the Flood. What is the location of the Garden of Eden? ",

            "answer_text": "The Genesis account, refers to a river which flowed through the Garden and divided into the head waters of four rivers, two of which, are still identifiable today. They point to a location about 140 miles SW of Mt Ararat in South Eastern Turkey just south of Lake Van. Genesis 2:10-14 NWT \u2014 Now there was a river flowing out of E\u02b9den to water the garden, and from there it divided into four rivers. The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Havilah,..... The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one encircling the entire land of Cush. The name of the third river is Hiddekel; it is the one going to the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.  ",
