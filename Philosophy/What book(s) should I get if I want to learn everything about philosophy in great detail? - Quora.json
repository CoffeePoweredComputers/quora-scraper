            "answer_text": "You should first start with the foundations of philosophy and great books for that include A History of \u2018Western Philosophy\u2019 by Bertrand Russel and \u2018The Story of Philosophy\u2019 by Will Durant. I would also recommend the three volumes of Anthony Kenny\u2019s \u2018A New History of Western Philosophy\u2019. Then you should choose a particular area of philosophy and excel at it. It is extremely difficult to learn everything about philosophy in great detail. And even if you somehow can, you can\u2019t do it by studying every field (epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics etc) at once. Hence, find one field that interests you and advance in it. The two books mentioned might give you some insight on the areas of philosophy but I would also recommend recommend reading Plato and Aristotle as they are the fathers of western philosophy and have covered multifarious topics in their lifetimes.

            "answer_text": "There is more than buying books that would be required. People have been writing books on philosophy for the past 2500 years or so and they keep on writing more every year. If you want to know all about it in great detail then you should quit your job, leave your family, and spend the rest of your life reading all of those books and discussing them. The idea that you could just read one really good book (or a few) and learn philosophy in great detail is a wrong premise. ",
