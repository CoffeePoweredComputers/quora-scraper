            "answer_text": "Clearly explaining \"if/then\" situations might help. You\u2019ll have to constantly point out that if he does X, then Y or Z are the possible outcomes. There\u2019s no way to know which until it happens. But, if he chooses to do X, he can\u2019t be surprised about either outcome, and no one else can take the credit or the blame. It\u2019s all his. I think I might also point out that when the outcome of his decisions is good, why does he take credit instead of giving it to someone else? The outcome, positive or negative, doesn\u2019t change who\u2019s responsible for making the decision. All of it, good or bad, falls on the decision maker. Maybe he\u2019s been sharply criticized when things turn out badly, or has been told \"I told you so\", so rejects assuming responsibility to avoid a lecture or being chastised. When faced with a decision, point out the possible outcomes, or have him name them, but make no recriminations if things don\u2019t turn out well. Help him think it through, then be quiet about the matter. The only thing I used to say to my son was, \"Well, that\u2019s a shame; but, have you learned anything? That\u2019s what\u2019s important.\" I didn\u2019t rush to remedy the situation for him, either. His decision - his consequence or reward. He\u2019s the one who ends up enjoying it or suffering from it. We have to teach personal responsibility. It doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. ",

Right now I'm still trying to live through it\u2026. I listen to a lot of podcast but haven't come across one solely in this area yet. I'm sure there is one out there at least one\u2026. Lol Anyway, what I'm doing is simply , saying that's sad or whatever fits\u2026\u2026 . and saying but what is your part? What can we work on to change next time? If he doesnt know I ask questions such as did you do _______. I always ask what is it you could do next time to not repeat the same mistake/ thing/ circumstances etc\u2026 I also remind him that ever since Adam and Eve people have been pointing fingers and blame elsewhere - even if there is truth to it being someone else who started it\u2026 We must realize we had a choice and for that we have to take responsibility \u2026for we won't ever get to a better place if we don't seek to know our part and make a better choice next time. If possible I also share a time when I messed up and blamed things on someone else and what my outcome was (ie. I was 2 years older than my brother and he wanted to go hang out with our cousins and I had a friend who lived close- so I walked with him to hang out with my friend, under the pretense that he'd come back for me so we could be back at granny's before mom got home from work\u2026 well as it started getting later and the sunset was approaching- I said I needed to go and walked through the woods looking for the clubhouse where the cousins were but was afraid I'd get lost- so I decided to go home without him\u2026 guess what?? He went home without me\u2026. I got a spanking I'd never forget- but I never did that again!). We both did wrong and both had a part but only one got caught and in trouble, for I did make a choice to go and hang out with a friend and listen to music in her room\u2026 Besides if we blamed the other they could go pick out a switch for our spanking.

Make it clear that the results aren't always going to be ideal, but that specific situations could have had better results. Ask for the *little* changes that could have achieved results that weren't the best, but could have still been realistically at least a bit better than whatever actually happened. In particular, aim for things where the immediate result would have at least been a step closer to the desired goal, rather than the flawed choice that was made which either stopped them in their tracks or pushed them further away from the goal.

If it was important I used to try and construct a time line in my mind or on paper where you can sit with the child- teen and explain what went wrong, how it went wrong , and what lead up to the event. Once they can see what was the cause then you can start explaining the alternative steps that could have been taken at various stages to alter the outcome. All good so far but pretty boring ok use humour, teens response well to embarrassment so I will not call them stupid but I will say you did something stupid I will also try and do it in a funny way so I get the message across but the humour softens the message. So I might sigh and say listen there\u2019s a small town just up road I will see if I can get you in there , they are still looking for a new village idiot. ",
