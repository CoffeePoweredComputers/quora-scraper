            "answer_text": "This is a tricky question. Is life worth living? Is all this worth it? Let's break this the fuck down, step-by-step. IS-ALL-THIS-WORTH-IT? First, what is 'this'? Is 'this' the shitty sitcom called 'life' that you aren't particularly fond of but were forced into and had to watch it because two people wanted you to and signed you up for it without asking you. You're tired of the monotonous episodes but you're into season twenty-something with 365 episodes each season and you've invested enough time and you can't suddenly stop watching, so you go on and on and on. Sure, there are plot twists and anticlimactic turns here and there. A few new characters added every season and a few forgotten. You are eagerly waiting to see what direction the sitcom goes and where it all comes together, but it never does. 'Life' is a badly made sitcom with no meaningful take away. As if the director got drunk or went on an unending vacation, if there actually was a director, ever, I mean. Now that we have that out of the way, is 'this' frigging 'worth it'? What makes something worth it? Remember when you were a kid and you ran an errand for someone like helped watch their dog, or fetched something for someone and were given a few bucks in return? It seemed worth it because a few bucks were all you ever wanted back then. It meant you could stuff your mouth with sugary candy and dance your way back home. Ah, bliss! You did something you were asked to, and were rewarded. You were given a temporary purpose and you got a reward for fulfilling it. This made the purpose worth the effort. You now work in an office. Your boss makes you work and you get a paycheck at the end of the month. A purpose, it's completion and a reward. You're happy. See the pattern? It's not that easy to spot. Look around, even animals and plants follow this purpose-completion-reward cycle. A bird feels hungry, it starts searching for prey. A Purpose. It swoops down from the high skies to grab an unfortunate (or fortunate?) wiggly worm by its arse with a sharp killer beak. Completion. It then eats the fucker up whole and satisfies it's hunger and it's body releases compounds that make it feel good. The Reward. Now, zoom out and try to fit the entire Sitcom into this cycle. Think about it. Doesn't fit? I know. Because I have been trying for so long to squeeze it in. To forcefully fit it in place. Never worked. See, you were born. But for what purpose?. And you will die. Completion?. You will then be slowly forgotten. The reward?. Nothing makes sense if you zoom out enough. It's never going to feel like life is worth living. Because there is nothing at the end waiting for you. No sweet candy, no fat paycheck, and no wiggly worm (I don't know why someone would want the last one but there are weird people in this world so I put it there). There is only non-existence. The same place you came from before being born. So why be born, eh? When you realize this, that existence itself is pointless and a curse of sorts, that we have no purpose, an ache passes through your being. A sensation of extreme melancholy and hopelessness. And from this state arises the question in the title: \"is all this worth it?\" Here's my answer: life is a futile exercise and all those of us who have been born are a result of an accident . A true physical and chemical accident that led to creation of 'life' as we know it. Yes, we are an accident. No big person came from the sky and made us out of thin air. You are a genetic permutation that came to be because your parents had sex and it led to conception. Out of billions of reproductive cells, you are the lucky(or unlucky?) one, it's like winning 100 lotteries in a day. So fucking act like it! Keep that chin up and rub your moist eyes because even though there's no purpose for your being, you can do things which the rest of the dead universe is envious of: YOU CAN LIVE! You can run and jump and slip and fall and roll and get back up and smile. Smile, because life is a pointless joke. Experiment with things you can do when alive because YOU can be alive only once. For a brief moment, you are gifted the power of thought and introspection with which you arrived at your diagnosis of purposelessness. Be proud that you know what the human condition is. For a brief moment you are not boring as most of the dead universe around you. You are LIFE. And YOU are the director. Add a few sex scenes and drama and throw the plot around like rolling dice. You are your master and you've only got one show. Make it Oscar-worthy. We are all gonna die anyway. Yes, we are gonna die anyway, I want you all to live like it! ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes, and for some people, it can feel as if there is no reason for living. Sometimes our feelings of sadness, hurt, fear, hopelessness, emptiness, anxiety, or depression are so strong that it feels as if being dead would be better than alive. I think if most people were honest, they would say they have asked this question of themselves at least once in their life because most if not all of us face some of these powerful emotions at some point. Shakespeare puts the question into the mouth of his character Hamlet when he begins probably the most famous of all monologues with \u201cTo be, or not to be\u2014 that is the question.\u201d Meaning\u2026 is it better to exist or not? And then Hamlet looks at both sides of the question and ultimately settles on living, but for a somewhat despairing reason\u2026 because the unknown beyond life/after death is more terrifying than anything in life. However, I will give you a different answer. Life is worth living because we all need you. Everyone around you. And you need them. We all have something\u2026 at least one thing of value to contribute to others in our lifetime, but this can mean a whole lifetime of giving. When you were quite young you probably did these things all the time freely\u2026 whether it was drawing pictures from your imagination, or listening to music, or walking in the woods, or riding a bike, or telling stories, or organizing your friends for a party, or reading about science. Gradually, life crushes the natural pleasure of these things out of us\u2026 or sadly, some people live in places where they never are exposed to much beauty and life is quite difficult or dangerous for them from an early age. But you probably did have things you once loved this much that made each day worth jumping out of bed for. If you can bring this love and passion to whatever you do, especially in what we call our \u201cwork\u201d or \u201cjob\u201d you will make others happy around you. And this will make you happy. And you can also receive what things they create out of their own love that make you happy as well. Simple examples are teachers who teach out of love and inspire and strengthen their students. A baker that makes bread that smells so sweet it pulls you in from off the street. A musician whose music touches and inspires you. Scientists and inventors who create things to make our lives more pleasurable or help solve real problems in the world like food scarcity or lack of education. Connect (or reconnect) with things that make you happy. Remember old heroes or find new ones to inspire you. Think less about your own internal experience and more about others\u2019. If there are people out there who need you, what can you bring to them out of your own love? What can you do for the world in the same way that your heroes do for you? If you live your whole life like this, you will not regret a moment of it. And we will build the world we very much need\u2026 together. This is a poem by the American writer Edgar Lee Masters I have often been encouraged by, although it may be difficult to grasp at first. Fiddle you must! And for all your life. ",
