            "answer_text": "Epistemology is the study of knowledge, e.g.: what knowledge is, how it is justified, and what we can know and how. Questions in epistemology include e.g.: What constitutes knowledge? The standard answer is: knowledge is justified true belief. Also: what is truth, what is belief?How do we gain (true) knowledge? Is it through perception or in general the senses (empiricism) or is it through reason or in general the intellect (rationalism)?What constitutes justification: perception, testimony, mathematical proof, inferential reasoning, divine insight, intuition\u2026?Are there limits to our knowledge, or is everything in principle knowable? Do we know the reality as it is in itself or only as it appears to us in experience? Can we know ourselves \u2013 can we know only ourselves?Can we know anything at all, at least with certainty? Is there a certain foundation on which to build our knowledge or is all knowledge relative or uncertain?Do we perceive things as they are (direct realism), some kind of sense-data that is directly bound to how things are (indirect realism), or perhaps only mental representations (idealism)?Metaphysics, on the other hand, is a study of what there is or what exists. Because the origin of the word \u201cmetaphysics\u201d is a bit random (see Toni Kannisto's answer to How does the metaphysics relate to classical physics?), it has had several slightly different meanings throughout history. I will mention the two most common ones: The study of the most fundamental or general features of reality and existence, i.e., what constitutes reality. This involves questions like:What is the ultimate substance, of which other things are but accidents? Is it matter, is it spirit, (monism) is it both (dualism), or something else (e.g. neutral monism or pluralism)?Does the world constitute of universals (denoted by general properties, like \u201cred\u201d or \u201chuman\u201d) and particulars (individuals), or only of one or the other \u2013 or perhaps tropes that are kind of like individual universals?What is causality, and is causality deterministic or is there room for free causality?What is consciousness; does such a thing exist and what does it consist in?What are time and space: entities, containers of entities, relations between entities? Does only now exist, or do all times exist? Can we travel in time?The study of certain ultimate entities that transcend ordinary experience (studied by natural sciences), e.g.:God, or the creator of the world \u2013 the first cause, perhaps. Does it exist and what kind of properties does / should it have?Soul, or the inner self. Is there a self that is not made or matter, can it survive death of the body (immortality)? Is personality in the soul or in the body?Other possible worlds in the multiverse, including other planes of existence. Is the actual world the only world, or do alternative realities exist simultaneously to ours? Could we in principle travel between them?Epistemology vs. Metaphysics As you see, epistemology and metaphysics appear to be very different: one deals with us and our capacity to know things, the other deals with those things. Accordingly, throughout most of the history, perhaps, the two have been separated. But at least since Descartes, things have gotten more complicated. Descartes criticised philosophers for attempting to create metaphysical systems before making sure that we have stable foundations for knowledge \u2013 for, after all, it is through knowledge that metaphysicians claim to be able to say how the reality is. This became a kind of epistemological turn in philosophy, where the status of metaphysics as the most fundamental study gave way, at least in part, to epistemology. But Descartes ultimately answered the question he himself posed by presenting indubitable foundations onto which metaphysics could be built, so the two still remained separate \u2013 even if their priority was reversed. Kant, on the other hand, caused a bigger revolution by taking Descartes\u2019s question a step further: it is not just the foundations of knowledge that are important but also the conditions under which we can hope to have knowledge to begin with. He analysed \u2013 epistemologically, as it were \u2013 our own mental capacities and the necessary conditions with which it was possible to know, perceive, experience, or even sense or think anything at all. Through this analysis Kant came to the conclusion that the objective world that we experience and wish to know is not the world as it may be in itself independently of us. Rather, it is that world as it appears, i.e. conforms to the necessary conditions under which it is possible for us to experience it. He makes an analogy to Copernicus: just like Copernicus discovered that the perceived motion of heavenly bodies is a combination of their movement and our own movement (rotation of Earth, going around the Sun), the perceived or experienced objects of the world arise out of a combination of the data that belong to them alone and our way of representing that data (e.g. in space and time). While this may seem like a result in epistemology, it is intertwined with metaphysics, for according to Kant all the fundamental metaphysical concepts like substance or causality are in fact our ways of organising experience \u2013 and are therefore not inherent in the things themselves. Thus it is, in a sense, epistemology that answers the questions of metaphysics (in the first sense explicated above), and indeed Kant used analysis of our cognitive capacities in order to derive metaphysical results about space and time, substance, causality, etc. It would be wrong to say that epistemology has thereby supplanted metaphysics, for equally we can say that what seemed to us like mere epistemological questions are actually metaphysical, i.e. they do not only tell us about our cognitive capacities but also at the same time about the fundamental structure of the world around us. At the same time, by restricting all our possible knowledge to the world of appearances, Kant argued that the objects of metaphysics in the second sense above \u2013 such as God or soul \u2013 are not knowable to us. Thus he rejected, based on epistemological considerations, metaphysics in the second sense (they became a matter of faith rather than objects of knowledge). TL;DR Metaphysics is the study of what exists; epistemology is the study of how we know or gain access to what exists. Although they therefore operate in different domains, they are often bound together or depend on each other. Our analysis of knowledge a) may have to precede our analysis of what exists, or even b) may determine at least in part what actually exists to begin with. ",

            "answer_text": "The difference is broad and fundamental, although obviously there are always points of encounter and inference from one branch to another. Epistemology (understood as gnoseology or theory of knowledge) is the philosophical discourse about the possibility, the modalities and the limits of our knowledge of the external world.In epistemology we wonder how our mind catalogs experience, how it connects it and makes it usable. If it is an inductive, deductive process, if it happens by resemblance or difference, if indeed the ideas to which we connect the objects of our experience are really entirely derived or at least partly innate. Metaphysics (referring primarily to it as defined by Aristotle, or philosophy first) is the investigation of the first principles of all reality. It is the search for non-physical realities that are the cause of physical reality. To date, metaphysics has substantially disappeared or accumulated to theology, to mysticism and very little considered. Nonetheless we can consider partially metaphysical branches of philosophy that do not focus on concrete realities, such as ethics and politics, or even tangible realities that fall within the field of science. Therefore, we can approach logic, the Philosophy of Language, to metaphysics. , the Philosophy of Mind. In these points we find meetings between epistemology and metaphysics.In my native language, Italian, epistemology is not synonymous of gnoseology but rather of Philosophy of Science. This helps us to understand that at some point we are having to account for how we come into contact with the outside world and how we make a representation for ourselves. This problem involved many logicians, including Russell, Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle.But the problem arises long before course. Even the clash between the Sophists and Socrates was based precisely on the possibility for the human being to know what is wanted truth. The sophists claimed that man was a measure of the world and there was no truth that was certain, knowable and transmissible. Socrates challenged that one could reach the truth by knowing the essences, or the universals of things.From the position of Socrates, his disciple Plato developed the concept of Reminescence, meaning nothing is known for simple experience but is actually known because ideas already exist in people's minds and are connected to the objects we encounter. It may seem an absolutely ancient position but in reality it is still widespread even among well-known thinkers, including for example Jerry Fodor, of whom I always remember the beautiful maxim \"the concept of carburettor is innate\".
