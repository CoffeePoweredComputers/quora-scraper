            "answer_text": "Absolutely. More worry doesn't mean more results. Its actually the reverse. You must know that there is a problem. FULL STOP. How to deal with it should be going on, but lingering to many options is not a good exercise. First face the problem, take some time to think over it, come to a solution fast and do away with it. If its something that you cannot do much about , then try forgetting about it, it shall help in this manner. ",

We cannot stop worrying thats true, but have a control over it by reacting not by just thinking . ",
