            "answer_text": "No. That's not how the world changes. Professors are \"teachers\" and \"observers\", not \"doers\" of things. The job of intellectuals is to observe things, analyze what they observe, and describe that in a systematic way. Furthermore, it's not a matter of getting all these smart people together to solve problems. That's not the issue. In fact, they already do basically \"come together\" on all sorts of \"projects\". Scientists and other academicians get together for conferences all the time, as well as publish papers for peer review, collaborate on research, etc.  The inability of the world to solve our social problems isn't due to the logistics of getting professors and other smart people together.
