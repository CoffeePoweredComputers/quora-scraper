            "answer_text": "What a charming answer to your own question: it is precisely the same one I asked myself in my High School physics class. My answer was to write in my notebook: \"There are no infinities or infinitesimals in the Universe\". The argument will have occurred to you: since the answer to your question is 'yes', then by reductio-ad-absurdum, the Universe cannot be infinite. Now there is a lot of debate now among my colleagues, especially in cosmology (not my major field), who argue that since the universe is accelerating and there are places in it that we can no longer see or visit because to do so we would have to go faster than lightspeed (visually or physically) and that is not possible (on the modern physics laws that they agree apply). But they have missed your point and mine. To have an infinite universe, we would have to abandon the Big Bang, and allow an infinite past for our universe. These issues are as clear (to me and many if not all) based on fundamental logic plus speed of light and Big Bang origin being the only provisos. We can rely on the universe being finite even if there are now regions in it that we cannot observe or reach. The opponents like to force a distinction between the observable and non-observable parts of the universe, and then say, \"The latter is infinite, so you are wrong Dr Muller.\" That has occurred in these very pages on Quora. Indeed, the questioning of my understanding attracted some amusingly strong and emphatic adjectives! But, given the Big Bang origin, and finite speed of light, THEN I will happily stand on the ground of a finite universe despite the fact that some of it might now be beyond observabilty or no longer within physical reach. We don't actually need the answer, or the reductio. The fact that it started from a localized volume, and has been expanding for only a measurable finite time, it must still be finite. There isn't room in a finite universe for an infinite number of Hydrogen atoms etc. Your question is a very deep one indeed. Thanks for asking it. Keep thinking. You know how to do it! ",

Consider a nonce-universe that had an infinite volume.     In this make-believe universe, there would be no upper limit on the sizes of  objects.  No matter how many objects our nonce-universe contained, and no matter how big those objects were, there would always be room for a bigger one.    The greater the volume of any given object in this universe, the greater number of features it could have.   I'm assuming that objects in this universe are made of something like atoms and that there is a lower limit to the sizes of objects that can have differing features.  From these first two notions, we could say with confidence that there would be no upper limit to the number of configurations of features that would respectively define all the objects.    So every object in this nonce universe *could be* unique, although this would not necessarily be the case.  Whether or how this little thought experiment might apply to the real world, I leave to better thinkers.   :-) ",

Answering \u201cNo, because the universe is not infinite\u201d is dishonestly and cowardly eluding the question. I can understand people to be confused about infinities, and ask this very same question over and over again. After all, it\u2019s not an easy concept to grasp, and on the other hand, there is no such thing as a a stupid question. What I can\u2019t believe is that some would have the nerve to answer yes. Regardless of how many PhD\u2019s they have. Despite that, for that matter. The number of things (galaxies, stars, planets, people, yourselves, etc.) in an infinite universe is infinite as in first degree infinity, while the number of possible things (galaxies, stars, planets, people, yourselves, etc.) is infinite of the second order infinity. Look up cardinality of infinities if you like math. Bottom line: the number of possible things ([math]\\aleph_1[/math]) minus the number of things ([math]\\aleph_0[/math]) is infinite, therefore, the probability of finding two identical things is 1 divided by infinity = 0. A zero probability means an impossibility. ",

There are infinitely many combinations of masses and orbits. So there is no reason to believe that any solar system like ours exists anywhere else. Even less so when you consider the masses and orbits of the moons and rings around these planets. And far less so when you add in all of the comets and asteroids. Considering just the earth itself, there are infinitely many ways that the chemical elements and compounds could be distributed in an earth-sized planet, that water could be distributed, or that heat could be distributed. Even for a single element, say carbon, there are infinitely many ways its 15 known isotopes could be distributed. So it is unlikely that any planet anywhere matches earth in the size and shapes of its continents, in its tectonic movements, or in its internal structure. There is absolutely zero chance that any other planet could have evolved humans. ",

But to have 100% identical planet like earth, then it must appeared and exist in same conditions: identical solar system with same age, same amount of molecules etc. To have a 100% copy of solar system we also need same galaxy so temperature, speeds etc are the same. and so on ..

If you consider a volume of space (let\u2019s say a \u201ccubic parsec\u201d) - there are a finite number of particles within that volume\u2026there are a finite number of positions and momentums they can have. If there are an infinite number of cubic parsecs, then it\u2019s not possible for them all to be different\u2026hence, it seems like there would have to be exact duplicates of them. That said, it could be possible that our cubic parsec is unique within all of the universe - but that just doesn\u2019t seem reasonable. So yes, in my opinion, if the universe is infinite, then there are an infinite numbers of you and I - and probably in enormous numbers of close variations - and at different stages of our lives. One thing is clear though - those duplicates will be far, far from the visible universe - beyond anything we can ever detect or interact with\u2026so in a sense it doesn\u2019t matter that they exist.

It seem there's vast of things that destroy each other and the gravity is strong to disallow for a things to build in unique ways.  Chance for like a perfect balance with no disturbance may well give chance to build small things little by little all by itself into a unique form. Earth is one example, that we exist due to questionable factors that we half know and don't know what made us.

It's about there being an infinite replicas of everything, even ourselves, given a finite universe and infinite time. The observable universe is not infinite, and it has finite mass. It's infinite in the sense that expansion will continue forever and will not be contained in a finite volume. It means the universe does not meet the (philosophical) conditions for eternal recurrence, so there are no infinite replicas of everything. ",
