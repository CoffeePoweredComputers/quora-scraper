            "answer_text": "I suggest you break the truth to your parents gently and privately, and decide before hand what your expectations are. Do you expect them to help you? Is there a risk that they will blame you for \u201cbad decisions\u201d, regardless of reality? Are you in a mental space where you can accept help, sometimes more challenging, suggestions or advice? If it\u2019s just a question of clearing up misunderstandings and being honest, then say that first, before you level with them. In general, parents hurt when their child suffers, and it\u2019s hard for us to resist the urge to jump in and fix everything- even when we really can\u2019t. Or you may not want them to. If you DO accept financial help, INSIST on writing down how much they are giving OR lending you. Define it: gift or loan? What are the conditions? When will you start paying it back? They may resist doing this but explain it\u2019ll make you feel better- your pride requires it. Everyone signs, dates it, everyone gets a copy. if your situation changes, revisit this. As you would with a bank, ask to repay more slowly BUT REPAY. Listen, unless you\u2019re in an abusive situation your parents love you and want only good things for you. Thoughtfully, gently open up. It\u2019ll work out. Amy ",
