            "answer_text": "In philosophy, what is existentialism? Ho lee SHIT. I AM an existentialist! THANKS. Thanks, questioner! Huh. I\u2019ve read a ton of these guys (mostly, guys) over the years and felt little enough affinity with them. Plenty of good points made! But mostly obvious points, with an often histrionic emphasis put on them. A lot of \u201cOk. So?\u201d But suddenly along comes this question, and I like to help out where I can. Feeling I\u2019ve more than a passing familiarity, just so as not to blunder fundamentally and look a FOOL, I pop over to my default search engine to brush up what they think it is. And this is what pops up: existentialism. n. a philosophical theory or approach which emphasizes the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of the will. Courtesy of - wait. Not Google this time, Bing. Huh, maybe I should use Bing for snap definition lookups going forward? That\u2019s a clear, precise definition! And while such wasn\u2019t the point or the goal, it\u2019s also me to a \u201cT\u201d! Turns out I pretty much pitch the TENT in existentialism. Anyhow, this little snippet of wikipedium captures more of the flavor I associate with the trend: \u201cIn the view of the existentialist, the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called \u2018the existential attitude,\u2019 or a sense of disorientation, confusion, or dread in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world.\u201d Yeah. They do go on about it. The famous \u201cexistential dread.\u201d So I\u2019d be an atypical existentialist, in that my starting point is characterized by a sense of delight, wonder and mischief in the face of an apparently meaningless and absurd world. Different strokes! Those two snatches encapsulate existentialism\u2019s thrust and mode well enough. There are all different currents within existentialism that emphasize different aspects of the problem. So often in life it\u2019s easier to get lost in the points of contention, and overlook the fundamental similarities shared between. For many, the most important fact is the will, in an ongoing act of self-creation (I\u2019d buy that) (hell, I\u2019d sell it!), and the meaninglessness is just a backdrop against which this pageant plays out. For others, the meaninglessness is the inescapable, often overwhelming fact. But they are not to be confused with nihilists! Existentialists rarely dismiss morality or one\u2019s own self-created meaning. To them, that\u2019s the point! Nihilists do this all day. To them, that\u2019s the point. Or as close to a point as they get: one mighty antipoint, puncturing the balloons of illusory points in a cosmic birthday party of pointlessness where they have their cake and deny its significance, too. In a nutshell, to sum up (your question): existentialists are those who look around at the world and see that tradition and culture have imposed many abstract, arbitrary, contradictory and alien values and narratives on human being and human interaction. Alien because divorced from human nature, far removed from human experience. Their response is to focus on the authentic lived experience of the thinking, feeling human being. The challenge they see is to define one\u2019s self, create one\u2019s purpose and find meaning that can satisfy our evident (and possibly absurd) need for it. An existentialist might pose it thus: \u201cGiven existence, what are we and what do we make of it?\u201d I am one. I\u2019m an existentialist! Who knew? Hot dog! I\u2019d probably pose it more thus: \u201cGiven existence, who are we, and what shall we do? Who the hell are you? What\u2019s that thing over there?\u201d I doubt I\u2019ll ever make a respectable existentialist, but there it is. It\u2019s better to know than to not. ",

            "answer_text": "Have you been experiencing any of the following symptoms: feeling that life is meaningless? a sense of spiritual isolation? feeling that no matter what you do or choice you make, it makes no difference? questioning the purpose of your life? feeling that nothing is worth doing? If so, you may be experiencing an existential crisis. Existentialist philosophy may help. An existential crisis is often provoked by a significant event in the person's life\u2014psychological trauma, marriage, separation, major loss, the death of a loved one, a life-threatening experience, a new love partner, psychoactive drug use, adult children leaving home, reaching a personally significant age (turning 16, turning 40, etc.), etc. Usually, it provokes the sufferer's introspection about personal mortality, thus revealing the psychological repression of said awareness. An existential crisis may resemble anomie (a personal condition resulting from a lack of norms) or a midlife crisis. An existential crisis may stem from one's new perception of life and existence. Analogously, existentialism posits that a person can and does define the meaning and purpose of his or her life, and therefore must choose to resolve the crisis of existence. In existentialist philosophy, the term 'existential crisis' specifically relates to the crisis of the individual when they realize that they must always define their own lives through the choices they make. The existential crisis occurs when one recognizes that even the decision to either refrain from action or withhold assent to a particular choice is, in itself, a choice. In other words, humankind is \"condemned\" to freedom. Peter Wessel Zapffe, a Norwegian philosopher and adherent of nihilism and antinatalism, asserted in his book, The Last Messiah, four ways that he believed all self-conscious beings use in order to cope with their apprehension of indifference and absurdity in existence, comprising \"anchoring\", \"isolation\", \"distraction\", and \"sublimation\": Anchoring is the \"fixation of points within, or construction of walls around, the liquid fray of consciousness\". The anchoring mechanism provides individuals with a value or an ideal that allows them to focus their attentions in a consistent manner. Zapffe also applied the anchoring principle to society, and stated \"God, the Church, the State, morality, fate, the laws of life, the people, the future\" are all examples of collective primary anchoring firmaments. Isolation is \"a fully arbitrary dismissal from consciousness of all disturbing and destructive thought and feeling\". Distraction occurs when \"one limits attention to the critical bounds by constantly enthralling it with impressions\". Distraction focuses all of one's energy on a task or idea to prevent the mind from turning in on itself. Sublimation is the refocusing of energy away from negative outlets, toward positive ones. Individuals distance themselves and look at their existence from an aesthetic point of view (e.g., writers, poets, painters). Zapffe himself pointed out that his written works were the product of sublimation.

Consult your general practitioner or psychotherapist. Remember, only you can determine the meaning and purpose of your life, but a compassionate therapist can provide emotional support and psychological insight. ",
