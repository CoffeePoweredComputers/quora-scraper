            "answer_text": "What's the between the lines message in your Question? Any religion says to respect elders and sacred things and places. What is the difference between what islam says and what christianity? Both teach but not telling you it is up to you how you act on that knowledge.Muhammed would not be offended by any criticism. Nor would Allah. But Allah and Muhammed are heart broken and very saddened by the fact that one gets to Act in Their name to comitt crime against Their Children. You can not justifie tears and fear off the little children caused by recent action. Men's ego is the  one that was offended because no Allah dwells in it. There is no position no law that allows a Men to decided the Allah will. Only the one who is AFRAID to admit it is on Sin acts offended. But being offended is to be in dineil of truth. No Allah dwells in Men who dines his sins. The Gentile is the one who is offended and who acts in personal interest but justifies his wrong doings by claiming that he did it in the name of Allah. There is no justice  in affliction. Nor there is love or peace or happiness. No picture of Muhammed or a drawing  is allowed for a reason that when He comes again your brain will listen  first and not judge by what it sees. Because when  you have an image of the Issa in your mind you might get confused. But no where it says that you should go kill if one did draw a picture. Because what others choose it is not up to you to judge but Allah. Muslims and Christians are waiting for the Messiah. Christians will denied their Messiah again and again but Muslims true belives will not judge but listen and look for the Signs and they will No The One has come and See Messiah in Him. How can  you see Him if you are so afraid of the Picture one draw. How would you see if He comes and Says I am Muhammed the Son of Ali, I am the 8th and the 1. I am the only one but the One you only need. How can you act in His name an voice yourself by making others fear Allah and Fear Their Children. If you are not waiting for Messiah you don't know Him so don't Act in His name. Respect is earned through slefness and respect and love not through  fear or force. You can't force one to love or care. If you answer to do disrespect with disrespect you are  the same not a true beliver. And the louder you yell that you are  right and some one was wrong the future and further you separate yourself from Allah. No forgiveness to a Man who made a child cry in the name of personal offence. Or one thinks that Allah is not real and can't take care of himself? Who said He needs you to rule Judgement. What men have the right  to hate in the name of Allah? Or God no matter what Thy name it sounds in your part of the World. How do you know what Allah likes or don't if you are not looking for him? If you are waiting for Messiah then if you see some one says He is the one and see the picture it will not matter how he looks. Because pictures are deciving some times and just a picture mean nothing .The Word of the One and His Message that he Brings that what defines Him to be the One. What offence is there in a drawing. Who said Muhammed can't handle a drawing that he would get so Mad to Kill one? Would you kill your Child if he makes a cartoon with you? Tell me will you be offended if your Child draws you with big head or not in the right color? Tell me WHAT WOULD OFFEND YOU SO BAD THAT YOU WOULD KILL YOUR CHILD AND HIS CHILDREN for that?  How would making some one who is your family suffer would make you feel just and at peace. What are You afraid of? Admitting that Muhammed was a Man? Or that He was not LIKE YOU? ",

            "answer_text": "The typical response from Muslims in my local mosque to the Hebdo attacks was \"Oooh it was wrong and bad. SO wrong and bad! ... But \u2014\" and it goes downhill from there. There's always a but. If you believe in the Hadith, there is no such thing as free speech, and certainly not with respect to insulting Muhammad. Non-Muslims are not exempt from this. There are Hadiths where Muhammad orders the assassination of poets who were writing satirical or otherwise offensive poems about him. I won't quote them here, because some Muslims assert (without proof) that these poets were actually inciting military action against the Muslims, but search for Abu Rafi' or Ka'b ibn Ashraf if you're interested. The Hadith that I will quote to prove my second paragraph is the following, from Abu Dawud 40/11, which Sunni Muslims will of course recognize as one of the six sahih books of Hadith. \"A blind man had a slave-mother who used to abuse the Prophet and  disparage him. He forbade her but she did not stop. He rebuked her but  she did not give up her habit. One night she began to slander the  Prophet and abuse him. So he took a dagger, placed it on her belly,  pressed it, and killed her. A child who came between her legs was  smeared with the blood that was there. When the morning came, the  Prophet was informed about it. He assembled the people and said: I adjure by Allah the man who has done  this action and I adjure him by my right to him that he should stand  up. Jumping over the necks of the people and trembling the man stood up.   He sat before the Prophet and said: Messenger of Allah! I am her  master; she used to abuse you and disparage you. I forbade her, but she  did not stop, and I rebuked her, but she did not abandon her habit. I  have two sons like pearls from her, and she was my companion. Last night  she began to abuse and disparage you. So I took a dagger, put it on her  belly and pressed it till I killed her. Thereupon the Prophet said: Oh be witness, no retaliation is payable for her blood.\" Note that the last sentence means that the murderer got off scot free. Also note that the slave girl was killed without going through any court of law or right of appeal. This is in direct contradiction to what apologetist Muslims will claim about due process being necessary before any Shariah punishment is carried out. So there you have it: freedom of speech Islam style. To explicitly answer the question: Any Muslim who follows the Qur'an and Hadith properly does not believe anybody has the right to offend Muhammad, and further, that lethal recriminations against such people are not blameworthy. Thankfully, most Muslims nowadays recognize that this sort of behaviour is no longer acceptable in today's world, and there are many apologetist Muslims who are trying to remove such Hadith and verses of the Qur'an from consideration. We should promote and encourage such Muslims wherever we can. ",

            "answer_text": "Well the Prophet himself wouldn\u2019t have justified those attacks, I know you\u2019ll laugh at this but most Muslims believe that there is a conspiracy whereby a spate of attacks are taking place in the West supposedly by so called Muslim terrorists to turn the West and Islam into enemies. The pattern is similar-some first time criminals go on a shooting/bombing spree; the attackers are then shot dead by the police so there\u2019s never a chance of a trial in the superior judicial systems in the West and all round there\u2019s no further investigation. The ISIS videos are even more laughable. A so called white Muslim speaking impeccable English explains why its necessary to slaughter a number of people ostensibly lined up in a desert setting wearing usual American prison orange/yellow jump suits with no sweat or sand or dirt on their clean faces and the West buys the anti-Islamic propaganda while the Muslims become as confused as ever. The same people go ahead and bomb the Muslims to extinction in Iraq and Syria. Whatever happened to critical thinking in the West? While some of us heave a sigh of relief that some of these refugees are finding a safe haven in some European countries, we squirm when one of these attacks take place\u2026sorry to give you such a long narrative but the world hasn\u2019t seen a better statesman/peacemaker than Prophet Muhammad. Of course non Muslims have the right to be critical of Prophet Muhammad but you can\u2019t criticize the Prophet and still claim to be a Muslim or you can\u2019t be a non Muslim and make some highly derogatory remarks or caricatures-but Muslims won\u2019t answer an insult with an insult\u2014so we won\u2019t go ahead and make derogatory remarks against Christian or other non Muslim icons\u2014simple, the Quran forbids it. Islam is the only religion which recognizes/acknowledges other faiths and their right to co exist. A typical Muslim response to Charlie Hebdo cartoons would have been protests on streets and pressure on Muslim governments to ban that publication in Islamic countries. I think its high time the world acknowledged that since Muslims don\u2019t hurt the religious sentiments of other groups\u2014I challenge anyone to find a single Muslim post that\u2019s insulting to Jesus, Rama, Buddha etc; its time to accord respect to the Prophet. It\u2019s time other religious groups understood that they can be critical of Islam and the Prophet without those below the belt remarks\u2014why this need for this kind of provocation-we are supposed to be civilized human beings and being civilized doesn\u2019t mean that a group should be forced to bear insults in the name of religious freedom. And to prove that Muslims are not the only ones who believe that these attacks are being engineered by others \u2014I\u2019m forwarding links which give the Russian and other nations\u2019 perspective on the matter.

The problem comes when someone do something wrong and people start shooting innocents. And the ones who do such activities are perhaps the one who watched the full movie on the prophet and are simply not following Islam. Because when the prophet went to Taif all the people were throwing stones at him, even the children. and the messenger was holding his blood so that it should not fall into the ground because he was a prophet and if the blood of the prophet fell int the ground the there will be chaos. Then angel came and asked him \u201cJust give permission, and we will crush those entire people\u201d but the messenger said no! perhaps their pro-genies will accept Islam. And now see the population of Taif. You see if the prophet was not angry then I don\u2019t understand why some of these people are so angry, even tough there are no instruction to be angry. Also all the prophets are honoured by God, so if some people insult the prophet they please whosoever says that we will defend the honour of our prophet? what are you kidding? God himself had honoured Him , who are you? Chill go drink milk and stud your scriptures. ",

            "answer_text": "No Muslim, can remain a Muslim, if he or she offends the person of the Prophet (PBUH). Non-Muslims need to understand what the person of the Prophet (PBUH) means to us. He is the Seal of the Prophethood, and for us, the perfect embodiment of humanity, and perfection of human qualities. For us, he holds a stature and position of respect higher than that of a mother or father, and undertook unsurmountable struggles filled with painful ordeals, that he could have well avoided, for the sake of humanity. In the biography of the Prophet (PBUH) Ibn-Kathir narrates that the tribe of the Prophet (PBUH) approached the uncle of the Prophet (PBUH) Abu Taleb, and offered him riches, abundances, position and the keys to the Kaaba, if the Prophet (PBUH) refused to propagate the message of Allah Almighty, to which he gave the following answer\u201d \u201cAbu Talib ibn Abd Al-Muttalib tried to solve the problem peacefully, and after they had left the house, he talked to Muhammad, The Messenger of Allah (SWT) about the matter, because Muhammad, The Messenger of Allah (SWT) was loving his guardian uncle Abu Talib ibn Abd Al-Muttalib very much. Addressing Abu Talib ibn Abd Al-Muttalib, Muhammad, The Messenger of Allah (SWT) remarked, 'Allah (SWT) has selected me to be His Messenger. He has given me a message so as to lift the people from degradation. He has given me a message for me to call the people to worship only One God. Allah has ordered me to prevent the people from idol-worship and oppression. I swear by Almighty Allah (SWT) that even if they put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left, and in return, demand of me to quit the propagation of Islam and pursuance of my divine aim, I will never do what they want me to. I am determined to carry on my duty toward Allah (SWT) to the last moment of my life, even if it means losing my life. I am strongly determined to attain my goal.' The life of the Prophet (PBUH) also reveals immense sacrifices for the propogation of faith in the wake of extreme violence, hate, opposition and vengeance. Please refer to a story I am sharing here, on the magnanimity, forbearance, fortitude and forgiveness of the Prophet (PBUH) when he was incessantly stoned. heckled and harassed from the town of Taif, on an attempt to spread Islam Muhammad\u2019s \ufdfa journey to Taif Furthermore, the Prophet (PBUH) is also referred to as the \u201cSealed Nectar\u201d - for us Muslims is the epitome of human qualities embodied in perfection, an ideal we attempt to reach each breathing minute; simplicity, honesty, honor, equity, justice, morality and charity. For us he is also the perfect father, son, husband and grandfather. He is not just a lawgiver, and his prophethood does not encompass a few edicts; his life itself to be emulated in the closest manner possible. So for us, the Word of Allah Almighty and the person of the Prophet (PBUH) are both sacrosanct, akin to giving respect to the Law and the lawgiver. ",

Even after returning to Mecca, he never took revenge against the people who had wronged him. Towards the old woman who literally threw shit at him every day, he even cared about her when one day she got ill. It\u2019s also said that the angel, Djibril, had once offered to deliver divine punishment to the people who had wronged him. But the Prophet (pbuh) politely refused. Personally, if Djibril, and the Prophet (pbuh) himself, held their temper and even showed care for the people who had wronged him, as a Muslim I really feel like we should be following their example. I always feel that it\u2019s wrong for Muslims to get so hot headed. ",
