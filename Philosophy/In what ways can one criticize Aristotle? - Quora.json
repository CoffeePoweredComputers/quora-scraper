            "answer_text": "Only the word \u201ccriticize\u201d makes me shiver. ! In my opinion to criticize Plato or Aristoteles or any Greek Philosopher U have to be extremely schooled. I will not criticize but i will make a comment : he was neglecting Plato\u2019s teaching about the notion of the notions that is called \u201cIdea\u201d. It is the reason that he is refering most to the Physical world and a world that is easy to be understood by us commoners. At the end he regognized that it is impossible to explain this world without the refernce to the real world the world of the Ideas that is the real cause for the existance of this Physical wold. Aristoteles has spoken about things that even today scientists are workin on his sayings. Modern scientists find many things wrong in his work but in my opinion this is happening because they cant understand him. Fex Aristoteles is saying that the Earth is the center of the world or our Planet system. Ahhh.. U will say, wrong! Ahhhh.. i will say \u2026.: The ancinet Greeks made a model of the Cosmos and made a metaphor shift(see article on that subject as it is an academic expression). They said that Cosmos can be depicted with 8 spheres. In the center of all of them is laying the Earth. Not the planet Earth but what it is called the material that exists in the universe. That it is why The Earth is called in Greek Philosophy the depth. So please when trying to critisize Greek Philosophers try not to doit. It is not so easy as it looks like. Imagine that 1000nds of scientists say that Aristoteles tok wrong on the subject of the Earth but they are ignorant and thus not capable to criticize him. ",

            "answer_text": "Aristotle claimed that people might become slaves due to some aspect of or flaw in their character. He also claimed that the innate qualities of women consigned them to a subordinate role to men in society. There were a number of things he believed about the natural world that turned out to be erroneous. Some of his theories about drama and politics are shaky. On the other hand, the Nichomachean Ethics is a priceless work, and so is his work on constitutions, politics, and drama. Also his Metaphysics. Aristotle\u2019s great contribution to Western thought was to emphasize the value of drawing conclusions from observed data in the everyday world, getting away from idealism and a priori thought. He was a proponent of the scientific method. Unfortunately, like everyone else, he wasn\u2019t always able to put his pre-assumptions aside. ",
