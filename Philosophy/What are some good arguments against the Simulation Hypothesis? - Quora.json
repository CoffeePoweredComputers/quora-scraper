            "answer_text": "Consciousness. Our human consciousness. This is the strongest argument against the Simulation hypothesis. The simulation hypothesis assumes that a very advanced civilization creates a simulation. And therefore, we and our reality are a simulation. This is the idea. Therefore, if we are a simulation, then our consciousness is also a simulation. But, in order to model consciousness (create it), it is necessary to understand what Consciousness is. At the moment, we have no idea what human consciousness, our mind is. Science now knows only one type of intelligent consciousness: this is our consciousness. Therefore, if someone simulates reality, this does not mean that consciousness will be \"born\" in the created virtual reality. It is likely that this \"someone\" will create an ordinary computer game. No more. In order to create a consciousness similar to a human one, one must truly be the Creator. Modern science cannot create consciousness, and there are no real prospects for creation. Therefore, the one who can create consciousness, for us will not be different from God (if we were created). And those who cannot create consciousness will create only computer games, albeit very powerful ones. It is obvious that the complexity of a computer game does not correlate in any way with the emergence of consciousness. Consciousness cannot spontaneously arise in a computer game. This does not follow from anywhere. Computer game characters are characters for us. They are not aware of themselves: they have no consciousness, it is just an image on our screen. It is foolish to think that this image is conscious. It is also obvious that the complexity of the game, and the power of the computer, will also not lead to the emergence of consciousness. Therefore, if we have consciousness (and this is a fact, since we think), then our world is real. This is an irrefutable fact, until a person creates an artificial consciousness similar to a person. That is, at the present stage of human development, it can be strictly argued that we live in the real world, and not in virtual reality. And this directly confirms our consciousness, the very fact of its existence, and the very fact of the absence of an artificial consciousness similar to a human. It should be especially noted that the possibility of artificially creating a consciousness similar to a person does not follow from anywhere. It is likely impossible by definition and will never be done. But, it is quite easy to refute, it is enough to create a full-fledged human consciousness on your computer :). We looked at the case when created a simulation, and we were born in it, and develop in it. That is, our body, consciousness, etc., is created from the elements of this simulation. And we are nowhere else, we exist only in this world. This is the most difficult version of simulation: in fact, the Creator creates the Universe, which is secondary, and this world can be located on someone's computer :). There is also a second case of the simulation: a simulation is created, and we are placed in its reality. But this reality (simulation) is not real for our true bodies. Such a simulation is alien to us, as in the films \"The Matrix\" or \"Avatar\". This is an easy way to simulate, since our real body exists in the real world. This is where you can study your simulation well, find bugs, and get out of control. In the first case (when we consist of simulation elements), it is not realistic to find errors: they simply do not exist, since a new world has been created, and in this world there are creatures with consciousness. Look at the picture of our brain (Our Brains\u2019 Information Processing Capacity Is Constrained by a Constant but Limited Energy Supply), it is really beautiful, like our consciousness that it creates :). P.S. About the brain's ability to process information. You need to study: the more, the better, as learning \"pumps\" our brain. And the \"pumped\" brain works much faster and better. Everything is like in the game :). And then the consciousness will be more enlightened :). I wish everyone to successfully pump their brain, it will come in handy in work :). P.S2. A very good analogy for a computer game is the game of chess. Two chess players play chess. Chess pieces have no consciousness, and they do not play chess. Although chess pieces are actively involved in the game. But, they have no consciousness, and therefore, they are not aware of the game, and they do not play the game. A man plays chess. Characters in a computer game are \"chess pieces\". They are moved across the screen, either by a person or by a program (algorithm). That is, a computer game is a \"chess game\" between a person and a program (or another person).     ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone knows we might live in a Virtual Reality (VR) simulation. Nevertheless there are four common arguments against it. Here they are, with rebuttals. First Argument: Sim can't be disproven, but it can\u2019t be proven either. That means it's not a scientific hypothesis. But that's true of any broad paradigm, like \"reality is a VR simulation\" or \"spacetime is curved\" or \"the universe began with a bang\" or \"Earth orbits the Sun\". These simple statements are, as they stand, mere metaphysics. You have to add more details to make it into a scientific model. You can\u2019t conflict with existing observations, of course, and should predict new results. It's easy to develop the VR sim guess into a sensible hypothetical model. Second Argument: Physicists have gone ahead and made assumptions about sim, leading to a testable model, then proven it's wrong. But that doesn't disprove the whole paradigm, just their model. For instance, see Lubo\u0161 Motl\u2019s Pizza and simulations vs renormalization and Sabine Hossenfelder\u2019s No, we probably don\u2019t live in a computer simulation. (At the bottom of both blogposts, check out my comments.) They assume sim runs on a conventional digital quantum computer, uses conventional unimaginative coding techniques, and MUST simulate the entire universe, just as it appears. In particular, they assume discreteness, or \"pixelation\", of space and time. It can be shown (\"almost certainly\") that contradicts Lorentz invariance at very fine scales, and other experiments. Great! Now we know that's not the way sim works. The right model is a Virtual Reality sim, sort of like the Matrix. It has to simulate only human experience. There's no need to simulate planck scale interactions, or activities on distant galaxies, etc. Space or time isn't pixelated. The low-level granularity of reality is Planck's quantum of action. This actually prohibits any fixed discrete lattice. Their \"proof\", fine as far it goes, is irrelevant. Third Argument: If reality is a simulation, they ask, then who's the programmer? Simulation hypothesis is just a smoke-screen, a stalking horse, hiding the God hypothesis. Lubo\u0161 Motl sarcastically wonders if She lives in mom's basement, eating pizza and drinking beer, while simulating our lives. This is just silly. There\u2019s nothing here to rebut. Fourth Argument: Finally, they claim there's no indication that the universe is simulated. Where are the glitches, the round-off errors, and so forth? But there are plenty of odd facts physics has discovered about the inner workings of reality that fit the simulation hypothesis. As we all know. Bottom line: there's no evidence against VR sim hypothesis. It can be developed into a plausible testable scientific hypothesis. You can interpret modern physics as providing strong hints in its favor. ",
