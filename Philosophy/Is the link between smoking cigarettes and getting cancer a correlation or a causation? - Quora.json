            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t seen any credible evidence in any research papers that there is any physical cause for cancer, smoking included. I have discussed this matter in depth in this answer: Kyrani Eade's answer to How does smoking cause various forms of cancer? Note. I was a smoker, a pack a day. In 1993 I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer with mets to the cervix, uterus, bowel and both lungs. This was the second opinion because the original diagnosis in Cairns was uterine cancer and they wanted to operate asap. I drove to Sydney for the second opinion, a journey that took 5 and a half weeks. In that time I saw many symptoms lessen and some disappear. Among the symptoms that disappeared was a reddish brown phlegm that I coughed up from time to time. I thought it was due to the nicotine. I was smoking all the way. In Sydney my doctors said the phlegm would have been blood. After the doctors said \u201cnothing we can do for you\u201d, I had a spontaneous remission by early 1994. The only reason I stopped smoking is because I had gone to a Chinese herbalist, who refused to treat me if I didn\u2019t give up smoking. I did think at the time the herbs \u201cdid the trick\u201d, but since then I know that the herbs had nothing to do with the spontaneous remission, except of course if there was some placebo effect. From what I have discovered I am certain that I would still have had the spontaneous remission with no herbs AND having continued to smoke! I found that there is underhanded foul game play and related, inhumane people behind cancer. What I had done and I didn\u2019t realize it at the time is leave and go far away from the people who were looking to do me harm. You will find an answer in the above answer that contains a video in which I document the reasons why cancer develops and under what conditions. I have found that it is possible to avoid developing cancer with this knowledge, but even if cancer develops, then it is easy to move to spontaneous remission of the cancer. ",

            "answer_text": "A tricky question. I\u2019ll call it \u201ccausation\u201d. The gold standard way of testing it hasn\u2019t (and cannot) be done. You take several thousand people and split them into two groups at random: one group is told \u201cNever smoke\u201d. The other group is given unlimited free cigarettes and told \u201cAlways smoke\u201d. You then sit back and wait a few years, all the while tallying up death rates/cancer rates. If the death/cancer rates are higher in the \u201cAlways smoke\u201d group, you then have demonstrated a causation. Obviously, that\u2019s never going to happen. The link between cancer and smoking has been established for decades. But was it correlation or causation? In the 1950s, one of the world\u2019s most renowned statisticians (Sir John Fisher) tried to establish exactly that. Conventional wisdom said \u201cPeople start smoking. People start dying of lung cancer. Must be the cigarettes.\u201d Fisher said \u201cNot so fast. Suppose that there is something undiscovered in the body that pre-disposes people to getting lung cancer. This unknown \u201csomething\u201d might be driving people to seek out cigarette smoking as a way of soothing their lungs. Therefore, it is entirely possible that people who will have lung cancer someday are seeking out cigarettes.\u201d Don\u2019t buy that theory? He also thought that perhaps some people were genetically predisposed to get lung cancer - and these people developed a fondness for cigarettes. Therefore, smoking and dying of cancer were linked to a common cause - again, correlation but not causation. However, there was too much other evidence. Fisher\u2019s viewpoint was eventually abandoned by practically everyone when confronted with the mouthing evidence. For example, as smoking rates rose, they were followed by a rise in deaths from lung cancer. Back in the day, it was the men who smoked as it wasn\u2019t considered ladylike. But following WW1, women began smoking in increasing numbers - and years later, they began dying of lung cancer too. There was also the famous \u201cDoctors Study\u201d performed in the UK in the 1950s. Researchers polled a bunch of doctors as to if they smoked and, if so, how much. They then sat back and waiting. When doctors started dying of lung cancer, it was overwhelmingly the doctors who smoked. And the more they smoked? The higher the death rate. The weight of evidence from thousands of studies established the link, even though it wasn\u2019t by the gold standard of a randomized study. In 1964, the US Surgeon General wrote a report that summarized all this evidence and the following year, cigarettes in the US had to have the famous labeling on the side warning consumers that cigarette smoking is hazardous.
