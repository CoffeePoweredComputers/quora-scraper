The hard problem (which I like to think of as Kripke\u2019s Zombies) goes something like this: Imagine a state of affairs where people act exactly as they do here, have the same brain events that we do, and in every way are indistinguishable from us, save that none of them are conscious\u2014they have no \u2018interior life as it were. They see perfectly well, but have no images; they can decipher sound but hear nothing, affirm things to be true or false but believe nothing. Is this really a hard problem? Perhaps not, but does seem to show that physical events (whether that of a body or just of a given organ) or behaviors are different descriptions from mental events and that latter cannot simply be describe by the latter.
