Who says we are it? That we r the top of the food chain? Not to mention spirits,demons,God's, Goddesses. So I think yes it is possible! All things are possible! ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Let's see how. The world which humans know is through 5 senses, scientific explanation and logics. But our 5 senses, science and logic has limitations. For example, 1000 years ago, we were unaware of electricity. We didn't even imagined. Many scientific innovations happened in modern times. The mediaval man was unaware of it. Hope it helps. ",
