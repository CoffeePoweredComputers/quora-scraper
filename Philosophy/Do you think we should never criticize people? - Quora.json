            "answer_text": "Aidana, you should learn to ask better questions on Quora. And please improve your grammar. It will help you ask questions, with better clarity. Before you downvote, please read further. Rarely, anything good comes out of a criticism. Even if its constructive. Infact, a constructive criticism is just a polite way of saying \"I am doing you a favor by telling you, that I know better than you\". Doesn't sound so polite now, right ? And may be they do know better. But what is the effect of criticism on the receiver ? Everyone wants to be right.  By criticizing, this core instinct is attacked. To protect their core instinct, receiver goes into defense mode. They will either attack the criticizer or show hostility to their own self image. Also, the one who is criticizing, might be actually the wrong one. Infact, people with bad self-image, criticize others, more often. That's why Dale mentioned that most fools like to condemn others.Just like I was in the first sentence of this answer :)  And because I am criticizing you, the actual discussion of \"better question\" gets lost. Instead, the focus is now between two people. Which is pointless and endless. As you can see, nothing really good comes out criticizing a person. Specially, when you wish to make friends. But, here is the catch.  If you are criticizing someone in your head, and not on your lips, you have lost the plot. 'Not criticizing' does not mean :-1. faking2. agreeing3. leaving it to perspective 'Not criticizing' only means :-1. Letting them know your thoughts, without putting them on defense mode and without putting yourself on \"being right\" mode. ",

            "answer_text": "I first googled the word \"criticize\" the moment I saw this question :P..The meaning is 1.indicate the faults of (someone or something) in a disapproving way.2.form and express a judgement of (a literary or artistic work).Regarding the indication of faults in a disapproving way, you can do it!!But, criticizing itself is an art.  If you are not doing it that way, then you are doing it wrong. It is suggestible not to criticize at all.You need to master it.Let me tell you my way:I use the Sandwich Technique. Sandwich has two bread slides. But, the real taste comes due to the one or more food items placed between the bread slides. So, whenever you want to criticize someone, criticize the sandwich way..People hate criticism. People always want to hear good about them. So, we start talking about something positive or good about them. This is top slice of bread.Then, the real content comes. You need to indicate the faults. You need to tell them their negatives, till the moment they can digest. Some digest even the disapproving way too.. This is where your food items come.Afterwards, again speak something good about them. Some positive. This is the bottom slide of bread. Believe me or not, even this kind of criticism gets you a lot of respect. Because, you made your point and always made me happy and elated..For example, I wanted to tell my friend that he is a very bad listener.So, I start with something like this:Dude!!You are really a very good speaker. You always put your points with such a confidence. I really appreciate that part of you.But, the problem when you should be listening people. You mostly stop them while they talk.(He tries to stop me too!..But, I insist him to wait!)People only remember you when they are heard. You have your whole life time to make you point. So, get that habit of listening to people...Great leaders are great orators, but they are good listeners too. I know that you have those leadership qualities. But, listening will again compound your leadership skillset. As you have already mastered the art of speaking to people, I am suggesting you this..I know you can become a great listener too!That friend of mine, might be pissed off in the  middle of short talk.. But, again in the end, he start feeling happy..Constructive Judgment is what is necessary. Regarding Dale Carneige's Statement, I want to add something:Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events,small minds discuss people.When \"A\" judges \"B\", A does not put his opinion of \"B\" in front \"B.\" Instead, \"A\" goes around and talks about it with C,D,E,F etc.. So, \"A\" ends up doing bad mouthing about B. \"A\" ends up being a small mind. \"A\" ends up being a chatter box. \"A\" ends up judging \"B\" like a fool.So, Dale is talking about fools like \"A\". Hope this helps!! :) ",

            "answer_text": "I would say it depends heavely on the context. As general atitude, I believe Confuciu's advise \"to treat others as you would like them to treat you\" gives more freeddom for both you and the person to interact. But of course, there are limits, Confuciu's advise serve's well for the small things we might be picky with one another, but there might be some huge flaws that one might display such as arrogance that we cannot simply ignore. That doesn't necessarily involve openly criticizing that person, but an attitude must taken, like moving away from that person.   I could write more about this answer, but I'm in a hurry here. So last thing, one who often condemn others, who tends to see flaws in other peoples attitude, need's to definitely look inside, because in a sense, the outer world is a mirror of the inner one. ",

            "answer_text": " No I disagree.  There are times when you need to tell yourself \"Enough is enough.  You've just overstepped my bottom line\".  It's time to give you a mouthful. Having been brought up in the Chinese tradition, I was always told to always be polite, never make waves and never criticize others.  I took this philosophy right up into my mid-20's, and developed a thick skin and a high level of tolerance as a result.  But there were instances in my personal and professional life when a person was just so abrasive or selfish that I couldn't take it anymore and lashed out verbally.  Until my (Western) boss took me aside and told me that it took me a long time to get riled up, but once I did, I got really nasty. So my advice would be: 1.  Avoid criticizing people unless it's absolutely necessary. 2.  Avoid doing it on the spur of the moment and weigh heavily on what you say or do.  Anything said in anger can never be retracted. 3. Never bear grudges. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Firstly, to criticize someone or not, depends hugely on the situation u/they are in. This my friend, is a very important aspect to consider when u plan on criticizing someone. If there's situation where the person who's gonna receive criticism, is already feeling low or sad, there's no use of criticizing him. He may turn violent or just pay a deaf ear to you. On the other hand, if there's a situation where a person is prideful, bosses around everyone, criticizing himIn the right way, in front of the right people can bring a lot of change in him. Second, it also depends on the kind of person you are trying to criticize. Not many people are open to criticism. A lot of them, infact try to defend themselves,haplessly, when criticized. Whereas, on the other hand,there are people who are open to constructive criticism. There's another kind of people who are open to any kind of criticism,be it negative/positive.These are the kind who don't take criticism seriously and even if they do,they try to learn something out of it. Finally, it depends on how u feel if somebody criticizes you the same way. Before u criticize someone, try to put yourself in their shoes and try imaging how'd u feel if someone criticized u the same way? ",

People often crave honest feedback, and in many professions it is impossible to do a good job without offering an honest evaluation of the work (or even character) of others. On the other hand people who constantly judge others in an unsolicited way are usually fueled by insecurity or a need for superiority and those are destructive motivations that can only lead in unproductive directions. So as usual, the right answer is there is no simple answer and you must judge according to the desired outcome keeping in mind the full complexity of the situation. ",

This way you add value to people life and you will be of more value to them. ",

Even if asked for, the recipient has to have the capacity to take criticism in a constructive manner. Now in a professional world, criticism seems inevitable! But again, it has to be dispensed in a manner that the recipient takes it as constructive feedback. In a few words, criticism should not be a tool to make look stupid, inefficient or simply point fingers at someone. Just like a sculptor uses a chisel to crave life into stones, criticism can prove to be a good tool to shape and channelize people's skill set. ",

Or, if you're doing it, you should do in a mild way. If you're criticizing for making the person realize his mistakes, and giving him motivation, then it is the right thing to do.  If some jerk is criticizing you, then just smile. If you don't have the guts to do that, then be the bigger asshole than him/her. ",

If a Kid burned his hands criticism doesn't help, but if the same kid is about to burn, any one can criticize that step, in order to put him in an inertial frame of thought which actually helps him to endeavor in right direction despite of the fact he asked your suggestion or not. Don't worry about what that kid does as his action are determined by his own will. You just place your thought which might or might not have occurred to him, problem arrives when you worry about the result. ",

It's the constructive criticism people appreciate, it shows your concern and kindness. Lets consider a scenario where two persons criticize us, one with negativity and one with positive constructive criticism, whom would we like? Whose criticism would we choose to think about? The one who is nice to us, right? Yes, I totally agree with what Dale Carnegie has said. People tend to judge others, criticism them negatively and mock derogatory comments, it sure shows how the person thinks about another. Detailed explanation can be seen here : Why people judge?.. ",
