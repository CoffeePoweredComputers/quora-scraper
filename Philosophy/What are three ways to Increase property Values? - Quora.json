            "answer_text": "Tips on how to increase the value of multifamily real estate property All multifamily investors should seek to add value to their investments. In so doing, an investor creates equity in the asset that they own. Multifamily properties are no exception. Here are just a number of tips on how to increase the valuation of your multifamily property \u2013 we will cover other tips in subsequent posts: Only do upgrades for which tenants will payMake tenants pay for their utilities directlyInstall LED motion sensor lightsOnly Do Upgrades For Which Tenants Will Pay When rehabbing, or improving a multifamily property, investors should examine the market where the property is located, adding amenities that add maximum value with minimum costs. For example, if the property is located in a neighborhood where the value, or rental amount is X, given certain amenities, an investor should stay within the parameters of those given amenities, as that is the market. Adding improvements that exceed the quality, will not add additional value, as the equilibrium point has been reached (determined by an analysis of comparable, and rental demographics. You get all this information for free on our site Smart Capital Center. For example, adding expensive carpet to units when the majority of units, have vinyl flooring would be counter-productive, contribute toward diminishing returns, and would not yield a greater return on investment, as the associated expense would exceed the return in property value or rent. But, adding vinyl flooring would yield a greater per capita dollar return on investment relative to expenses (cleaning, replacing, upgrading etc.) In other words, there would be a maximization of profits and a minimization of expenses over time. Make Tenants Pay for Their Utilities Directly Additionally, having tenants pay for the services they use on a daily basis would greatly reduce the variable expense of utilities. Having the tenants pay for their own utilities (water, gas and electric) is wise, as tenants would be more frugal and thoughtful in using these valuable resources as it is an expense they incur. Install LED Motion Sensor Lights Furthermore, to further reduce expenses, and increase value, installing LED Motion Sensor lights would be an efficient improvement. The motion sensor characteristic in LED lights discourage vandalism, as it is activated by movement, which in turn may serve to reduce insurance costs, due to decreased probability of damage/robbery to property. Also, they serve to create efficiency with regard to energy use, as lights are automatically turned off if there is no movement, which can save substantially on energy costs. These are just a few antidotes that can help investors create value. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us at hello@SmartCapital.Center or via Quora messages. ",

Disclaimer: This question sounds as if it\u2019s a test question . . . which means that there\u2019s a book with the \u201cright\u201d answers. The answers below are 100% correct, but they may well not be the ones your teacher or instructor is looking for. Get the zoning changed. For instance, if the property is zoned for single-family homes, it\u2019s likely that it will be worth more if it\u2019s zoned for multi-family units. Or subdivide the land, so that more houses can be built on the same piece of property.Increase the income from the property. This applies to commercial and rental properties, where value is based largely on the income from the property. Raising the rents, cutting costs, or developing additional revenue streams are all ways to increase the income.Update and upgrade the property. Put in new paint and carpeting. Landscape the property. Remove clutter and junk. Stage it.",
