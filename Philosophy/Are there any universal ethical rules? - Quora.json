            "answer_text": "Henry Sidgwick thought there were the following self-evident and universal moral intuitions: - it cannot be right for A to treat B in a manner in which it would be wrong for B to treat A, merely on the ground that they are two different individuals, and without there being any difference between the natures or circumstances of the two which can be stated as a reasonable ground for difference of treatment.  - a smaller present good is not to be preferred to a greater future good - the good of any one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view (if I may say so) of the Universe, than the good of any other; unless, that is, there are special grounds for believing that more good is likely to be realised in the one case than in the other. - it is evident [...] that as a rational being I am bound to aim at good generally,\u2014so far as it is attainable by my efforts,\u2014not at a particular part of it. The latter two propositions combine into: each one is morally bound to regard the good of any other individual as much as his own, except in so far as he judges it to be less, when impartially viewed, or less certainly knowable or attainable by him.

Be reciprocal.Be honest to others.Keep your promises with others.Don't do unprovoked or unnecessary violence towards others.* Most all of these are manifestations of the Golden Rule and there are probably others as well.
