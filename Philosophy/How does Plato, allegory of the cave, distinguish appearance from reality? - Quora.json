            "answer_text": "Well, allegory first. Like an explanation, an allegory relies on our familiarity and comfort to help us understand something previously beyond us. It\u2019s not an entirely bad system but it\u2019s not strong enough for modern science - and it\u2019s predictive value depends upon how it is interpreted , how it is used. It\u2019s the stuff of clever stories. \u201c The p;oor man really was like a lion \u2026 but lacked the teeth. \u2018Nough said. So the allegory in the case of the cave. The first side of the allegory involves a bunch of people in a cave watching the shadows from the outside. They watch the shadows all their lives and that forms their conception of reality. The second part the ordinary people live in the real world outside the cave, and they use light {not shadow} to make sense of another reality. Then there is the philosopher who, contemplating the analogy between the cave dwellers and the outsiders, realizes that there is a third element, for the philosopher has to know not by shadows, not by ordinary light, but by reason and a determined search for truth. Shadows, real light, and the world learned by reason. That\u2019s it. Very, very clever. Analogies are a lousy way to find the truth but a wonderful tool for teaching. His analogy still works after more than two thousand years. Even today we instantly grab the idea of an alternate reality and the question becomes which is the one for us. And with which shall we choose to live? The shadows? Or in that common sunlight? Or, even better, in that good light of reason? Great stuff! Now, I\u2019m asked, does Plato help us hold fast to that better light? The record is plain! It survives after more than two thousand years as a key introduction to intelligent life - the intellectual\u2019s discovery of wisdom, it is the moment of baptism \u2026 for our minds. ",

            "answer_text": "In a virtual reality or in a fake reality in the cave, people is put to chains unable to move. They cant speak and they dont have enough light at least no sun light, that gives shadows on the walls of the cave of their guards and the items they carry. In reality persons are able to be in the sun light, they are able to move, to speak, to observe direct all objects and beings as the light is adequate and helps on that. This is a simplified answer on that subject that needs hundreds of books to explain as the Cave allegory is complicated and applies to many many situations. ",
