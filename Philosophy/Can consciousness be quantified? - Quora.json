            "answer_text": "There are many ways to quantify consciousness, and all are interesting because they show its different aspects. Gradation of consciousness by clinical tests: from the primary reflex to the vigilance tests. The quantified aspect is the superimposition of functions. Consciousness is a functional hierarchy and it is possible to quantify the present height. Quantification of the neural activity underlying consciousness: fMRI can measure the metabolic activity of neurons involved in the integration network of awakened consciousness. It is not correlated with the quality of the service it provides, rather a measure of consumption. Depth of information: The Integrated Information Theory (ITT) explains consciousness by the depth of information reached by the neurons coding the data. Quantifying an information depth is mathematically very accurate. Detailed tests of higher functions, self-evaluation, intelligence tests: here again it is the contents of consciousness that are quantified, as well as the capacity of consciousness to model itself and to control back. Since all these methods focus on qualitative aspects, they do not exist to quantify \u2018the consciousness' as a global concept, except by adding up their results. Even the ITT erases the qualitative and it is unsatisfactory. We would tend to think for example that the depth of thinking reached for ethical issues is more important than sensitivo-motor performance. But neurologically these are just networks located in different areas. Consciousness is a patchwork and quantifying it globally is like classifying cities by agreeability: terribly arbitrary. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say, consciousness cannot be quantified, but AWARENESS of it can be. Consciousness is ONE. It is the ALL. There are different levels in Awareness of this ONE Consciousness. Difference between Awareness and Consciousness: Awareness is a CHOICE, but Consciousness is The ALL and forever existing. Consciousness cannot stop existing, but awareness of that consciousness can. Nothing can destroy Consciousness, because there is NOTHING other than consciousness and it's manifestations. Awareness is a function of human choice. Based on your choice, you can be aware of Consciousness, or not. Consciousness IS, Awareness may\u2026 Based on this, here are the levels of awareness: Stone (knows nothing, but exists)Plant (can respond to environment, but not FEEL)Animal (can have emotions/feelings, but unable to express the feeling)Human Being(Can Be, Do, FEEL, as well as express them)Evolved Human Being(Can do everything that a human being does and knows NATURE deeply. It understands that it is Love)Highly Evolved Being(Never doubting the Self, Knowing it is Love, and a Master of the elements of existence. This is becoming God)",

            "answer_text": "In the linked video, physicist Michio Kaku proposes to quantify consciousness \u2014that is, to measure \"how\" conscious something is, and thus to accept a model of consciousness\u2014 by considering:  \u2026the number of feedback loops required to create a model of your position in space, with relationship to other organisms, and finally in relationship to time. He then notes that a thermostat, with its very limited awareness, has perhaps one feedback loop and is therefore a \"1\" on what we might call the consciousness scale (he says it has \"one unit of consciousness\"). He says then that a flower might have 10 units of consciousness.  I don't understand his transition from this unit-of-measurement to the next classificatory scheme he uses, calling reptiles \"level 1 consciousness\" although they have many more feedback loops. I don't know that it's worth investigating too much more, though, because any model of consciousness that posits that a flower is just 10x as conscious as a thermostat is either erring badly in its particulars or simply doesn't measure anything like consciousness. I like Kaku, but I think this is a quixotic and perhaps under-considered effort. Materialists (like me) are pretty desperate to escape the bind we've been placed in by the total failure of AI research; there seems to be no explanation for human intelligence at all in our models of the world, and our only recourse is to deny that it is special \u2014a manifestly absurd proposition\u2014 or pretend that the difference between us and a thermostat is just a question of the number of feedback loops. That is: it's just degree, not kind. Keep adding feedback loops (or megahertz or memory or nodes or strings or\u2026) and you just \"jump\" from thermostats and flowers to human minds. I suppose that's possible; there is such a thing as emergence, although it gets leaned on a lot in this conversation!   Most efforts of this sort recall for me the Nobel-prize-winning physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, who refused to accept reductive conceptions of mind simply because we had no better ones:  I am very astonished that the scientific picture of the real world around me is deficient. It gives a lot of factual information, puts all our experience in a magnificently consistent order, but it is ghastly silent about all and sundry that is really near to our heart, that really matters to us. It cannot tell us a word about red and blue, bitter and sweet, physical pain and physical delight; it knows nothing of beautiful and ugly, good or bad, God and eternity. Science sometimes pretends to answer questions in these domains, but the answers are very often so silly that we are not inclined to take them seriously. This is not simply hand-waving about mysticism; Schr\u00f6dinger literally felt that science had so far found nothing to tell us about what we experience in our mind, and that this was because science had so far failed to understand mind. In his wonderful lectures Mind and Matter and What is Life? he returns again and again to this failure, using simple examples to highlight it:  The sensation of color cannot be accounted for by the physicist's objective picture of light-waves. Could the physiologist account for it, if he had fuller knowledge than he has of the processes in the retina and the nervous processes set up by them in the optical nerve bundles and in the brain? I do not think so. Light-waves have no color; photons have no color. Most of any given piece of matter, whatever its color, is empty space; there is a lattice-like structure, perhaps, of vibrating particle clouds, but 90% of more of a stop sign or a yellow banner is empty space. The \"yellow\" of it is your invention, from within your mind; it is what your mind makes from the colorless light-waves of certain frequencies. That's uncontroversial because most of us believe that what's happening in our brain is understood, that the \"yellowness\" comes from this or that sort of electrical activity in this or that part of the brain. But no such theory exists. No one has any useful model for \"what a thought is\" or what it's made of beyond general observations about brain functions. How ignorant are we about the mind? Well:  we have no idea what most mental illnesses are or what causes them; we describe them by correlating groups of observed behaviors in persons with highly provisional theories about neurochemistry, and we measure heritability after-the-fact, but no one knows what bipolar is, what schizophrenia is (imagine a comparable state of ignorance in physical medicine!)we have no idea at all how to make AI, and about 50 years of AI research has produced no significant progress; contemporary AI agents are hardly better than Eliza was 30 years ago, and regardless of what you read, no one has any idea how to \"make\" something that has \"will,\" or is \"creative\"worse: no one really knows what will is, and many think \"free will,\" a cornerstone of commonsense reality, doesn't exist; no one knows what creativity is beyond the most basic descriptions, and there is absolutely no progress on instantiating creativity in machinesSo: Kaku's quantification adds little to this bleak picture. The \"model\" he implies is: add feedback loops and eventually you get creative self-consciousness capable of infinite reflection, reach, and knowlegde-generation. What do you think the threshold is? What do you think the liminal zone around the threshold is like? Why do you think the threshold is what it is? Many aspects of consciousness can be quantified; consciousness is explicable in physical terms, I believe, and will be explained by science eventually. But it has not been so explained yet, and we are not obliged to pretend that the reductive attempts made so far are true simply because we don't have a better theory ourselves. So: consciousness can presumably be quantified \u2014and it can and will be modeled\u2014 but in my lay opinion I don't see any reason to believe this is a solution, a model, or a description with much utility.

            "answer_text": "Simplest and straightforward meaning of consciousness is \u201cexperiencing of knowing\u201d. Knowing has three aspects viz. past, present and future. Collective knowing of the entire past strikes you as \u201cimplicit/ emotional/ genetic consciousness\u201d which has been popular in the name of \u201csubconsciousness\u201d. Indeed, this term could be a misnomer insofar as its unparalleled sovereignty in comparison to other components of consciousness isn\u2019t sufficiently emphasized in this conventional term. The current collateral knowing, mostly perceptional, mostly limited to the domain of relevance, strikes you as \u201cexplicit/ apparent/ mental/ intellectual consciousness\u201d. This is generally referred to as \u201cconsciousness\u201d. This term again is a misnomer inasmuch as its implication has been misleading people away from \u201cplenary consciousness\u201d which is of innumerable times larger magnitude. The futuristic knowing, intuitional in nature, appears to you as \u201csuper-consciousness\u201d. As falling dusts swell the ground and as you might accordingly visualize earth to have been formed out of continuous rain of dust, it may be deemed that sedimented past knowing as genes have been augmenting subject\u2019s body and accordingly, we may visualize the subconscious body to be solely the accumulation of past knowing. Brain/ mind, the seat of apparent consciousness, a marginal organ, is the portal for continual influx of information and their filtration and sedimentation into subconscious constituents. It may be also be noted that even brain is only a modified portion of the subconscious body. So, the power of brain would most likely be proportional to the subconscious. In a similar manner, the intuition/ intuitional organ would be proportional to the subconscious body. All these considerations seem to imply that the body could be the physical measure of all forms of consciousness that constitute plenary consciousness. We can start off on further research in this matter with a presumption that \u201cbody is the quantified consciousness\u201d i.e. \u201cbody\u2019s evolutionary value is subject\u2019s quantified consciousness\u201d.

Consciousness typically refers to three cognitive processes that we \u2018bundle\u2019 together in our thoughts: paying attention to signals, the signals we pay attention to, and the subjective sense of self, that it is \u201cI\u201d which is paying attention to those signals. Attention is a flow of electrical impulses conducted via chemicals in and between brain cells located in the brain stem, which is electrically connected to the other brain structures where signals are processed along with the generation of the subjective sense of a self that is paying attention to those signals. Strictly speaking, it is possible to measure the voltage of those electrical impulses constituting the production of the energy of attention, and the magnitude of the intensity of both attention and the signals being paid attention to should be able to be quantified in that manner, but the subjective sense of self is very elusive as it is constructed by multiple brain regions which makes it virtually impossible to separate out what is the subjective sense of self and what is other brain functions being measured.

Do you think your cat is conscious, having some ability to think and feel? Most cat owners would say yes. But is your cat just as conscious as you are? No, not on the same level. So if there are different levels of consciousness, it must follow that there must be ways to measure the different levels. For more on the idea of measuring consciousness, you might be interested in reading Douglas Hofstadter\u2019s I am a Strange Loop. Hofstadter writes, \u201cConsciousness is not an on/off phenomenon, but admits of degrees, grades, shades. Or to put it more bluntly, there are bigger souls and small souls.\u201d The book is a great exploration of consciousness and this new idea of soul sizes. As researchers build on the idea of consciousness as a spectrum and continue to develop technologies in neuroscientific research, it seems likely that consciousness will be explained in terms of quantity.

Consciousness uses the recorded Knowledge as a great tool or accessory for its performance or response to the situation, quality of which is enhanced mainly by the purity of Consciousness. Consciousness can be compared only in its purity in percentage, i.e., Consciousness can be said to be 100%, if the percentage of damage or fragmentation is zero.

            "answer_text": "Friend, Mathematical logic is core component of computation. Thing/process you want to represent by mathematical logic has to be perceived by senses and mind/psyche leading to perception dominated by senses will represent dominantly space dimension and perception dominated by mind will represent dominantly time dimension, former results as something physical and latter as something psychological/which can be conceptualized in form-pattern-called mathematical formulation, which in turn forms basics of computation. Whatever we take in/whatever we know, is through our tools called senses and mind and eventually our all knowledge/data/information bear potential to be understood by mathematical logic and here is the future for AI. It is only consciousness which is perceived directly and doesn't need any http://interface.It simply means that if you being conscious being only can perceive consciousness of your own and consciousness of other.you know you are is something consciousness being conscious to consciousness -state called self consciousness noticed in a man. It is kind of encounter. This particular way of perceiving consciousness by consciousness makes consciousness something beyond dimension-space and time-or it makes consciousness something omnipresent /multidimensional /something being existed in all dimensions. This particular feature doesn't allow consciousness neither to be something physical nor to be something psychological which may have any possibilities for conceptulization representable in form called maths/mathematical logic. You can realize your own consciousness is not thought, neither emotions nor feelings nor sensations. Thanks Q guru ",

Fully conscious, the patient will easily follow the motion of the light. Sluggishness implies a lower level of consciousness. No response, but pupils still dilate implies an even lower level of consciousness and no pupil dilation implies zero consciousness. ",
