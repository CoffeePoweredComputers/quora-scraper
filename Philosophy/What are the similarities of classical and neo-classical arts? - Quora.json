            "answer_text": "Classical music is very structured. It almost always has the same general structure among the various works that are from the Classical period. I\u2019m not that familiar with neo-classical arts. But from its name I would guess that it is a new (neo) form of art that expresses itself in a structured way, much like the Classical period, but in newer, more modern expressions. If something could be freer and more uninhibited yet still contained in a structure, I would guess that might be neo-classical art. That\u2019s the best I can do. ",
