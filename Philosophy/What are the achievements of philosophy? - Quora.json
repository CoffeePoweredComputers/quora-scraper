            "answer_text": "The list would be huge in philosophy as well, which would include mathematics, physics, and all their achievements which couldn't have been possible without philosophical inquiry in the first place. Methodology in rational endeavours is philosophical. Once those methods are established, taking credit for achievements which depended on the establishment of those methods without acknowledging the difficulties in establishing them fails to acknowledge that we are standing on the shoulders of giants. Not all of them self-identified as philosophers, but most did. I think that the \"striking contrast\" you find between philosophy and math or physics is that many of the fundamental epistemological and ontological issues have already previously been worked out, and they've been worked out by philosophers or philosophers working with people in those fields. In mathematics and physics, just like philosophy, progress is actually very slow. But its growth is also exponential. The more fundamental the questions, the more disagreement you will get. Once a resolution is agreed, there is a huge growth in results. The major spark in fundamentals early last century was philosophical work in non-classical logics, the foundations of math, and the formalization of the loose calculus of Newton and Leibniz. Without that foundational work, the likes of Einstein, Godel, and Heisenberg would not have been able to formulate their theorems. ",

It taught us to ask questions, raise dilemmas and speculate on any branch of knowledge. It taught us not to take everything as a given. And so on...wish it were taught more in schools. We certainly need more intellectual elasticity.You don't want Maths or Physics? Then Politics, Ethics, Pleasure, Music, Religion.It helped us look at ourselves in a mirror. And doubt ourselves.Cogito Ergo Sum. ",
