            "answer_text": "The phenomenology of Husserl is modern. (We can talk about people before Husserl using the method of phenomenology, and the origin of the word can be traced back at least as far as Kant\u2019s distinction between phenomena and noumena. But the attempt to justify the phenomenological method as being the correct way to solve important philosophical problems begins with Husserl - earlier writers count as phenomenological because they anticipate and influence Husserl). As far as I\u2019m aware Husserl was attempting to find the one true method that would resolve long-standing philosophical problems. Post-modernists would reject this kind of ambition as typically modern. (I\u2019m not an expert on Husserl, and am open to correction, but from what I\u2019ve read by and about Husserl, I think this is accurate). However, a postmodernist might choose to use a phenomenological method to write about some issues not because it is the One True Method To Give Definitive Answers, but because postmodernists like to mix and match different approaches, none of which are definitive. To take a phenomenological approach to some subject means you just describe the way things seem to be, hoping to come up with a description that makes people say \u201cYes, that is how it seems to me too.\u201d A phenomenological approach to a religious ceremony would aim to describe how the ceremony feels to participants, ignoring the issue of whether their beliefs are true or false, and whether the god they are worshipping is real or unreal. A postmodernist could use the phenomenological method as long as there is no danger of it leading to Truth. ",

            "answer_text": "Phenomenology slowly evolves along with its background culture, tracing through pre-modern, modernism, and post-modernism, and now maybe beyond that into meta-modernism. Considering its basic ideas (ontological constructs), first-generation phenomenology of the Husserlian variety is pre-modern, being essentially a repackaging of theories of mind grounded in classical western theological idealism. A second generation of phenomenology including Heidegger and Merleau Ponty is beginning to go in the direction of post-modern ideas, with the inclusion of embodiment, unique situation, and other less universalized and absolutist ideas about perspective. A third-generation phenomenology is currently emerging, influenced by cognitive neuroscience and the challenging long-term project of creating a mapping between brain process, subjective experience, and behavior. This includes the search for neurological correlates of consciousness and other \u201cphenomenological\u201d states and processes. The detailed empirical observations and attempt to ground phenomena biologically can be expected to depart further from the idealism and transcendentalism of early phenomenology and lead in the direction of \u201cnaturalization\u201d and realism. I speculate that the use of \u201cbig data\u201d and semantic information technologies will introduce a further \u201cturn\u201d in phenomenology within the next generation. Philosophers are doing something different now: Quantitative data Phenomenology and the Third Generation of Cognitive Science: Towards a Cognitive Phenomenology of the Body ",
