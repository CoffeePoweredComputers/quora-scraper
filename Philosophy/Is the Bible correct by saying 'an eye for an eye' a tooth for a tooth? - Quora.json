            "answer_text": "I must confess right up front that I believe the Bible is always correct. What is often not correct is our interpretation. The expression \u201can eye for an eye and tooth for tooth\u201d is found in Exodus 3:24. This sounds very violent. When you read it in context it is clear that under the Mosaic law the person who commits a crime must pay compensation or at least equal what was done to the person. The original purpose was to prevent escalation when it came to revenge, and to promote punishment that did not exceed the crime. Jesus in Matthew 5:38\u201341 takes this further\u2026 \u201cYou have heard that it was said, \u2018An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.\u2019 But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. What Jesus is saying is that a disciple of his should go even further. That is not demanding rights but show that something different has happened inside of you. While the natural tendency is to seek revenge or to hurt someone back, don\u2019t resist. Go above and beyond in seeking peace. Be the one that lives honest life. Yes, the Bible is correct in saying an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Justice is important, and it should not exceed what is equal or even to revenge. However, Jesus says if you\u2019re one of my followers you take this even further and represent me as people of peace and love. a2a ",

            "answer_text": "That is a great question and I will only use the bible to answer your question. Did God\u2019s Law Authorize Revenge? The words \u201ceye for eye, tooth for tooth,\u201d found in the Bible, have caused no little contention. (Exodus 21:24) To some people, it is nothing less than divine approval of revenge. But such thinking conflicts with God\u2019s command: \u201cYou must not take vengeance nor hold a grudge against the sons of your people.\u201d (Leviticus 19:18) How, then, are we to understand those words in Exodus? Exodus 21:22 presents a scenario in which two men are fighting and one of them strikes a pregnant woman, causing her to deliver prematurely. If mother and baby survived, the injured woman\u2019s husband would not be authorized to strike back. Rather, the man who struck the new mother would have to \u201cpay the damages imposed on him by the husband of the woman; and he must pay it through the judges.\u201d In other words, the judges in court would make the striker pay a fine to the husband of the injured mother. If she or her child died because of injuries, those same judges would have the perpetrator put to death. In this case, the court, not the victim, applied \u201clife for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth . . .\u201d (Exodus 21:23, 24) That principle reminded judges that punishment should be neither excessive nor insufficient. Bible scholar Richard Elliott Friedman states: \u201cThe basic principle appears to be that punishment should correspond to the crime and never exceed it.\u201d  What gave rise to the idea that God\u2019s Law authorized personal acts of revenge? It is noteworthy that atMatthew 5:38, 39, we find Jesus\u2019 words: \u201cYou heard that it was said:\u2018Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.\u2019 However, I say to you: Do not resist the one who is wicked, but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other also to him.\u201d It seems that by Jesus\u2019 day, some religious teachers had included the \u2018law of retaliation\u2019 in their oraltradition as approval for personal vengeance. Jesus, however, made clear that such ateaching had no support in God\u2019s Law to Israel.
