There ARE objective truths, mostly of a scientific cast, but for the rest of us, \u201ctruth\u201d is a relative thing and is awfully dependent on our frame of mind, our education, our emotional state, our perceptive state, our age, our gender, and our dedication to honesty, which is another thing altogether.
