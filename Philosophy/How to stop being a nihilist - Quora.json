            "answer_text": "Presumably you\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re supposed to \u201cmake your own meaning\u201d, right? I hope that letter got out to everyone by now. But when people hear that, they\u2019re often not impressed. Let\u2019s explore why that is \u2014 why is it that \u201cmake your own meaning\u201d seems so unsatisfying as a solution to the problem of \u201coops. I realized that there\u2019s no objective meaning to things!\u201d? A crisis of meaning occurs because humans go along making meaning, but not realizing that they\u2019re making it. They think that they are perceiving reality as it is, when in fact they\u2019re making up significance, value, narrative, etc. as they go along. The meaning is their own product, and then one day they start to notice and confront this \u2014 \u201cdamn! All this time I thought life was meaningful but it was just me making stuff up or believing things that others made up! Damn!\u201d Why is that upsetting? Because it means, in effect, that you\u2019ve been wrong about everything you had based your choices and actions on. You thought there was some meaning underlying your choices and guiding your actions, and you thought that meaning was something bigger than you that you owed respect to. That meaning was the foundation of your existence, and then one day\u2026 poof! Gone. So then who are you and why are you bothering to do anything or try to be good or whatever? Crisis, yes? Your sense of self can come apart because it was unconsciously grounded on an untruth which has now been exposed. So this is a threat to the ego, it\u2019s scary \u2014 and it\u2019s depressing because the reasons that you\u2019re used to having for doing things no longer make sense and the future collapses, as it was based on the values and beliefs that you no longer trust. This is a door with two sides. One side is labeled \u201cdespair and nothingness\u201d, and the other side is labeled \u201cfreedom and possibility.\u201d The trick is to be able to see why the door has two sides and then promote yourself to Head Chooser. The despair-and-nothingness side of the door is what you get if you consider that the meaning that you make is meaningless. Note how we use \u201cmeaning\u201d twice in that sentence, you have to stop and think clearly here: is the meaning that you make devoid of value and truth and significance? If it is, then you\u2019re right to be depressed \u2014 because that means that not only is objective reality meaningless, but YOU are also meaningless to yourself. There is literally no possibility of meaning whatsoever, because even you-making-meaning is meaningless, to you. But the other side of that door is equally valid: if you are the meaning-maker, then nothing has meaning without your permission. But\u2026 can\u2019t you give your permission? What is stopping you from granting meaning to the meaning that you make? You were doing it for years, but you were not aware that you were the source of the meaning that you perceived. Now, you are aware. But is the meaning you make, in fact, actually significant and valuable? Who should we ask? How could there be any authority \u201cout there\u201d who can solve that question? How could there be any Oracle who answers the riddle about whether your meaning is significant and valuable? I\u2019m sort of hoping that the resolution of this is obvious now, or at least you can smell it coming around the corner: it is up to you to choose whether or not you have the power to make meaning that\u2019s meaningful. If you take the view that your meaning is meaningless, then that is the absolute truth, because you are the only possible arbiter of this truth, and you say it\u2019s meaningless. So be it. And of course the contrary is also true: if you hold as valuable the meaning you make, then it is absolutely valuable because the only authority in existence has so deemed it. In that case, you\u2019re utterly free to express yourself \u2014 you are the source of meaning, and you have empowered yourself to live as that and express that, and you have nobody to answer to on this topic. You\u2019re free and fully able to put ground under your own existence, because you hold the keys to the existence of meaning. That side of the door says \u2018freedom and possibility\u2019 because it becomes clear that there\u2019s no rules or walls holding you back. If there are rules and walls, you made them, and you don\u2019t have to keep making them, because you accept and choose your role as the source of all such things. In general, if someone gets this clearly, it tends to produce a \u201clightening up.\u201d A lighting up. An enlightening upness. Freedom and possibility are just not all that shitty. ",

            "answer_text": "I find nihilism to be an expression of the enneatype 5 virtue. It is a component of fear, a quintessential denial of existence to relieve the self of the burden of being. This is an attempt to deflect fear. The solution is always the same to any emotive problem on one level and totally different depending of course on the specifics of that problem. Understanding truth is an aid in dealing with the problem. So, fear is always properly balanced with anger and desire. Those are the only three emotions at one level. Love is a meta-emotion comprising all three of those. Love is the source of all meaning and happiness. So nihilism is a product of facing the awe-inspiring majesty of the universe and wishing to be small enough to avoid notice, wishing in effect to not exist, except on the mental plane, as an observer. This disconnected wish is actually immoral in some ways, so I respectfully disagree with the assertion that Nihilism is acceptable. It is not. One must morally stand to life as an existing entity. The anger or spine to stand is not easy. Anger is a holding force demanding its own space and showing its presence in an effort to hold it. Invoke anger within yourself, your right to exist, a primal component of love, derived from compassion. You are equal to all and a part of all. You have a right to be here. You belong and cannot be made to unbelong. That which says otherwise is immoral. Further, as mentioned by several others that answered, desire must be used. Will to power is a means of balancing fear. You have to want to live. There are many directions you can go, or behaviors you can show. Which one will it be ? To navigate the chaos, requires desire, passion. Use it. Amid presence and the right to exist coupled with passion, nihilism is deflected properly. These tasks are not easy at all. A moral act, a true act is the single hardest thing any entity can do. Yet it remains moral duty to do so. It remains the only route to happiness. Good luck and get busy! ",

As a former moral nihilist and epistemological skeptic, I can relate to such a frame of reference.

Your friends life? Learning? Art? Sports? Whatever you value, whatever gives you meaning, is proof that nihilism is an impossible position to live by without contradicting yourself. So the question is why? Is it all just personal taste? Are humans more valuable than a cockroach because society says so or is it something above society? And now you are a philosopher.

Since there is no inherent meaning to life (cosmic nihilism): you are free to make your own (I would suggest meaningfulness). Since there is no objective morality (moral nihilism): you are free to make your own (I would suggest social contact theory). Since we cannot know what is true outside the fact that I exist in some form (epistemic nihilism): move forward with useful assumptions (I would suggest pragmatism). If nihilism is true, which I have found that it is, we should only work with it. Never fight the truth. ",
