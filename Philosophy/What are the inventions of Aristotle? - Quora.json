            "answer_text": "Did you know that everything on Earth is composed of fire, water, air, and Earth? Aristotle knew that. Well he thought he knew them. So why are we so sure of what we \u201cknow\u201d? Anything that scientists claim to know nowadays has been proven in experiments, so I guess that's a difference. Aristotle is very well known as the most famous philosopher to study under Plato and as the teacher of Alexander the Great. While he is held in high regard for much of his work in Philosophy, many of his \u201cdiscoveries\u201d would not hold up to modern day scrutiny. Considering his belief in the 4 elements listed earlier (plus a heavenly element he added), his work in alchemy held us back more than it moved us forward, because people accepted his false teachings as the truth for many years. But what were his contributions to science? His work in Biology is still read today to some extent, and those discoveries were backed by accurate observations. Some of his discoveries in Biology: Dolphins are not fish because they give birth to live young and they have lungsHe classified animals into groups and he coined a term still used today: genusHis placement of animals into groups based on shared characteristics was used for hundreds of years.He made errors in Biology also, such as his belief that men had more teeth than women. His work in Geology was also quite advanced for his time. He believed that Earth's surface features changed, but on a much longer time scale than a human\u2019s life. His work in Astronomy and Physics was much more impaired by his focus on Philosophy. Instead of making experiments for many of his theories, he would instead think about them until he thought he had it figured out. His beliefs became the standard and they eventually became the beliefs of the Church many centuries later, and to question his beliefs was to question the Church, a big no-no at the time. So where would we be without this guy?  Possibly more advanced! But it looks like we'll never know. ",

            "answer_text": "-Logic -Biology -Physics -Metaphysics Of that list, logic, I think, is the only one that is indisputably his. Biology also really starts with Aristotle. Though many Greek philosophers before him formulated various abstract conceptions of how the physical world works, Aristotle\u2019s physics was the first form of physics that even closely resembles modern physics from Newton onwards in terms of its systematicity. Plato talked about things that might be considered part of metaphysics, but again, Aristotle was the first to truly study it and make it a unique discipline. ",
