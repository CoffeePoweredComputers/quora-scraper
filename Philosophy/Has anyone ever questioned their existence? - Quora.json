            "answer_text": "Yes invariably almost everyone going through the human experience is bound to question their existence, question this mundane survivalistic lifestyle given to us by the society, or let's say anyone beyond a minimum threshold of intelligence is bound to question his/her own existence at some point in life. A minimum threshold of intelligence is needed to have such question, dumb people are always interested, involved, excited full of meaningless hopes from the future, they dont see & they don't question, even that requires a bare minimum intelligence. So the people who've questioned their existence aren't really important, there are many, New ones everyday when faced with some challenges or difficulties in life would have this question arising within themselves. On The other hand ones who've answers to the question of their own existence are important, they're are the very salt of the earth, they're the reason life still exists on this earth & humanity is still alive, they're the enlightened ones, the awakened ones simply known as Buddha's. They've found the answer to their existence, they've experienced themselves one with the entire existence, their boundaries have disappeared, they've realised themselves as limitless, formless consciousness. It's not that they've found some definitive answers because something as arbitrary as life cannot have definitive answers, there are Infact No answers, it's that they've dropped out of all questions because all questions are meaningless & all answers lead to further questions. It's an endless game and Dropping all the questions is the answer. Attaining a questionless state free of mind is the answer. Silence is the answer Becoming a Buddha is the answer, realizing your existence & becoming one with this entire universe or existence as one might call it is the answer. ",

They'd rather watch all the movies all the time and given a choice hire someone to do the thinking for them. Unfortunately, just like steel cannot be tempered without going through fire, the onus is on the individual. These things cannot be forced. Some wake up at 8, some are asleep at 80. ",
