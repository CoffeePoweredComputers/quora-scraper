            "answer_text": "No. E.g. to be the world\u2019s best at anything almost surely will require a top hand of genetics. Even if you work to the max to achieve it, those with better genetics will still beat you. Even in lesser degrees of achievement a good hand of genetics still helps. And even then, likely you will need to have realized your desire extremely early in life - perhaps almost surely involving it not really being your, but your parents\u2019 or coaches\u2019 decision, to put you into it, e.g. like with sports. Critical periods of development are as vital as a gene; if you miss them, skills you could have learned then become unlearnable to the same extent later on as the brain stops being neuroplastic in the ways required to achieve that learning - e.g. the canonical example is language, esp. your first language, but also your second language is still most easily learned while around the ages of 6\u20138 years (200\u2013250 Ms) tops and then declines thereafter to adult-like levels. But sports science has also shown there exist similar critical periods for certain kinds of motor skills development relevant in athletics, and thus if they are missed, athletic performance will be significantly reduced. Even if you may train very hard for many years, those years will never quite go as far as they would had they come a lot earlier in life. What you need to do is find how to harmonize your wants and your capacities, and then maximize the synergy of the two so the former will fuel the development of the latter to their greatest extent. You will not get a product that can be rightfully compared to anyone else\u2019s, nor should it be. You don\u2019t have to be the best - if you do that, you are being a society person and not yourself. ",

Get money for free from someone who can fund it legally, no robbing or stealing. If your desires are not realistic then move on to your next realitic \u2018want\u2019. Remember want doesn\u2019t equate to need and there\u2019s always trade offs. I wanted many things badly at one time but realized most are unnecessary and impulsive desires masking real issues. I eventually identified the issues and am working on them. It\u2019s convenient to delay issues with impractical/unrealistic wants so we can procrastinate longer, eventually you still have to deal with your issues. ",

I would: Attend UCB or StanfordAcquire an undergraduate degree in engineeringObtain an MBA from HBS or WhartonClimb the fortune 500 ladderI achieved my first goal because I executed the steps necessary. However, I am certain I will never achieve my last goal. I watched my mother climb the corporate ladder during my youth. She achieved great success, however that came at the cost of her relationships, family, health, and mental state. The hours she committed simply wasn\u2019t favorable for other endeavors. I do not want to execute the same steps. For that particular reason I will never obtain my 10 year old dream. To put it simply, a desire is simply a desire without action. ",
