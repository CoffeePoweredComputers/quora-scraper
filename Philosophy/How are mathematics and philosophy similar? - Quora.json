            "answer_text": "I am going to answer the question: \"how are mathematics and philosophy similar and how are they different?\" which may or may not be what you are asking. I am not an expert in either discipline, and my answer would probably annoy both mathematicians and philosophers. Both mathematics and philosophy aim to answer questions by pure reasoning. Both fields attempt to make assumptions explicit and examine the consequences of those assumptions. Philosophy tackles big questions that might occur to any thoughtful person. To quote Robert Nozick: \"Does life have meaning? Are there objective ethical truths? Do we have free will? What is the nature of our identity as selves? Must our knowledge and understanding stay within fixed limits? These questions moved me, and others, to enter the study of philosophy. I care what their answers are. While such other philosophical intricacies as whether sets or numbers exist can be fun for a time, they do not make us tremble.\" Mathematical questions are narrower and more technical. The \"big questions\" of mathematics (let alone the answers) require years of training to understand and are only accessible to a small group of experts.  The tradeoff is that the narrowness of mathematics allows for real precision. Mathematicians for the most part agree on what their terms mean and what constitutes a correct (or incorrect) argument. It is therefore possible to make progress in mathematics. And mathematics works: not all of it applies to the real world, but mathematical models turn out produce correct (or at least very useful) predictions of how nature actually behaves. Philosophy tries to be precise, but because of its wide scope, it is just too hard. When two philosophers argue the question of whether, in principle, a computer could think, it's hard to know whether each means the same thing by \"computer\" and \"think\" and whether there is anything more to the debate than the different interpretations of those terms.  I don't know of any big philosophical issue where there is anything close to consensus among professionals.  You would be hard pressed to identify \"progress\" in philosophy -- you never hear of universally accepted new breakthroughs.  It is fairly common for philosophers to disavow their early works. In these ways philosophy is unlike mathematics.  This is not to say that philosophy is worthless. Grappling with unanswerable questions is both fun and necessary when building a political system, or writing laws, or deciding how you should live your life. But if you are thinking about something really abstract and making progress, you're probably doing math. ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes nothing at all, sometimes a lot, depending on which area of mathematics and which area of philosophy. Many think G\u00f6del's theorems in mathematics, which tell us about the limits of logic, tell us something important about the nature of the universe and have deep philosophical implications. Questions about existence and what it means to exist have branched two ways, one going off into mathematical logic and set theory and the other going off into non-mathematical philosophy. Whenever a branch of philosophy ends up being quantifiable, it ends up ceasing to be regarded as philosophy and regarded instead as physics or mathematics, so this reduces what would otherwise be a huge overlap. Mathematical logic and computation theory is particularly rich with philosophical implications. For example, there are questions over whether the operations of the brain can be reduced to a symbolic \"formal\" system or not, and whether concrete implementations of formal systems (computers) can be conscious (look up Searle's Chinese Room). The mathematician Roger Penrose regards G\u00f6del's theorems as proof that the human brain does something that a computer cannot replicate, but others disagree. Philosophy and mathematics intersect in physics, which was, after all, originally known as \"natural philosophy\". In the mathematical theory known as quantum mechanics, objects appear not to have definite states until observed, which conflicts with our ordinary intuition at the macroscopic scale. The paradox of Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat is as yet unresolved, but physicists have no problem using the mathematics while not worrying about the philosophical implications. Quantum mechanics has been described (I think by David Bohm) as seeming like the wrong answer to \"if a tree falls in a forest and no-one sees it fall, does it really fall?\". ",

Words in philosophy are not well-defined (save the so-called \"mathematical philosophy\"), which encourages a culture of debate. Although both depends heavily on inference. Mathematics seeks not to explain world phenomena. Mathematical objects are well-defined but are approximation to nature at best. And it's only because of that that it makes sense to talk about proofs in mathematics. However, philosophy of mathematics could be characterized (arguably) as a blend of mathematics (mathematical logic) and philosophy (platonism, formalism, intuitionism). ",
