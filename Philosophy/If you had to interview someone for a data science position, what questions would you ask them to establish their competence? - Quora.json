            "answer_text": "Questions should vary depending of a level of a target position, actual responsibilities and tasks. Requirements to a junior level Data Scientist are quite different form requirements to a senior level Data Scientist because of a big difference in expectations and tasks. Of course the is a lot of levels between them. Here I will not discuss questions to a junior level Data Scientist. Mike West provided a good example of such a list. I will focus of requirements and possible questions to a Senior Level Data Scientist. For such a candidate a knowledge of basic concepts, terms, tools particularly libraries would not be sufficient.I would expect a deep understanding of fundamental concepts, methods and ability thinking creatively, out of box in applying that knowledge to practical tasks. Here a deepness is is generally in a favor to an extensive knowledge. If the candidate can convincingly demonstrate such knowledge and abilities it would be fine having lack on knowledge in any specific method or a library. Most of such questions may have no simple right/wrong variants of answer. The goal would be seeing a way of thinking. That was a general remark. Now I can give some simple examples.For any specific method, for example a specific type of a neural network I would ask describing how does it work inside with key details. A candidate should be able describing a scope of applicability, limitations, strong and week points in specific circumstances.All the answers must be technically argued. Referring to respectful sources would not be sufficient. For example different types of Activation Functions can be compared in specific contexts (it is just a possible example). Another type of a question would giving a specific practical task and asking a candidate describing how he/she would address it. The candidate should say what candidate methods he/she would consider and why. What should be checked as criteria. Here a way of thinking would be more important than a specific result. If a deep understanding and ability would be demonstrated I would not waste time for any specific knowledge checklist. Again this was a general approach to a really senior level candidate. A specific approach may and must very depending of a target position. ",

            "answer_text": "If you had to interview someone for a data science position, what questions would you ask them to establish their competence?The first thing to be aware of are two potential pitfalls in terms of measuring performance (1) Interviewing a candidate regarding a certain set of ML/Data techniques that you are familiar with, but neglecting the candidates overall quantitative skill. (2) Interviewing purely for quantitative skill, but neglecting job specific skills. In the first case, you may get a candidate who seems great for a given project, but who\u2019s performance may stagnate and skills will not transfer to other projects. Let\u2019s say you hire a former financial quant type who has worked with regression and time series models. They may answer every time series question you throw at them perfectly, but in a years time, they might not have added anything new to your companies time-series model. In the second case, you may find a candidate that seems great on paper, but requires months or years of training. For example, many economists and statisticians will have VERY strong quantitative skills and fundamentals, but may take years to ramp up to more advanced deep learning projects. This isn\u2019t easy, and many interviewers will stick to what works best for them. That could be either asking something extremely specific to their world view of data science. Or, it could be asking taxing quantitative problems that all but a few solve (or most likely get lucky on). One approach is to try to ask questions that find some middle ground between these two extremes. However, I would recommend trying to avoid the pitfalls entirely. How do we avoid these pitfalls? We need to go back to the root problem we are trying to solve. How do we gauge competence? The most important way to gauge the general competence of a data scientist is to focus on evaluating problem solving skills. The only real way to do this is to ask open-ended questions. If you, as the interviewer, already have the optimal solution pinned down, it\u2019s probably not that great a question. Some examples of good open ended questions: What model would you use for this NLP problem. Explain some piece of research that you have done in five minutes. What tools would you use to process data at scale X. An interview is meant to tell you as much as possible the person you are interviewing. An open ended question that can be solved in a few different ways tells you a lot about the type of person you are interviewing. One interview question I worked with involved computing the expectation of some game. The key for why this was a good question was that I gave the interviewee the option to solve it directly with math, with software assisted approaches, or any mix of both. I knew of 3 solutions to the problem that ranged from heavy simulation to pure math. Because I focused on the problem solving nature of the task, I could learn things about the candidate from this question such as How does this person fit on the scientist/engineer spectrum? Do they take the first approach that comes to mind? Can they work with ambiguity and still find a solution? All of this can be learned on top of the standard understanding of how much prompting they need, are they bullshitting, etc. The truth is, good interviews require commitment from the interviewer. So why are purely quantitative or recall/domain-specific questions so common? Large companies generally employ these strategies, at one end of the spectrum or other because (i) it is easy to develop these kinds of questions (ii) it is easy to standardize the interview process (iii) they can play the numbers game for good candidates. In practice, this actually works pretty well for large companies. However, despite how common questions like these are in industry, I think it\u2019s probably the case that smaller companies or departments will generally suffer if they try to emulate those interviewing strategies exactly.
