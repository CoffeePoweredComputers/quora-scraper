            "answer_text": "Dear Kevin, in response to your question Are you awaiting a great truth, that will help you change your life? NO, I am not awaiting an EPIPHANY of any type that will help change my life. My life will change because I am implementing plans for change. I go out every day with positive anticipation and thinking. My efforts, my energy, my perseverance will get me to the finish line. I am courageous enough to believe in myself and my principles. Life is a PROCESS built in incremental and chronological steps, and I checked off most of them. Most importantly, I enjoy a happy and fulfilling life, I continue to add positive experiences to my life; my GOALS set to purchase real estate; go to college; raise a son who I am very proud of; learn a lot about the legal system and do more traveling have been implemented or accomplished. The truth I know is derived from spiritual development and life experiences. Each person should formulate a life plan and execute it. ",
