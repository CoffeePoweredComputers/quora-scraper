            "answer_text": "I am not a medic of any kind but I would think there are many ways this could happen. A person could be actively dying and fall into a coma before they die. A person may have little oxygen getting to their brain so may be unconscious, or semi-conscious, before they die. Someone could be brain dead, and therefore have no brain activity. If someone is in intensive care, and they were in pain, the medics would give strong pain killers, such as morphine, so pain would be controlled fully, or as much as possible, before they die. Someone with a serious illness, may not be in pain but could die of a sudden cardiac arrest, where the heart just stops and they would lose consciousness quickly from lack of blood to the brain. Someone who is critically ill with Covid 19, for example, may need to go onto a ventilator. To do this they would be under full anaesthetic. They may develop sepsis that can\u2019t be controlled, their heart could stop, they could become brain dead, and so they would be removed from the ventilator and die. Anaesthesia literally means \u201closs of sensation\u201d, so no pain involved. Someone with medical knowledge could correct any mistakes I made. ",
