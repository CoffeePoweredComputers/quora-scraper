            "answer_text": "No doctrine original to the Indian sub-continent can be called \u2018philosophy\u2019 in a conventional sense. Because streams of thought original to that part of the world have never been just a theoretical basis of understanding knowledge/ truth, but have largely been complimentary pairs of \u2018ideals\u2019 and \u2018practices\u2019 intended to: (a)impart theoretical understanding (b) also prescribe practices for realizing them in a practical sense. When viewed this way, an Indian school of thought is termed a d\u00e1r\u015bana (\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0928) and the science concerning with study of various d\u00e1r\u015banas is called tattva-sh\u0101stra (\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u200b) which roughly translates to: Tattva = An object being itself ; sh\u0101stra = science Thus philosophy in India has always been the \u2018science of that being itself\u2019. Vedas Off the very many schools of thought originating from Indian sub-continent, the most primal and the most significant of them all is called the ve\u0300das. Though its origin is believed to be eternal, the credit of bringing them to human cognizable form are attributed as utterances of Rishis (saints) aboriginal to Eastern Punjab region and the fertile plains between rivers Ganga and Yamuna[math]^{[1]}[/math]. Initially undivided, the Vedas were later organized and split into 4 main branches : Rig-veda , Yajur-veda, Sama-veda and Atharva-veda by Krishna Dvaip\u0101yana - more widely known as veda-vyasa who is also the author of Mahabh\u0101rat\u0101. Vedas contain 3 main parts : Samhita, Braahman\u0302a and Aran\u0302yaka. \u201cSamhita means that which is collected and arranged. It brings out the purport of Vedas in the shape of mantras (hymns), systematically arranged.\u201d [math]^{[2]}[/math] Braahman\u0302a extensively lists and describes the procedure for rituals. Samhitas when translated to action are called Yajnas. Braahman\u0302as act as a guide book for performing these Yajnas. The third part of the Vedas are the \u2018Aran\u0302yakas\u2019 (aran\u0302ya = forest). They are prescribed practices to contemplate upon the highest ideal of life while in the solitude of a forest after one has completed one's duties as a householder through the first two parts. The essence of elaborate practices of vedas were later condensed in the Upanishads. Each of which are distinct methods prescribing mental inquiry into the nature of ultimate truth. \u201cPrimarily they represent a spirit different from and even hostile to the ritual, and embody a theory quite distinct from the one that underlies the sacrificial teachings in the Braahman\u0302as\u201d[math]^{[3]}[/math] This system then gradually transitioned to several schools of thought during the post vedic times; some of which were in accordance with vedic practices (orthodox) and some that developed as a resistance to them (heterodox) . Non-Vedic Schools Materialism or the ch\u0101rv\u0101ka school, Jainism and Buddhism Vedic Schools Ny\u0101ya-Vaisheshika, S\u0101nkhya-Yoga and Mi\u0304m\u0101msa school Ved\u0101nta Development of post vedic schools of thought and the indefiniteness of the Upanishads led to the need of systematization of vedic teachings. Unifying the essence of Upanishads and harmonious combination of teachings from all other vedic schools has been the chief feature of Ved\u0101nta. Etymologically , Ved\u0101nta translates to \u2018culmination of Vedas' and also as \u2018heart of Vedas\u2019 . Vedanta can be further divided into two streams absolutistic (Advaita) and theistic (Vishistadvaita and Dvaita).
