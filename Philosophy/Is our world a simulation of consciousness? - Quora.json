            "answer_text": "Simulation- meaning - imitation of a situation or process.the production of a computer model of something, especially for the purpose of study.The world is not a simulation , it has its own level of existence. Advaita's explanation is a good and valid one. The world is 'maya' . Maya is not simulation or illusion, it has existence like a dream, that is it is real in your sleep. When you are awake it is not there. But underlying consciousness is always there, which is real. Similarly the consciousness is real in our waking state also and the external world is a cosmic play or a play of our minds.",

            "answer_text": "Something like that, more like a dream of consciousness. Consciousness is infinite, and unknowable. As so, that which is, aka consciousness, experiences itself through the mind, a collective of separated clouds, in an open mind screen or sky. The cloud dynamics are really not separated, as everything is consciousness or blue sky. ",
