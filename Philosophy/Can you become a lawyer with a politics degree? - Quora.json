            "answer_text": "All that matters is going to a law school land then passing the bar. BTW, I once looked into this. Technically, you can still become a lawyer the old fashioned way, as Abe Lincoln did, without law school, although fewer than 1% of lawyers do that today. So, without going to law school it\u2019s still possible if you: Pass the bar exam.Find a law firm to endorse you. Generally, this means you are going to have to apprentice as a para-legal for a while.But generally, you need a law degree from an accredited law school in the USA (or whatever country you\u2019re going to practice in). To get into law school, the minimum requirement is generally that you have a four-year degree of some kind (Bachelor\u2019s). However it absolutely doesn\u2019t have to be politics or \u201cpre-law.\u201d You\u2019re better off majoring in just about anything that you can get high grades in. Although, the premiere law schools want to know if you can write papers\u2026 so English or other humanities degrees do have an edge there. Interesting note: In the film \u201cCatch Me if You Can,\u201d Leo DiCaprio\u2019s character passes the bar, and qualifies to be a lawyer, without going to college or law school. When asked how he passed the bar exam, he says that he just studied very hard for it! Of course, that character was practically a genius. ",
