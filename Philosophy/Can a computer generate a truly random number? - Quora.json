            "answer_text": "I read somewhere that a computer can not generate a random number, is this true? Absolutely true. All the truly random number generators are analog sensors used as peripherals to the processor. The only \u201crandom numbers\u201d a computer can generate on its own are \u201cpseudo-random numbers\u201d and generate a sequence of numbers depending on a seed value that is used to compute the next seed and return a value. These are pseudo-random in that they depend on a given starting point, and if that same starting point is used, then the sequence is identical. This is very handy for running tests where you need the same sequence, or anytime you need the sequence repeated. But it is not random. Some generators will use a truly random number obtained from a peripheral, then use that as the seed for a sequence. This works almost as well as always using a truly random number, and only breaks down in extreme cases where the pseudo-random number generator itself fails\u2026 permitting a seed value to be predicted. The reason for doing it this way is that it takes time to get a true random number value (microseconds and longer), which can slow down the application using them. Other methods used are a combination of the two, using the truly random number to tweak the seed (this is \u201centropy gathering\u201d) which improves the random sequence, but can suffer the \u201centropy\u201d to be exhausted by taking too many random values faster than the entropy is added. If a system is lacking a true random number source, then a fallback is to use time intervals based on interrupts, with the assumption that the interrupt intervals are actually random. The problem this adds is that actions carried out by the computer are not truly random - and that can allow the prediction of the random sequence. To mitigate that weakness things like collecting intervals of independent devices (keyboard, mouse, disks, networks), will be \u201csufficiently\u201d random that forced sequences will not be generated.

            "answer_text": "\u201cIs anything truly random\u201d is a good question and the answer is \u201cmaybe?\u201d Its is nearly 100% correct to say that computers can\u2019t generate truly random numbers. Its also a highly important of cryptography and there is a absolute tonne of examples out there of people finding ways to generate the strongest random numbers possible from increasingly weirder sources (google lavarand as an example). Using the breakdown of radioactive material is also thought to be a good source of entropy (chaos). It doesn\u2019t really matter if something is random or not - whats important is unpredictability. We might say for example that radioactive decay is unpredictable but it may just be that we haven\u2019t figured out what causes it so for humans its unpredictable. In cryptography we talk about strong random number generation vs weak. Its really up to the operating system the computer is running (or somethings the software in use) to generate those numbers. To date, every form of random number generation (in isolation) has been broken due to being predictable in one form or another (on your average computer that is). Operating systems these days use many sources of (hopefully) hard-to-predict input to generate random numbers and that\u2019s the key. One of the best sources of random (though it goes down over time) is actually the person sitting in front of it. You can never really predict how fast people are going to type or when they\u2019ll stop to think about what it is they\u2019re typing (same applies to their mouse usage). As an example, linux uses hard disk operations, mouse movements, keyboard inputs (etc), and these days we also have cpu and motherboard hardware for helping to generate random numbers. All of them (by themselves) are potentially breakable, for example if i were a network admin, i can easily see the network traffic going in and out of a computer, if this were the only source for generating random numbers I can easily predict what numbers that computer is going to start generating (or at least, i can narrow it down to the point that i can test all possibilities pretty quickly). The point is, computers never rely on a single source of input to generate random numbers and mix in a whole variety of sources as any single source is potentially breakable and the hope is that no one can really predict all the sources of entropy to a system well enough to narrow down the random numbers the computer might generate (with the goal of ultimately breaking the computers ability to encrypt data). Ultimately the goal is to be unpredictable but no one can ever really say a computer is capable of generating truly random numbers. ",

            "answer_text": "I would like to know if computers rely on the exact time the code runs to create a pseudo-random number. If we divide up the time of day into say 10-minute intervals and divide each 10-min. interval into say one billion small divisions, then the time the algorithm runs within that 10-minute interval can affect the random number generation somehow. It will be based on highly unpredictable aspects of human behavior. It would become less and less predictable the smaller the time window we use (10 mins is probably way too long. Perhaps we can go as low as windows that are one second long). However, to make it even less predictable and more random-appearing, this can be modulated by considering which 1-second interval within the present 10-minute interval we're looking at, which 10-minute interval within the hour, which hour in the day and which day of the week and in the calendar year. I think combining all this information could enhance a random number algorithm. Others mentioned using some kind of sensor for environmental noise can be used. However I'd also want to mention that we can never guarantee that something is \"truly\" random and it's not even philosophically clear what this means. Even if we use direct quantum effects, does randomness inhere in the particles or is it merely a statement about limitations in being able to measure their state? Ultimately, all quantum mechanics tells us is what we can predict we'd observe if we were to make a measurement. The randomness part tells us that we can only predict up to some probability distribution. So is uncertainty only in what we observe or what \"there is\"? In fact I would even challenge the notion of \"what there is\" apart from an observer, but this is a different topic. ",

            "answer_text": "A Turing machine cannot create entropy, so cannot generate true random numbers. There are psuedo-random number generators and Deterministic Random Bit Generators, or various grades. NIST approve DRBGs based on SHA256 which can only be distinguished from a true random number with 2^128 effort unless you know the seed. This has been analysed by many cryptographers not working for NIST - so is reasonably trustworthy. However, they need to be seeded. There are various ways of doing this. You can take environmental noise, typing speeds, disk access times, internet traffic. However all of those can be faked and influenced. Ideally you would use specialized hardware. The most common are thermal noise collected from revered biased zener diodes. Usually two in parrallel in a \u201chumbucking\u201d configuration to eliminate external influence. Multiple free running ring oscillators are also common. Timing nuclear decay is also used. We believe these give us \u201ctrue\u201d randomness. However, in all cases, you need to analyse the circuitry used to gather the data very closely. Or if you do not have th skills to do that, read the reports from NIST or BSI - who do have people who can. Or just look for their certification if you cannot understand the report. If you just want to play patience, you can probably use /dev/random. If you are trying to keep secrets from the sate, you need something better. ",

            "answer_text": "Generating a true random number is hard. Most computers use a combination of mathematical algorithms and as much entropy as they can find. However, that is more difficult than one might imagine. Algorithm First, the algorithm. Computers use something called a pseudo random number generator (PRNG). A PRNG takes an initial seed value and spits out bits or bytes that appear random. Streams of bytes from these algorithms must pass standard statistical tests if the generator is to be considered secure. The algorithms also have extremely long periods. That is, although every PRNG may start repeating a sequence at some point (no PRNG can be truly random), it must take a really long time (eg 10^60 bytes) before a stream repeats its output. One important point, any PRNG will produce the same sequence given the same seed. This is not a defect, it's by design. No PRNG should be given the same seed, if it's to be considered secure. Which, bring us to the next point\u2026 Initial Seed or Entropy When security people think of random numbers and their generators, they think in terms of entropy. This is a lot like the concept of entropy in physics. Close, but not exactly the same. In any event, when we want to seed a PRNG, we want bits that are highly entropic or non guessable. Now, at first blush, this may appear to be a simple task. It is not. For example, some items that may appear highly entropic but are not (they could be guessed or might repeat): Current time - guessableProcess ID - often the same upon restartUptime - can be guessable, sometimes detectableAmbient noise - in a machine room may be constant or no external micHundreds of parallel threads run to generate data - may behave the same every time!Ambient Temperature - may be steady stateAmbient Light - computers often in interior roomsAmbient Radio waves - may be overwhelmed by nearby EMSo, how do the most secure seeds get generated? One method uses radioactive decay. A Gieger counter or similar detector listens to a radioactive isotope tracking the time between decays or the decay count within some short time period. Atomic decay on a short time scale is truly random. Another method, and my personal favorite, is to use a lava lamp with a camera. In this setup, a lava lamp has lots of bubbly colored liquid floating up and down and an external camera picks up the image and converts it to a digital (often hashed) value. The fundamental variability of the liquid in the lamp creates the entropy. lavarand [dot] org used to run a free service supplying lava lamp generated random numbers. Sadly, no longer. I should add that theoretically /dev/random provides random numbers and /dev/srandom provides secure random numbers. However, both of these are often PRNGs and not pure entropic bit generation. Whether the values from these sources are truly secure depends upon the hardware implementation. Summary Random Number Generators contain two parts: an entropic initial seed generator and a pseudo random number generator. The seed is passed into the PRNG which provides the final byte stream of random numbers. ",

            "answer_text": "Not an algorithm, but a physical device or a complicated system with sufficient outside entropy sources (including thermal noise, metastable latches, network activity, etc). I am assuming that by random you mean statisticaslly unpredictable. For some reason, many people have semi-religious beliefs about randomness (Einstein famously claimed that God does not play dice, but was proven wrong using quantum-physics experiments). It seems more appropriate to look at the facts.  Modern CPUs include physical random number generators that can be read by software (and I am not referring to pseudorandom numbers here). On Linux systems, /dev/random is a good source of random numbers, but may be slow when there isn't enough entropy. /dev/mrandom is faster, but may be \"less random\".  You can also buy commercial random number generators based on quantum physics (as random as it gets), but for most applications they are no better than standard facilities in your computer.  For numerical applications, pseudorandom numbers are often sufficient, and are typically more appropriate, since you want some repeatability for debugging purposes (there are some nice tricks you can play with software here). It's a little tricky to generate consistent random numbers in parallel, but there's a great recent paper from DE Shaw Research (with D.E.Shaw as a coauthor) on this. Also....From the Wikipedia: RdRand is an instruction for returning random numbers from an Intel on-chip hardware random number generator. RdRand is available in Ivy Bridge processors and is part of the Intel 64 and IA-32 instruction set architectures. The random number generator is compliant with security and cryptographic standards such as NIST SP 800-90A, FIPS 140-2, and ANSI 9.82.  The generator uses an on-processor entropy source, which passes the randomly generated bits to an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) (in CBC-MAC mode) conditioner to distill the entropy into non-deterministic random numbers. A deterministic random-bit generator is seeded by the output from the conditioner, providing cryptographically secure random numbers to applications requesting them via the RdRandinstruction. One of the standards it relies on, NIST SP800-90 contains four random number generators. The random number generators with the names CTR_DRBG (used by RdRand), Hash_DRBG, and HMAC_DRBG[4] are made of uncontroversial cryptographic primitives used in an uncontroversial manner, but the remaining one, Dual_EC_DRBG, is known to be kleptographic.

            "answer_text": "Not normally, but there are exceptions. For normal purposes you don't really need random numbers, just things close enough to random. It is in fact a bonus if you can generate the same random stream so you can make the exact same raytrace again, or the exact same \u201crandom\u201d game level from a small seed (like 48 bits) rather then saving 100s of wall segments and such. However for generating crypto keys and nonces, and probably even for things like games of chance with real money riding on it you need to do a lot better! For pseudo random numbers you will likely use something like a LCRG, some multiplying a little addition a modulo, oh and some addition. They are fast and random enough to be hard to guess (but given enough samples you can guess the sequence). For real cryptographic random numbers you start with a random seed (we will get back to that), mix in any sources of enthropy you can get (again we will get back to that), add a counter and then apply a one way hash. There are some additional wrinkles but that is the basic shape of it. If the one way hash is a good function you can't figure out the seed by looking at samples & you can't figure out the next values in the sequence by looking at prior values. If the hash is bad then the game is up, then again if we do t have a secure hash we don't have a working SSL (https) or most of the rest of modern crypto, so we can assume we have one, but we may need to upgrade it every decade or maybe twice a decade. The interesting thing is where to get the initial seed. Some system have some hardware sources of randomness, but they are not always though highly of, and they are fairly rare. Most modern Unix & Unix like systems do things like keep precise track of when various interrupts occur and use the low few bits of the time stamps as an enthropy source. Which works if a person has interacted directly with a system, or if it has things like spinning disks. I think it is less reliable with SSDs, and definitely can be problematic on a virtual machine where the low bits of timers might not actually be real! If the initial seed is limited, but you have real sources if enthropy initial random. I bets won't be very random, but \u201clater\u201d ones should be. If the initial seed is random the initial numbers will be random, later ones will be more like a stream cypher with no feedback, which is considered weak, but I don't know if a practical attack is known. I would love to tell you how real world headless (think machine room servers) get around that, but I don't actually know. Ditto for VM cloud instances. Maybe servers actually tend to have real hardware RNGs to seed from, and VM instances pretend they do and the host hardware either gives them its software crypto RNG as a virtual RNG, or has a real RNG to offer. I'm not doing security on cloud devices though, and somehow it is an area of research I missed. Maybe another answer to this question will fill in this corner. (It is also possible that the answer is \u201cnobody worries about it\u201d, which is also \u201chey a new attack vector for credit card fraud! Expect to see it in the news at some point\u201d) ",

Not truly random. The problem is that we know most things to be deterministic\u2014and \u201cmost things\u201d includes computers. The engineering solution to that is getting the next-best thing to true randomness: A value so obfuscated and difficult to follow, it might as well be random. We have different \u201clevels\u201d of obfuscation like that. There\u2019s classical pRNGs that computers use (which, on a conceptual level, always output the same sequence of numbers over and over\u2014but ideally the sequence is so long it doesn\u2019t matter). A step above that is measuring a physical phenomenon that\u2019s difficult to trace back (called a \u201csource of entropy\u201d).

A software only \"Pseudo-random number generator\" will not give you truly random results.  Adding the computer's time-of-day clock to the generation process will help to create truly random results. One technique which should work is to record high speed clock values when input interrupts occur.  This could be used as a new seed for a pseudo-random number generator or just to produce a single result.  It is not guaranteed to be really random.  This depends on how many external events are really involved in the process.  When the number of external influences  is beyond comprehension then the results should be truly random.  An example of this kind of system might be a large server recording the arrival time of packets from a large number of users.  This would not work if the bandwidth of the input path becomes a limit.  Then the arrivals would be very regular according to the bandwidth.  I'm sure a creative person could come up with all sorts of external events to use for this purpose. ",

            "answer_text": "The question and some of the answers miss the point that computers do generate truly random numbers. All computers need to generate random numbers is a source of entropy. Most computers have a huge variety of sources of entropy. For home computers and Laptops the time since booting up is a source of entropy.Most computer CPUs have integrated hardware number generators that are a source of entropy.CPUs are also a source of entropy because of the unpredictability of status changes inside the CPU, speeds of cores change depending on load and temperature, there are caches and branch prediction so very precise timing of how long the CPU takes to do something is also a source of entropy.User interaction can be a source of entropy.A sound card with an input is a source of entropy (this is for example used by the linux package randomsound).Every device that has error-detection or error-correction for bit-flips can be used to get entropy (although devices with few errors only gather entropy slowly)Network traffic can be a source of entropy. Especially wireless network traffic. Especially if you can capture precise timings of the network traffic and error-correction information.Computers can collect the entropy from all the sources and combine them to generate random numbers. Which is in fact what Linux does and I guess MacOS, and Windows do similar things. When I say \u201ccombining\u201d I don\u2019t mean using the entropy to seed a random generator. ",

I'm no computer programmer, my answer will be based on logic and basic knowledge. Let's say a computer generates a random number based on the air flowing at a particular coordinate, we can say that the speed of air is a random number, but is it truly a random number? Let's say the air flow was controlled by the Labrador current which in turn was controlled by the gulf currents, this goes on forever until and unless a loop is formed, for example: airflow at coordinate controlled by Labrador controlled by gulf current controlled by the air flow at coordinate, any one of the above values will help us determine the other making the system deterministic. Now let's suppose earth was a closed system and free from external energy, in that case loops eventually would keep forming making earth a deterministic system, but earth is not a closed system, it is supplied by external energies from all over the universe. Supposing the universe is infinite, we have infinite possibilities and things can be random. Supposing the universe is not infinite, loops will form and things can be deterministic, though impossible to calculate. This theory is solely provided by me and may have infinite flaws, don't use is as a reference. ",

The thing is, using a random seed on a pseudo-random number generator (the simplest of which is a \"left shift\" electronic register equivalent to multiplying a number x2) can end up in generating good, random data with a lot more bandwidth than the few bits used in the input. By including the Joule effect in the digital world it is possible to create a true random number generator by fiddling with a gimmick unstable SR flip-flop, as used in 2013+ Intel platforms.  see Jacob VanWagoner's answer to How does the circuit in Intel's True Random Number Generator work? The only criteria for randomness is that over a very long period of time, the rate between binary 0 and 1s should be 50:50.This means that very long sequences of a single kind of bit, such as \"1111...\" are possible, but highly unlikely.

            "answer_text": "Question Answered: \u201cI read somewhere that a computer can not generate a random number, is this true?\u201d The answer to this question is dependent upon whether the universe is truly and entirely deterministic (which may be the case) or whether truly random events occur in nature. A true random number generator cannot exist in a deterministic universe. In a universe that is deterministic, everything is the inexorable result of prior activity, such that no other thing is possible. By contrast, something is random if it can be one thing or another without regard to what comes before it. Within the paradigm of determinism, nothing is random and everything is seemingly random at the same time. Nothing is random in a deterministic universe, because everything is inexorably caused by prior activity and can be only as it is and no other way. Accordingly, in a deterministic universe, a true random number generator cannot exist, because a true random number cannot exist. Notwithstanding the fixed nature of everything within a deterministic universe, many things (if not all things) are seemingly random (or, at minimum, \u201cprobabilistic\u201d), because it is theoretically impossible to know for certain from within that universe precisely what effects past causes will bring about. As best I can tell, a true random number generator cannot exist even in a probabilistic universe, except that a probabilistic universe holds out the minute possibility of the logic that drives a random number generator failing to produce the programmed result at some point. By contrast, a deterministic universe allows for the possibility of the logic that drives a random number generator failing to produce the programmed result only if that occurrence is within the inexorable path forged by prior events.

            "answer_text": "YES TL;DR Firstly, \"true random number\" does have a technical definition. A true random number generator (TRNG) (or, in the language of FIPS 140-2 (Page on nist.gov) a \"nondeterministic\" random number generator) derives the randomness in its output from a physical source of entropy. Common entropy sources are photon emissions from quantum systems, thermal noise in semiconductors, and radioactive decays. Note that these quantum bases of entropy are unpredictable in the strictest sense, meaning that you can't know the next number no matter how much information you have about the system. There is simply no way (according to our current understanding of the laws of physics) to predict in advance how much time will elapse between any two gamma ray emissions from a radioactive source, or between two photon emissions due to electron energy level transitions. TRNGs can indeed be constructed using only digital circuit elements. In fact, the latest generations of Intel CPUs contain a digital-only TRNG based on multiple oscillators.* It is also possible to generate random bits on most computers even if they lack this special hardware because multiple, software accessible clocks (aka oscillators) are present on virtually every modern architecture. * I do not know for certain that they are using this method, but it is the most likely design choice based on some patents Intel has filed, news releases from Intel labs, and the general state of the art in the field.

Or at best you had a 1 in 100 chance of doing so.  I'll bet you think that was rigged.  That I cheated you somehow.  Well, now think about it.  How?  How did I cheat? Well of course, if you refresh the page and read it again, then suddenly your odds of guessing it improve to 100% don't they? And that, ladies and gentlemen is the true definition of \"random\".  It's something for which you did not have a model for guessing in a deterministic manner before you knew it, and which does not apply in any way to things that you know already. Just to make it clear, if you shuffle a normal deck of cards and pick out the 7 of diamonds, the odds of doing that are 100%.  Because you know what the card is already.  It's only 1 in 52 if you have not yet picked the card (and your shuffling is uniform). Randomness is about a phenomenon that you know has an outcome but you don't know what it is, and cannot discern it through your own power.  It has nothing to do with the quality of the generator, or the entropy source or whether or not it comes from cosmic background radiation or what. For example, I only have the first few digits of pi memorized.  So for me, if I just say, start picking the digits of pi after, say, the 50th decimal place, then this is a perfect source of random numbers between 0 and 9 inclusive for me.  Because I have no idea what these digits are.  They are not random in the sense of being different every time, or nobody being able to predict them. So randomness is a matter of perspective, not just a matter of entropic character. Now what you probably mean is a universal random number.  That is to say a source random numbers that nobody can predict.  Well in that case any difficult to model physics phenomenon, as simple as flipping a coin is good enough. There's no reason to go all exotic with cosmic background radiation sampling or anything like that. ",

If you generate, the best you can, 1 million random numbers and put a mark on a number line for each one, would you see any patterns? Lumpiness? Empty areas? If the coverage is even, then you have a random distribution. However, when you look at a single number at a time, strange things can happen. When you toss a balanced coin and you get 10 heads in a row, would you say the last head was not random? The best way to view a selection of a single random number is that you cannot predict what the number will be ahead of time. It could be the same as the last one or any other possible number. As long as you cannot predict it, it is random. Computers follow instructions. They are deterministic. They produce predictable outcomes. Therefore it is not possible to have a totally unpredictable number. Unless there is some input to a computer from the outside from a \u201crandom\u201d natural phenomenon. However, there is even a metaphysical question as to whether natural phenomenon are predictable. What is a truly random number? ",

Something that you can reproduce at will is not random. That does not even mean that you will find the corresponding initial condition (i.e. the decrypted version) that leads to the output (e.g. an encrypted message) as the pseudo-random generator may not be a one-to-one function, or it may be impossible in practice due to time constraints (e.g. so called one-way functions as e.g. based upon the difficulty of prime factorization). Pseudorandomness is thus just another name for non-randomness (i.e. determinism), but it is the kind of non-randomness that appears to be random on the surface, it is thus statistical randomness (which is very different to true randomness e.g. algorithmic uncomputable randomness, i.e. the kind of randomness that it is impossible to generate by finite mechanical means). Another question is whether true randomness exists, classical mechanics tells it does not, because everything must have a cause. Only uncaused events can be random and those processes do not exist in classical mechanics. Even assuming that quantum fluctuations may be truly random, it is unclear how they may propagate to the coarse graining reality in which we live. Let alone whether quantum randomness is truly algorithmic random, as it is only random under some interpretations of quantum mechanics, but it is not really needed in the theory (the math is only about probabilities, not about requiring uncomputable randomness).

As a result, the replay will not be accurate! This is where seeds come to work, you could generate a random seed from an external factor like time or temperature and then save it to be used in simulations, then the replication will be more accurate that before.

            "answer_text": "This is a common myth. Real, modern computers have a large number of ways of generating truly random numbers. One common way is to measure the latency of hard drive access. The rotation speed of a hard drive is affected by turbulent shear forces between the platters of the drive and the air. These shear forces are believed to be truly random. Another way to generate truly random numbers it to measure the arrival time of network data. This is affected by varying offsets between the CPU clock and the network interface\u2019s bit clock. These are affected both by microscopic zone temperature variations in the quartz crystals and shot noise in the comparators that read the signals from the crystals. These are believed to be truly random. There are lots more examples. In real-world computers, it is not particularly difficult to generate random numbers that are truly random. It\u2019s often difficult to generate them in large quantities, but large quantities are never necessary. ",

They tend to apply a (varyingly)-complicated algorithm to a seed which is derived from something like the time (often adding in the number of times the Random Number Generator has been called), and there are some security attacks based on trying to guess the results used by some crypto algorithms.The Linux kernel has one which is more random than most in that it uses what might be considered truly random input based on user mousing and certain other external and hardware-based events; look into the entropy pool if you're curious about this (I'm not actually sure how truly random it is).If you do need true randomness, there are hardware solutions available which generate an even but very random distribution by doing things like looking at the fluctuation in background radiation levels.

Part of what intel calls the Intel\u00ae Secure Key, previously code-named Bull Mountain Technology instruction set additions, which came out with Ivy Bridge processors (3rd generation Core). One of the only useful instructions intel has added in years; the others they have added are mostly designed to chew up the manpower of the cloners and add negligible improvements. But the random number generator is a real winner! It uses an isolated hardware module immune to attack or observation to generate a super high quality, unpredictable number. ",

            "answer_text": "Of course.  But before you get excited, let's define a few terms. First, there's a distinction between \"random\" and \"predictable\" (and if we were discussing evolutionary biology, I would distinguish \"undirected\" as well).   \"Randomness\" is a hypothesis (or model).  We have probabilistics tests that we can apply to a sequence of numbers and determine how likely it is that these have been generated in confirmance with our model.  Can we \"prove\" a sequence is random?  No.  The best we can do is establish a likelihood.  (This is more useful than it might first appear.  You can't prove a die is loaded just by looking at repeated results, but you can establish how unlikely it is that it's fair.) If you are generating sequences with an algorithm, the sequences may pass our \"random\" hypothesis yet be completely deterministic (and thus predictable).  Non-algorithmic sources may be non-deterministic, but this again comes down to a hypothesis.  I'm willing to believe, for example, that Intel's random number chip was designed correctly, but was the one on my particular processor manufactured to spec?  Has it been subtly damaged since it left the factory?  Is my operating system accessing it correctly?  Am I using the operating system interface correctly in my application? If something goes wrong, I may have a lot less randomness than I thought.  So again, I can test the sequences generated by the chip as establish a confidence level, but I can prove neither that it's random, nor that it's nondeterministic. To sum up:  there is not a method to generate provably random, nondeterministic numbers.  But a computer will let you get arbitrarily close to that, depending on how much blood and treasure you want to expend. ",

            "answer_text": "Can a computer generate a truly random number? I\u2019ve read a bunch of the 100+ answers on here, and these are all decently working established techniques that are described, but I\u2019m surprised that nobody mentioned a simple technique to get a random number with little to no additional hardware. When the computer starts running, set up a timer to increment a value as fast as practical, maybe about once each microsecond or better. It could be a byte, word, or as many bits as can be counted at a rapid rate. Then, set up a means to capture that number with each keystroke input from the user. If the user is entering something and we have a microsecond timer update, there is an extremely small chance that they could strike a key in the time that a timer rolls over from 1 to 256, as it would mean having a repeatability of 256 microseconds for a users motion. Even larger value ranges are practical. Imagine a user able to press a key and release it exactly every 256 microseconds, or even at any speed that is stable enough to remain in harmony of the 256 microsecond interval. Several keystrokes over the course of the first minute of running can give us several random values, or a truly random seed for a pseudo random generator. In effect, the number obtained by an extremely random human being\u2019s response to a keystroke will be random, involving his observance time, arm movement, finger press time, and unknown variables such as their attention and energy level. Add to this the random time interval from when the processor is first powered up, and the crystal frequency drift over time only improves the randomness of later keystroke events. The speed of the timer increment and the number of keystrokes can determine how many random numbers are possible to get. ",

Then you would have created an algorithm that generates truly random numbers. If, on the other hand, what you really meant to ask is, \"Can a function produce a truly random number?\" (This is the question most people are answering when they talk about pseudo-random numbers) then the answer is no. A function takes an input value and produces a single output value. We might not know how the function calculates its output but we do know that every time we put the same input in we get the same output out. ",

            "answer_text": "This is for the most part true. Most computers, when asked to generate a random number, actually use a very long list of sequential numbers in order to generate a \u201crandom\u201d number, then multiplies that with a factor and rounds up or some other math in order to get the number being asked of it. For instance. If you ask the computer to give a random percentile number the code will look something like: rnd()*100 Which gives a \u201crandom\u201d number from the list between .00 and 1 and multiplies that by 100, to give you a randomish number from 0 to 100. Most computers are like this and it's how most applications handle random numbers. The problem is that computers are inherently \u201cdeterministic\u201d - it is follows the code it was programmed to follow. It cannot truly create a random number. There are ways to make it \u201cmore random\u201d by applying more complex algorithms to generate the \u201cpseudo-random\u201d number but in the end it'll still be following a deterministic program. Some programmers have gotten around this limitation as much as possible by introducing more random elements to the values the algorithm uses to create a random number. For instance, you can use the Time clock of the computer as an extra variable down to the second or even millisecond to make the random table even more complex and random. The function would look something like: Rnd()*TimeValue() So that would be reasonably random enough that most applications would be fine with it. You can take it even further, using a sensor like a camera, the mouse or even the keyboard to take external stimulus around the computer as a seed value to randomize the algorithm even further. While not \u201ctruly\u201d random it gets around the problem of determinism by introducing elements outside of the algorithm that are truly non-deterministic. ",

            "answer_text": "If you needed to make a choice at random, you might flip a coin or roll a die. If you did, you'd have a leg up on your computer. That's because computer software can never generate a truly random number. That's not so important when you want to listen to your favorite playlist on shuffle, but when it comes to important areas like security and gambling, it can mean everything! Modern computers can do some pretty amazing things. So why can't they do something as simple as simulating a dice roll? It all comes down to the way computers are programmed. Computers follow algorithms, which are essentially just lists of instructions on how to carry out tasks. They're slaves to their instructions, so they're completely predictable. Still, engineers are pretty savvy, and they've come up with a few different ways to make computers generate something very close to random numbers, even if they can't generate true randomness. One way to come up with seemingly random numbers is with a pseudo-random number generator. Those algorithms use things like mathematical formulas or predetermined number tables to create number sequences that appear random. These days, the algorithms that generate pseudo-random numbers are so good that it would take Sherlock's work to determine that the numbers aren't actually random. Still, it's possible!

That is, given the current state of the computer, you can predict all future states. If you can predict something, it isn\u2019t random. However, computers can use external sources of randomness, such as the arrival of external events (like keyboard or network events), either directly (looking at the times that these events happen) or indirectly (looking at the state of RAM, which is influenced by external events). But there is a limit to the amount (bits/second) of true randomness (entropy) you can extract from such sources. If you really want a lot of truly random numbers, you can use a hardware random number generator. ",

What can seem random to me and you, as human beings, it won\u2019t be for a powerful calculator. Then the concept of \u201crandom\u201d is not possible as long as the result of a process carried out by a computer is concerned. What can improve randomness is the source: most reliable RNG are normally based on things such as atmospheric noise, etc. These should provide always different values for the aforementioned starting parameters. But theoretically, it could be possible to demonstrate how even these are not fully random. The topic that you chose touch lightly philosophy more than math =D I guess there is an amount of randomness depending on the filed in which it is used; for example, in game programming which is my field, no one care so much about how random a number is when it\u2019s used to decide what item you get in Super Mario Kart; things get more serious for example in casinos, like for example in slot machine\u2019s software where is about real money. There, the result given by an RNG is fundamental, of course for the player, but most of all for the casino. I think they are the most concerned on earth about your question. I just think at the story of that hacker who, thanks to the fact that RNG are not so much random, managed to win million of dollars against casinos. So my answer is:don\u2019t stress your mind too much..Yea they are random if don\u2019t go too deep =D For most people they are random enough as long as they don\u2019t have concrete repercussion on reality, like in the case i depicted.

Pick a number between 1 and infinity. If you guessed 173,817,017,716.0183710 then I suppose numbers are not randomly generated. ",

            "answer_text": "To quote John Von Neumann (*), Any one who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin. (*) If you don\u2019t recognise the name, then you\u2019re also in a \u201cstate of sin\u201d, because John von Neumann originated the architecture that all computers (except quantum computers and a few other weird things) conform to. Almost certainly the architecture of every computer you\u2019ve ever used. His point here, is that it\u2019s simply impossible to produce random numbers by numerical means, because numerical methods are both predictable and repeatable. In practical terms, designers \u201cseed\u201d their random numbers using unpredictable quantities obtained from the physical world, such as the microsecond the computer was turned on, or the number of microseconds it takes the user to press a key. Such things are known as pseudo-random \u2014 which is another way of saying \u201ca bit complicated, but not at all random\u201d.  ",

They also feature a PRNG \u2014 Pseudo-Random Number Generator which can be seeded from the TRNG. The advantage with the PRNG is that for testing purposes, given the same seed, you will get the same sequence of numbers. There is more information starting on page 433 of this datasheet. ",

I doubt that you could define \"truly random\" in a satisfactory way that allowed generation of truly random sequences. One way of defining truly random sequences is by means of information theory. To be truly random, the information should increase as you add more numbers to the end of the sequence, and so an infinite truly random sequence would have infinite information. You could measure the information in a finite sequence by the length of the shortest algorithm to generate it. Since an algorithm is finite, the information in the sequence it generates is finite. Therefore, no algorithm can generate a random sequence. ",

However, practical computers can sometimes do things that Turing machines cannot by using physical phenomena which are chaotic, or depend on quantum phenomena. In fact, starting from the Intel i810 chipset, motherboards have had a chip that uses random thermal noise in a chip to generate random bits claimed to be quantum-unpredictable properties which, as we know are truly random. See i810_rng.txt  In recent CPUs, Intel included an instruction called RDRAND that was supposed to do similar things. However, there is some evidence that this RNG has backdoors which might have been enforced by the NSA to help them break encrypted communications -  So RDRAND may not be truly random. Whatever Intel or NSA do, however, it is possible in theory to extract true random numbers from quantum phenomenon. ",

            "answer_text": "Computers do generate random numbers and they don't. That depends on how you define randomness to be. Practically random number generator should generate numbers devoid of any pattern and it the next in the sequence should not be discernible by any means. There are certain cryptographic algorithms that achieve the same to a desirable level. But any such algorithm is a computational process which in real terms cannot be designated as \"True randomisation\". The process of generating true random numbers involves devising a function of measure of some physical process, eg wind speed, electromagnetic field activity, thermal or acoustic noise, radioactive decay. Since these are natural processes, perhaps it can be \"assumed\" to be have no cognizable pattern in their execution. But who knows nature might be running on its own equations. :P ",

But by either creating an entropy pool using events from the computer such as hard disk interrupts, keyboard timings, mouse movements, of other you can create true random numbers which are often used to create better pseudo-random numbers (random numbers generated by software only). There are many hardware devices that can create true random numbers now and most CPUs have some device built-in to allow it. If you simply turn on the microphone and let it capture ambient noise it\u2019s a good source unless the computer is running with no fans and in a vault or something. Other sources of hardware random is nuclear decay, photometrics, noise generation from such things as reverse-biased transistors or thermal noise of resistors, homodyne detection, and avalanche noise.  Both AMD and Intel now have rdrand() instruction that will have the CPU generate a random number from a hardware seeded (and constantly reseeded) entropy pool \u2014 true hardware RNG from your chip (should you trust trust it?) The good old C64 had an unintended hardware random generator because of the noise channel in voice 3 of the SID chip.

ANU Quantum Random Number Server is one source of quantum random numbers. There will be people who tell you that you can use entropy to generate random numbers, but while entropic randomness is sufficient to satisfy most cryptographic needs, entropy does not produce randomness. Entropy simply relies on there being sufficient noise so that the lack of randomness cannot be detected. Entropy generates have failed often and in very interesting ways. They\u2019ve also been around since the 1940s. ",

However good luck predicting which number will appear next without knowing seed and the algorithm. Pseudo Random Numbers are the most common ones. However, software can improve randomness. For example, linux/unix system have two files that act as source of random numbers. /dev/random and /dev/urandom. /dev/urandom will produce infinite stream of pseudo random numbers if you read from it. However, output of /dev/random will be highly random, because it will be using external events (meaning you and your actions) as a ways to increase quality of randomness. The cost of it\u2026 the file can run out of numbers and you\u2019ll need to do something on your computer so the program can generate more./dev/random - Wikipedia Then\u2026 nothing really stops the program from utilizing a hardware random number generator. So, to summarize it: usually a random number generated by a program is not truly random. However, several operating systems and programs have means of producing actual random numbers, or numbers that are close to being fully random. ",

Given the same input and the same state of the system, the answer will always be only one. This is why people have gone out of their way to find ways to make pseudo-random output generators as random as possible. In some cases, this means proving mathematically that the behaviour of said output has properties that are as similar as possible as a true random process. In others, it means choosing an input from a (hopefully) random source and processing it many times over to make it unrecognizable. This is commonly referred to as a seed, and could be anything from the current time in milliseconds to a complex mix of user input (such as mouse movement) and system events. ",

It can go from the serious specialized devices that detect the particles produced by the radioactivity, to the electric circuits brought into the random generation mode, and to the normal input devices used to read the timing of the interaction with the outside world, such as the time when the network packet arrives, or when a user presses a button. The recent Intel processors have a built-in device that collects this kind of randomness from the minor variations of signals inside the computer, and generates the random numbers from it with the instruction RDRAND. Note that this doesn\u2019t contradict the full predictability: the computer is fully predictable only when viewed as a digital device, but this idealized digital device is implemented with the physical analog circuits, so there is a good deal of randomness going on below the digital level.

They are infact, completely deterministic. After all they are a result of some pre-determined steps that the computer executes. The common structure for such a program is having a \u2018seed' and an algorithm to generate random numbers. The seed is an input to the algorithm, based on which the random numbers are generated, making it a function of the seed. Hence, if you know the seed, you know the random number (that's not so \u2018random'). Such algorithms are known as pseudorandom number generators. Still the word \u201crandom\u201d appears with a qualifier \u201cpseudo\u201d because these numbers pass various statistical tests for randomness. For practical purposes, you can treat them as random numbers, as long as the seed is concealed. And since the randomness of the numbers depends upon the seed, one effective way to turn a pseudorandom number generator into a true random number generator, is to make the seed random. That is take input from some external source like air pressure etc, within good decimal accuracy, convert it into the seed-range using some algorithm, and input it. Now, since you have no control on seed, your numbers are random. ",

Most of these number eventually re-cycle though, part of why they are pseudo-random. To make the generated number even more random and unpredictable, some generators allow choosing the starting point of the sequence to be pulled from some external source, like the time-of-day clock in microseconds. Then it is nearly impossible to predict or repeat the sequence of numbers generated. However it can be useful to start from a known place (seed) if you are testing software and want to start with known inputs, even if the intention is to operate on numbers having an even probability distribution.

There is a problem with the definition of randomness that the mathematics of randomness always has a hidden state that is being incrementally revealed to us. So on a philosophical level we have difficulty defining 'truly random' without having a way of telling the difference between a process that brings arbitrary values into existence on request and one that pre-calculated arbitrary values and reveals them as we go. That's a metaphysical or ontological problem and we have no way of determining it.But random number generators in computers not hooked up to some external device are far less random than that! ",

When you want real randomness you will need a dedicated hardware random number generator, which uses the randomness created by observing physical events determined by quantum mechanics. This device could measure effects like quantum tunneling or radioactive decay. This is of course not used commonly as most applications do not require true randomness.

This can be achieved by measuring some physical phenomenon that is expected to be random such as chaos and quantum phenomena and then  compensates for possible biases in the measurement process. Without that, you cannot generate true random numbers, because the computation of a traditional computer is deterministic, which means their output is inherently predictable, and thus they are not regarded as true random numbers.

            "answer_text": "Given any sequence of numbers (finite or infinite), the correlations between subsequences are never exactly equal to that of a \u201ctrue random sequence\u201d. In that sense, no sequence will pass all criteria for randomness. On the other hand, if you have a random variable X ~ U(0,1), with the uniform distribution on [0,1[ (0 inclusive, 1 exclusive), then for any random distribution F, you can compute Y = Finv(X)Finv(X), such that Y is distributed according to F. If X was \u201ctruly random\u201d, then so is Y. In this context, please consider the following article https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/upload_library/22/Ford/Volchan46-63.pdf, containing many pitfalls on the road to define randomness. In section 3, Randomness as Stochasticness, the problems of defining \u201ccollectives\u201d show that even if all finite subsequences have the correct behavior, the total sequence may not be random in terms of all countable subsequences.

It turns out that gas turbulence inside the drive adds a little be of randomness to the drive seek times.

First you have to start with a physics source that has a very reliable atomic mechanism that generates a known distribution. There exist semiconductor junctions for which careful bias will give you this much. Then you have to engineer it against shifts in distribution from temperature variations, vibrations, and voltage variation. And if you\u2019re really paranoid (maybe your international bank\u2019s security system is based partly on the randomness of these numbers) you\u2019d want to also worry about how immune your RNG is to charged particle beams and so on. The cost of doing all these things can tend to make your RNG system extremely expensive, so nobody does them in commercial systems or home use. ",

The algorithm is seeded using the operating system's \"true\" random number generator. * Operating systems provide a random number generator, or entropy source, which collects noise from system processes/events that are (hoped to be) unpredictable and (ideally) based on physical phenomena. For linux, this would be /dev/random. ",

But in this case then those sources of randomness are the ones that truly generated the random information as the computer manipulated it in a predictable way. ",

            "answer_text": "There are simply too many undefined terms in the question to produce a meaningful answer. However, we can get an answer if we define two terms. The first is \"random number\" which we can define as a member of a sequence such that there is no algorithmic method of predicting the next member of the sequence based on prior members of the sequence. Note, however, that there are many such sequences which would not, in practice, be suitable for many applications of random numbers. We also need to define external source. One possible definition is that an external source is any source other than the properly functioning digital (or digitized) elements of the computer. With these definitions, the answer is no. With minor variants, the answer could be yes. A more useful version of the question would be based on the characteristics of \"randomness\" that are appropriate for some given use. In such event, the answer might be either yes or no. ",

Let's go with 1bn s. So using 1 Gbyte memory is 8bn bits meaning 8 bits flips per second. Their position would be random and usable as a truely random seed. However, this is obviously slow compared to pseudorandom numbers and they usually get the job done. In conclusion, there are no physical principles baring true randomness in deterministic computers, it's just impractically to use as we have tried to design out randomness when constructing the computer.

Any c.e. random real is is the halting probability of some universal prefix-free machine,which in turn is  also  Martin-L\u00f6f random and computably enumerable real and  Turing complete in the sense that it is Turing equivalent to the halting problem \u03d5\u2032\u03d5\u2032. Hence, from a computational point of view, the bits of \u03a9\u03a9 are as difficult to decide as the question whether a universal Turing Machine stops on a given input. To be more definitive: No, Martin-L\u00f6f random sequence \u03b1\u03b1 is incomputable. Here is how: if some oracle computation with oracle \u03b2\u03b2 (which itself is an infinite binary sequence) can compute \u03b1\u03b1, then for all n, n\u2212O(1) bits of \u03b2\u03b2 are needed to compute the first n bits of \u03b1\u03b1 (a characterization of Martin-L\u00f6f randomness).

You can plug a device into a USB port that uses some random mechanism (white noise in an electric circuit, radioactive breakdown of a mildly radioactive element etc.). Without such a device you can only generate pseudo-random numbers. These use a function that produces a sequence that looks random, but actually has a complicated inscrutable pattern. Some methods apply the function to the last number produced. Some use a sequence of past numbers. For more detail, look up linear congruential RNGs and the Mersenne twister, two of the most popular types. ",
