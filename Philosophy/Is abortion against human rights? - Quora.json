            "answer_text": "The first thing that should be noted about this question is that there are two separate meanings of the word \u201crights\u201d and these two meanings lead to two different questions. If we do not get clear on these meanings then we could spend a lot of effort talking about things of which there is no real dispute, and do so in a very disagreeable way. That said, the word \u201crights\u201d can refer to protections/benefits given to us by law (e.g. the rights outline by the Bill of Rights) or it can refer to claims that we have on other persons by virtue of being human (e.g. the inalienable human rights referred to in the Declaration of Independence). The first question is therefore about what laws are on the books, the second question is about what laws should be on the books. Consider the case of slavery. Did the slaves in North America have the right (in the first sense) to be free? Well I am no historian but it seems fair to assume that they did not. As far as the U.S. government was concerned, its citizens had the right to own slaves, and the slaves did not have the right to be free. In the second sense we might think that that the slaves actually had the \u201cinalienable\u201d human right to be free. In this case the U.S. Government was violating the right (in the second sense) when issuing rights (in the first sense). Given this distinction we can now consider the two questions that might be being asked. First we might be asking the question of whether a given governing authority recognizes the unborn as having human rights. This is the question that Clare Celea has chosen to answer when she considers the legislation of the European Union. And while I am not remotely informed about EU law, I have no reason to doubt her claim that the unborn do not have human rights in this sense. Despite this, it is the second meaning of the word \u201crights\u201d that we usually have in mind when we ask a question like \u201cis abortion against human rights?\u201d That is, we are usually interested in the second question: \u201cdo the unborn have inherent human rights?\u201d Or alternatively, \u201cshould the government recognize the unborn as having human rights?\u201d That is a big question. It is the question that is behind much of the debate about abortion. To get at this question we should consider the three basic views on moral facts. First, the moral objectivist believes that moral facts are person independent. On this view moral questions have correct answers just as mathematical questions have correct answers, and these answers (at least in general) do not depend upon the beliefs or desires of anyone. On this view Karen has the right to life even if no one in the whole world recognizes her right to life. We might say that Karen\u2019s rights are grounded in the kind of being that she is\u2026 and as she is a human, she has human rights. Second, there are views that propose that rights do exist, but that they are determined by a subject or group of subjects (or possibly even an idealized subject). Moral relativism is one such view. On this view whether Karen has a right to life is dependent upon the right-determining property (e.g. beliefs) of the individual or group that gets to determine Karen\u2019s rights. That is, if the general cultural beliefs of the Nation determine the rights of its citizens (including Karen) then whether Karen has a right to life depends on the relevant cultural beliefs. Third, we might think that there are no inherent rights. This view is called Nihilism. Look at Kevin Lawson\u2019s answer to this question for an example of a nihilist perspective on human rights. Now given this, which view should we take? Well if Nihilism is true then it makes no difference. We might have a preference, but there is simply no answer to the question of whether the unborn have inherent rights because no one has inherent rights. Well what about some kind of subjective view such as relativism? My problem with these views is that they seem to me to be simply false. When Hitler killed millions of Jews in the Holocaust it was simply wrong. It makes no difference what Hitler thought about it, nor what the German people thought about it, and even if the whole world was filled with die-hard Nazis, killing millions of Jews was still wrong. If you think I am incorrect about this, imagine that everyone in the whole world thinks that it is morally acceptable (even obligatory) to rape, torture and mutilate you. What would you think as these (objectively horrible) things were done to you? You will think \u201cHey, Stop, you should not do that!\u201d And that is because deep down, humans are programmed to believe in objective moral facts. Relativism and its ilk are just cheap counterfeits that satisfy people who are living in relative comport. That just leaves moral objectivism. So do the unborn have inherent human rights if moral objectivism is true? Well I have two things to say about this. First, it is seemingly impossible to generate reasonable views of human personhood, where the unborn do not have inherent human rights and the rest of us do. The pro-choice movement has had a long time to come up with views, and they have produced quite a few, but all that I know of either require very odd and specific religious beliefs (that hardly anyone holds), or else they violate the equality of human personhood. In contrast the pro-life view is completely consistent and easily understandable: \u201call complete human organisms are human persons and thereby have equal human rights.\u201d Second, if moral objectivism is true then there are only two major ways that we can gain insight into moral truths: divine revelation and our moral intuitions. This is one reason that religion often comes up in debates about the inherent rights of the unborn. Regardless, even if we set aside religious beliefs, our moral intuitions are strongly in favor of the value of the unborn. This is one of the reasons why getting an abortion is so emotionally difficult. People, especially mothers, have the basic intuition that they are carrying a real human person inside of them. That is why the pro-choice movement has put so much time into dehumanizing the unborn by calling them things like \u201cblob of tissue\u201d or \u201cparasite\u201d. We do the same thing during war. Calling the enemy names makes it easier for us to pull the trigger. The same thing can be seen in reverse. Before we see the child it is (to some extent) unreal to us. We can talk in the abstract about starving children in Africa, but actually meet one face to face and we begin to have an appreciation of their value. Then spend a few months getting to know the child and her value will truly be impressed upon you such that the thought of her going without food is a horror to any descent person. The unborn are like children in Africa until we \u201cmeet\u201d them via ultrasound and finally get to know them once they are born. Anyways, our moral intuitions (i.e. the only non-religious source of information on moral truths) definitely support the equality (in value and hence rights) of the unborn. Finally, I just want to leave off with one last thought. Suppose that we do not know if the unborn actually have human rights. What should we do then? Well if we do not know whether a gun is loaded, does that make it morally acceptable to point that gun at someone and pull the trigger? No! If in doubt you assume the gun is loaded. Similarly, if there is any real doubt then we should assume that the unborn do have human rights. Of course someone could respond that I am not considering the mother. But is that really the case? If the child does have human rights, if they are a real human person just like you and me, then the murder of the unborn is not the only wrong that is done by a pro-choice society. The natural bond between a mother and her child is so deep that encouraging a mother to be complicit in the murder of her own child is a horrendous evil that I actually consider to be worse than the murder of the child itself. It is one thing to do an evil to someone, it is another to encourage someone else to do evil. If you do not know whether you are encouraging a woman to murder her children, then for her sake, if not for the child\u2019s, you should stop. There is a foolish idea that persists among many people that the pro-life perspective takes the side of the child and the pro-choice side takes the side of the mother. This is not true. If abortion is murder, then both the child, and the mother are harmed immeasurably. That said, the pro-choice concerns for the mother are very real and should not be ignored, but they are generally socioeconomic concerns - murdering a child, and encouraging a mother to be the one to commit this great evil, far outweigh socioeconomic concerns. That said, it is of paramount importance to assist and encourage the brave women who choose to keep their unborn child - especially when it has cost them dearly to do so. And for those who have had an abortion and have come to believe that they have done something terrible, I encourage you to read: Luke 15:11\u201324. ",
