            "answer_text": "Classical Liberalism should not be confused with Liberal Politics as it almost invariably is in the USA - To advocate Liberalism is to be a Libertine which is essentially being the same as an Anarchist in thought & behaviour - The label of Liberal in Political terms is largely a misnomer- In \u2018America\u2019 most so called Liberals are better described as Progressives, Reformers or Improvers - Whilst they seek greater liberty from numerous constraints & restrictions imposed by a Capitalistic Economic system, Religious or Political Ideology, Progressives don\u2019t advocate the complete removal of all Societies rules & necessary regulations, as true Libertarians do TBC ( To be continued) - Those labelled as Liberals who are usually voters for, or members of the Democratic Party in the U.S. are unacceptable to conservative minded people across the Socio - Economic spectrum seemingly because they are considered soft & not tough enough on all all manner of issues, as in being called \u2018 bleeding heart liberals\u2019 a truly ridiculous description for those who are more caring & considerate, about what happens with people in Society & other animals, as well as the total Environment- Along with this they are considered insufficiently firm on most issues generally not being followers of any Ideology - This \u2018open minded\u2019 attitude appears to be unsettling to most of the conservatively inclined - So called \u2018liberals \u2018 are far less likely to be conformist & thus they\u2019re often difficult to \u2018pigeon hole\u2019 - This results in \u2018liberals\u2019 being viewed as somewhat unpredictable & not sufficiently patriotic as few adhere rigidly to any belief system - Being generally anti guns & only sanctioning Military action as a last result American \u2018Liberal\u2019 Progressives are disparagingly referred to as being weak called \u2018wimps\u2019& \u2018peacenicks\u2019 - As most American \u2018Democrats\u2019 are supporters of Civil Rights they were labelled as \u2018nigger lovers\u2019 & probably still are by many conservative racists - Now those who support \u2018Equal Rights\u2019 are pejoratively called Socialists The majority of those conservative by nature are unnerved in seeing \u2018Liberals\u2019 & \u201cliberalism\u2019 as wanting to change too many things & \u2018conservatives \u2018 in general aren\u2019t comfortable with any change, unless it can be seen as without being in any way being detrimental to them & entirely without doubt as to their benefit - \u2018Liberals\u2019 in contrast are constantly in pursuit of positive change & improvement- Apart from being far more adaptive to change the most positive aspect of true sensible \u2018liberalism\u2019 is the pursuit of human freedom but freedom with responsibility ",

            "answer_text": "Being liberal promotes comradery with other people. Liberals believe that politics and economics are based on the wellbeing of the community, which encourages redistribution and public spending. This mode of thought allowed the middle class to be a significant component of the United States\u2019 social system. FDR is the prototype for modern American liberalism, and Bernie Sanders is a political reincarnation. On the other hand, liberalism can deter some people from taking chances, which is disadvantageous in the business world. All business endeavors carry some form of risk involved. Being an entrepreneur often requires citizens to break free from the safety net provided by American liberalism. Liberalism can disincentivize innovation. ",
