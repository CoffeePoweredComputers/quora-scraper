There is a fundamental randomness built into the universe due to quantum mechanics.That randomness is not so very different than the randomness that already existed in classical mechanics. People pretend that it is very different, but it is not. Quantum mechanics simply prevents people from asking certain questions about nature at all.We have no way to calculate the way that the whole universe would behave in the first place. This is independent of whether the underlying laws are classical or quantum mechanical. No one can calculate the probability that you ask for.This doesn\u2019t mean that the formation of the Earth would be \u201cunlikely\u201d due to this fundamental randomness. There are many possible ways for the Earth to have formed. Not exactly here perhaps, but somewhere, not exactly the Earth we know, but something close to it.There is randomness, yes, but quantum mechanics makes very strong and very definite non-random predictions, if you can define the problem well enough. It is not so vastly different than classical mechanics that way.",

(Just look at Saturn\u2019s rings. Or our total inability to predict the next asteroid that will come close to, or hit, Earth.) And, as Gould said, rewind evolution and let it start again, and we wouldn\u2019t end up with the same species we have now (and for the same reasons - if one creature didn\u2019t have one reproductive cell hit by one cosmic ray, some new feature might never have occurred). So yes, there\u2019s enough randomness that the universe may have formed with different enough constants that life would be impossible. that matter itself would be impossible, anything. Likely? Maybe or maybe not, we can\u2019t tell. But possible? Certainly. ",

A: Quantum processes which dominated the early universe are statistical in nature. Thus rewind the universe we\u2019d end up with a similar but different universe. The universe at the large scale would still look pretty much the same. It is just the fine details that would differ. There would be no \u201cEarth\u201d as we know it but there would probably be other Earth like planets, as there surely are now already. You and I wouldn\u2019t be here. Our solar system and even galaxy cluster wouldn\u2019t be the same. But all the physical laws might be exactly the same. Thus resulting in a universe that looks roughly the same as it does now at the largest scales. ",
