            "answer_text": "Consensus means \"general agreement,\" so its presence or absence is not established by voting.  Any context that supplies a concept of \"voting\" typically also specifies how voting leads to collective decision-making as a matter of formal process.  If a political system specifies that a majority of votes decides an issue, it does not matter if the issue is extremely controversial and nothing close to a consensus exists.  Also note that voting, being formal and often very consequential, can be done for tactical reasons and is not always a direct expression of one's opinion. An opinion poll is an example of a context that makes a connection between voting and opinion.  We may hope to determine, through quantitative measurement, whether a consensus exists regarding some question or statement among some population -- for example, do leading scientists accept the theory of evolution?  There's no exact percentage that corresponds to \"general agreement,\" but given that the idea of \"general agreement\" suggests that agreement is the norm and dissenters can mostly be disregarded, you would probably want to show not just a majority but a strong majority to argue that a consensus exists.
