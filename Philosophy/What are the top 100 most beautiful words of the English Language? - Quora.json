            "answer_text": "WEIRD ENGLISH WORDS. Bumfuzzle: This is a simple term that refers to being confused, perplexed, or flustered or to cause confusion. You\u2019ve probably heard your grandma or grandpa use this phrase, especially if they are from the East Coast or below the Mason-Dixon Line. This word is derived from the Old English dumfoozle . Cattywampus: This is a term that you will find in the Midland and Southern United States. It is referring to something that is in disarray, that is askew, or something that isn\u2019t directly across from something. For example, a post office might be cattywampus from the library. You might actually know this word by the terms catty-corner, kitty-corner, or catawampus. Gardyloo: This is actually a Scottish term, but it sounds really nifty! The definition is a funny and gross one; this is what people living in Edinburgh shouted out their windows as a warning before dumping their slop buckets out of their windows. At least they gave a little bit of a warning to those below! Taradiddle: This word references someone or something that is filled with pretentious nonsense or something that is a lie. A great example of this is that classic fisherman\u2019s tale of how big the fish he caught was. Usually the fisherman is lying or at least exaggerating about the fish, especially if he (or she) didn\u2019t keep the fish. Snickersnee: While this word sounds like something funny or possibly cute, it is actually referring to a long, dangerous knife. It was first used in reference to cut-and-thrust fighting in the 1700s and is still occasionally used when referencing the knife, though it is becoming more and more obsolete. Widdershins: This is another way to say something is moving counter-clockwise or something is moving in the wrong direction. It is a much more fun way to say counter-clockwise and is most likely something you heard one of your grandparents or great-grandparents say. Many people do still use it in many poems and newly published books. ",
