            "answer_text": "You need to clarify 1) what you mean by accomplishments and 2) why you want to focus on a particular race instead of focusing on civilization. Most civilizations were to some extent racially mixed and traded with other civilizations. They achieved little without cultural exchange. Especially in modern Western Civilization, there is a set of ideas and technologies that are shared and developed by people of different races. Just for example, two of the great writers of Western literary canon, Alexandre Dumas and Alexander Pushkin, are not, as you might expect, Dead White Men but rather Dead Men of Color.  Alexander Pushkin, Russian writer  Alexandre Dumas, French writer The earliest civilizations were in Africa, the Middle East and India. (It is worth noting that historians once assumed minimal contact between these civilizations, but subsequently learned that they all traded with each other.) These peoples were all rather dark skinned. (Indeed, the people of the Indus Valley civilization, in what is now India and Pakistan, were very dark and achieved a high level of culture long before the lighter skinned Aryans invaded.) Lighter-skinned people were relative late-comers to civilization and made their earliest achievements only when they moved into places like the Middle East, for example, the Hittites who migrated from the northern Caucasus into what is now Turkey. Eventually the Mediterranean Basin became the locus of culture, including North Africa, the Near East, and southern Europe. (Someone once said that the Egyptians invented geometry by trial and error; the Greeks learned from them and then figured out the shortcuts.) The Chinese Culture, of course, although it had contact with other civilizations, primarily represents a vast tapestry of high cultural achievement among people who predominantly happen to be non-white. The Great Wall that is one of the few man-made objects that can be seen from outer space was built by the Chinese. Civilizations rise and fall. There were several kingdoms in Africa besides Egypt that rose and fell. Europe has seen several risings and falls. Europe was regarded as such a backwater by the Chinese, that before the fifteenth century, China\u2019s emperors considered but rejected plans to sail to Europe. Until the nineteenth century, China did not see anything in Europe that it wanted, except gold. Most of the gold taken by the Spanish and Portuguese from Latin America wound up in the Chinese emperors\u2019 coffers, exchanged for silk and gunpowder which the Chinese had invented. (The Chinese invented tissue papers for blowing one\u2019s nose - at a time when most Europeans used their sleeves.) The people of the New World independently built great cities and roads and invented the concept of zero (as did the Indians of India, from whom the Arabs got it and eventually passed it on to Europe). It seems to be an accident of history that the European or Western civilization rose to the prominence that it has. But it was built on the achievements of all who came before in other civilizations. It is impossible, for example, to talk about the achievements of the Greeks without those of the Hebrews when looking at the fabric of modern Western civilization. It is the combination of the two. One of the most absurd libels against Western civilization is to associate it with slavery when, in fact, Western civilization is the first and only civilization to determine that all slavery is wrong and abolish it; there would be no opposition to slavery without Western civilization. The impetus of anti-slavery was actually anti-racism BTW. Benjamin Franklin, for example, already believed that slavery was wrong for white people when, at age sixty-five, he decided to free his slaves and joined the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery. He realized that slavery was wrong for African people, too, and to do that he had to overcome racism. As slavery was overcome, then, and in spite of those who held the opinion that the races should be segregated - even in different countries or continents - the fact is that people of all races have lived together and shared in the highest achievements of civilization, with scientists and men of letters of all races contributing to an increasingly unified or at least interdependent planetary culture. The whole world is all mixed up, and sometimes in a good way. ",

            "answer_text": "Up until about 1500 East Asians, particularly the Chinese, were ahead of Europeans in accomplishments. At that time and with the start of the industrial revolution in England Europeans pulled ahead; so much so that the modern industrialized world is \u201cWestern\u201d or \u201cWhite\u201d If you will. However this is too simple. The West benefitted from \u201cArabic numerals\u201d \u201cAlgebra\u201d, and the concept of \u201czero\u201d from India. America could not have gone to the moon if the engineers had to do the calculations with Roman numerals. Another reason we get the impression that white people invented everything is that we don\u2019t give credit to Asian inventors, such as the Korean inventor of movable type, who thought up the same invention centuries earlier. In the last 20 years it seems that Asian and Western Countries have about the same amount of inventions. See link below. So my answer is that, first it would be better to forget \u201cWhite race\u201d \u201cAsian race\u201d etc. If China lands people on Mars first I will feel pride in this great accomplishment. Second, if you\u2019re going to rate races in terms of accomplishment I would say \u201cNo\u201d, the White race and Asians (East Asians and India) are about equal now.
