The leaders of the Western World on Remembrance Sunday who line up to remember the deaths of World Wars and whilst they do children die of war and starvation. Leaders of the Faith who watch the homeless walk past their closed and locked citadels of prayer whilst the temperature sinks below zero. The men and women of Mastercard and Visa who would die to protect their children but let their payment system be used to pay for child pornography. All the employees of Google who would faint at seeing the horror of children being sexually exploited but let their search engine bring up sites of children being harmed. Barack Obama who wants tough gun laws but will expect his protective detail to shoot dead any person who is an immediate threat to his life. We the People who watch a Lion caged in a Zoo and then complain about our human rights. 7 billion people who live on Planet Earth and enjoy all it has to offer and are collectively choking it to death.
