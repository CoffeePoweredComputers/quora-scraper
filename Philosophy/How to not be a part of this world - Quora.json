            "answer_text": "There is an implication in this question that should not be ignored. The definition of \u201cthis world\u201d implies that \u201cthis world\u201d is not \u201cmy world\u201d. Not being part of \u201cthis world\u201d implies you want your own world (or non-existence). For those of us who find interacting with \u201cthis world\u201d to be a chore and stressful, our coping strategy is to create a personal space and time that gives us time to de-stress and not be interrupted by \u201dthis world\u201d. That can be a simple as finding a quiet corner, making sure someone else has volunteered to help with the worldly chores (e.g. minding the children) and reading a book. Personally, computer games are \u201cmy world\u201d and so is being on a ladder working on the house (not a big fan of the neighbors wanting to talk, but hey, sometimes you gotta be peaceable and friendly like). Just know you are not alone in not wanting to be a part of \u201cthis world\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "You can't not be a part of the planet you live on. You can try to not be in conformity with the parts of the culture you don't agree with. But that puts you into conformity with some group. No one can live and not be part of the world. Try to live within your convictions of what is right. It is a worldly sense of morals and ethics that relies on greed, dishonesty, selfishness, love of self, lust, hate, jealousy ; that part of the world I avoid. But I have to be part of this world I occupy a space here. ",
