            "answer_text": " I\u2019d add Einstein\u2019s to this quote, but it would not be helpful. So, the answer in a nutshell: hell not. There are extremely rare cases of untreatable social phobia, but chances are it\u2019s not you. Unless you had brain damage. Unless you were born with an even more rare brain condition. It\u2019s not you. Which is amazing news :-) Linda Bennardo summarised what there is to say. I strongly believe that there is no one fits all when it comes to mental health. There IS a methodology, out there, that works for the person YOU are. It\u2019s up to you to find which one it is. Because no, unless you find one of those Patch Adams doctors (hint: there ain\u2019t many), nobody is going to do that kind of work for you. Even if you go to a very good therapist, chances are he will be mostly trained in one methodology and apply it to you. It may work. It may not. It\u2019s up to you to do the research, and all trials and errors necessary to find your way out. I took a few years to find mine. And let\u2019s not even go into how that feels. Because it\u2019s not \u201camazing\u201d. It\u2019s the difference between suffocating and breathing. Between living in a narrow prison cell and being free. I\u2019m still an introvert. I\u2019m still me. And yet I approach people with curiosity instead of anxiety. I perceive rather than judge. And got crazy in love with diversity. The more the merrier. Cliche alarm: you create a life that reflects your beliefs. Find the toxic beliefs at the root of your anxiety, find a way to accept and deal with them that works for your brain, and feel alive, all over again (assuming you ever did\u2026 I didn\u2019t\u2026 really\u2026 before the age of 34).

            "answer_text": " I\u2019m not really a fan of useless information and inspirational messages which won\u2019t really help you overcome social anxiety. If you want to see a real change in your life you need actionable advice you can actually use. There\u2019s a great workbook on Amazon which is designed exactly for this: Amazon.com: Shy to Social: A Self Coached Social Anxiety Workbook: Self Coached Social Anxiety Workbook (9781097478514): Chris Magin: Books \u2018Permanent\u2019 is a rather strong word to use. But yes, there is no \u2018cure\u2019 for Social Anxiety Disorder. If it\u2019s severe there\u2019s a chance it will never go away even with therapy and medication therefore you have to learn how to handle it while living your daily life. Some people are lucky enough to notice their having anxiety issues early enough while it\u2019s still mild/moderate so they can get professional help and eventually overcome it. Like any Anxiety Disorder it all depends on you personally, each case is totally different. It\u2019s very complex that\u2019s why if you are having any concerns or would like advice regarding your Social Anxiety I recommend you get assessed by a qualified psychologist and get their advice. Peace! <3\u2026 This answer is worth paying attention to. ",
