            "answer_text": "Cultures are collections of social inventions for keeping members of a culture away from each other\u2019s throats. I don\u2019t know what a heterogeneous culture would be like. Perhaps it would have calm, melodic music such as Irish ballads and violent, jaggedy visual art something like this: r . m . The their fiction might emulate the darkest self-examinations of guilt, something like Dostoievski\u2019s Crime and Punishment, and they might have some kind of light and frothy poetry. I\u2019m not sure there would be anything \u201cbad\u201d about such a culture, or anything \u201cgood\u201d about it either. What is problematical is when a single society has two or more cultures. Maybe half of the people are uncompromisingly blunt and tell you exactly how they evaluate things, including you, and the other culture always uses white lies to avoid saying no to anything, gives extravagant praise to others and feigns complete self abnegation with respect to self and family. Or maybe one group practices genital mutilation on both boys and girls to keep them from being too sexy until they can be \u201csold\u201d in marriage, and the other group won\u2019t even permit surgery for legitimate reasons, arguing that if you have appendicitis you should just submit to God\u2019s will and die. Please don\u2019t make too much fuss about it. Go where people won\u2019t hear your screams. I think these communities would be in continual inner conflicts. Inter group marriages would almost always explode, and so forth. Is that kind of a cultural firefight good? I don\u2019t know. Maybe it provides great works of literature and music to contend with Beethoven\u2019s late quartets, the best possible cultural arts and artifacts are left in its wake, and damn the costs to individual humans whose lives are in general torment because of the cultural dissonance involved.

            "answer_text": "Even in a really heterogeneous country, you\u2019ll find a domination from a culture belongs to the majority of people or those in power. Thus the nation\u2019s cultural representation will be reshaped into a more homogeneous type, either by promoting the culture of the majority (or those in power) or recreating another which is proclaimed to be the \u2018national culture\u2019. Whether it is good or bad, it depends on the cultural approach being made. If there\u2019s a homogeneous cultural perception which tends to antagonize or disregarding other cultures, then it\u2019s bad. So it depends on the cultural perceptions toward differences. ",
