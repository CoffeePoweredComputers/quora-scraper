            "answer_text": "Is metaphysics considered the same as Supernatural phenomenon? +JMJ+ No, as Metaphysics covers the entire range of being (see the last definition below) whereas supernatural phenomenon would just apply to that beyond our immediate sense knowledge. Whereas \u201csupernatural\u201d is just defined as that which is above nature, Metaphysics would include both. from A Catholic Dictionary, edited by Donald Attwater, Second edition, revised 1957 Supernatural. That which is superadded to nature; it is therefore that which neither constitutes an essence nor is necessarily consequent upon it, nor is it that which an essence has need of lest its being and activity be frustrated, but it is a special participation of the Divine Goodness itself. It is opposed to Natural, which is whatever constitutes an essence, or flows from it, or is due to it for its activity; and to Preternatural, which neither constitutes an essence, nor necessarily follows upon it, nor of which the essence has need for its being and activity, but which does not go beyond the order of the whole of nature. Phenomenon (Greek, appearance). The appearance which an object presents to the mind from without. It is opposed to noumen, a term used by Kant to denote a thing-in-itself lying beyond the range of cognition. from Modern Catholic Dictionary by John A. Hardon, S.J. Doubleday & Co., Inc. Garden City, NY 1980 Metaphysics. The science of being, as being; or of the absolutely first principles of being. Also called ontology, first philosophy, the philosophy of being, the philosophy of first causes, wisdom. (Etym. Greek meta, after, beyond + physika, physics.) from A Catholic Dictionary, edited by Donald Attwater, Second edition, revised 1957 Metaphysics (from the Greek, after physical things; originally the title given to those treatises of Aristotle placed after those on physics). That part of philosophy which treats of real being. It has two parts: (a) General, sometimes called Ontology and treats of being as such and the transcendentals (being something, unity, truth, goodness); of the Categories or supreme genera (substances, accidents; quality quantity, relation, etc.) of causes (material, formal, efficient, final). (b) Special, called applied metaphysics, which treats of Cosmology (the world), Psychology (the soul), Theodicy (God). ",

            "answer_text": "The term supernatural connotes description of paranormal, psychic, magical, occult type of earthly human physical behaviors. Do earthly humans \u201cnaturally,\u201d by the nature of being human, hold the behavioral possibility to behave super \u201cnatural\u201d (beyond earthly human \u201cnature\u201d of Human Nature?) Perhaps you know an earthly human who does! Earthly human who could manifest super \u201cnatural\u201d behavior would indeed exist as a phenomena different from the nature of Human Nature. There are earthly humans who do profess to hold these supernatural powers. The Metaphysical Realm of Human Nature Existence exists \u201cnatural\u201d to the \u201cnatural essential\u201d innate nature of Human Nature. Human Nature innately and inherently exists within two Natural Realms of the Nature of Human Nature Existence: the Metaphysical Realm of an abstract conceptual cognitive intellectual mental operational capability \u201c to think, to pro form, creative, thought ideas\u201d encapsulated within a Physical Realm of a human species physical, biological, physiological body substance existing within a parameter, phenomenal nature of Nature Nature. Metaphysical Realm Innate Nature of the Essence of Human Nature Existence does not exist phenomenally super natural. Metaphysical Realm Innate Nature of Human Nature exists essential toward the innate nature of existing as Human Nature; otherwise, earthly human species \u201c could not mentally rationally think, nor, come to know anything! Metaphysical Realm of Essential Nature of Human Nature IS earthly human. edit finished answer edited ",
