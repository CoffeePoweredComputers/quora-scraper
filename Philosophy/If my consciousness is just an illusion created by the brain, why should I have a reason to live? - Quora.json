            "answer_text": "***initial disclaimer: if you\u2019re truly having suicidal/negative thoughts please go talk to someone ASAP. There are tons of reasons to live. Problems never last as long as you make the tiniest of effort to fix them. Please be well** What do you find joy doing? What makes you really really really happy? That\u2019s why. Whether it\u2019s sex or creating a drawing or writing a song (or whatever) those are the reasons worth living. One of the topics that laid it out pretty good for me was Absurdism. It basically states that life is so meaningless and short and we\u2019re so small that killing yourself is ridiculous because your time on the planet is so short anyway. from Wikipedia \u201cAccordingly, absurdism is a philosophical school of thought stating that the efforts of humanity to find inherent meaning will ultimately fail (and hence are absurd) because the sheer amount of information as well as the vast realm of the unknown make total certainty impossible. As a philosophy, absurdism furthermore explores the fundamental nature of the Absurd and how individuals, once becoming conscious of the Absurd, should respond to it. The absurdist philosopher Albert Camus stated that individuals should embrace the absurd condition of human existence while also defiantly continuing to explore and search for meaning. [2] It\u2019s literally an absurd conundrum but it makes so much sense when you realize the point is for you to continually search for meaning. that\u2019s where those small bits of joy come into play. Once you catch what makes you happy you HAVE to do more of it because nothing else matters. If you\u2019re not able to do the things that make you happy you\u2019re wasting your time. Yes there are economic and other practical matters to consider, but even with a full time job you should still be able to eek out 1 to 4 hours a day of happiness in something. And be happy! and keep searching for happy! and as long as you\u2019re curious in things you\u2019ll find happiness. Keep your mind as active as you can handle. If you\u2019re pursing happy things tired is only until you sit in that chair. If you can stay up and watch TV or play videos or other mindless thing way past when you should, imagine if you found something you really loved doing right around that time and started doing it? You\u2019ll get excited and then bam, it\u2019s midnight and you\u2019re answering questions on Quora, 2 hours after you intended to go to sleep. :) please be well. life is amazing. Go to an astronomy center, an art museum, or a science museum and look at some of the achievements people have made. We\u2019re extremely special and lucky to have evolved from some bacteria flying in space to what we\u2019ve accomplished now. Yes there is a lot of negatives but you\u2019re mostly in control of your immediate surroundings. You can get a different job, eat different food, wear different clothes, etc. It\u2019s hard but start small changing the things that you don\u2019t enjoy to the things you do enjoy. Treat yourself to stuff and keep looking for the things you love. As Bukowksi said \u201cFind what you love and let it kill you. Let it drain from you your all. Let it cling onto your back and weigh you down into eventual nothingness. Let it kill you, and let it devour your remains.^*\u201d It sounds morbid, but, if you love writing or drawing or making music and you devote all of your energy to doing it, it sounds pretty awesome to me. <3 ps ^* the quote may not have been from bukowski, but i still like it. It\u2019s on the internet, isn\u2019t everything true here? ;) \u2018\"It's like my friend Kinky Friedman said,\" mused Van Dyke Parks. \"You've got to find what you love and let it kill you. I don't think any of us should ever forget that.\" ",

This idea seems really alluring, but the question is does it matter? Please read into Maslow's Need Hierarchy. According to it what you are asking relates to self actualization needs/goals. Ask yourself if have attained the ones preceding it. Maybe then you will have a better perspective of answering the question yourself. ",
