            "answer_text": "Descartes is a substance dualist, but his proof for the distinctness of mind and body does not necessarily entail substance dualism, property dualism is another type of dualism that can be derived from it. All of the early modern philosophers I know of such as Descartes and Locke who were dualists, were substance dualists. They believed that there is a physical substance and a mental substance, and each one had their own properties. So the physical substance \u2018body\u2019 has properties such as being a certain size, weight, undergoing certain biological processes, etc. The mental substance \u2018mind\u2019 has the properties of having certain memories, thoughts, emotions, etc. Property dualism is a newer kind of dualism, whereby you only generally believe that there is physical substance, but you think that that physical substance has both mental and physical properties. So that there\u2019s a physical substance, say the brain, but there are both mental and physical properties of the brain, e.g. neurons, physical properties, and consciousness, mental properties. Descartes\u2019 argument for the distinctness of mind and body, if you thought it a good argument, could support either form of dualism. To review his argument, he argues that since it is conceivable that the mind could exist without the body, then the mind must be distinct from the body. An analogous argument could be given for properties: since consciousness, or memories, or an experience of a color, could be conceived to exist distinct from neurophysiological correlates, then they must be distinct types of properties.

            "answer_text": "No he does not. As Ian Heckman already summarized, the argument goes as follows: Descartes\u2019 argument for the distinctness of mind and body, if you thought it a good argument, could support either form of dualism. To review his argument, he argues that since it is conceivable that the mind could exist without the body, then the mind must be distinct from the body. An analogous argument could be given for properties: since consciousness, or memories, or an experience of a color, could be conceived to exist distinct from neurophysiological correlates, then they must be distinct types of properties. But it is ultimately begging the question. You already have to understand what you\u2019re talking about to answer wether something is (meaningfully) conceivable. Consider the time before the molecular structure of water was known. It was possible to conceive water (H20 , two hydrogen and one oxygen atom[math])[/math]without oxygen. Separate statements can seem (perfectly logically) conceivable but contradict each other in the bigger picture: If A then B. If C not then A. If B then C. One could say it is no longer conceivable for consciousness, or memories, or an experience of a color to exist distinct from neurophysiological correlates. ",
