            "answer_text": "\u201cLogical necessity \u201c is another way of expressing the relationship of entailment. One can see it in deductive inferences and various mathematical relationships. A very common deductive inference is called modus ponens or the mode that affirms by affirming. The inference looks like this: \u201cIf P, then Q\u201d is true (where P and Q can be any propositions).P is true.Q must be true.In natural language, it might be It is true that if I have slept well, then I am happy.It is true that I have slept well.It must be true that I am happy.Logical necessity also lies behind the truth of the proposition, \u201cA square has four sides.\u201d We can see this when we remember that the definition of \u201csquare\u201d is \u201ca four-sided plane figure.\u201d So, the original proposition can be rewritten as \u201cA four-sided plane figure has four sides.\u201d David Hume points out that the negation of such a proposition expresses a contradiction and cannot be true: \u201cA four-sided plane figure does not have four sides.\u201d Either a proposition is true, or its negation is true (or so we thought before Bertrand Russell), so \u201cA square has four sides\u201d is necessarily true. The more interesting question, however, is what makes logical necessity necessary? One explanation is Platonic: logical necessity expresses a relationship between two Forms that are perfect and immutable, so the relationship itself is immutable: it is what it is necessarily. Another explanation is that some relationships are logically necessary because everyone agrees to what they are, so no variation of the relationship exists; the one we have is the only one accepted by everyone, so it is necessary due to a lack of alternatives. I propose that Aristotle is correct that thought, word, and reality are isomorphic (making some relationships logically necessary because thought and reality are in a relationship of identity). I further propose that the isomorphic nature of thought and reality has an evolutionary explanation that can be seen in the similar behavior of bats and humans when in the proximity of physical objects. A bat will swerve to avoid a tree when flying at speed, as a human will swerve to avoid a tree when running. Since bats experience the tree as reflected sound while humans experience the tree as reflected light, it would be impossibly coincidental that two such differently evolved creatures would take similar measures to avoid a thing like a tree unless it were really there. So, given a real external world, the tree that the bat experiences is identical to the tree that I experience since two such differently evolved creatures could not reasonably harbor the same illusion of an object\u2019s being there. If an object is real, some propositions concerning it will be true and others will be false. The propositions that are true will express a necessary relationship because certain things must be the case for there to be a condition of truth. The force that compels us to think in a certain way when we think what is true is what powers logical necessity, and it is evolutionary in nature. ",
