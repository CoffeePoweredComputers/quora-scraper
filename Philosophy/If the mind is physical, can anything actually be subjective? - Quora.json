If the mind is physical, every one would, of necessity, have the same perspective on every subject on earth just like water reflects images of the nearby objects and people. In addition, as years pass by, one will have all his body cells replaced with new ones. Yet memories remain\u2014something that would not have been possible if mind was just physical entity. ",

            "answer_text": "If\u2026 the mind was physical then perhaps indeed nothing could be subjective. However, the mind is not physical. The brain is physical. The mind is made of information processing. It builds virtual representations of things, models, some times of the external world, sometimes of imaginary things. The model of the world and the world itself are not the same thing. The model is subjective. The world is objective. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. It\u2019s a bit like the way computers physically the same, but running different programs will process the same input potentially in very different ways. Since our experience of reality is our brains interpretation of its current internal state as it is impacted by both sensory input and previous states, our experience is subjective. ",
