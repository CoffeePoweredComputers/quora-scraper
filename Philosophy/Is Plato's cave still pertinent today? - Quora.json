            "answer_text": "Plato\u2019s cave will never not be pertinent. It\u2019s a thought experiment about unfalsifiable claims. So long as our language system will let us make claims that can\u2019t be tested, which is forever, Plato\u2019s Cave will be a useful thought experiment. Plato\u2019s Cave is the earliest formulation of Simulation hypothesis - Wikipedia. It\u2019s what you would imagine if you couldn\u2019t imagine computers yet. By analogy, the walls are the simulation, the fire is computation and \u2018us\u2019 is the data. The next step of Plato\u2019s cave, however, is escaping the simulation. This is also useful because it points out an important limit to things we can know. The assertion was we can\u2019t know things that defy our experience up to that point. The new knowledge can destroy our existing knowledge. By extension, finding out our basic assertions were wrong is a dangerous way for humans to feel. We are still humans, so Plato\u2019s Cave is still pertinent. ",
