My brother used to think it funny to corner me, hold me down and then fart in my face. I felt like he was making a statement. One I had to solve for. Last time he tried it, I made sure the peanut butter that was in my hand made it to the back of his shorts and down his leg. Then I ran to his friends and told them he sharted all over. They never let him live it down. ",
