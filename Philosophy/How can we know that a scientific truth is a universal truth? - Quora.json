            "answer_text": "We can\u2019t because there is no universal scientific truth. Only the entirety of life itself can be a universal truth (its existence in and of itself). Thus, all scientific findings independent of field remain but relative facts (relative to perception). Fact and truth are not the same. Fact is true for now, but may not be true permanently. While truth is truth forever\u2014independent of time and space. Hence, facts are relative through sense and perception, whereas truth is not and exists per se. You see, all is but a sensory projection made up by our brain. This is demonstrated by all the neurological diseases that change the world for those affected i.e., Anosognosia, Korsakoff\u2019s syndrome, Apaxia, etc (there are many, many more). If our brain experiences one tiny impairment, our entire reality would change. Now, imagine that we damaged parts of our brain that are associated with face recognition so no one could see a full face anymore\u2014only half faces (i.e., Harlequin Syndrome). How would we know that full faces exist when all we would perceive is half of the face of people? We wouldn\u2019t. In fact, we would deem it as natural to have half a face, whereas a full one would probably terrify us as that would be unnatural. Therefore, all that could be ever said to be the truth\u2014must inherently be within us. Ultimately, we are the only reality we can or will ever experience in existence. Hence you can say\u2014 I am the only universal truth there is (because existence is being perceived by a subject none of us knows what is, despite our persistent belief of it being \u201cme\u201d). Because life can only perceive life through physical forms\u2014it is therefore inherently locked into a biological robot we know as our body. This is how it can perceive the totality of itself (life living life). The sad part is that science is slowly replacing religion and becoming like religion when it is nothing but relative facts. Facts may perhaps apply within its current contextual moments, but never permanently like a universal truth would. Which is why truth exceeds facts. ",

            "answer_text": "The question begs us to accept the proposition that scientific truths are universal. But the \u2018laws\u2019 may differ. Scientists use reliable and trustworthy \u201cclocks\u201d to progress. That means that \u201cchange\u201d is measurable and therefore can be duplicated, verified and predictable. This is a good thing, and there is good reason to continue on this path. - But scientists (as opposed to science) have dismissed \u201cunmeasured\u201d and \u201cirrational\u201d events. For example, let us take \u201cdream logic.\u201d If the universe included coordinates where the laws of physics were different, and one \u201cimage\u201d morphs into another without \u201ccause and effect\u201d then scientists have been known to dismiss these possibilities as unscientific study. - So, we must discern between \u201cscience\u201d and \u201cscientists.\u201d Scientist follow the rules of science, but that does not mean that \u201cscientists,\u201d nor \u201cscience\u201d sanction what is truth. - For example, we have seen that the \u201cinvisible imagination\u201d has many times in the past been subjected to scorn. But if we realize that many times what goes on in virtual reality works complimentary with physical reality, we should be able to consider that science fiction, and fantasy have seemed to foreshadow the future achievements that blossom in the scientific community. Space and medical marvels, for instance, started with what seemed to be superstition, magical thinking, wishes, and outlandish, even silly visions. - Scientists, we hope are not soulless automated zombies that merely operate like machines in a devoted drudgery. Yes, there are many thankless \u201cspokes\u201d in the wheel that fine tune the trial and error, experimental applications, and so on that finally produce something tangible. - From the dawn of history, \u201cscience\u201d existed, but perhaps not yet were human kind able to \u201craise their consciousness\u201d in a way to click and bridge the invisible and visible. - Perhaps, a good view of the limitations of scientists and a \u201cuniversal time\u201d is stated by a Professor of Higher Mathematics, Ferdinand Gonseth. >> \u201c\u2026have taken a further step, not only towards the objectivation of the measurement of time, but also towards the objectivation of time itself. When will this procedure of extension have reached its term? Principally never. In practice one must observe moderation. In a Situation of well-defined knowledge, it is useless to increase indefinitely the possibilities of control and of synchronicity. But what gives us the right, we might ask, to stop the process of extension at this point? If one does not admit the existence of an objective and universal time, is it not a fault of method to assume that the controls of synchronicity which have been erected would guarantee those which were not yet erected? Is it admissible to exclude as impossible the ease of an instrument still \"unpublished\" which could not be easily fitted into the group of clocks presently in use? We have already answered this question indirectly. It is not necessary to construct all possible clocks; it suffices to establish the temporal law of the phenomena. As long as this temporal law does not vary with regard to the moment when the phenomenon begins (this Variation certainly could not be attributed to any momentary influence or to any more or less concealed evolution of the system which is the seat of this phenomenon), we have no reason whatever to abandon the hypothesis of a universal time, and every phenomenon whose law does not vary in the course of time confirms this hypothesis. What more can we ask of a natural law?\u201d (Time and Method p 216). Another example is how we think of \u201ctime-space.\u201d For many, \u2018past\u2019 has vanished, the \u2018future\u2019 is a not yet existent distant event for a narrow \u2018present.\u2019 But perhaps we construct \u2018time\u2019 so that the \u201cspace\u201d we envision has a coordinate system we can measure and work with? What if \u201cSPACE\u201d is not only faster than the velocity of light, but encompasses \u2018past,\u2019 \u2018present\u2019 and \u2018future\u2019? Can we exclude unmeasured time and dismiss it because scientists are not capable of working with \u2018unmeasured\u2019 time and must rely upon \u2018measured\u2019 time for \u201cchange\u201d? ",

These models are used to isolate the research from the researcher, isolate variables to accurately measure effect, and isolate the research subject from unduly influencing the research. Wikipedia will provide a decent primer into effective research models. Many professional disciplines require some study in this subject. ",

For example, there are no married bachelors because by definition a bachelor is unmarried. Likewise, it is impossible to exist and not exist at the same time because these are mutually exclusive conditions. Scientific truths are relative to a specific set of conditions. Thus, they are conditional or contingent truths. For example, the force of gravity is relative to the size of objects and the distance between them. Therefore, we can calculate the parabola of a projectile. However, if we forget to account for the wind, the object doesn't land where we anticipated. ",
