            "answer_text": "These two terms and the people who are supposed to represent them are already reconciled. In the modern American sense, liberalism wants progress and a better way of living. In it\u2019s most extreme form, it wants progress for the sake of progress without considering if pushing things forward will make things worse at a practical level. Conservatism wants a better way of living too, but it doesn\u2019t want to make anything worse in the name of progress. In its most extreme form, conservatives don\u2019t want any progress out of fear that things will get worse simply because they are changing. They are not natural enemies. The tension between these two ideas is what forces liberalism to consider whether any particular change might make things worse, and it forces conservatism to consider whether any particular change might make things better. In the hands of rational and sincere leadership, these two sides are already reconciled as having their roles to play. They are both important if they are in balance. But that doesn\u2019t happen in the real world where there\u2019s money to be made and power to be gained by pushing one idea instead of the other one. ",

Liberals are society\u2019s gas pedal. They want action, change, improvement. Conservatives are the brake. They want stability, caution, protection. The country moves forward, not as quickly as liberals would like, and not as slowly as conservatives would like. When you think about it, it\u2019s better that way. You can\u2019t reconcile left and right. You can take positions somewhere in the middle instead of classifying everyone as friend or foe. ",

But today Media, lobbies we allow, TV talk shows (that we used to know as news) has made in nearly impossible\u2026.because its like a game of sports now & money is involved and not common sense of what is best for all the People. Politicians are only for a few nowdays on both sides! And those few only worry about their families, Corporate interests and putting on a show for the public. In Congress nothing good seems to get done because of the money, egos, etc. I have found that most public I try to talk to are so entrenched in Identity Politics that there can be no communication, no discussion\u2026its like a Raiders fan talking to a Cowboy or whatever\u2026there is no compromise in a game where people want to WIN. Politics is like that now and politicians like it that way. But WE ACTUALLY want a country that works for US HERE and not overseas, or Wall Street and we do not want to be Citizens of the World in the sense that we control it all. Liars who tell us all Private will help us hurt us so much if you are in the in crowd. All private destroys us. Liars who say open borders will help us hurt us more than ever. Its so bad for us in an already too crowded country with lack of resources like housing, good jobs, schools etc. But both sides fight to WIN for ulterior motives and if they get a Fan (who really does not understand the dynamics), there is no talking to them. You see fans fighting at a sports event\u2026.thats what us manipulated dummies are like today. ",

So, I\u2019ll answer both questions with one answer. I believe that we all exhibit a combination of liberal and conservative beliefs and traits that address our artistic, religious, social, ethical, and political interests and talents. Therefore, those of us who are able to reconcile those personality differences are the healthiest among us. So, I expect that same response applies to our society in general.
