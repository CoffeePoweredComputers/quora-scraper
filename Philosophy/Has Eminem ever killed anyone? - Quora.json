Physically or non physically. Another answer to this said he beat up some snails or something.. i don\u2019t remember. maybe they wouldn\u2019t get out of his way. Snails are really slow. Like weekdays, me in algebra, getting a boyfriend\u2026 Maybe they weren\u2019t hasty enough for the Rap God himself. thisdippityhippityhiphopyoudontreallywannagetintoapissinmatchwiththisrappitybratpackinamacinthebackoftheacbackpackrapcrapyapyapyacketyyack he says that pretty fast ~anyway~ To answer the actual question, no, he hasn\u2019t killed anyone (that i know of.. i\u2019m not doing research), but he has slayed and broken lots of people like a motherfuckin table with his skills, so\u2026 does that count? sry ethan lol :P ",

Sure he kills,tortures,rapes ext on record \u201cvery creativly\u201dI might add ,but that does not make him a chain saw wielding maniac in real life. If he actually walked around in real life doing half of the stuff he does on record he would be dead,in jail,or in an an insane asylum not a multi millionaire living in a mansion the size of rhode island.
