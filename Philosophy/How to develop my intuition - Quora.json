            "answer_text": " When I was a teenager, my mother took me and my sister to visit a psychic. That was my entry point to the knowledge that there are deeper levels of understanding beyond what meets the eye. Some may call it \u201cwoo,\u201d but ever since my introduction to a higher level of awareness (psychic powers, the ability to communicate with spirits, you name it), I\u2019ve been profoundly aware of the power of intuition. In my day to day, many of my decisions are guided by an intuitive gut feeling\u2014and that feeling almost always leads me in the right direction. That has made my life so much easier! Trusting my gut has helped me be more confident in my decisions, and it only gets stronger as I use it, like exercising a muscle. In fact, I have my intuition to thank for one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made: starting my marketing and PR agency, Stanton & Company. When I launched the business 13 years ago, it was focused on female athletes, and so many people told me that I\u2019d never be able to make money in the women\u2019s sports business. In hindsight, I understand why they said that, and many years later, I have a clear sense of what the obstacles are. That said, my gut was ultimately right and has led me to a flourishing and expansive business that has broadened and expanded with the times. Everyone has intuitive powers. But not everyone puts them to use. Some people are very aware of their intuition and work to strengthen it as they would any other skill, sometimes even making a career out of it. Others simply don\u2019t know when their gut is trying to communicate something because they\u2019ve learned to suppress it. There\u2019s so much information out there\u2014books, articles, and research\u2014about how we can learn to perform at our highest levels. Many of these emphasize the value of hard work and discipline. But intuition, a soft skill that we can\u2019t easily see or define, can be the most useful, powerful force for improving your work and personal lives. A lot of the time, people either aren\u2019t willing to trust their intuition or don\u2019t know how. But the good news is that we can improve. The foundation of intuition is awareness. If you\u2019d like to start using your intuition, begin by simply paying closer attention to the little things\u2014subtle feelings and unexplainable pulls in particular directions. That\u2019s where the magic is. Pay attention when your intuition shines through, like when you think about someone out of the blue, then run into them at the grocery store or an event. I also always use the parking space example: I can literally visualize a specific parking space wherever I\u2019m going, and more often than not, that space is open and available to me. (This, of course, is a combination of intuition and manifestation\u2014a winning combo!) Start by taking advantage of these small opportunities to notice and flex your intuition. Then, you have to learn to trust it. I trust my gut at work 100 percent of the time and encourage my team to do the same. If one of my employees feels unsure about something, the first question I ask her is, \u201cWhat is your gut telling you?\u201d Much of the time, their intuitive feelings align with mine. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that there\u2019s only one right answer, but it bolsters my confidence that our gut instincts are leading us in the right direction. Intuition can also quite easily be pushed away when it arises. This is especially common for busy, stressed professionals who feel like they don\u2019t have time to reflect (we\u2019ve all been there). Unfortunately, when you repress intuitive feelings over and over, you aren\u2019t giving your intuition room to show you its power. Ignoring your intuition is like a bad habit. Whether you\u2019ve fallen out of touch with your intuition or have never consciously tapped into it, using your gut to make low-stakes decisions can help you better connect with it. For example, when buying a gift for someone, let your gut decide what you pick out. Or, when deciding between two equally enticing weekend plans, use it as a tie-breaker. Simply pay attention to the intuitive feelings that arise here and there. Gradually, your intuition will gain strength and influence more of your daily decisions. And if you make an effort to notice when it guides you in the right direction, you\u2019ll come to trust it. Once you learn to trust your gut, it can extend to all areas of your life\u2014even work. When we wrote \u201cThe Feminine Revolution,\u201d my co-author Catherine Connors and I wanted to get people thinking and talking about the true value of soft skills like intuition. Because, despite being incredibly powerful, many soft skills have long been dismissed as \u201cfeminine traits\u201d with no use in the workplace. We often prioritize data and even other people\u2019s opinions over our own intuition. Early in my career, I worked in corporate environments where no one trusted their gut. Every single decision, big or small, had to be supported solely by data and research. There\u2019s certainly merit in this approach, but I think the best strategy\u2014especially in creative fields\u2014involves a combination of data and intuition. If you\u2019re only willing to embrace what people are comfortable with because the data supports it, you forfeit the opportunity to surprise and delight your customers. I\u2019m not saying you should walk into a meeting at work and, totally out of left field, suggest your company shift its strategy because you had a gut feeling. That\u2019s never going to be taken seriously. Instead, over time, prove your intuition\u2019s usefulness and accuracy. Use it in combination with quantitative information, reports, prior knowledge and experience, and other data. Allow it to help you make an ultimate decision. Using your intuition may feel funny at first, perhaps even difficult and uncomfortable. But it will get easier as you exercise it. Simply listen to your intuition when it speaks, both quietly and loudly. Learn to trust it over time. Eventually, it will become a truly powerful decision-making tool in all aspects of your life. The starting point? When you\u2019re debating something\u2014big or small\u2014take a moment and ask yourself, \u201cWhat is my gut telling me?\u201d Your gut will always be right. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are 7 ways to develop your intuition: 1. Slow down enough to hear your inner voice. Before you can pay attention to your intuition, you first have to be able to hear it amid the cacophony of your busy life. You have to slow down and listen, which often requires solitude. Taking some time away from the everyday, even something as brief as going for a walk, is a great way to turn up the volume of your intuition. 2. Follow your inner voice. One of the primary reasons that some people are more intuitive than others is that they actually listen to their gut feeling instead of dismissing or doubting it. And that doesn\u2019t mean that they ignore their analytical mind and their critical thinking skills; there\u2019s a difference between using reason as a system of checks and balances and using it to talk yourself out of what your intuition knows to be true. 3. Practice empathic accuracy. I\u2019d probably lose you if I said that highly intuitive people read minds, so I\u2019ll use a scientific term: empathic accuracy. It\u2019s not magic; it\u2019s an intuitive awareness of what other people are thinking and feeling, using cues such as body language and tone of voice. It\u2019s an extremely powerful form of empathy that helps foster deep connections with other people. 4. Practice mindfulness. Mindfulness sounds even more New-Agey than trusting your intuition, but it\u2019s really just a fancy term for focusing on being in the moment. Mindfulness is a great technique to filter out all of the distractions in your environment\u2014and your brain. When you do that, you can hear your intuition loud and clear. 5. Nurture your creativity. Did you ever have one of those paint-by-number kits when you were a kid? Talk about turning art into a science\u2014all you have to do is put the right color in the right little space. You may end up with a pretty painting, but the only intuition involved is guessing what colors you\u2019re supposed to use in those really tiny spaces. No paint-by-numbers kit in the world can make a skilled artist create something as novel and monumental as the Sistine Chapel or the Mona Lisa. The missing ingredient is intuition. And, just as intuition is the secret ingredient in creativity, being intentionally creative strengthens your use of intuition. 6. Trust your gut. Have you ever made a decision and immediately started to feel sick, maybe even kind of clammy? Well, that affective experience is the body\u2019s way of informing you that the decision your analytic mind came to is at odds with your instinct. 7. Analyze your dreams. If you accept the science that demonstrates the power of intuition, it\u2019s not much of a leap to accept that our dreams are often manifestations of intuition. Sure, sometimes dreams are nonsense, but they often try to tell us something. Intuitive people don\u2019t just think, Wow, that was a weird dream!; they ask themselves, Where did that come from, and what can I take away from it? ",
