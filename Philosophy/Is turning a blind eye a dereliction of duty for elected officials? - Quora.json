            "answer_text": "YES!!! Elected officials are entrusted with the well-being of our communities, states, and nation. When they turn a blind eye it is a betrayal of the public trust. Not only are they expected to behave as professionals, they are also expected to help with oversight of others. No one, regardless of position, is above the law nor should they be allowed to do things that jeopardizes democracy. For example, if our president is engaging in activities that are illegal, anyone who knew of this but chose to say nothing should be held responsible for not reporting it. While they may not be guilty of his crimes, they are guilty of not doing something to stop it. It\u2019s just like if I am driving down the road and I see someone committing a crime, I have a duty as a citizen to call the police. ",
