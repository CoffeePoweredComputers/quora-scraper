            "answer_text": "Both were dualists, but they were dualists of very different sorts. Plato\u2019s dualism is epistemological in motivation, and only becomes metaphysical by extension. It is a dualism between mere opinion - shadows on a cave wall \u2014 on the one hand, and certain knowledge \u2014 the Forms seen in the sunlight of the supreme Form, the Good \u2014 on the other. Descartes\u2019s dualism is metaphysical in motivation. Or, perhaps, physical. It is focused on the distinction between the world of mind and the world of matter or body. Mind is conceived of entirely as the source of thoughts \u2014 body is conceived of entirely as the taking up of space \u2014 it becomes difficult to explain how the two can even have a connection. From this difference in the motivation of their dualisms come other differences. I\u2019ll just mention the most obvious. Descartes believes that we CAN have reliable knowledge of the physical world. We can know that chunks of matter push each other around, for example, because one chunk will occupy a patch of space to the exclusion of another chunk. Plato believed on the other hand that trying to acquire reliable knowledge of the physical world is a fool\u2019s game \u2014 the shadows on the cave wall are subjects merely of opinion, NOT of knowledge.
