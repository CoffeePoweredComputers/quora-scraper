            "answer_text": "ou have asked me a very comprehensive question whose answer can be given by writing a whole book. Anyway, i  shall give my best effort to answer it as concisely as possible.The most effective political ideas are Liberalism and Socialism. But before describing these two ideas, let me give some light on few other ideas which were an important part of Human History: 1.Anarchism:The belief that the best government is absolutely no government is known   as Anarchism. This ideology argues that everything about                     governments is repressive and therefore must be abolished entirely.  Examples: Although neither violent nor strictly anarchist, members of the American Libertarian Party believe that government should be so small that it hardly ever interferes in citizens\u2019 lives, thereby best preserving individual liberty. Russia has had a long association with anarchism and nihilism(A related ideology that emphasizes that everything\u2014both government and society\u2014must be periodically destroyed in order to start anew.). Many prominent members of both movements were Russian, including Mikhail Bakunin, considered the father of anarchism. Russian nihilists engaged in a number of terrorist attacks in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,including the assassination of Czar Alexander II in 1881. 2.Absolutism:Traditionally, much of Western civilization\u2019s history was dominated by Absolutism, the belief that a single ruler should have control                     over every aspect of the government and of the people\u2019s lives. In some cultures, the absolute ruler was seen as a god in human form. Other peoples believed that their ruler had the divine right of kings, meaning that God had chosen the ruler to govern the rest.  The Greek philosopher Plato, for example, firmly believed that the best government would be run by a benevolent absolute ruler who would have the people\u2019s best interests at heart. English philosopher Thomas Hobbes,  perhaps the most persuasive proponent of absolutism argued that life without governments was \u201cnasty, brutish, and short\u201d and that people must willingly submit to absolute rulers\u2014even tyrannical ones\u2014in order to live longer, more stable lives!Example: In the Byzantine Empire, the double-headed eagle symbolized Caesaropapism. The two heads stood for church and state. This symbol clearly and graphically portrayed the unity of  religious and secular power in one person.   3.Conservatism:Conservatism began as a reaction against the liberal ideas taking hold of Europe during the French Revolution in the late eighteenth century. Conservatives believed that traditional institutions and beliefs would bring stability, concreteness, and human fallibility in the society.Example:In the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars (roughly 1792\u20131815), for example, most European governments actively worked to stop the spread of liberalism and democracy. Nevertheless, conservatives were not necessarily hostile to democracy but argued that some sort of monarchy was necessary.  Liberalism:Liberalism emphasizes on, Individualism(The individual takes priority over society.), Freedom(Individuals have the right to make choices  for themselves.) , Equality(No person is morally or politically                             superior to others.), Rationalism(Humans are capable of thinking logically and rationally.), Progress(New ideas can lead to progress in the sciences, the economy, and society.) and the The free market( Liberalism and capitalism go hand in hand.). In practice, this has meant favoring a democratic government.  Example:The revolutionaries in the American Revolution and French Revolution used liberal philosophy to justify the armed overthrow of tyrannical rule. Mill\u2019s Good Government: English philosopher J. S. Mill argued that good governments should be unrestricted enough to allow people\u2014both men and                            women\u2014to pursue their own interests and achieve their own potential as they see fit. Mill also believed that representative democracy was the best form of government because it allowed people to express their individuality and provided them the opportunity to take a more active role in the political process. The more active the people are, Mill thought, the more satisfied they are with their government.  Liberalism in India:  Mahatma Gandhi demonstrated through a humane, non-violent, and dignified protest,  that all humans were equal and should be treated equally, including  their being given the opportunity to govern themselves. This was a major  advance in the theory and practice of freedom and can be argued to have  had a major effect in ending the age of imperialism and the age of racial discrimination.The 1949 Constitution gave to Indians some of the liberal rights that the British and Americans had come to expect by then. In addition, India extended franchise to everyone: all adults had the right to vote in the republic. That was earlier than even most developed countries had provided to their citizens at that time.After Independence, Swatantra Party was founded as India's liberal party in 1959.After Rajagopalachari's death in 1972, it declined rapidly, and eventually merged with Bharatiya Kranti Dal led by Charan Singh in 1974. It has been India's only genuinely liberal political party till date, with a large number of seats in Parliament. Socialism:Socialism arose as a response to the Industrial Revolution, which was the emergence of technologies such as the steam engine and mass                     production. It caused major upheavals: In a very short time, many  people were forced to abandon agricultural ways of life for the modern                     mechanized world of factories.Karl Marx is the best-known theorist of socialism.    Socialist Beliefs:  Collectivism: Human beings are social by nature, and                             society should respect this. Individualism is poisonous. Public ownership: Society, not individuals, should                             own the property. Central economic planning: The government plans the economy; there is no free market. Economic equality: All citizens have roughly the same                             level of prosperity. Class Warfare:According to socialists, liberalism fails to live up to its promises of freedom and equality. Socialists blame the free market for liberalism\u2019s                         failings. Under a capitalist system, money and means of production are the  measures of power. The rich use the government to further their control and to increase their power over the  lower, poorer classes, so people are neither free nor equal. The Evolution of Socialism :Communism and democratic socialism are the two most prominent evolutions of socialism: 1.Communism: An authoritarian and revolutionary approach to achieving socialism. As an ideology, communism emphasizes a  classless society in which all members jointly share the means and output of production. The regimes of the Soviet Union and communist  China embody this ideology. Communists such as Vladimir Lenin, who became the first premier of the Soviet Union in 1917, argued that people can and must make the transition to socialism quickly rather than waiting for it to evolve. Authoritarian and violent measures are often required because the defenders of capitalism will fight ferociously to stop socialism from coming into being.          With the fall of communist regimes in Russia and Eastern Europe, communism has been in retreat for most of the 1990s and 2000s. There are, for example, fewer communist movements around the world than during  the Cold War. But there are still several major communist regimes, including the governments of China, North Korea and Cuba. 2.Democratic socialism: A peaceful and democratic approach to achieving socialism. As an ideology, democratic socialism also emphasizes a classless society in which all members jointly share the means and output of production. But unlike communism, democratic                             socialism attempts to achieve its goals peacefully via the democratic processes. Democratic socialists reject the need for immediate transition to socialism in favor of a gradualist approach, achieved by working within a democratic government. Economic inequalities should be remedied through a welfare state, a system that provides aid to the poor and help to the unemployed.              Germany\u2019s Social Democratic Party and Britain\u2019s Labor Party are contemporary examples of successful political parties heavily influenced by democratic socialism. Socialism in India: The socialist movement began to develop in India with the Russian Revolution. Bipin Chandra Pal and Bal Gangadhar Tilak were amongst the prominent Indians who expressed their admiration of Lenin and the new rulers in Russia.There are a large number of smaller Marxist parties, including the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist), Marxist Communist Party of India, Marxist Coordination Committee in Jharkhand, Janathipathiya Samrakshana Samithy, Communist Marxist Party and BTR-EMS-AKG Janakeeya Vedi in Kerala, Mazdoor Mukti (Workers' Emancipation) and Party of Democratic Socialism in West Bengal, Janganotantrik Morcha in Tripura, the Ram Pasla group in Punjab, and the Orissa Communist Party in Orissa.Noted Indian socialists include the founding leader of the All India Forward Bloc and the Indian National Army leader Subhas Chandra Bose and the country's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.There are many Nationalist ideologies like Fascism and Religious ideologies like Hinduism as well... but they are not so popular world-wide. thanks for A2A, keep asking more :-| ",

            "answer_text": "If the standards are prosperity, with wide distribution, and freedom (political freedom, civil rights, tolerance) and stability, there is no doubt that the most effective political ideology can be found in Northern Europe, where capitalism and socialism are balanced in a hybrid system, which, ironically but inevitably, has no ideology but is rather a kind of mosaic of institutions, some private, some public and which conforms to no known\u201cpure\u201d ideology. This is because all ideas, taken to the extreme become absurd, a kind of intellectual gargoyle, and this reality points to the limits of ideology as a blueprint for social success and balance. This system is supported less by ideas driven to their extremes than by best practices, by experience, and the lessons of the past. It is usually called social democracy, supported by democratic socialists but within a framework of capitalism, regulated and guided to the benefit of society as a whole, to the common good. Rousseau defined the common good in his classic The Social Contract as the sum of all desires and needs, minus all those which benefit only a part of society. Examples of the common good then would be peace, clean air and water, tolerance, and education, all of which are of value to all. The social democracies, as in the Nordic countries, work without a rigid ideology but rather a set of shared (common) values: that government is established for the common good, that labor should have a voice in the economy, that wealth and benefits should be distributed so that none are left to suffer uncared for. So at the root of this hybrid \u201cideology\u201d is a shared sense of concern for each other, less altruism than the realization that \u201cwe are all in the same boat\u201d and that harms one threatens all. The template for this vision of society is the commune=ity. This sense of community is the key to the success of social democracy, a sense that capitalism unbridled rips apart and which socialism, as a collective enterprise, might ossify into a conformity which crushes innovation, which is a hallmark of capitalism (tho not always for the good\u2026.consider nuclear weapons). Ideology, taken to its extremes, leads to, atrocities. Intense nationalism leads to war, pure capitalism leads to a world of immense wealth for a tiny elite and mass poverty for billions: today, globalization has led to a world where 5 billionaires, all of whom gained their wealth by exploiting taxpayer-funded technologies and gaming the system (ie eliminating competition) have more wealth than 3.5 billion people, one billion of whom live in abject misery on $1 a day or less and millions die of malnutrition. This is the absurd obscenity of \u201cpure\u201d capitalism. Social democracy, which can understood best not by studying its formal ideology, but by observing the institutions and their underlying assumptions and values, in existing, successful nations (which also co-operate as part of the greater EU)\u2026for social democracy is less a political theory than a successful experiment in combining the best features of capitalism (it\u2019s dynamic quality) within a broad social framework of the nation as a large family with all members valued and each sharing in the labor and fruits of their collective effort. The extreme strain of the individualism which underlies capitalism and of collectivism, which underlies socialism, meet somewhere in the middle where rigid ideology dissolves into mutual agreement to tolerate compromises instead of fighting over ideas. Social democracy, as the most successful model of human society we can find, is based on a social contract which enacts Rousseau\u2019s concept of the common good based on compromise in its original meaning: promising each other together to abide by rules which benefit all. In conclusion, I would like to suggest that ideology is a recipe for disaster, as it posits a set of ideas that compete with others, often ending in war. By contrast, social democracy, as we see it enacted in nations like Finland (the happiest society on earth), Sweden, Germany, and other European nations (but also in nations like Canada, Japan, and Australia) is less an ideology that an agreement to stop fighting over ideas and live by a social contract, the basis of which is a set of institutions and rules which work for that which is of benefit to all: the common good, which, in essence, is the function of legitimate government, according to the principles of democracy and the equality an inalienable rights on which it is founded. Democracy itself is less an ideology than a deep culture which incorporates basic rights, consent of the governed, an independent judiciary, a free and diverse press, an informed and engaged citizenry, an a culture of tolerance for differing ideas, which in itself tends to soften the hard and threatening edges of a rigid ideology which leads to purges and wars and destroys the social contract, on which all stable societies rely for cohesion. The social, in social democracy, refers to the emphasis on policies and institutions which go beyond personal or special interests and emphasizes what is good for all, such as clean air, safety, etc. Democracy, in the deep sense, is less an ideology than a strategy, by promoting consent of the governed among equals, to avoid rulers who, lacking the tailwind of popular support, are compelled to resort to lies, propaganda, threats, force, and if all else fails, torture and violence to overcome the resistance of the governed. So social democracy is a hybrid of the innovative dynamics of capitalism, combined with the emphasis on the common good, sustained by a strategy that ensures harmony by avoiding rulers compelled to use deception and force to rule over unwilling subjects.
