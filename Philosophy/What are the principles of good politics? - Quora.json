            "answer_text": "Like good behaviors in sporting events. Rules that are established and publicly enforced. I saw J.B. Holmes and Justin Thomas going head-to-head in the final holes of a golf event yesterday. They walked down many fairways together talking and even joking with each other (to not get too uptight\u2026helps both of them\u2026and they know they\u2019ll meet again being in the same profession). Below at left is Justin (in blue, who lost) and J.B. and Justin and Tiger Woods at right. And they\u2019re playing for over a $1M in some cases so don\u2019t think it\u2019s a trivial \u201cgood times\u201d competition. But the PGA really leverages sportsmanship so the sport stays healthy and youngsters want to consider a career in golf. Seems politicians don\u2019t have those priorities. Of course much of politics is wanting the public to like you most (popularity contest) as much as stance on issue. And pride rises when you want to be seen as \u201cbetter\u201d (or try to make the other look \u201cworse\u201d\u2026.like some TV or movie drama in a high school popularity contest). But the key is having \u201crules of the game\u201d and publicly exposed \u201cconsequences\u201d for breaking a rule. One good rule would be to not talk about anything but your own or your party\u2019s stances and not talk about anyone but yourself and your party. That would leave debates to contrast both views but each candidate could never \u201cdebate in absentia\u201d. I see that in the PGA\u2026\u2026no one talks about someone else\u2019s game, attitude, or career unless it is in praising those things. They can criticize their own game, abilities, thinking bit not others. A candidate should never act like a \u201cnon-competing critic\u201d.  ",

            "answer_text": "What are the principles of good politics? Sucker everyone that is dumb enough to believe you. You must gather those votes. It\u2019s a national entitlement. After that you can lean more factual, the uniformed voter is not listening anyway. Push the buzz word phrases. Talking points are the mother\u2019s milk of getting elected. BTW, getting elected is everything. Make lots of promises to those with money for your campaign. Sort of try to do your paybacks. Remember, this is a career move. ",
