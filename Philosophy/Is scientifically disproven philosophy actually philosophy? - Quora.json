            "answer_text": "Question worded originally as:Is scientifically disproven philosophy actually philosophy? Science can hardly hope to disprove philosophy, because philosophy sets the standards of science. Philosophy supersedes science. Perhaps the the intended question is whether science can disprove \u2018theories\u2019 and if disproved theories can be called \u2018actual\u2019 theories any more. The answer is quite easy. Science, as ordered by philosophy, has a duty to falsify theories against facts. When a theory is disproved, the normal result is that the scientists discard the disproved theory and may or may not have another theory that better fits the facts and better articulates the causal logic. Sadly however, some horribly false ideas as primitive theories persist among the ignorant, who are not guided by philosophy to understand that they have false beliefs. Let us consider an example. An uneducated animal naturally feels hunger, and is afraid that if other animals arrive to compete for the same food, it may starve. This animal level fear is built in the biology of all animals. A human, entirely uneducated and untrained in science, may be consciously aware of the fear of hunger: it is just too natural for him to fear that if there are too many other hungry people, he may have to starve. A belief in overpopulation is a belief that there are more people than the available food can adequately feed. This belief is not based on observation of facts and logical analysis of the existence of overpopulation, it is just a consciousness of fear of hunger. Philosophers have told scientists that they must first observe the facts, and then define what they want to known about, and then apply rigorous principles to analyze the causal character of the reality. Thus if one wants to learn about some phenomenon called overpopulation, one must observe the pertinent facts, and define the phenomenon rigorously so that what is not overpopulation is not confused with what is overpopulation, and what is overpopulation is not confused with what is not overpopulation. In short, he must have a clear sense of what constitutes overpopulation. Untrained people do not know how to think, just because they have not been trained to think correctly as established by philosophers such as Socrates and Russell. So, it is quite common to see many ignorant people presume that there is overpopulation, while they do not know what constitutes overpopulation. If one knew philosophy, one would know how to think about overpopulation. To define overpopulation, they would begin with a clear identification of the equilibrium population, which is just the right size of the population that is neither overpopulation nor underpopulation. A population larger than the equilibrium population would be called overpopulation. Guided by logic of equilibrium rigorously established by philosophy of science, one would know to look for two terminators: some causal force that will terminate the tendency of the population to be larger, and another force that will terminate its tendency to be smaller than what it is. Causality means that there is a definite certain cause why the equilibrium population is not smaller than what it is, because there is something that would not let it be smaller. Likewise, the population is not larger than what it is because there is something that does not let it be larger than what it is. An economic scientist takes a very narrow view of causality to identify the determinants that terminate the population from both sides: one determining the lower limit and the other determining the upper limit. The cost of sustaining the population with the food and other means of sustenance sets the upper limit: a population cannot be larger than what it is because the cost of a larger population is too large to bear (e.g. there is no food to feed them). The lower limit is set by the benefit of population: the population cannot be smaller than what it is because the benefit that the population delivers in the form of productive work is large enough to sustain the population. The equilibrium occurs when the upper limit is the same as the lower limit: the marginal cost is equal to the marginal benefit. Counted only in the amount of food, the equilibrium population is one where the extra individual delivers the benefit of extra food he produces, which is also equal to the cost of keeping the extra man alive, that is, the last mean is barely able to feed himself. So, in its most primitive formulation, overpopulation would be a situation where the excess people are unable to get the food to stay alive. Look at the facts, and the world is oversupplied with food. There is certainly no overpopulation in terms of food availability. But science gets the dictate from philosophy that it must find the determinant of the actual population. If the world in 2018 produced enough food to feed 13120 million people (with 2660 million tons of food), why would the actual population be merely 7700 million (which is less than 13120 million by a very large population of 6420 million people)? Knowledgeable economists have found that modern urban people think of education as a necessary means of sustenance, and the high cost of education of the children forbid parents from raising enough children who could eat the food. That is, food does not set an upper limit, but education does. The world in 2018 did not have 6420 million unborn people because the parents were unwilling to bear them as they could not provide for education. In short, a parent refuses to bear a child if the parent cannot bear the cost of education (though he can bear the cost of food alone). Sadly, there are too many people who keep believing the false theory of Malthus that the population tends to grow faster than food supply: the fact is just the opposite: food supply has actually grown faster than population. So one ends up like poet Kahlil Gibran who said: I can give you my love, but I cannot give you my thought. We can only feel a sense of pity for those people who cannot think, and hence who believe that there is overpopulation. They accept a disproved theory because they cannot think properly. So, we have this sad situation: scientists have disproved false theories. That does not prevent ignorant people from believing false theories. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a blurred line between science and philosophy. For example, spare the rod and spoil the children was the idea that you must beat children to make them good adults. Countless stuides have shown the opposite is true, if we define good adult as loving and happy. So did we disprove a philosophy or a scientific childhood development theory? I think if a thing can be scientifically disproven, one could argue that it was never a philosophical belief, but rather only bad science that people wanted to be true. Only the other hand, pure philosophy is generally untestable. For example, take the proposition that we must be moral creatures to be completely fulfilled. You can\u2019t disprove or prove that sort of thing. ",
