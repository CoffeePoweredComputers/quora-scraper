            "answer_text": "That in the face of criticisms it had to keep changing it's criteria and come up with excuses until it lost credibility. Their basic claim was that there are only 2 types of meaningful statements. 1. It must be verifiable by sense experience. 2. It is an analytical statement. Basically one in which the conclusion of the second part is contained in the first part.  Mathematical equations, logical arguments etc.  All other statements, such as indiscrimanant killing is wrong, are \"non sense\" and say nothing about reality outside the speaker. Criticisms: 1. How can you verify a claim about a distant galaxy we can't visit. To this they replied by saying it only had to be verifiable in principle if we could go there. Well What about historical facts? Reply it would be verifiable in principle, if we had been there at the time. 3. The claim that there are only 2 types of meaning full statements etc., is itself neither analytic or verifiable from sense evidence. Reply: Well umm, in logic a statement can't be applied to itself, without contradiction e.g. on the blackboard \"this statement is false\". Russell\"s anomaly.  4. And finally, The statement of logical positivism is obviously meaningful, and is itself an example of a meaningful statement which is neither verifiable or analytic, it's just false. ",

            "answer_text": "My objection is- how would you determine whether some statement is verifiable or not? How can you simply eliminate the possibility that one would not be able to find a way to verify something that now appears to be unverifiable? My concern basically is with some physics and metaphysics questions. Physics questions like- how did the world start? Metaphysics questions like- how does consciousness fit in with rest of the things? It might be that since time itself might have started at the beginning of the world, my first question is meaningless. But of courses as soon as one realises this, one can restate the same question about the same thing to bring back a meaning to it. My second question relies on the hope that at the end of everything, there is just one truth. A kind of truth which makes everything fit. We have studied few things about the universe. We are also a part of it. What do we know about ourselves? These questions, as of now, appear unverifiable. But i will keep them in my mind, fearing i might miss something if i don't keep my perspective a little broader than allowed by logical positivism. ",
