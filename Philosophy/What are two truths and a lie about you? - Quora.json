            "answer_text": "Okay here are 2 truths and 1 lie: When I was visiting family, my mom rented a car and let me drive it illegally around San Diego.It was love at first sight with this boy I met in my psychology class. Since I really liked him, I wanted to get to know him better so I inched my way closer and closer to him. After two weeks, he said that he liked me. Now, we are dating.My stepdad was an illegal before. He did get transported back to Mexico. When I was little, my pregnant mom and I traveled to Tijuana when it was really bad there to help him get his green card and stuff.Here is the truths and the lie: \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. TruthYes, this was actually true. I did drive around San Diego illegally and it was fun as hell! No regrets! LieThis was a full on lie! I never fell in love and I was homeschooled last school year so I couldn\u2019t have met anyone in my psychology class since it was online. TruthThis is unfortunately true. My Pregnant mom and I had to travel very long ways over there while my dad was drinking and partying back in his hometown. We were treated like shit. He manipulated her to do his green card by getting married. Now, they are very unhappy but she\u2019s glad that she did or my little brother wouldn\u2019t exist. Thats all folks! ",

SPORTS When I was younger, I played basketball, soccer, golf, and racquetball. However, I was best at soccer and racquetball. TRUE- My grandpa took me to play golf and racquetball, and I played in local kids leagues for soccer and basketball. My least favorite sport to play is currently basketball. ALSO TRUE- It\u2019s just countless running back and forth, hoping for somebody to pass you the ball. Plus if you play it outdoors, in the sun, you can\u2019t see the baskets you\u2019re shooting at. And everybody always seems to be better than you somehow. I would rather watch hockey than American football. LIE- You can\u2019t see what is going on. The puck is too small and the action is too fast. With American football, it\u2019s more entertaining and you can see what is happening. MATH I used to go on tumblr instead of pay attention in my 8th grade algebra class. TRUE- My teacher sucked. A lot. I have never retaken any math classes due to failing the class. LIE- My 8th grade algebra teacher (the Tumblr teacher) did not reset your grade at the beginning of the new semester. So I had to start my second semester of Algebra with a C+, and I dropped by the end of the semester to a D. I retook Algebra 1b at the beginning of 9th grade- and passed with 94.3%! I prefer Algebra over Geometry. TRUE- Geometry is too much finding proofs. I just want to solve equations and find answers. It feels like a puzzle or a riddle. There\u2019s something satisfying about finding what X equals, checking the question, and seeing that it fits! SOCIAL LIFE I am a member of my school\u2019s Jewish Student Union. Lie- I don\u2019t even think my school has one. I mostly hang out with theater kids. True- They\u2019re some of my best friends. We do crew together and watch the shows at our school to support each other. I once took my friend to see Book of Mormon at the Pantages! I am a part of the online tropical cyclone community. True- It\u2019s pretty fun. Someone will show a satellite photo of a hurricane/cyclone/typhoon and everybody will throw their guesses. Eventually, somebody will find it on Wikipedia archives and we start over again. It\u2019s tons of fun. POLITICAL I am liberal, but I am pro-gun. True- I consider myself to have leftist ideals, and I call myself liberal. However, I fully understand that there are people that need guns, such as air marshals, or lower class citizens who may need to defend themselves from gangs or violence in their neighborhoods. On the contrary, guns such as AR-15 rifles, or any other semi-automatic weapons, should not be available for the public to purchase. There needs to be a line between constitutional rights and public safety I find it difficult to be friends with people who have different political views from myself. Lie- Many of my friends are Republican, and support Trump. We often joke about our political differences, and make jokes about Trump (just because). We have very interesting and fruitful conversations. They are some of the funniest people I know! I believe that there is not an infinite number of genders. True- I fully support the idea of a Gender Spectrum. However, I feel like there should not be an \u201cinfinite about of genders.\u201d I support anybody who does not go by male or female pronouns. On the contrary, this list of genders is far too long and repetitive.  If you go by male or female pronouns, go ahead. A bit of both or neither? Fine. But you don\u2019t need to constantly say, \u201cI am a transgender boy\u201d or \u201cTransmasculine two-spirit\u201d or \u201cdemigirl/guy\u201d. Just tell me what your pronouns are, and I\u2019ll respect that. RANDOM I have never seen Ratatouille. True- I\u2019ve never seen it. Not one bit. Tell me if it\u2019s good, and maybe I\u2019ll watch it. I was once stabbed in my left leg by a checking table. True- It\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ll link it here once I answer in detail about it. I prefer chocolate-flavored candy over fruity-flavored candy. Lie- If you take me to get Fro-Yo, you can bet that I\u2019ll get strawberry, mango, orange, lime, watermelon, etc. Fight me. ",
