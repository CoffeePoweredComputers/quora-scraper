            "answer_text": "The central dilemma of the crew in Memoirs of a Spacewoman. They visit a planet where an intelligent species is being studied. They are essentially telepathic caterpillars who love nothing more in the world than making art (by arranging colored marbles formed from their excretions into intricate and fascinating patterns) and having sex (in giant underwater group orgies). They are constantly stymied from pursuing both of these activities by the belligerent telepathic admonitions of giant moths, constantly sweeping over them and scolding them for their sin, encouraging them to refrain from the marble-making and the orgies, to practice abstinence in all ways. These telepathic attacks lead to a great deal of anxiety and sadness among the caterpillar creatures\u2014and the humans studying them. Later, we learn that these are, in fact, the same species, much like caterpillars on Earth\u2014there is a metamorphosis from one to the other complete with cocoon and everything. However, unlike caterpillars on Earth, the transformation does not involve complete remaking of the body, but only exterior features. They get a bit slimmer and grow wings, and that\u2019s about it. They can still eat. But their brains are completely reformed\u2014they cannot remember their lives as caterpillars at all. It also turns out the moths have very good reasons for their telepathic attacks. The same muscles used to form the colorful marbles wind up powering and helping form the wings, and the act of forming the marbles repeatedly over a larva\u2019s lifetime distorts their shape enough that the moths they will become cannot fly. They fall out of their cocoons and die ungracefully on the ground. But even worse than that is how reproduction works. These moth creatures do not have sex, and they do not have ovipositors. If they participated in one of the underwater orgies as larva, they take on the moth form already full of fertilized eggs, and when they have grown sufficiently\u2014after a few months or years\u2014they burst forth from the end of the moth\u2019s abdomen, falling into the water where they will grow, inevitably killing the moth in the process in a violent and painful way. But if they never did\u2014and few don\u2019t\u2014there is nothing preventing from living indefinitely in a state of perpetual bliss. They do not age. All of their tissues regenerate as needed. They are, barring accidents or attacks, effectively immortal. So the moths all along have been staging these telepathic attacks, making the caterpillars miserable for their entire lives in the hopes of creating more immortals that can only come into existence after the caterpillars, from their perspective, have died. The moral dilemma, then, is: is it okay to torture someone to abject misery until they die if it is the only way to ensure another will be born into near-permanent bliss? ",

            "answer_text": "A question or decsion involving ethics is never equally balanced between right and wrong. When people see a \"ethical delima\" when trying to decide to do or not do something, they know what the ethical thing is to do. The real question is are they willing to pay the price for doing the ethical thing. ",
