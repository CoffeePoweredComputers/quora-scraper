            "answer_text": "When it comes to ethics and politics, Aristotle is one of the best. Here are the things I find most useful about his work when thinking about the principles of nature, human happiness/virtue, and the proper orientation towards the Good: Human things are inherently variable. While Natural Law exists, it is actualized by human beings.Happiness is the end of all action and happiness is virtue; however, this does not mean that if one acquires virtue that one will be happy. Happiness also requires external goods - a combination of resources, study, and effort in order to conform the activity of the soul with a life of virtue. To even begin to know it, one must first know moral conduct which requires a proper upbringing. Aristotle teaches us that happiness is a part of our spirit \u2014 perhaps the mean between reason and appetite.Morality is not natural, but learned and habituated, therefore mutable. Aristotle moves happiness and virtue from the poetic/divine realm into the philosophical, will-based realm of manly action (praxis) and rational faculty. Happiness is for the soul; excellence is for the body.If happiness is virtue and virtue is practiced, then, too, happiness must be something we do. Without putting things into practice (words without action) they mean nothing.For Aristotle, there are three ways of life available to human beings: (1) The life of Pleasure; (2) The political life; and (3) The theoretical/philosophical life. These three could be considered pleasurable (sensual), political (honor-seeking), and contemplative (intellectual). These ways follow the three aristocratic castes described earlier by Plato as: bronze, silver, and gold.The life of pleasure is what most men seek in the pleasures of the body. This is the way of life most tragically mistaken as capable of making people happy. Great appetites for pleasure know no bounds and push aside the power of reasoning. Aristotle saw the orientation towards pleasure as being the result of a poor upbringing and a lack of education.For Aristotle, one must not only be virtuous, but also engage in human relationships because these remain critical for happiness, but these relations also depend upon virtue. I mean, how can one be a friend if they are untrustworthy? In this way, friendship is indispensable to life and to justice. A gentleman will demonstrate, through his behavior and through his friendships, that virtues are not only beautiful, but they are good. In this way, prudence is made possible for men who know virtue and men who know friendship. The good man wishes his friends the greatest of human goods and gives affection to his friends freely. Friends must naturally share a common bond and that is often a shared view of the just. Justice and friendship are inextricably linked and honor is given to those who practice both.In terms of the best one can aspire to be, the high-minded (virtuous) man will not run from battle (courage) nor will he do wrong to anyone (justice). High-mindedness is the crowning virtue.The character of man is determined by his choices. Proper choices are not simply driven by appetite or passion or wish or opinion, but aimed at nobility, over and over again. Magnanimity (a greatness of soul) is to be self-sufficient and justice is towards the community. Together these things form the political questions that Aristotle considered so thoroughly.Politics is the proper balance, or mean, between the individual and the collective. Therefore, justice is the practice of virtue both within ourselves and in relation to others.Happiness is connected to friendship, justice, and learning. We need friends to practice living virtuously and that starts with basic courtesy.Everything in moderation implies a balance between defect and excess, or in other words the mean that, for Aristotle, is virtue.",

            "answer_text": "Utterly fascinating and amazing. I am afraid people aren\u2019t really aware how amazing Aristotle is. Most people are acquainted with his political philosophy, and his literary theory (his poetics). So they associate him with the ideas of \u201cman as a social beast\u201d, \u201cthe catharsis\u201d, his \u201cvirtue ethics\u201d, \u201cthe six types of government\u201d, and his interests in botany and zoology. This is all nice and well, but it is only the tip of the iceberg. I fell in love with Aristotle via his esoteric writings - his so called Organon, the texts concerning logic. These texts are quite abstract, difficult to read, and obscure. I am afraid that without the proper guidance one cannot really \u201cdecipher\u201d the Organon. But in essence they are mind-blowing, utterly fascinating and deep. Contemporary logic owes a lot to him, but what we nowadays call formal symbolic logic is really a beast of its own. However, it is not his contributions that I laud, but his utter genius. This is a man who two millennia ago sat all alone, in the quite of his room, and described the structure of the human mind. He basically showed how the mind works, how we reason, how we form logically valid thoughts. The level of abstraction is huge and his attention to detail even bigger. When you compare him with modern neuro-scientists, psychologists, and philosophers of mind, who all use statistics, advanced technology and the like, you can\u2019t but feel humbled that you have had the chance to read him and acquaint yourself with his ideas. When I read Plato for example, I also feel in the presence of genius, but a genius that I can conceive. His method is quite clear and precise. But when it comes to Aristotle I feel in a presence of a being that I can\u2019t imagine even existed. I personally find Plato more colorful, more artistic, his writing have a soul of their own, his voice is compelling and engaging, I agree with most of his views concerning everything (from art to science). On the other hand, I don\u2019t quite agree with Aristotle. His views on life were more pragmatic and straight-forward, more \u201cboring\u201d really, but like I said the way he presented his ideas, and the way he surpassed Plato is beyond understanding. He advanced the Western civilization further than anybody else in his time. He isn\u2019t what we might call today a \u201cmust read\u201d, because his writings are esoteric, meaning meant to be read by a selected few. Plus, there is nothing new to learn form them, in today\u2019s sense, but they are one of the most precious artifacts we have. They should be conserved and loved by generations to come. I might have praised him more than I intended, but I just really wanted to capture my fascination with this giant of a man. ",
