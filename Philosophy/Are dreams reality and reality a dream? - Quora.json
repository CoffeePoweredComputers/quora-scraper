            "answer_text": "The question are dreams the reality and is the reality our dreams is a topic of discussion and wonder that goes back centuries\u2026 Many respected philosophers queried the same question, Plato, Socrates, Aristotle. I have a sleep disorder called narcolepsy, narcoleptics naturally lucid dream, have hypnogogic and hypnopompic hallucinations as well as dream initiated waking dreams and just a mess of hellish nightmares. It makes our dreams extremely real and vivid\u2026 I have numerous times experienced the waking senses of touch, taste, feel, and smell in my lucid dreams and dream hallucinations. When you don\u2019t know what is going on (that you have a sleep disorder) you ask the question yourself\u2026 \u201cAm I awake or dreaming?\u201d Only you also question your sanity. That is why I began to research the possibility of if dreams are the reality. I first ran across Rene Descartes dream argument. He theorized that being awake has the same content as dreaming. That dreamers have frequently been confused into believing they are having a waking experience while they were actually dreaming. He went on to argue that one can\u2019t really prove that they are not dreaming, we can state our senses are telling us we are awake but then questioned if we can trust or senses? Can our senses fool us? Could our senses fail us? I admit it is intriguing, and it relieved me some that others had the same curious question as I did from my personal dream experiences. Equally as interesting is that Neuroscientists figured out that our dreaming reveals the same brain patterns as does our conscious life (waking life). Dreaming and being awake are identical neurologically speaking. It definitely gives you a lot to consider and even debates the definition of reality itself? So where do I stand with all this\u2026 lol its a lot of thinking. I don\u2019t know that it matters to me so much anymore. If I had to make a choice between the two worlds I would pick the one that my husband, children, grandchildren, and pets were in most frequently rather that is the dream or the reality, or the reality is the dream doesn\u2019t really have merit as long as I can be with them.

            "answer_text": " You have to tell me kindly what you mean by the term \u201cdream\u201d. There are conflicting usages of this term. In \u201cday-dreaming\u201d, you mean \u201clong-range desirous reflections\u201d by the term \u201cdream\u201d. In \u201csomnolent or nocturnal dream\u201d, you mean \u201cinadvertent showing-up of deranged memory-chunks\u201d by the same term \u201cdream\u201d. The second meaning applies to even similar mental experiences encountered while being awake. In all these cases, the medium of dream is \u201cthought\u201d. So, metaphysics of thought would have to be called for prior to further delineation or dissection of dream. The seat of a thought has been known to be \u201creal\u201d since long. The material of this reality has been identified as brain dusts (neurons, nerve cells). A cloud of neurons is felt as a thought. So roughly we can say that thought is real. That is to say, dream is real whether it belongs to the domain of day-dream, nocturnal dream or sporadic dream. However, this reality may be relevant or irrelevant. Sometimes, bias against the irrelevant reality tends to push it into the domain of unreality. We have to be careful about that. When we say dream is real, we don\u2019t imply that any reality is dream. Let me give you an analogy to clarify this difficult point. Ocean is water. But any quantity of water isn\u2019t ocean, though this quantity of water could be a \u201cpotential\u201d constituent of ocean. A dew-drop isn\u2019t ocean, though it could evaporate away to be a part of a cloud that would rain into the ocean. Now think of the reality of a mountain. The mountain-view, as a percept, would become a memory chunk that could be advertently or inadvertently recalled into a day-dream or sporadic dream. This doesn\u2019t mean that the mountain is a bare dream. Summing up, ordinary dreams are deranged subtle realities, true, but it would be absurd to say that realities are stark dreams. ",

            "answer_text": "Interesting question Rod. One of the things that I find fascinating about dreams, as a student of psychology, I learned that, like opinions, all the theorists have their own viewpoint on what dreams are. Therefore it all depends on who\u2019s theories one wants to lend credence. Whose scholarship are you willing to trust? I\u2019ve always been drawn to Jung. But whomever\u2019s theories one desires to lend credibility to, several things must be said about them. Everybody dreams, but not everyone remember their dreams, why this is is a current problem in psychologyAre dreams reality? They are in the sense that they are a very real part of the human experience.Is reality a dream? Is this the matrix? What is real? What is imagined? Think long and hard enough and those questions will drive you either mad or to find answers. I\u2019m with Descartes: Cogito Ergo Sum.",

            "answer_text": "The reason I feel that dreams when we are sleeping are not real is that it\u2019s clear when dreaming that what we see is simulated by our inner minds in that if we blink for too long, the scene disappears and the dream sequencer has trouble redrawing it. Dreams also abruptly change and evolve in unpredictable ways, almost as if by magic, with strange elements and happenings, almost by whim of an inattentive thinker. Reality is persistent and well-formed, predictable and full of clarity, while dreams are essentially the opposite. This leads me to form the conclusion that dreams are developed from the elements of our own imagination. ",

Down to the subatomic level everything is the same so there is no \u201ctrue reality\u201d to begin with, because everything is connected. Dreams don't come true, you just don't realize they are right there, in front of you, waiting. Because dreams come from our real-life experiences and our subconscious mind wants to tell us something. We made our reality by being conscious anyways and before that by dreaming of what comes next. Dreams came way before consciousness, because consciousness developed from our dreams. Your dreams are signaling you for change, because our minds know that there is no reality without us. You are never dreaming, because if you did you would be dead and there would be no \u201creality\u201d for you to occupy. ",
