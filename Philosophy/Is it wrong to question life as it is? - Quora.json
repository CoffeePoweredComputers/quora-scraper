            "answer_text": "No; why would it be wrong? Point is, perhaps, but not wrong. \"Life as it is\" is an awfully broad phrase; are you questioning the extinction of the dinosaurs or the transfer of physical functions from the cerebellum to the basal ganglia? Or do you mean life in its social sense, with religious and ethnic conflicts and political maneuvering? A little more information along these lines would be very helpful in writing an interesting answer; otherwise, the answer is entirely generic: it's never wrong to question things as they are ",

            "answer_text": "The short answer is that it\u2019s not wrong to question ANYTHING. Questioning is how you arrive at insights and partial or full answers to your questions. What CAN be wrong is how you go about questioning something and what you choose to do with the insights and answers you get. ",
