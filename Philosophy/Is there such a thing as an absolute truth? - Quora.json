            "answer_text": "With sarcasm, I could say that yes, there is an absolute truth. The truth is what you know and believe. But on a serious note though, we could never know if and where the absolute truth exists. I have two thoughts on this topic. Thought 1 Humans have known everything through the history. Why don\u2019t we take a look on the scientific discoveries? For example, for hundreds of years we knew that the Earth was flat. For another centuries we knew that the sun orbited around the Earth. And we were so certain of our knowledge at this time.  In the same manner we are equally confident that the knowledge we possess now is 100% correct and there is almost nothing more to discover. Thought 2 The second idea that came to my mind is perspective. Everybody has their unique view on everything, no matter if the information was discovered personally or forcibly fed to them. If you walked in a countryside at night and saw a flying saucer, what would you think? Maybe you would start thinking that there might be something more besides humans. The fast light you saw was the true UFO for you and you are not lying. While telling your friend about your experience, he stays skeptical as he denounces the light to be an experimental army jet. After all, you live near an air force base. Your friend has seen many similar lights before and he is not lying when he declares it to be a jet. All the while\u2026 the light was a bigger meteor that burned in the atmosphere a bit more than usual. The point is that what one person thinks is true, may be true to him as he perceives it the way he does. The problem is that we are too tiny to see the whole picture. It\u2019s not only about the planet, it\u2019s about every field. Why else are there so many religions that denounce their rival religions?  Imagine that there are multiple identical jigsaw puzzles scattered around. Imagine that every person holds some pieces. Some might hold 10 pieces, some may hold 100, some even more. Some people have some identical pieces in one hand, but it\u2019s hard to identify the difference as the pieces of sky or sea are almost identical anyway. Some people have both identical pieces and they can start a conversation about their common knowledge. Some of them will cooperate to complete the jigsaw puzzles, while some of them don\u2019t, leaving the jigsaw puzzle unfinished. Conclusion Employ critical thinking when gathering new information. The piece of information may be true, but it may as well be out of context, leading to wrong implications. ",

            "answer_text": "There are really three kinds of truths-general, judicial, and scientific truths. Truth (General): n. a subset(s) which existed with a large number of logical and accurate correspondences or has a relatively large probability of existing in the future and will have a large number of logical accurate correspondences. (scientific truth had a large number of accurate and logical correspondences in the past and will probably continue to have a large number of accurate correspondences in the future and is a standard of truth which future general truth should also have) The greater the number and accuracy of the logical correspondence will be the more true it will be!!!!!! Truth (Judicial) (Jtruth): n. a relevant fact(s) and/or concept(s) which may be used to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the (nondeceptive and/or nonfraudulent) and/or honest nature of something through evidence and/or testimony by hopefully (non deceptive and/or nonfraudulent) and/or honest people and it may include scientific truth or testimony by hopefully (nondeceptive and/or nonfraudulent) and/or honest specialists in their field. Scientific truth may therefore be a subset of judicial truth during a trial. Truth (Scientific) (Struth): n. a scientifically proven subset(s) proven by using the scientific method Absolute: adj. complete The only absolute truths are in mathematics even though we still don\u2019t really understand what zero and infinity really means. You could say the 2 + 2 =4 is an absolute truth. You could also say that certain facts are absolute truths. Humans, cars, cellphones, and plants now exist. Yes, they may not exist forever so if your definition of absolute is something which exists forever then your only answer will probably be the universe. ",
