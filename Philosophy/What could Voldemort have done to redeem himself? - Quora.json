            "answer_text": "It depends on your view of \u201credemption\u201d :- If you take the Darth Vader approach (one final good act wiping out DECADES of being evil) then he could have dropped his wand during the final battle and just let Harry kill him. That would have redeemed him to some degree because it would have shown he was willing to let his empire die. If you take the Angel approach (you can\u2019t make up for the evil you do, but you can just continue to try) then he would have had to go to jail, pay his debt to society and come out and then maybe become the DaDa teacher to make up for what he did. However the truth is he planned mass genocide, imprisonment, murder, mass murder and oversaw one of the most evil regimes in magical history. There is nothing he could do to redeem himself - he was, quite honestly, better off dead. ",

            "answer_text": "He could leave Britain and go find a place where he can use his magical powers to help people in need for an eternity. Before he leaves, he can send a letter to Harry Potter telling him that he doesn\u2019t want Britain anymore and that he\u2019ll leave him alone. He can also either provide evidence linking all of his Death Eaters to crimes that will get them convicted or kill them all himself. Those that are willing to repent with him can join his new organization and help him help others. The guy went through the effort of becoming immortal, so if he wants to help people, he can feed them, heal them and provide clean drinking water and shelter. Lord Voldemort would become humanity\u2019s eternal protector. Wizards have cures for all mundane diseases, so if he really wants to be a bro, he can openly reveal the existence of magic to everyone, and then spread these cures around the world. That should save a few billion lives, right? And he\u2019ll keep doing it forever, finding any areas where there\u2019s a need for resources and providing them. And what are people going to do if they don\u2019t like him revealing magic, kill him? No, they\u2019d be too scared to act against him. Besides, he\u2019s good now and would have far too many people willing to die for him as thanks for saving so many lives for anyone to bother making an attempt on his life. This is all terribly out of character though. Voldemort didn\u2019t see anything wrong with his behavior. ",
