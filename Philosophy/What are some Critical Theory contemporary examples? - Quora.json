            "answer_text": "The Frankfurt school authors and theorists is the list of names you are looking for. That\u2019s the short name for a list of philosophers who looked at society and human relations and communication via a Marxist and anti-capitalist bent (or lens or paradigm). In addition, they had a distinctively anti-technology bent. The authors most typically associated with this viewpoint are Horkheimer, Adorno, Marcuse, and Habermas I suppose also have a link to this viewpoint. The work of Antonio Gramsci was rather influential on this group. More recent critical theory has ventured a bit away from this basis. Presumably they are some combination of Marx and Foucault in terms of influences. Critical theory challenges the triumphalism and overall \u201csuccesses\u201d of Enlightenment and Enlightenment reason. For more on this: Frankfurt School I would suggest at least three critiques: The challenge is the theory isn\u2019t particularly falsifiable, except in relation to the \u201csuccess \u201c of capitalism\u2014and capitalism has certainly had successes at least economically speaking.It seems to propose generally an either/or question. Capitalism or something else (usually some version of Marxism). This seems a pretty dichotomous choice. Why not reform capitalism or otherwise have a mixed economy. Or what if all the CEOs in capitalism were ethical? Doesn\u2019t that solve the critique of capitalism?Not to mention any singular focus: \u201cits all class\u201d or \u201cits all capitalism\u201d is likely to miss the boat. Human life is more complex. Thats the nature of both the complexity of human existence and reality. Systems theory is real.",
