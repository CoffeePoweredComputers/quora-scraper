            "answer_text": "time is relative parameter,  it is rate of change of state of matter and energy if there is no matter than also relative time exist for energy. assuming there was only energy which was not imparted to matter yet. Einstein's e=mc2 only stands for the relation between energy and matter here also energy is inversely proportional to time. at t=0,  E= infinity but infinity energy is not practical, otherwise no creation start. So time has some value of 0.000.......0000.....0x.  E= mc^2 is not the definition of energy. It's just rest energy, not anything else. More appropriately, in the case of a \"free particle\" (one that has no forces acting on it), the relativistic equation for energy becomes E^2 = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2, where c is the speed of light and p is the particle's momentum. If you let m=0, then this reduces to E = pc. Quantum Mechanics shows that photons have energy related to their frequency. It has 0 mass, but still has energy; therefore, it has momentum E/c. The key point is that the formula E=mc^2 is referring only to rest energy, not all the energy of something. 0 mass means 0 rest energy, but there are other energies than rest energy. Also, keep in mind that E=mc^2 shows that there's an equivalence of mass and energy. You can convert mass to energy (as in a nuclear reaction) or you can turn energy into mass (as in pair production). This leads to the idea that while not exactly the same, energy and mass are different forms of the same fundamental \"being.\" The photonic particles (light) becomes trapped. This combination of photons wrapped up in collapsed sheets of spacetime is what we call matter. E=MC^2 is more of a chemical reaction than a physical law. ",

            "answer_text": "Exactly NO!!! To answer this question, we need to see how time dilation happens. In special relativity, moving clock works slower than the stationary clock. Time dilation in special relativity must be investigated along with contraction of length. Because they are inseparable from each other. Contraction of a physical object means compactness of atoms and sub atomic particles. Now the question is, what is the clock? Every observable or detectable physical being is a clock. From the standpoint of feeling, time has an arrow from past to future. This attitude is consistent with classical mechanics and thermodynamics, but is not compatible with relativity and quantum mechanics. \"Time is what happens when nothing else does.\" Richard Feynman said. It is a philosophy statement (not defined) of time and it is not even a physical statement. \"If nothing happened, if nothing changed, then time would stop.\u201d Julian Barbour said. Some other authors and researchers say that time is an illusion. In general, time is part of the physical properties and is not an independent quantity.

            "answer_text": "According to Newton the answer is yes According to Einstein the answer is no Who is right, who is wrong. Newton declared that time is absoluteand wrote that time .flows equably without relation to anything external\u201d. Einstein had another opinion. He wanted to know that Where does the conception of time come from?\u201d What is the essence of time?\u201d. To explain these questions he created two theories: SRT and GRT . =.. According to SRT / GRT time is relative and depends on the mass and speed It means that different moving mass-bodiescan create different time. It also means that space and time is only a result of some physical process of moving mass / moving particles. The causefor time and space to be able to appear is moving mass / moving particles. ",

First, without the Matter there wouldn't be anything capable to determine the existence of Time or Space. Secondly, Time can only be measured using Matter, namely, interactions between material objects. So, if there is no Matter, the concept of Time would cease to exist instantly. ",

If their is only space with no matter or e/M waves, then it will not be possible to distinguish between previous and subsequent state, hence no perception of time. But no perception does not necessarily mean that time does not exist. When you sleep you cannot perceive but time ticks. You come to know about it only when you are awaken after sleep.
