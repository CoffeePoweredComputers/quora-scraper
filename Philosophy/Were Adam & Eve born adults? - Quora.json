            "answer_text": "Think, Von, of the concept \u2018born.\u2019 To be born one has to be birthed by a mother. Eve was the first mother, therefore she could not have been born: Genesis 3:20 After this Adam named his wife Eve, because she was to become the mother of everyone living. Adam and Eve were not born; they were created. They had no childhood; they were created adults. Adam was created first and some time later Eve was created: Genesis 2:7 And Jehovah God went on to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living person. Genesis 2:18 Then Jehovah God said: \u201cIt is not good for the man to continue to be alone. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.\u201d \u2026: :21 So Jehovah God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping, he took one of his ribs and then closed up the flesh over its place. 22 And Jehovah God built the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man. 23 Then the man said:\u201cThis is at last bone of my bonesAnd flesh of my flesh. This one will be called Woman,Because from man she was taken.\u201d 24 That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and they will become one flesh. (NWT) So, Von, the first human couple was not born but created as adults from the choice elements of the earth. They could have sustained their earthly bodies forever by continuing to eat the nutrients provided from the earth through the vegetation of the garden. They chose to disobey Jehovah although He had told them the consequence for disobedience: Genesis 2:15 Jehovah God took the man and settled him in the garden of E\u02b9den to cultivate it and to take care of it. 16 Jehovah God also gave this command to the man: \u201cFrom every tree of the garden you may eat to satisfaction. 17 But as for the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat from it, for in the day you eat from it you will certainly die. Their disobedience returned them to their origins; dust of the ground, unconsciousness, nothingness: Genesis 3:19 In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "According to Genesis 7 Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. 22 Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. 25 Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame. Under the assumption that kids don\u2019t marry (although back in those days a 12 yr old could be considered an adult) we can postulate that Adam and Eve were created as adults. Mind you this is the bible , a book put together by voting at the Nicene convention (where reincarnation was left out by 1 vote) based on a boatload of hearsay and cobbled together to please as many pagan religions as possible so it might contain some untruths here and there.
