            "answer_text": "The fields of philosophy, religion and science are dedicated to answering this question and haven\u2019t yet come up with a fully satisfactory answer. Please keep that in mind\u2014kindly\u2014when perusing this answer. I am a Christian and am frequently accused of holding irrational beliefs. I generally respond by saying that\u2019s a subjective judgment isn\u2019t it? I use this to demonstrate that there is a subjective aspect to what we call rationality, and simply saying an opponent is irrational because they disagree with you is not a good example of rational truth. It turns out, that\u2019s a pretty good example of irrational \u2018truth.\u2019 (I understand it\u2019s used in politics a good bit as well.) :-) Rationality implies the conformity of one's beliefs with one's reasons to believe, and of one's actions with one's reasons for action. We call some fears rational and others irrational based on their reflection of the reality of genuine risk and that of personal experience. One woman has the tragic experience of being raped while walking home alone after dark. She forever after has the fear of walking alone in the dark. That\u2019s not irrational given her personal experience. Another woman who lives in a relatively safe environment refuses to leave her house even in the daytime, with company, because of what \u2018might\u2019 happen. That\u2019s an irrational fear because it\u2019s so much greater than the real risks involved and there is no reason to base it on. Rational thinking is the ability to consider the relevant variables of a situation and to access, organize, and analyze relevant information (e.g., facts, opinions, judgments, and data) to arrive at a sound conclusion.[1] Being rational simply means using reason and logic to respond to the reality around us. I assert that if God is an aspect of reality, then it would be irrational not to believe. So the question inevitably moves to our perception of reality and how we understand truth. This gets much more complicated. Truth is often defined as something in accord with facts\u2014then we dispute what constitutes fact\u2014so that doesn\u2019t really help much. Current theories of truth all imply certain metaphysical presuppositions and can actually embody those metaphysical positions. I say God is an aspect of reality because that is my belief\u2014my metaphysics\u2014and my perception of reality includes that. The materialist embraces physicalism\u2014the physical world is the only reality\u2014therefore anyone who believes in God is disconnected from the \u2018real\u2019 reality. Truth is thereafter defined by how consistently it corresponds with our definition of reality. But how do we know who\u2019s right? We can\u2019t. Truth is constrained by our limited abilities to verify it one way or the other. It is constrained by our all too human \u2018epistemic situation\u2019\u2014what we can and can\u2019t know and how. Certainty is not available to human beings. The best we can do is probability. The things we can\u2019t know define us at least as much as the things we do. All of that means something can be rational in that it has been reasoned through with logic and experience; it can be rooted in what someone believes to be true; and it can thereby be considered a \u2018rational truth\u2019\u2014yet still contain the possibility of being\u2014inevitably\u2014wrong. That\u2019s just as annoying as all get out isn\u2019t it? But rational truths don\u2019t have to be proven right to be rational truths. They just have to be consistent and coherent with the overall system of belief\u2014including its metaphysics. That means both liberals and conservatives have \u2018rational truths.\u2019 Aiyeee!!

            "answer_text": "In the 1970s, two psychologists proved, once and for all, that humans are not rational creatures. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky discovered \u201ccognitive biases,\u201d showing that that humans systematically make choices that defy clear logic. But what Kahneman and Tversky acknowledged, and is all too often overlooked, is that being irrational is a good thing. We humans don\u2019t always make decisions by carefully weighing up the facts, but we often make better decisions as a result. To fully explore this, it\u2019s important to define \u201crational,\u201d which is an unexpectedly slippery term. Hugo Mercier, a researcher at the Institut des Sciences Cognitives-Marc Jeannerod in France and the co-author of \u201cThe Enigma of Reason,\u201d says that he\u2019s never fully understood quite what \u201crational\u201d means. \u201cObviously rationality has to be defined according to how well you accomplish some goals. You can\u2019t be rational in a vacuum, it doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem is there\u2019s so much flexibility in defining what you want.\u201d So, for example, it\u2019s an ongoing philosophical debate about whether drug addicts are rational\u2014for in taking drugs they are, after all, maximizing their pleasure, even if they harm themselves in the process. Colloquially, \u201crational\u201d has several meanings. It can describe a thinking process based on an evaluation of objective facts (rather than superstition or powerful emotions); a decision that maximizes personal benefit; or simply a decision that\u2019s sensible. In this article, the first definition applies: Rational decisions are those grounded on solid statistics and objective facts, resulting in the same choices as would be computed by a logical robot. But they\u2019re not necessarily the most sensible. Trust your instincts Despite the growing reliance on \u201cbig data\u201d to game out every decision, it\u2019s clear to anyone with a glimmer of self-awareness that humans are incapable of constantly rational thought. We simply don\u2019t have the time or capacity to calculate the statistical probabilities and potential risks that come with every choice. But even if we were able to live life according to such detailed calculations, doing so would put us at a massive disadvantage. This is because we live in a world of deep uncertainty, in which neat logic simply isn\u2019t a good guide. It\u2019s well-established that data-based decisions doesn\u2019t inoculate against irrationality or prejudice, but even if it was possible to create a perfectly rational decision-making system based on all past experience, this wouldn\u2019t be a foolproof guide to the future. Unconvinced? There\u2019s an excellent real-world example of this: The financial crisis. Experts created sophisticated models and were confident that the events of the 2007 crisis were statistically impossible. Gerd Gigerenzer, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany, who studies decision-making in real world settings, says there is a major flaw in any system that attempts to be overly rational in our highly uncertain world. \u201cIf you fine-tune on the past with an optimization model, and the future is not like the past, then that can be a big failure, as illustrated in the last financial crisis,\u201d he explains. \u201cIn a world where you can calculate the risks, the rational way is to rely on statistics and probability theory. But in a world of uncertainty, not everything is known\u2014the future may be different from the past\u2014then statistics by itself cannot provide you with the best answer anymore.\u201d Henry Brighton, a cognitive science and artificial intelligence professor at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, who\u2019s also a researcher at the Max Planck Institute, adds that, in a real-world setting, most truly important decisions rely at least in part on subjective preferences. \u201cThe number of objective facts deserving of that term is extremely low and almost negligible in everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole idea of using logic to make decisions in the world is to me a fairly peculiar one, given that we live in a world of high uncertainty which is precisely the conditions in which logic is not the appropriate framework for thinking about decision-making.\u201d Let your gut guide you Instead of relying on complex statistics to make choices, humans tend to make decisions according to instinct. Often, these instincts rely on \u201cheuristics,\u201d or mental shortcuts, where we focus on one key factor to make a decision, rather than taking into account every tiny detail. However, these heuristics aren\u2019t simply time-savers. They can also be incredibly accurate at selecting the best option. Heuristics tune out the noise, which can mislead an overly-complicated analysis. This explains why simply dividing your money equally among assets can outperform even the most sophisticated portfolios. \u201cIn a world where all options and probabilities are known, a heuristic can only be faster but never more accurate,\u201d says Gigerenzer.
