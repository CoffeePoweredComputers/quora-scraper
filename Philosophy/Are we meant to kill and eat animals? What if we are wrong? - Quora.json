            "answer_text": "Whenever you use a word like \u2018meant,\u2019 it implies conscious thought is behind something. That something intentional is happening. In terms of the question you asked, that implies something religious - that you feel intelligent design is involved in our existence. The only person you can, therefore, ask this question of, is your deity. Or, I suppose, your priest, if you\u2019re not on speaking terms with that deity. Or consult your religious texts - many religious texts offer dietary guidelines, since it seems meddling in the minutiae of a person\u2019s daily life is something priests feel a deity should be into. Or whatever. Now, in terms of science, nothing is \u2018meant.\u2019 We evolved to be as we are because it allowed us to survive. The ones who survived best and longest had the most offspring, and so the traits they had were passed on. For our species, that means predatory omnivory is the norm. The savannahs, where our ancestors first evolved to be bipedal most likely, weren\u2019t rich in fruit. Edibles such as tubers, grass seeds, fruits, nuts, and insects were there to be had, but it would be a struggle to get enough calories that way. Preying on other animals is a much more efficient way to get total nutrition. When you combine it with the other stuff, you have a winning combination. That\u2019s why some of the most widespread species are omnivores. So, scientifically speaking, we DO kill and eat animals. And our bodies are well adapted for it. We possess the instincts to do it. The species we evolved from possessed those instincts, and had those adaptations as well. You have to go a long way back before you stop seeing evidence of predatory behavior in hominins. Even among the great apes, which branched off from our line a couple million years ago at least, our closest relatives (chimpanzees and bonobos) enjoy chowing down on monkeys, and make a regular tradition out of killing and eating other animals. Sometimes they use spears to get them, too. (We homonids evolved to use tools to help us acquire our food - right from the very beginning). We\u2019re so dedicated to carnivory that we lost the ability to make vitamin B-12 in our own gut. We need to have it in our diet, and B-12 only comes from animal foods (and a few yeasts/fungi - nothing reliably found by any hunter/gatherer). So, \u2018meant,\u2019 or not, Homo sapiens simply ARE predators; and only technology developed in the past hundred years or so allows us the conceit of trying to be anything else. ",

            "answer_text": "Everything I know, read, understand from my study (as a vegetarian) tells me that human beings are carnivores who must hunt, kill, butcher and eat animals. Are we \u201cmeant\u201d to do so? By nature, I would say - yes. My concern is not so much with the hunters who quickly subdue and dispatch their prey as with modern humans who use painful methods of hunting (spears, bow and arrow, poor marksmanship, traps) when they don\u2019t even need to hunt for food. It\u2019s easier, safer, quicker and much cheaper to go down to the Abertsons and buy a pork chop. The animals injured in these ways are tracked as they die slowly from their wounds. Or abandoned as too much trouble to go after. That isn\u2019t right. Not in my book. My concern extends to the greed of agricultural business people who breed, grow and maintain livestock in crowded, unnatural and often painful conditions until those animals are crowded into hideously hot/cold/waterless transports where dead and dying members of the herd are simply trampled by those still on their feet, until they reach their destination. There people with electric prods move them into the slaughter process - caring little whether the supposedly fatal coup de grace actually achieves its end or an animal is left groaning, drooling and trembling to be processed to the next step still alive and aware and suffering greatly. You don\u2019t need any further exposition - the horrors of the slaughterhouse grow more repulsive with added knowledge. But, humans are intended to consume meat. It isn\u2019t wrong in that sense. It\u2019s the treatment we give our livestock, based as it is on greed and indifference and the headiness of our physical power over them, that\u2019s wrong. ",

We not only have all the right teeth for eating meat, but our digestive tract is finely tuned for it. Without eating meat we never would've gained the intelligence we have. There was simply no other way to gain the calories required for such large brains in primates. Cows eat grass. They have specially tuned stomachs for it. They can extract energy from it, which the grass takes directly from the sun. Grass is billions of tons of energy, locked up in a form we cannot consume. But cows can. And they conveniently convert all that grass into meat, which we can consume. Not only can we consume it, but it is years worth of grazing on grass worth of energy packed into a small, convenient package, which we can extract that energy from very efficiently. Eating other animals is a way to gain energy that is otherwise unavailable. It is the basic strategy that all carnivores and omnivores use to live. And we are one of those omnivores. ",

            "answer_text": "This question seems to be pre-loaded with a little bias, considering that in order to eat an animal, it kind of presumes we would kill it first. In any case, the only real reasons to not eat meat would be because of ethical, religious or taste considerations, otherwise it is okay to do so. Unlike ruminants which are able to digest and utilize, with a high degree of efficacy, energy derived solely from plant sources, humans are largely unable to do so. We can convert some fibre into SCFA, but nowhere near to the degree that other animals can. Obviously we are quite distinct to these kinds of animals, but it\u2019s worth noting anyway. In the case of a Gorilla, in particular a western low land Gorilla which has a largely vegetarian diet. These Gorillas consume a lot of plant matter, however their colons enable them to convert a large portion of that to SCFA, which we as humans are incapable of doing. In fact, if we were to mimic the diet of this particular gorilla, our diet would be largely carbohydrate/ fibre based whereas the gorilla would actually enjoy a reasonably high fat intake due to gut fermentation. Now humans can enjoy a high fat vegetarian diet now largely thanks to availability of nut and seed imports, however before the day that people could do this, this sort of diet would have been hard to maintain. You ate what you could, and thanks to hunting, we were able to obtain high density fuels without having to rely on plant matter which would yield very little Calorie value. So by and large, yes, we are designed to eat meat as one component of our diet. Is it required now? No. But are we able to do so? Absolutely. Whether or not we should is for you to decide. ",
