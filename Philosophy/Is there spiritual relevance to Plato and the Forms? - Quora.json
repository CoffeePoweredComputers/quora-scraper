            "answer_text": "In my reading, Plato\u2019s theory of the Ideal Forms is itself spiritual. To begin, I note that the German word for Mind (Geist) also means Spirit. Plato placed Ideas (Ideals) at the highest point in the Cosmos. Ideas are Invisible, but they control the world. This was his teaching. The most powerful Ideas in human society are the Ideas of Ethics. These Ideas include Virtue, Honesty, Courage, Moderation, the Good, the Right, the Beautiful, Honor and Justice. All of these Virtues are Invisible Ideals. This was one of the abiding themes of the dialogues of Socrates. He would ask an intelligent person, \u201cDo you know what Virtue is?\u201d The person would answer, \u201cOf course I do!\u201d Socrates would ask, \u201cWould you please define it for me?\u201d As readers of Plato know, the persons were able to describe individual instances of Virtue \u2014 but it was different for the wealthy compared with the middle-class. It was different for men compared with women. It varied depending on age. There were many variables \u2014 many kinds of Virtue. But nobody could nail it down succinctly. We can see examples of Ideas \u2014 but not the Ideas themselves. The Ideas exist in an Eternal Dimension which will outlast the Material Universe itself. All Divine beings exist in this Eternal Dimension. To call this Eternal Dimension \u201cheaven\u201d is not a stretch. To call the Mind the Spirit itself is only a stretch for those who insist on defining the Mind as animal reflexes of the material nervous system. Most modern folks seem to have lost touch with Plato\u2019s Realm of Ideals. ",
