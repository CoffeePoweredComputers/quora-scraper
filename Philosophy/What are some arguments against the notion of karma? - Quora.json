            "answer_text": "Karma is a nice idea, it seems like something that people want to believe. You do bad things, it comes back to you somehow. You live a difficult life and do good things, eventually you will be rewarded. Its simple and I wish it was true. I don't like the idea, not because of bad things I've done though. I don't like it because it gives people a way to disregard reality. It allows people to ignore suffering and not do anything about it because it was somehow deserved. How can it explain a boy right now in somalia who is going to die in a few minutes from malnutrition? This boy is a good kid, he has done nothing to deserve his fate, all he wanted in life was to make his mother proud of him, he has never hurt anyone or caused anyone pain in any way, but that will change before you finish reading this answer, he will cause his mother more pain than you can understand when she finds his limp, lifeless body in a dusty corner of his shelter. How can karma account for this boy? He was a good child who did nothing to deserve this. He is dead now for no reason other than the crime of being born into his situation. He did nothing to be punished for. You have to fall back on reincernation to exlain it. He must have been an evil man in a past life. How can you punish an innocent boy for the crimes that were commited by another person? How can you make that kind of leap of logic? We want to believe in karma, it feels right. We think that is how the world has to work. The idea makes us think that somehow our struggles will one day be worth it. Then we see a good person suffer and die and we see an evil man die after living a life of pleasure at the expence of others. We see both and instead of rejecting karma as a bullshit idea, we say the evil man will be reincarnated as the boy who suffers. We make excuses and we explain away the obvious proof that the idea is wrong because we don't want it to be wrong. We are willing to believe anything that would make it true. No one wants to believe that the world around us doesn't care about what we do, good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people. It rains on both of them. An evil man and a bad man share the same end, and the only thing they will agree about is that life was too short. Reject the idea instead of making excuses for its failure. The best counter I can think of is the book of ecclesiastises. (The book in the bible that can be used to counter any religious concept, even the rest of the bible. Why its there I will never understand) It basically says \"things happen for no reason and there's nothing you can do about it\" ",

            "answer_text": "I don't have a philosophical argument but have always preferred a practical argument against it: The concept of karma is ultimately a theory about causality, but it actually lacks true predictive utility. Meaning, that it\u2019s not terribly useful. Without predictive utility the core concept is ultimately a trivial truism: Everyone does some good things and bad thingsUnforeseen good things and bad things will happen to everyoneHow can I know exactly what will happen and when, if I do thing X? Imagine a person who is thinking about committing a crime. Being a rational and observing person she may observe that many unpredictable bad things will befall her from this moment until she dies, whether she commits the crime or not. Committing the crime does add to predictably higher chance of bad things happening. This in no way requires a supernatural explanation like karma. However, it is absolutely true that unforeseen bad things will still happen until the day she dies even if she refrains from committing the crime. There would be no way to know what difference the decision would have made, supernaturally speaking. Therefore, if the predictable bad consequences from committing the crime can be confidently avoided (such as never getting caught), there is no incentive to *not* commit it. Karma would be so much more meaningful if it actually offers a true predictive utility, allowing people to perform accounting to decide what consequences they are comfortable accepting, and what they are not, by showing exactly how and when a retribution will be exacted. Of course, if it worked that way, the entire mechanism would almost certainly be categorized under science/technology, so the point is moot. ",
