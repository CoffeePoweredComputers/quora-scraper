            "answer_text": "I think what you\u2019re trying to say is \u201cWhat are some examples of something that is \u2018evil\u2019 but \u2018right\u2019 when it comes to the law.\u201d Ironically though, I think you\u2019re talking about something that is \u201cgood\u201d but \u201cwrong.\u201d The thing about people is that they tend to associate doing what\u2019s \u201cright\u201d the same as doing what\u2019s \u201cgood.\u201d Truth is, good and right isn\u2019t always the same thing. The same goes with wrong and evil. Sometimes, a person can be absolutely right but still be evil. And a person can be absolutely good and still be wrong. The thing about right and wrong is that it has a lot to do with equality and balance. What is given must be return. What is taken must be taken back. An eye for an eye. Good and evil, on the other hand, has a lot to do with gain and sacrifice. People who are good are those who are selfless. People who are bad are those who are selfish. Given that logic, it wouldn\u2019t be surprise for someone to be completely right and evil or to be completely good and wrong at the same time. To further explain my logic, I\u2019ll give an example: You and your partner went on a date at a restaurant. While there, you each order your own respective meal and you each had your own respective meal. When it comes time to pay, you can either choose to pay for your meal, choose to pay for both meals. (Right) The right thing for you to do is to pay for your meal and only your meal. Why? Because you\u2019re not the one to order your partner\u2019s meal nor did you get to eat it. Therefore, it is only fair that you don\u2019t pay for it because you didn\u2019t benefit for it. Where as you\u2019re the one to order your meal and you ate it. Since you\u2019re the who gain from that meal, naturally, you should be the one to pay it. (Good) The good thing for you to do is to pay for both meals. Why? Because you\u2019re paying the meal for your partner. You\u2019re selflessly sacrificing something of yours and giving it to your partner without asking anything in return. That is why when people do something for others, it is consider as a gesture of good will. Back to the Topic Now, the thing about the law is that it has very little to do with morality or ethics. Moral and Ethics are merely tools use to serve the law and not what the law is base on. The law is there to ensure safety and peace, not to bring about justice or to condemn evil. It\u2019s there to protect people, namely, to protect people from themselves. If you look at it this way, it is completely understandable why there are laws that goes against moral and ethics alike. For example: Abortion There is nothing that is really right or good about abortion at all. You\u2019re taking someone\u2019s future away from them despite not having a right to do so. Even if you\u2019re a rape victim, the person who hurt you isn\u2019t the unborn child but the culprit. So there is no right for you to punish the unborn child. As for doing what is good, honestly, people who gets abortion just don\u2019t want to bear the burden of taking care of a child. Meaning that they do it for selfish reason and thus is evil. But in terms of the law, it would make sense as to why people are permitted to get abortion. First of all, the unborn child is not consider a living human being, thus, does not falls under the protection of the law. And having a child can change one\u2019s life for the worst drastically, namely, it can ruin their entire future. So for the safety of the person\u2019s future, Abortion is permitted. The same goes with Gun Restrictions: There is nothing right or good about restricting people\u2019s guns. There are millions of people out there who hunts or/and collect guns as a hobby, and they\u2019ve never committed a crime in their life. Yet, because of evil people, they have their rights taken away from them despite not doing anything wrong at all. Guns don\u2019t kill people. People kill people. But in terms of the law, it makes perfect sense as to why people shouldn\u2019t have guns. Though most people won\u2019t use gun to commit crime, there are those out there who will. To ensure the safety of people, restricting gun is a perfect means. ",

            "answer_text": "Is there anything legal but immoral? Yes, of course there is. For there is more than one kind of morality. What is morality? Morality is any concern in right and wrong, to tell between in order to further right or oppose wrong. Also called \u201cmorals.\u201d Ethics is a subset of morality. Ethics is a code of right conduct voluntarily adopted by those of like mind (i.e. philosophical ethics) or like purpose (i.e. professional ethics). Note: \u201cethics\u201d also shares a synonymous sense with \u201cmorals,\u201d in which \u201cethics\u201d means no more than \u201cmorals,\u201d and the two can be used interchangeably. I call this the \u201cuseless, redundant\u201d sense of ethics: no more objective, no less arguable than morals. Might as well just say morals at that point. Where you specify a code of ethics, though, ethics has clear advantages is specificity and application. You know what\u2019s covered and required (it\u2019s in the code). You know who is bound (voluntary subscribers to the code). Useful. Law, in the form of the criminal code, is a subset of morals: a code of right conduct considered involuntary of application. It contains the complete list of judgeable, punishable acts: acts held sufficiently wrong that the people themselves say: \u201cThis must be prohibited. We will even hire help to prevent these acts, catch and punish the doers. We ourselves will be liable to punishment if we do this.\u201d So. That gets the foundational stuff out of the way. Is there anything legal but immoral? Looking back up at the top, you can conceive how broad morality is. Any concern in right and wrong etc.? Yes. You can imagine how many different standards are out there, respecting the nearly infinite array of all different acts human behavior can attempt or commit. Often with finely-drawn shades and conditions for how each can be done rightly, or which cannot be done at all. These systems often share overlaps in common, yet each has expanses the others don\u2019t cover, and within their overlaps, complexities of quirk and difference. Whereas in a given land, there is only the one law. Oh, you find yourself liable to municipal, provincial and national codes of law where you stand, but it reduces to one list of prohibited acts - and probably no more than one or two police forces to watch for in a given location. Of course morality covers more than this bare skeletal sketch. Law only covers acts whose harm is detectable to all or at the very least most, and sufficiently considerable in scope that the people in general support or even demand that act\u2019s prohibition. Personal morality, including religious or other morality, goes much farther. A religious or personal prohibition does not need to lay itself before the people and justify its prohibition. The high priest (or whoever) can simply pass the buck up to God (or whoever): \u201cGod says. That\u2019s why it\u2019s wrong.\u201d Or the individual can simply own it: \u201cI say I cannot do this. I say it\u2019s wrong.\u201d People take such stands all the time on moral grounds, in areas where the law cannot reach with dignity or excuse to touch. Risibly, some even presume to pronounce judgment and condemnation upon others for violating a moral standard of their own, to which the other has not subscribed. As if they are the judge of humanity! Pah! That about covers it. Oh, examples you say? COME ON. EASY. Many will feel it is immoral to lie to their friend. Even though it is not illegal.Many will feel it is immoral to incrementally destroy their bodies with greater and greater abuse of intoxicants, even where they take care not to drink and drive or similar dangerous negligence.Many will feel it is immoral to first, vow to someone permanent sexual exclusivity, and then later, go back on that vow using sex with some other person. I suppose this technically falls under \u201clie to their friend.\u201dMany will feel it is immoral to parade bare-ass stark full nude in a dangle-flop-bounce proud strut, displaying their innocently raunch n\u2019 haunch act to the pop-eyed public crowd, even if in that specific place (such as Pacific Avenue in downtown Santa Cruz, California) it is not illegal.Many will feel it is immoral to visit a prostitute, even in places where this is legal. Wait. Not \u201cvisit.\u201d I mean have sex with, in exchange for pay. What if you don\u2019t have sex? What if the prostitute\u2019s your mom and you\u2019re just visiting her? Just visiting would probably be fine, although some would shun even that due to the associations and potential scandal.Many will feel it is immoral to dishonor their parents. Even though, come on. There are as many legal ways to do this as there are to dishonor strangers, probably.Many will feel it is immoral to break any of a whole host of rules, commit acts not illegal, but which they have deeply embraced as conditions of a moral life. Even such things as cultural norms and social mores are often raised to a moral pitch. Well, social \u201cmores.\u201d Tipoff, there.It goes on and on. Huge expanse of morality not covered by law. But here\u2019s the catch: morality is of voluntary embrace and application. We are free to find and adapt whatever moral code, creed, system or approach suits us. It is only in law that we find code of right conduct, prohibition of wrong acts - morality, in short - which we have hired people to apply to us, if we fail to keep it. Funny humans. I love us. It\u2019s really a pretty shrewd move on humanity\u2019s part! What law prohibits - I don\u2019t know about you, but every crime I hear about strikes me as something I\u2019d never want to do with my head on straight, barring dire straits. So law impedes my freedom not one jot or tittle! And we are far freer with law than without. Free to devote resources, attention and energy to self-expression, chosen pursuits and commingling union with others, which would otherwise have had to be devoted to concealment, fortification, defense and subsistence. That\u2019s a good trade, law. But in terms of moral prohibition, law only really covers acts whose wrong is considerable enough for all to see prohibition\u2019s necessity. And typically, acts the prohibition of which nobody much minds. A bare and skeletal sketch of morality, as I said - but where would we be without dem bones? ",
