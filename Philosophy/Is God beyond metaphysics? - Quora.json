            "answer_text": "Is God beyond metaphysics? +JMJ+ Yes and no. Yes, in that God is so far beyond anything we can imagine there is no way our limited human intelligences can even begin to comprehend Him, much less describe Him using language. No, in that Metaphysics encompasses the First Principles, and the Fourth Lateran Council (A.D. 1213\u20131215) tells us that God IS the First Principle from which everything depends. from Modern Catholic Dictionary by John A. Hardon, S.J. Doubleday & Co., Inc. Garden City, NY 1980 Metaphysics. The science of being, as being; or of the absolutely first principles of being. Also called ontology, first philosophy, the philosophy of being, the philosophy of first causes, wisdom. (Etym. Greek meta, after, beyond + physika, physics.) ",

            "answer_text": "G-d is not limited in any way. To ascribe any description to G-d is to limit G-d. We can\u2019t define G-d to being a spiritual or physical existence as both are limits on their own rights. Spiritual is not physical and therefore a limiting constraint. So too, the physical is limiting. In the same way that G-d is beyond boundaries, G-d is within boundaries. All things in existence, all rules, time, space are from G-d. G-d exists now the same way as He existed before the creation, without any change. G-d is equally beyond and within metaphysics simultaneously. ",
