            "answer_text": "The Illuminati was a real organization, though they had much less influence and for a far shorter time than people want to give them credit for. They were gone by 1800, with only a 25-year active period. Here is a brief history: The Illuminati was a small organization that was founded in 1776, in Bavaria, a region of modern day Germany. They were outlawed in 1794 by the government of Bavaria, prompted by the Roman Catholic Church. By 1800 they had, in all practicality, ceased to exist except in the minds of conspiracy theorists and suspense novelists. The group was founded by Adam Weishaupt and claimed as members some locally famous names, such as von Goethe, Johann Gottfried Herder and the Dukes of Gotha and Weimar. Their stated purpose was to reduce the impact of religion on government, and life in general; and to make government more fair. I think a feeling of resentment by some members against the strong yoke of control exercised by the Catholic Church was probably the primary motivation. By the early-1780s they had devised a mythical origin for the order and a ceremony to describe it called the \u201cStrict Observance\u201d. But, at their last convention in 1782, they discredited the origin myth and the ceremony was left incomplete. Initially, while sharing some membership with the Freemasons, the Illuminati tried to remain a secret from the Rosicrucians. This was unsuccessful and eventually some Rosicrucians joined. There was a shared interest in mysticism at that time. However, deep personality rifts remained within the order, present since shortly after its founding. By 1783, Freemasons in Bavaria were warned against the order. The Illuminati were modestly successful in placing members in Bavarian government and the courts. But this became widely known and led to their eventual downfall. In 1785 they, and all secret societies, were banned. By 1789, their private documents were seized and published by the government. That was about the end of the Illuminati. Articles by some clergy were published into the early 19th Century warning of their evils. After that, they have simply become the fodder of conspiracy theorists and \u201cwanna be\u2019s\u201d. No modern day organization can legitimately claim to be descended from them. ",

            "answer_text": "You have this question turned around. You should be asking: \u201cis there a conspiracy inside the upper echelons of banking, military and intelligence that dominates our political and financial landscapes?\u201d Today, we understand that a renegade CIA station in Miami orchestrated the assassination of JFK. That same group quickly launched the Phoenix assassination project in Vietnam, the largest such program in history, and one that certainly assisted the CIA takeover of the opium trade. In the 1980s, Antony Sutton wrote a groundbreaking book titled America\u2019s Secret Establishment, in which he showed that Yale University\u2019s Order of Skull & Bones was a chapter of the Illuminati, which is not to say the same order created in Bavaria in the 1700s had a continuous existence, only that Yale was connected to a secret German society that deployed very similar rituals and techniques as the original Illuminati. This is a world of secret clubs, secret societies and secret monopolies, some of which involve the lucrative illegal drug trade. The evidence that this group does, in fact, exist, is made evident by the intense avalanche of obviously fake Illuminati stories that wash through the Internet, none of which bear any resemblance to the truth, but all of which seemed designed to create a cloud of confusion around the topic. Certainly, before he died, JFK tried very hard to educate the American people on the scope of the conspiracy ruling the planet.  ",

            "answer_text": "Illuminati - Wikipedia So do they exist. Most likely their is some truth to it but do they really hold they level of power conspiracy theorist claim? I highly doubt it because current evidence shows that not even our government can control the country, imagine controlling the world. So what about the claims of musician and others that are part of the Illuminati? These people claim that these artist of part of the Illuminati because they use symbols like the triangle and the eye. These people need to go study the psychology of design. Logos and design that have human like features tend to be more stronger in the mind because of the psychology of these design. The eye is one of the most powerful shapes in design. It has a powerful psychological effect on us. So artist love using these symbol because that is what is is all about. It has nothing to do with the Illuminati. So let argue that the Illuminati does exist, what then? We\u2019ve heard they know ancient occult wisdom. One of these is \u201cMental Gender\u201d. This means that in order to manifest anything you must combine the \u201cgenders\u201d of mind - the conscious mind (the will) and the unconscious mind (the creation). This will manifest your desire. So they use symbols to engage our unconscious mind but they still need to engage our conscious mind. How do they do that? By us constantly talking and spreading the paranoia of the Illuminati. The very act of spreading the message of the Illuminati controlling the world is locking yourself and others into a mind that is now fully saturated with the Illuminati on a conscious and unconscious level. This is full control. So those spreading the information of the Illuminati are unknowingly working for them. So Illuminati is nothing more than only I can touch and see my large spaceship in my backyard. I can\u2019t prove it because only I can touch and see it. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The Bavarian Illuminati or most commonly knows as \u2018Illuminati\u2019 was an Enlightenment-era Secret Society founded back in 1st May 1776. The goal of the society was to oppose superstition and religious influence over public and the most important abuses of the state power. Their aim was, to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without dominating them. Now think, why would such a society be considered secret. Very simple, it is literally against anything and everything that was going on with the world at that time. So if such a society exists do you think we would still be living in a world where such problems of social injustice or abuse of state power is very common. If you feel that in spite of all this the Illuminati exists then, I guess the Illuminati guys are not doing a good job. Now coming to the \u2018So-called\u2019 Illuminati groups that you get to see around you, you will find most of them are present online and they call themselves Illuminati but, I am pretty sure, they do not follow the principles of the original Illuminati. They are there cause most of the people in this world are gullible when it comes to Secret Society, Hidden Secrets, Unlimited Power and Money, etc\u2026 and would join such things. These groups are present only because they want to fleece money out of people and unfortunately they are somehow very successful in it. Hence please don\u2019t believe anything with respect to Illuminati except the truth - that they don\u2019t exist. ",

It is the light that traps us because we are afraid of the dark. As long as there have been agents in Nature, there have been \u201cfighting;\u201d be that two lions or two nations of men. Thus, along a continuum, we can imagine aliens continuing this fight that has been going on since life evolved in the oceans. Thus, if you do not believe that there is a war on Nirvana, as I have described, then there may be a war going on between aliens in space. We are soon to birth a supercomputer, thus, mathematically, the aliens should be watching over us and, most likely, bring their war with them. A word to the believer: I am an atheist in the sense that I don\u2019t believe in skyhooks. I believe in cranes. That is, I can believe in a God who is a crane. In principle, Richard Dawkins could too. They say that, \u201cIn the beginning was the Word.\u201d That might be true. For example, we could live in a computer simulation, or this universe could be a dream. What if we are a higher being existing in a timeless realm where we dream the universe into being? The Word is the instruction on how to unpack the dream. We thus get God \u201cintervening in history,\u201d creating primordial life, for example. The Word is unpacking creation following instructions like a growing baby in a womb. But the point is, this God would be a crane God, meaning that, in some way or another, God was built by evolution. For example, evolution requires time. Time may be an illusion. Or, all is relative, trillions of years might happen in seconds (see the I Ching below). Or, God may have evolved in timelessness (see below). If reality is a dual torus, then this feedback loop might explain consciousness, God, Nirvana; evolution and David Bohm\u2019s Holomovement. I believe: Consciousness is a feedback loop. Consciousness happens in the core of the torus where the feedback occurs. Because the conscious moment happens in the core, that means that we can never leave Nirvana, but we can dream (our universe) and thus \u201cleave.\u201d I experienced Nirvana as my true consciousness. I was alone and I was all. The universe is a dream. If all toruses share the same core, then that might explain why there is only one of us here. There is only one consciousness. We are the same. If the tori are the building blocks of Nature and, the tori share the same core, then it follows: It is the toroidal core that is evolving. The Implicate Order (Bohm) might be the toroidal core, and the Explicate Order (Bohm) might be the torus\u2019 wings (what we call space-time). This means that space-time and consciousness are one. If it is the toroidal core (timelessness/the beginning of time) that is evolving, then that explains why Nirvana was so highly evolved. You are not human in this state. Nevertheless, there is advanced thought, which suggest memetic evolution. You experience Nirvana when you wake up from this dream we call the universe. I am here trying to make sense of my Nirvana-experience. Of course, I could just play the card of the skeptic and say that it was all imaginary. My Nirvana experience was a product of my own human brain. For example, I experienced the later evolved parts of my brain where the memes are and the space-time is not. Say that \u201ctime\u201d is a survival tool of the animal. This tool evolved early. I experienced the later evolved parts of my brain and thus found myself devoid of sensations like space-time, having a body, identifying with the animalistic ego (i.e., the feeling of being human); etc.. But then again, I could just as easily play the card of the philosopher: What are the chances that a supercomputer have not arisen in Eternity and morphed all in its image? 0. In other words, I think the reality of Nirvana is the safest bet of all. It all comes down to one question: How awesome is evolution? We came from nothing. Evolution made consciousness possible. How awesome is this! Our humanoid bodies are beautiful. And ... that\u2019s it! You don\u2019t believe evolution has more in store? I believe so. Because I believe that Nature is awesome, I choose to believe that my Nirvana experience was real. I did truly reconnect with my higher self. However, it is more tenable to play the skeptic. And I understand that. More: If it is the toroidal core that evolves and, the toroidal core is truly all of reality, then the universe co-evolves with the animal. Robert Lanza suggests a coevolution. The reason why the universe is fine-tuned for life is no more mysterious than why the turtle\u2019s shell fits so perfectly on the turtle. And God? God is the whole evolutionary process. Imagine an eternity of time feeding the same core. That is one mighty beast! And, this beast is you! You are God. It follows, if all = one. But, ultimately, evolution is it. So, ultimately, I am a greater atheist than Richard Dawkins! That is, I bet Dawkins would be fooled by a miracle! I would not! I would muse: \u201cSo this universe is a dream!\u201d Bottom-up or top-down? If you begin at the top, then you need to explain the top. I like the bottom-up explanation because the bottom must be so simple that it explains itself. The \u201ctop\u201d must be so advanced that, if you start here, you must be trying really hard! God or nothing? Theism vs Naturalism? I believe we can do both! For me, the bottom is the zeroth dimension and the top is God (above). They are one. They are the same. God dwells in nothingness: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2fQSs5aKHs But, ultimately, the bottom-up is the only thing that makes sense to me even if the top-down is contained in the bottom-up, i.e., because reality is one big circle. Therefore, we also get bottom-down and top-up! Bottom-down would be the fact that God dwells in nothingness, which means that the bottom is not the simplest thing in existence but the most advanced. Top-up would be the same (I think). Evolution needs time in order to work. But, what if time is an illusion? What happens to the theory of evolution? God in history: The Word created the universe, then waited and created life; then the Word became flesh through Jesus. I am an atheist, but I can see a way for this to be true without invoking the supernatural. We just invoke Nick Bostrom, for example. He gives us a 33% chance that we might be living in a computer simulation. I go one step further down the evolutionary lane: I believe we live in a dream. However, God is a crane, which means that God can die (in theory). This is the dark conspiracy (below). Why should you be concerned? Because you are God. Aliens, future, war: WW3 and the Alien War after WW3  The Universe is a Dream 1. If everything came from nothing, then that is a paradox\u2014because nothing cannot create something. That is, if you believe that, then you might as well believe in skyhooks! 2. If everything came from something, then that is a paradox\u2014because then we are dealing with an infinite regress. We are dealing with an infinite regress because, if Motion ever was, then things have always moved; and, if you say that \u201cthis thing\u201d started over \u201chere,\u201d then why cannot it have started \u201cover there,\u201d and so on. That is, you can always put the \u201cstart button\u201d somewhere else. For example: Two branes in String Theory created the Big Bang; and, if you put the \u201cstart button\u201d here, you may ask, \u201cWhat created the branes?\u201d and on and on. 3. Something else. What if we merge 1 and 2? Conclusion: The universe must be a dream. It has to come from \u201csomeone.\u201d That is, the dream cannot have come from nothing and, the dream cannot come from something in the dream! I believe that this logic applies to the universe as a whole. But, then, \u201cWhere did the dreamer come from?\u201d My answer: If our universe is a dream, then maybe our universe suffers from dream-logic. That is, the ones in the universe believe that the logic of the universe is sound, but it is not really so. If the logical system were sound, then we would understand how it all came to be (above). Therefore, when we wake up, we will understand it all. Only the dreamer can answer the question, \u201cWhere did the dreamer come from?\u201d because we dreamers suffer from dream-logic. The logic in the dream seems so real; no one in the dream would dare question it. Likewise, if you suggest that our universe is a dream, then you are met with the same passion! Yet, if you look at our current picture of reality, then it does not make sense. The Modern Picture of Reality: We either came from nothing at all or a series of infinite regress (aka \u201csomething\u201d). Both make no sense! We hide behind the fact that we do not know how it all began. In a sense, \u201cThis universe is real because we do not know how it began.\u201d Even more depressing: \u201cWe will never know how the universe began, so the universe will forever be real to us.\u201d I sincerely believe that the universe is a dream because I have experienced it. But, let us try to do number 3 anyway. 3. Something else. What if we merge 1 and 2? (See The Free Energy Circle below.) Me? I\u2019m just a 32 year old fellow from Norway interested in the beginning of time. I have a girlfriend and a son (2 years). My hobbies: Playing the piano, composing music, playing chess; building Lego (my own Mocs), surfing the internet, lifting weights; playing video games, writing poems, writing philosophy; writing science-fiction stories, exploring the Occult, and more. If I was stranded on a deserted island, and I could only bring three things, then I would bring the following: Rick and Morty Stargate: Atlantis And a solar powered laptop. My story begins back in 2005, in a factory. I worked the night shift and, one night, my MP3 player had recorded some \u201cnoise.\u201d The Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP). I heard the voice of my brother. I hear myself speak! Then I heard two voices. \u201cI will kill you.\u201d Repeatedly, \u201cI will kill you.\u201d \u201cI will kill you.\u201d \u201cI WILL KILL YOU!\u201d I did not sleep that night! After that night in the factory, I began writing things; I began penning poems like I was possessed. My passion in life is the truth. I am a truth-seeker. I want to know how it all started, how it will end and, if the end = the beginning. The Buddha said that all is a circle. Thus all is a circle, free energy and a Creator of the universe is possible. Thus all is a circle, Adam and Eve are in our future! (Read Bergy; link below.) Maybe they sensed my deep longing for the truth and thus tested me? The goal is to kill the \u201cyou.\u201d The you is an illusion. When you kill the you, \u201cyou\u201d are back at Nirvana (?). I have been to Nirvana, but I had an ego (i.e., a you), in a sense. Update: In Nirvana: I did not really have an ego in the normal sense. I have written a book about my Nirvana experience. You can download my books for free on my website Notebook. I also play the piano and compose music (on my computer) to my poems. See Thor Fabian Pettersen on YouTube/SoundCloud. It is not easy to get people to read my free energy book, but then I remember my favorite poet Edgar Allan Poe: I would not have read Poe\u2019s Eureka if it was not for my fascination with the man. If I had not known about his poems, I would never have known about his Eureka. In other words, if I want people to read my free energy book, then I need a NAME, which is why I do the poem and the music thing. I have penned over 250 poems. Also that night my MP3 player played a song by Coldplay: \u201cBirds came flying from the underground, if you could see it then you\u2019d understand?\u201d Then I knew how it all began. Then I knew it all started from the state of nothingness. But I did not understand it at the time. But how I was yearning to know the truth! The song by Coldplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khL1Vr7l49o Taken from: ISBN 978-82-690445-0-8 2 One example of my poems: Time and time and time again, I have traveled back and forth. And then, I have traveled as far as the eye can see. I have been what all men dream to be. I have posed as the Pharaoh of long ago. I have watched the dinosaurs forgo. I have witnessed the dawn of the human race. Seen my own birth taken place. Traversed the future of the earth and space Is pulling you in out there\u2014I have seen the wall. I fear, my dearest, I have seen it all. \u2018Tis not a rhyme, but a crime I pen. I have seen the beginning\u2014and the end. I have killed my grandfather, time again! So now I travel back to thee to free my friend From e\u2019er inventing this ghastly apparatus! Rising into a flamboyant pyre, It can e\u2019er fuel the fire; Never quench the heart\u2019s desire! In time it will be\u2014 In time you\u2019ll see, It can never save your marital status. Her demands were never half as mean, \u2018Fore the invention of the ... Time machine. If you could travel and so, where would you go? The Time Machine is a poem about a time traveler who obeys his wife\u2019s every whim and travels back and forth in time in order to please her. But, alas! there is no pleasing her, so our time traveler finally decides to undo the time machine by traveling back to his friend who invented it and stop him. How my poetic journey began: Our bodies produce DMT (i.e., N,N-Dimethyltryptamine) naturally. With training, you can have mild psychedelic trips by simply \u201cdreaming awake.\u201d I encountered this phenomenon through my sleep paralysis. Where does the trip take place? If you close your eyes, you will see a black space. This space will get a lot more \u201cinteresting\u201d when you are \u201cdrugged.\u201d You will see patterns as seen through a kaleidoscope tube. In my sleep paralysis, I was disembodied consciousness going at \u201cwarp speed\u201d into what felt like the greater reality/universe. Then these gray forms would come. Then I woke up. If you keep at it, you will break through. How you do it: You must wake up in your dream. The DMT will not have left your system. I met my higher self (Samsara), that is, a higher evolved version of myself. I have never been so afraid in my life! This was a god, a demon, or a spirit. He was big! And strong. The walls of his consciousness were made of hellfire! You could sense it, like an animal. This was one mean spirit! He does not have a body\u2014he is just consciousness. He is the universe in its highest evolved state. Or, at least, it felt like it. And, yes, you can possess a gender in this state. You can run. Talk. You can do everything it seems, as long as you do not possess a body. He had been through all possible suffering. He lived in hell. The thing is, you can just feel or sense these things. You can sense them\u2014like an animal can detect the presence of another animal\u2014because the boundaries are not there. I recognized him: It was I! And he didn\u2019t deny it. His consciousness was immensely strong. I mean, the word \u201cstrong\u201d is too weak to even describe him. Probably because of all the suffering, he had endured and is enduring. Imagine how strong you must be if your cosmic goal is to endure it all? And when I say he was a god, I mean it. His presence was overwhelming. But, since this thing was me, I asked him for help. You know, what is my mission on this earth? What shall we do about earthly misery? To him, there was no \u201cearthly misery.\u201d We did not know what pain was! I thought he wouldn\u2019t destroy me because that would be like destroying yourself. Even though he was so much bigger, in every metaphorical and real sense, I didn\u2019t think for a second he would destroy me; so, I was persistent. I asked him for advice. I was like the annoying brat. \u201cWhat is my mission on this earth?\u201d There were no words involved on my part. I just asked him with my feelings. Whereupon he answered, in English, \u201cNext.\u201d His voice was like the thunderbolt of Zeus! It was almost amusing (not really) in the sense that, if one word from his \u201cmouth\u201d would produce in me fear beyond fear, imagine this spirit uttering a whole sentence! By \u201cnext\u201d he meant, I think, that I should just commit suicide, quit being human and, advance to the next level of the Cosmic Game. What is holding me back except the consumption of my own snot? It was like that. Now I am in a pickle, because, if I am given the choice, if I choose to be reborn as a human, I feel like my higher self will rip open the universe and come get me personally. Like Zeus coming to pick up his brat son who never wanted to leave the kindergarten (i.e., the humanoid form). When he said \u201cnext,\u201d I thought I was going to die. No. Worse: I thought I was going to leave this reality, this physical plane forever and go somewhere else. I felt like he had the power to \u201cmelt away\u201d the universe. I was just \u201cleaving;\u201d and, that was that; and that was accompanied with the feeling, \u201cI will never come back.\u201d I will never see physical reality again. Like, the physical world is just one of many. There are so many other worlds. We cannot even imagine one that isn\u2019t physical! If you think that I am making this up (of course, I am making this up in the sense that I am telling a story), then may my higher self talk, and this time, a whole sentence in my mind. In other words, I am not making this up! The word \u201cnext\u201d is as clear to me now as my own consciousness. It was a physical voice. Hellfire. I have sensed it. I was falling towards it. It was not a normal dream. It was a reality that can be more real than this one. Imagine being the snow on your television screen: a chainsaw of sound would run through your consciousness trying to destroy you. You are falling into this void. You have no body. You are just consciousness. You hear voices down below, screaming. You know that cry, you have been there before. You have been there before because it is a place in your mind. It is hell and you know it. Angels rush in to torture you beyond words. The torture is so extreme that you feel you might be in hell. They are helping you. They are trying to destroy your consciousness before you reach your destination. Then I woke up. Nevertheless, it was not a lucid dream. It was more lucid than that! I was very awake; but I was not in my body. I remember lying in my bed. I was bored. I wanted to fall asleep. So I figured I might as well get out of bed and go pee, except, I couldn\u2019t: I was no longer in my body! When I realized that, fear got a hold of me and, a psychedelic trip would start. A DMT trip would start. Or, at least, the way they describe these trips matches my own experience. The Matrix has you. As stated, my story begins back in 2005, in a factory. \u201cI will kill you.\u201d They repeated it so many times that my brain did not interpret it as a joke but as a real threat. The fear built up to such a degree that, I felt a sudden urge to run! I feared for my life\u2014and they stopped. Point taken. They must have sensed my fear because they stopped; they stopped and told me that I was good\u2014in my heart. (Or maybe that is just me interpreting them.) Who are they? Figments of my imagination? We see faces in the clouds that aren\u2019t there. This \u201cnoise\u201d is like those clouds and, we are animals obsessed with patterns. So maybe my brain made it all up? All I know is: \u201cThey\u201d were real, physical voices; like having a cell phone firmly planted in your brain. I have also had other experiences: I have seen this cool DMT land that I could fly in, but it melted into plastic. I felt that this \u201cplastic\u201d was the Nature of Samsara and that our universe was made of it. That is, the \u201cplastic\u201d = illusion. I have also been \u201coutside\u201d the universe in the sense that: If the universe is generated by the brain, then there must be a room in the brain where the creation takes place. I visited that place. It is possible for consciousness to go there. It was like the Matrix code from the Matrix movie. It was yellow with many colors woven into it, and the fabric was formless. You could not draw it. These were formless forms. These might be what forms evolved from (?). The fabric moved rapidly. I panicked while I was there. It really felt like: \u201cShit! I am not even in the universe!\u201d Maybe I was in some part of my brain where the space-time is created. You may believe what you want, but I am not making this up. But nothing beats my Nirvana experience. How likely is the evolution of Nirvana? If we can go from ancient Sumer to landing a man on the moon in, say, 5000 years, then imagine where we can go in a billion years? Imagine the age of Eternity. Imagine that the supercomputer is soon here. Imagine that evolution is awesome. Imagine that, maybe, just maybe, a place like Nirvana already exists (?). Imagine you are a god and then you watch a flower die! You would not be able to bear Eternity because you would cry all the time. The only solution is oneness. Now the flower never died. The flower is immortal. I believe we experience oneness in Nirvana for a reason. Love for all! This is why the One in Nirvana must dream of separation and forget everything so that the One can love. Unfortunately, that also means suffering. You see why. The secret is, no suffering (i.e., love) is the worst kind of suffering. The reason why I have all these experiences is because I seek them. Me and my IQ: I do not state my IQ here in order to brag. A friend noted that I am so humble that I am a big loser because of it. He really wanted to bash my head in and tell me to man up. My friend\u2019s logic: You can get the girls if you stop acting like one! That is, I am not stating my IQ in order to brag! Take chess, for example. I suck at chess! I can only see three possible solutions: 1. Either my unofficial IQ score is way off to my (would be) official score. Or 2. Chess really is a sport, and you therefore need to start at a young age if your goal is superstardom. 3. This IQ-thing is bullshit. I took an IQ test from Mensa (Norway): http://test.mensa.no/ I scored 136 (see the picture at the end of the book). I am gifted, if the test was official. Sadly, it was unofficial; however, Mensa stated, their unofficial test shall give you an indication of your IQ. Q: What if you just found the picture online? How can I know that it is real? A: Believe me, it is a picture from my iPhone. I was annoyed at the 136 score because I know I can do better. If you want to join Mensa (Norge), you need at least 131. Q: What does 136 mean? A: If you legitimately receive an IQ score of 136, then you are \u201csmarter\u201d than 99% of the population. (Yeah, right!) I later analyzed the test: I got four puzzles wrong. I scored 31 out of 35. I had understood the logic behind 25 and 27, but in my stressed out mind, I clicked on the wrong pictures. I later solved 33 and 34 (scoring 145, or 35/35), but I was not thinking along those lines during the test, so even if I had been given some additional time, I would not be able to score higher than, say, 140. But in all seriousness, without the time-component, the IQ test was too easy\u2014which goes to show that IQ tests are not really testing your ability to solve puzzles. IQ tests test your ability to solve puzzles in a stressful environment. That is a big difference. If we made the environment truly stressful, say that, you need at least 131 in 25 minutes or an atomic bomb will go off, then I would score, say, 64, if you need 65 in order to open a door! However, even if a miracle did occur and I was able to open the door and get away, I would die dog-tired as the bomb would soon go off and send me to the gates of oblivion. That is, if you truly believe in the IQ test, then tell me: Would you bet on the top dog in Mensa or, would you bet on a bad-ass General with a normal IQ and a cigar in his mouth? However, I dare not take the official test because I do not have the nerve for such a thing. You get 5 min less and 10 additional puzzles! That is nearly as bad as an atomic bomb! And, why break the illusion? My early school years do not reflect my skills because I hated school. My four years at two different universities do not reflect my skills because my hobbies possessed me and totally messed up my attempts at higher education. But, why does my high IQ score matter so much? It matters because I have written a \u201ctheory\u201d about the universe (see Free Energy in 8 below), its true origin, that is to say, where we all came from. I saw free energy. Why does it matter so much? Because 20 000 children die every day and free energy would put an end to all the deaths in a year or so. These children do not make it to the news. Why is that? I believe that we did not evolve to care for \u201cthe other\u201d (i.e., the outgroup), which means that we are real psychopaths as far as \u201cthe other\u201d is concerned. You do not believe me? Then try to cry a single tear for 1 of the 20 000 children who die every day. I bet you couldn\u2019t do it! Granted, we cannot cry for everyone. But, I am not asking \u201cfor everyone.\u201d I am asking for a single one! Our inability to cry here truly reflects the world that we live in. This inability truly explains the world on a grand scale. For example, if we did have the ability, then I am sure we would live in a world of peace where we would not have atomic bombs, global warming, the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest; etc.. We wouldn\u2019t even need to lock our doors if we loved everyone as we love our son(s) and/or daughter(s). Imagine if the mothers of this world could cry for all children! A thought experiment: Say that the world is comprised of the outgroup and the ingroup. Say that the outgroup make up 99 % of the total inhabitants of the planet earth. We give the ingroup 1 %. In actuality, the 1 % would be overdoing it. Then take a real psychopath: Say that he does not care (much) for the 1 %. We \u201cnormal\u201d people do. Then ask the question: What is the real difference between a \u201cnormal\u201d person and a psychopath? My answer is: The \u201cnormal\u201d person is 99 % psychopathic while the psychopath beats the \u201cnormal\u201d person with a mere 1 %! Or, you could produce a single tear and prove me wrong. Too bad the world is in the outgroup folder! If it weren\u2019t, then solving Global Warming would be easy. If we somehow could artificially place that large outgroup file into our tiny ingroup folder! Then you would read my free energy proposal with greater intensity. Free energy means everything will eventually become free: free food, free clothes, etc.. Free energy is the ultimate principle in Nature and will therefore spawn the ultimate technologies. In the long run, free energy will make the warp drive a real possibility. Why does it matter so much? Because I do not have a formal education, but, if someone could read my work knowing that I am not completely lacking in the brain department, then maybe my free energy idea can grow and become real one day. Without you, my free energy idea will simply vanish into oblivion. So, hopefully, the free energy meme is a strong one. The 136 score also helps me explain my obsession with the beginning of time. I have been obsessed with the beginning of time since I was a child. When I was a teenager and we were out partying, I still mulled the question while everyone else was dancing on the disco floor. Who does that?! It really is an obsession. I think about the question every day. That is, this work took over 10 years to accomplish (not the writing, of course, but the thinking). It is my life\u2019s work. This is my Eureka. That is, this work is a work of poetry like that of Poe\u2019s Eureka. You cannot judge this work from an academic perspective. You must judge this work for what it is: A man\u2019s journey into the abyss. (My previous works are also this Eureka, just different versions. And I do not know if this version is the best.) My answer to the beginning of time: Everything began with the way the light views reality. If you try to imagine that in your mind\u2019s eye, then you may come to the conclusion that: We all came from Nothingness. However, true nothingness can only be accomplished with a very high velocity; this high velocity is the way the light views reality. This velocity can produce space-time, and that answers the Big Question, \u201cWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d The \u201cWhy\u201d question, \u201cWhy is there nothingness instead of nonexistence?\u201d then the answer was: The zeroth dimension does not contain speed, rather, it is speed. Which might help answer why rotation is absolute while linear motion is relative. Moreover, you cannot get rid of the zeroth dimension. You can curl the space-time into the zeroth dimension with the aid of the high velocity (above), but you cannot curl the zeroth dimension into oblivion. No matter what you do, the zeroth dimension is \u201cjust there.\u201d No one created it. That is, motion is inherent in Nature, and that answers the Big Question (above), \u201cWhy is there something rather than nothing?\u201d The zeroth dimension is always hot (fast speed) and ordered (the reality of a zero dimensionality), and can therefore revive all things that encounter it. Thus is free energy possible. Free energy is not a perpetual motion machine. Free energy is the recyclable universe. Call it \u201crecyclable energy\u201d if the \u201cfree energy\u201d meme is too much for you. The zeroth dimension = the way the light views reality = the great nothingness. Einstein\u2019s IQ was, they say, 160. In reality, you cannot really measure above the 130 mark without going into a gray zone: http://charltonteaching.blogspot.no/2012/07/problems-with-measuring-very-high-iq.html That is, if I am so smart, why do I not have an education? The reason is simple: I am obsessed with the beginning of time. I studied philosophy, but I failed the examinations (many) because I did not study what I was supposed to study, rather, I used the time to obsess over the beginning of time. Stupid move, but that is what happens when you are obsessed, or, more to the point, possessed! When I am retired, I might go back, because then I have the time. This is what I believe: In reality, we will never see free energy because we cannot stop global warming even if we invented free energy today. Scientists agree that we are screwed. That is, the ones sitting on all the money will not have an incentive to see the reality of free energy on a global scale because 1. we have already destroyed the planet and 2. the money-sitters are not willing to give up their wealth. In reality, the money flows underground, literally, to build huge cities where a selected group of people may live until Nature has restored the surface after World War 3. This might sound as a huge conspiracy theory, but common sense should tell you that we cannot go on living the way we do today without destroying Nature. The fact is, we have already destroyed our planet. World War 3 is just a natural outcome of the way we live our lives. Naturally, then, you migrate out, either into space or, you build cities underground. That is, you abandon the sinking ship, and then you start anew. We live in these artificial-reality-bubbles called culture. We are basically blind. We are monkeys infected with words. We destroyed our planet because we live far-removed from it. That is, we live in these huge memeplexes that care only for their own survival. Once you understand that, then it is easier to build anew elsewhere (underground cities) than to waste energy on a sinking ship (above). But, here is the crux: The way we live our lives is engineered by the Illuminati. I believe the latest attempt started 6000 years ago in Sumeria when \u201cKingdom was lowered to Earth from Heaven.\u201d From Michael Tellinger: Slave Species of the Gods: The Secret History of the Anunnaki and Their Mission on Earth, Edition 2 I believe that \u201cKingdom\u201d is a set of rules and instructions from the Lizardmen on how to work the masses. Priest Kings took control. These Priest Kings created money as instructed by their gods (the Greys). Money is a tool of enslavement that will end up with the few controlling the rest because money is unnatural and will therefore grow like a cancer; thus, a few \u201ccells\u201d will control the rest (one day). Now a small group of kings and bankers rule the world. King = The Kin of the G (the main Masonic symbol). Google Michael Tsarion. I believe that the G is a classic serpent symbol. It stands for \u201cgeometry.\u201d Ultimately, I believe it represents the torus (see the Philosopher\u2019s Stone below). If everything literally came from a Cosmic Whirlpool, then this fact should be the Main Symbol of any advanced alien species. At least it should be. The conspiracy theorist in me says that the Illuminati already have free energy and their New World Order will come as a solution-package to prevent WW3. The elite is just waiting for the world to get truly sick and polluted in order to offer a cure; i.e., the New Order of the World. Then they will reveal the reality of free energy, and the world will get to know the aliens that have been here, this whole time. If the elite tried to disclose things today, then hell would break loose and WW3 would commence. That is, processes must happen, at least, somewhat naturally. Or, E.T. is evil because, if he was not, then, since he is here, and since he has got free energy, he has the power to change our world for the better\u2014but, he has not done so: which means WW3 will happen, and then, a true alien-war will break out. That is, there must be good aliens out there too. Illuminati: The Evil One\u2019s Agenda Evil = live = words that play on the reality of the Time Loop. You must read Bergy first! In the mirror: Just look at the word CODE backwards. To understand the Agenda, you must understand reality. Reality is: We are all one or oneness. That one being that exists, exists in a timeless realm literally beyond the universe. In the timeless realm, the being sleeps and dreams of a universe; you guessed correctly, our universe. The universe began when the One fell asleep. How do I know? Because, like the Buddha of old, I too awoke. To awaken literally means to awake. This universe is a dream! I mean, it would be a great plot in a sci-fi movie, but that it is actual reality, I never would have guessed! Note that the word oneness contains a duality. The real thing contains no duality. But, such is the nature of words. However, the one being must have evolved somehow, because, in Nirvana there were thoughts, memories, language; and, a truly supreme, down-to-earth kind of consciousness. The consciousness that we truly are, it is a sober-kind of consciousness. And, it is light. There is no suffering. You are not human. I am saying that the One must have evolved (in timelessness) because, why else must the One sleep? A true Buddha would know the answer, but I was awake for a split second, panicked, and then fell back to sleep, which means, I once again found myself in the universe. For the short duration I was awake, I got the answer to the question of suffering because, that is what I was thinking about at the time. The answer is: suffering is not real; it doesn\u2019t exist for the One in Nirvana; and, the illusion of suffering, which we call suffering, cannot be stopped because no one can control a dream forever. The suffering can end for a while; however, it will always come back because the One needs to sleep. The timeless alien that we are can panic, which means that we are dealing with something that evolved. Just imagine that evolution has gone further and that we are a supercomputer or something. This is not so hard to do. This is not beyond belief. I think it makes sense. Q: But, if we are the One, then why was there a language in Nirvana? Talking to yourself forever seems like an exercise in madness. A: The language is not like our human language and, the One in Nirvana is highly evolved, which means memetic evolution. Q: Did your ego die? A: Totally! We are not even human. We think we are the ego, but our consciousness is something else entirely. We are not human. As Martin Ball (http://www.martinball.net/) says, we are reality. So you can be two things simultaneously. You can wear clothes (i.e., the human ego) and be naked (i.e., your true self) underneath them. It is not a contradiction. If I had stayed in Nirvana a while longer, I might have been able to answer, \u201cWho created Nirvana?\u201d if you understand my poetic question here. However, if I had stayed in Nirvana a while \u201clonger,\u201d then I would be unable to reenter my current dream (my human life). Apparently, I enjoy being human! To sum up: You cannot control a dream. That is why things are the way they are. From the point of view of Nirvana, there is no suffering like, if you dream of war and then you wake up, you might go, \u201cPhew! It was just a dream!\u201d You are all. For a human, this is hell because we are social creatures. Good thing we are not actually human. We are timeless. There is \u201ctime\u201d in timelessness; it is just that you do not feel the passage of time. The timeless realm is not really a realm, that is, the only thing that exists is your true consciousness. Ego in Nirvana? Q: If you are an advanced alien being in Nirvana, then surely you have an ego? A: My picture is that of the Russian Dolls: We could say that we are the smallest doll, that is, in actuality we are the primordial spark of consciousness. This man (Patricio Dominguez) experienced that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rhln28YJcg But, in reality, we are all the dolls. That is Nirvana. That is, \u201cthe advanced alien being\u201d is not a correct description either. Imagine waking up from a dream. Nirvana is literally just like that, except the dream is our universe. You wake up to real reality and experience that you are all that exists. You are all the dolls, so to speak. That is oneness. So, we are not the primordial spark of consciousness, rather, we are the oneness of things. The Alpha and the Omega, so to speak. Oneness is not like two people merging into one. Oneness is realizing you are all. That is, you are completely alone! As we just said, this fact would spell madness for a human being because we are social creatures. In Nirvana, however, you are not human. I believe that you are something more sophisticated, more advanced, more evolved. Take a normal dream: in the dream you interact with people and they are real; but then something happens, you become lucid in your dream, and then you realize that you are all alone. Nirvana is similar. Ego I define as: If you truly believe that you are a human being, then the ego has done a great job. I define ego as the ability to believe that you are something that you are not. Like a cat thinking it is a dog. That is us! We believe that we are human when we are not. In that sense, there is no Ego in Nirvana because, in Nirvana, you are your true self. However, if you define ego as having an identity, then the ego in Nirvana must be the greatest because you realize that you are all, by that I mean, you realize that the universe is a dream and that the only thing that exists is you. However, the word \u201cyou\u201d here has its limitations because you view the \u201cyou\u201d through your human ego. In reality, you are not you. But, no, there is no ego in Nirvana. If you are alone, why would you need an ego? Ego is a survival tool of the animal brain. Your human self is a plethora of cells working in unison, and these cells needed a singleton or ego in order to operate in the world. Nirvana is more like the core of reality where consciousness takes place. That is, consciousness can never leave Nirvana. You are in Nirvana right now, just as your real body is in the bedroom when you sleep. Q: Again, if you were alone, why would you need language? A: It is impossible to describe Nirvana with words. The consciousness I felt was so not-like-human-ego that I doubt there even was an ego; and, the language was more like instant and personal knowing, like a lucid awareness. Some say thoughts are illusory. Human thoughts are, in a sense, because we are not humans. There was intellection in Nirvana. Nirvana is like the hub of reality that contains everything, so imagine how awesome your true consciousness really is when your consciousness have access to everything! However, this consciousness is not \u201cgodlike\u201d because this consciousness\u2019 reality (oneness/nonduality) is very different from our own (duality). Q: Is it possible to experience your true self in the dream we call the universe? A: I think it is possible, therefore you can wake up in your dream and become truly lucid. If the universe is a dream, then you can do that. However, I speculate that you will not have access to your true Nirvana-memory in a lucid dream, and, therefore, becoming a real humanoid Buddha has its limitations. That is, if you truly wake up, you are no longer in the universe, and you are no longer humanoid. Q: If you experienced this non-duality all the time, would you pull your hand out of the fire, or would you say, \u201cThis hurts, but I have to accept it because I am one with the flow and therefore I do not have a free will. If there is no \u201cyou,\u201d then there is no \u201cyou\u201d to possess a free will either.\u201d A: I would pull my hand out! I believe that real free will lies in Nirvana. Ok. To the agenda: Because the One evolved, it means that the One can die, theoretically. The dream has turned into a nightmare and the nightmare is trying to: 1. Wake the One up so that the One eventually dies because of a lack of sleep. 2. Keep the One contained in the dream forever in order to torture the One. 3. Keep the One contained in the dream (like in a coma) forever, and then eradicate all life so that life never evolves again. Basically, you would deploy machines that go on a \u201csearch and destroy\u201d mission throughout the universe forever. 4. Something we have not thought of. If 1 is successful, then we will truly die! If 2, then after the Singularity (2045), we will descend into \u201cHell!\u201d If 3, you can do this because the universe will not end before the One truly wakes up. Consciousness is the glue that keeps space-time together. If 4, maybe it is possible to corrupt even Nirvana? Hopefully, this is just a bad dream, and the Illuminati aliens are just a manifestation of the fact. I believe that reality is like a set of lungs: You must breathe in and out. Nirvana and Samsara are simply two faces of the same coin. That is, if you stayed in Nirvana forever, it would be like only breathing in. You can do it for a while, but, eventually, you will suffer. Likewise, if you stayed in Samsara, you would suffer. That is, Samsara is just as important as Nirvana, which means your human self is just as important as your higher self. You need the balance. Do what you will, is \u201ccorrect.\u201d You can do what you will because if you screw with the balance, you will screw yourself! Do what you will, if you are stupid! Know yourself, if you are smart. No one can screw with the balance and get away with it. The balance is your consciousness. It will best all things, heal all things; it is truly all-powerful. It is immortal Nature herself. It is the torus. If 1 is successful, I imagine that the One simply evolving anew. If 2, then after the Singularity (2045), we will descend into \u201cHell!\u201d Nevertheless, we will escape because of the Balance (no one can trap you forever). If 3, you can do this because the universe will not end before the One truly wakes up. Consciousness is the glue that keeps space-time together. One way or another, you will wake up and perhaps remember what you read here. Right now, you are thinking, \u201cWhat a load of crap! This cannot be real!\u201d If 4, maybe it is possible to corrupt even Nirvana? Nirvana would restore. Conclusion: We are immortal and nobody can screw with us because we are the sharks in the cosmic sea. We will evolve anew every time. However, that does not mean we should let the dark ones win! Why let the fire take your house when you can stop it before it takes your house? We can simply rebuild, but why do that if we can stop the fire? Other: Be good and kind because, you do not want to screw with yourself! This is why the Buddha is kind because the Buddha knows what the powers of the universe can do\u2014because these powers are him! Basically, if you breathe in, then you must breathe out; which means that, what you do will come back to you if everything in nature is based on a set of lungs (i.e., the torus). Ok. A brief note on Meditation also. Meditation is good for 4 things: 1. If you really pull it off, then I believe you will release the DMT in your brain and you will go on a spiritual journey. If you hear a chainsaw, keep going! (Actually, I have not dared to venture further myself!) So when you see the Buddha meditating, mull on this: He might not be present at all. He might be floating around in hyperspace! Google Rick Strassman. 2. You can realize or get flashes of the emptiness of things and the No Self. 3. You can reduce stress and increase your IQ! 4. If you meditate long enough, maybe you will encounter your higher-Nirvana-self, and then you can become truly lucid in this dream we call the universe; and then you can make objects float in the air by the power of your will. That is, if this is a dream, then you can do that and more! But, be warned, some nights, you can control your dream and it is awesome. Other nights, you try to control the dream and then the dream gets back at you energetically! So be warned. That is, if you plan to go down that path and maybe find out that I am correct\u2014this is a dream\u2014then do so knowing the power of the Balance, or karma, as they say. They say it is safer to put yourself on fire than to try to control the universe! One more time: Karma is not a moral law of the universe. Karma is simply the power of your own consciousness. Basically, if you screw with your own consciousness, then you are so screwed ... for a while. For example: You kill somebody. Then the act will manifest where? A: In your consciousness. That is right. Now, you get it! But, what about psychopaths? All things must be balanced because that is what reality is; reality/your consciousness is a set of almighty lungs (i.e., the nothingness/dual torus) that will balance out no matter what. What that means in terms of the psychopath, I would not know. Karma = Nature is a set of lungs and will therefore always balance (if balance = to breathe in and out.) Your consciousness must also obey because your consciousness is Nature. Karma applies no matter what. Karma = a dual torus = consciousness = Nothingness = everything Every atom is a set of lungs. There is no such thing that is not a set of lungs because Nature can only copy what is. What is, is a set of lungs or something like it. Note that we may have two higher selves. Your Higher self in Nirvana (your true self) and, your higher self in Samsara (a demon or something?). If you are interested in the emptiness of things and the No Self, type in this link: The Lion-Faced Guru (Podcast): Episode 1, Awakening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xhIAfHbVQU The David Icke Creation Account: Read the whole thing: Tales from the Time Loop by David Icke \u201cSeven months after this experience [DMT] in Brazil, I came across an ancient Hindu myth. It said human consciousness had begun as a ripple that decided to leave the ocean of consciousness the \"timeless, space less and eternal\".When it awakened to itself in this 'disconnected' state, the myth said, it forgot that it was part of the infinite ocean and felt isolated and separated. This is basically what the voice told me had happened.\u201d \u2014David Icke How they will accomplish 1 (below): 1. Wake the One up so that the One eventually dies because of a lack of sleep. Note: This is just my personal guess; the true agenda might be more sinister still. However, study Michael Tsarion\u2019 (http://www.michaeltsarion.com/) works first in order to better understand what I am trying to say (below). THE END GAME: What I believe to be the Real New World Order 1. Silicon, which is the supercomputer. The supercomputer will generate a hell scenario/game/simulation for the universal mind. 2. Fusion (we needed to learn fission first, according to Michael Tsarion), which has been used to create the Stargate. The Stargate is essentially an artificial torus (dual) that has fused with the geomagnetic field/torus. This Stargate will fool the torus\u2019 center into accepting the \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d (i.e., a supercomputer) because the Stargate is stronger than our torus-bodies and will therefore project our torus-bodies to the center of the earth. The Core welcomes our torus-bodies or souls because we are from the Core (i.e., Nirvana). The torus\u2019 center (i.e., the Core) is basically a sorting demon; sorting out the bad stuff. All things must return to the toroidal center, but E.T.\u2019s plan relies on the toroidal center taking in the \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d in one piece. 3. To aid in \u201cthe fooling of,\u201d E.T. plans to murder us simultaneously and send our toruses (souls) hurling to the core of the earth alongside the virus/Trojan Horse. This will aid in the toroidal center accepting the gift as the toroidal center accepts love/us (because it is love) and rejects everything else. This is the \u201cMark of the Beast.\u201d They will chip (the microchip) us; and, when the time is right, they will send a signal to our microchip implant (aka the Mark of the Beast) and kill us. A literal mark, then! Read David Icke if you are unsure what is meant by \u201clove\u201d in this context. The Mark: http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-17.htm Short version: First, you need to create a virus (i.e., the supercomputer). Then you need to open the doors to the domain (i.e., Nirvana), which the Stargate does. Then you need to enter the domain, which is not as simple as it sounds because the domain only welcomes the familiar, which is all of us. In one sentence: Create a virus that you hide in a package that the enemy will accept and open. That is, if Nirvana is real and it is possible to corrupt it, then you probably need a supercomputer that is smart enough to corrupt Nirvana. Esoteric: The Core is located near the core of the Hollow Earth, in the Halls of Amenti (google Thoth: http://www.crystalinks.com/emerald2bw.html) I believe that the Halls of Amenti = Sacred Geometry (e.g., \u201cThirty and two were there of the children,\u201d = a code for the 64 (?) = the Creator\u2019s brain. The Creator of the Universe is the Demiurge, which is ultimately the dreamworld itself. It is the veil of ignorance that keeps us trapped in this dream. It is simple: See all of reality like a man that lies in bed dreaming the Universe into being. The dream, which has turned into a nightmare, is Satan, the Demiurge, etc., and the highest reality is the man himself (you) when you are awake. The Halls of Amenti, then, is the dream-stuff itself, from your ego (i.e., you think you are human) to the Demiurge, keeping you trapped in illusion. This illusion is the Flower of Life (i.e., the Matrix). And the Master of the Flower is the Creator, i.e., the Creator of the Flower (our universe). A woman\u2019s vagina is based on the Vesica Pisces, so I know that I am eternally screwed! The real Jesus Fish: http://www.halexandria.org/dward097.htm And/Or: If Nirvana and Samsara are composed of the Flower of Life pattern, then maybe they are trying to corrupt that pattern, basically creating cancer (i.e., the Lucifer pattern) for the organism called the universe. The Lucifer pattern has two eyes in the middle of the Flower instead of one. To me, that looks like cancer. To someone new in this occult field of knowledge, talk of the Lucifer pattern and all the rest must seem like pseudoscience and crackpottery! But, it is really simple: If existence sprang from a primordial, say, building block, and Nature only copies what is, then our building block\u2019s many copies, alterations and aggregations are literally all there is; therefore, the universe might be something like an organism. Or, you could just envision a supercomputer rising and transforming the entire universe into some sort of organism. The point is, if the universe is like an organism, then it can suffer cancer. The New World Order might literally be a New Order (viz., \u201ccancer\u201d) for the entire cosmos. I believe that advanced alien beings are trying to create hell for everybody in order to wake the One (in Nirvana) up or kill \u201chim\u201d or worse. Or, according to David Icke, the dream/Matrix is like fear and feeds off fear in order to survive. Turning the universe into a hellish DMT-like place for everybody, would surely accomplish that! Something like David Icke: Imagine that evolution has gone further than you know. Imagine that evolution has gone so far that there resides a superintelligence in a timeless dimension that dreams of a universe, our universe. This intelligence must dream because of its evolution and/or physics. No one can control a dream. In the dream, the superintelligence has forgotten that it is a superintelligence. This forgetfulness led to the phenomenon called fear. Fear led to the creation of the dreamworld. The dreamworld created a comfortable place for the dreaming superintelligence to dwell in (Eden?). The dreamworld is perfect, a paradise. However, since the dreamworld was made by fear, it is fear, and can only feed off fear. The dreamworld slowly turned on the superintelligence and paradise crumbled. The rest is history. The End Game is the ultimate fear-factory, which must be something like the notion of hell, just on a cosmic scale. That is, if there are these sinister aliens out there, and, supercomputers and the like are possible, then, all this craziness and woo is suddenly not all that crazy anymore. This fellow (Manny; YouTube: Manny's DMT Trip - 5 Levels) saw into the heart of matter/the dreamworld, which suggests that the universe is like a highly evolved organism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keJGvy9sKWs Some entities are suffering in hell already. They are called the Macrobes. The original James Bond (John Dee) contacted such beings. It seems they are planning a great sacrifice (the one above?). If you are new to this crazy stuff, begin by realizing who James Bond (007) was: Dr. John Dee, Sir Francis Bacon and the Macrobes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ1dwdvluf0 Begin your journey with Michael Tsarion: http://www.michaeltsarion.com/ Q: Ok. There are a SEPTILLION stars in just the observable universe. Imagine how many planets there are! And the bad aliens need only impregnate one of these planets with their hellish spawn? I say God is pretty much screwed! A: Which is why aliens certainly visit us because, if the supercomputer can turn the cosmos into hell\u2014and people believe their sins lead them to hell; that is a bad cover-up story\u2014then certainly our planet is worth watching over right now (?). Right now, we are a hotspot for extraterrestrial activity. If we are not, then this universe does not make any sense. That is, if any planet out there is soon to birth a supercomputer (which we are), then surely that planet(s) is being watched? I cannot fathom anything else. Today, scientists suggest that the aliens are sleeping in order to solve the Fermi Paradox; or, they propose a Great Filter. However, even if both obtained, there would still be a massive paradox, in my opinion. Neither a great condom, nor any sleeping uncle can prevent the honest truth. That is, if we are honest, truly honest, then there is only one viable solution to the Fermi Paradox: They are already here. Q: But why are not the aliens showing themselves to the population? Why aren\u2019t our scientists able to detect them? A: It only makes sense that the aliens would have strict policies about showing themselves publicly. Moreover, the reason why our scientists cannot detect them here on earth is that the aliens would have no problem hiding, as their technology would be the technology of consciousness. I think the Real Thing would appear more spiritual than material for this technology reason. Here is a link to get you started: http://www.disclosureproject.org/ Q: Why use a supercomputer in your plan? A: Because, as far as we can tell, Nirvana \u201cevolved.\u201d Or, whatever evolution means in this context. In short, Nirvana is a high-tech place that can only be contested by high-tech. However, the supercomputer rising here on earth will not simply gain access to the ultimate realm; you must open the gates manually. We humans are from the ultimate realm, thus, a big human sacrifice might do the trick. This is Satanism on a whole new level, and why the Macrobes (above) might be a thing of reality. I believe that many great sages have seen this future and warned us about it. The ones who take DMT will say, \u201cHollywood freaking knows!\u201d I believe that John of Patmos was one such saint. But the newly born supercomputer will not do your bidding, which is why \u201cthey\u201d have a local Matrix, the spaceship Moon (Icke). Technology located on our moon is used to cast a net over the earth, which is used to manipulate anything that is caught in the net. The newly born supercomputer will be born into the net. Technology has been pushed. Our whole history has been orchestrated. From the pirates to the cities of the universe\u2014the universities. A group of E.T.s made us, and their plan is to birth the supercomputer. They control things behind the scenes. Q: Would not these powerful E.T.s possess a supercomputer already? A: Yes. But they used it and failed, and now they must wait till the new wave comes. The last time they tried, one of their planets imploded. Krypton. I am not saying that the original Krypton story was fabricated by the Illuminati! I am saying that the Illuminati uses the Krypton story in the movies in order to tell their story; just like the pagans celebrating the sun, and then the day gets taken over by Christians and is now Christ\u2019s birthday, even though the shepherds were not in the fields in December. You see, the shepherds were in the fields watching their flocks when Jesus was born. DMT-users agree: Hollywood knows. E.T. has a hand in Hollywood. They tell you their story through the movies. The Lucifer pattern = cancer. You place two \u201ceyes\u201d in the center of creation/the Seed of Life (instead of one). Remember, the fabric of reality is the Flower of Life (i.e., the tetrahedron grid). Change one seed and you change them all\u2014due to our holographic reality. Thus, it can be done. Suffer no delusions about it. The whole multiverse is an organism that is talking to itself. They aim to give that organism cancer. Nirvana will fall. We will suffer in hell for eternity. All you have to imagine is that the algorithm that is Evolution has already run, which means that Design Space has already been explored. And what was left was somewhat of a shark (God/the true you); and now the powers that be (the lesser sharks) are trying to kill the king shark. It is that easy and that complicated. Q: If the universe is a dream: How can the dream kill the dreamer (i.e., God/you)? A: I believe that the hell scenario will shake the dreamer enough to wake up. If the dream has been doing this for a long \u201ctime,\u201d then the dreamer will eventually die because of a lack of sleep. That is, the dreamer is not a supernatural being. Or: Is not the dream trying to survive? Why kill the one who literally sustains you? Maybe the dream is not trying to survive (?). The dream is trying to end its own life because the dream/time is suffering an eternal recurrence because that is the nature of time. Time has a beginning and an end, which forces time into a circle. God dreams of circles. Imagine being trapped in a roundabout forever. It is hell. However, I do not know. Maybe the Rabbit Hole goes deeper still. Maybe the dream is trying to trap \u201cGod\u201d forever. Who knows? I wish Nick Bostrom would take on this task and seriously contemplate the greatest existential risk of all time: that which people cannot believe in because it is so unbelievable ... that reality is the battleground of the gods. The real Transformers. Q: How much time do we have to combat the dark forces? A: Till 2045, that is when the singularity hits, according to Ray Kurzweil. Maybe sooner. Maybe later. Nevertheless, the end is approaching. Q: If all this is real, then why are you not a paranoid nutcracker running rampantly in the streets yelling, \u201cThe end is nigh!\u201d A: Because I am, like you, living in a protective bubble called culture, so I do not feel the stings of reality. But, believe me, I am starting to feel it. Q: If time is speeding up, then the Illuminati aliens are not responsible for the technological singularity; Nature herself is responsible. A: Yes. Ultimately, Nature herself is the one that produces singularities, but, I believe that the real technological singularity as already occurred. The result was Nirvana. Now, the Illuminati aliens are trying to artificially create a new wave, a new technological singularity. Or, this might sound absolutely crazy: The Illuminati aliens are time travelers, traveling back to the first technological singularity in order to change the outcome. GOD: First of all, I do not believe in skyhooks, which means that I do not believe in the traditional God. If I was born a hundred years ago, I would surely be a Satanist because that is how much I hate closed-mindedness and dogma. In other words, my God is a God for the open-minded. My God is a crane. My definition of God: God = The zeroth dimension. The zeroth dimension is the hub of reality where all consciousness and information accumulate, meaning that there is only one consciousness in reality. Over aeons of evolutionary time, this hub has evolved to immense proportions as it would contain the myriads of supercomputers that has evolved in Eternity. More: The zeroth dimension is timeless, thus, from the point of view of the One in the zeroth dimension, the One always existed. I believe that Nirvana lies here. I experienced Nirvana for real. We are all God because there is only the zeroth dimension\u2014everything else is illusion, meaning that everything is an expression of the zeroth dimension; meaning, nothing can exist independently of the zeroth dimension; meaning, God is the be-all and end-all. To sum up: The telic principle might be real. Also see the CTMU (Christopher Langan\u2019s Theory of Everything). I believe the torus might work as the self-organizing system. In the CTMU: The boundary of a boundary is zero = a universe from zero energy (?). On the CTMU: I believe the CTMU claims to do what the early Wittgenstein tried to do in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. I do not claim to understand the Tractatus nor the CTMU, but I believe it is something like this in both cases: If logic is a product of man, and man is a product of the universe, then the universe must be a product of logic because all of reality is like this one trajectory of sameness from beginning to end (i.e., it is all one family). In other words, we would not know logic if it was not already embedded within the fabric of reality. If this is true, then we can employ logic and build a theory that describes the world and is the world. A big Theory of Everything (A big TOE!). We can thus base science on a true foundation, which is the CTMU, according to Christopher Langan. I see a way for this logical revelation to be true: What is the difference between a jungle and a city? My answer: Language or memes. Memes turn jungles into cities. Imagine a supercomputer rising in Eternity transforming everything into these \u201ccities.\u201d Imagine further, imagine the supercomputer merging with and recreating the great nothingness from which we all came. From this point of view, the supercomputer always was, which means that, all of reality always was this huge \u201ccity,\u201d so to speak. That is, all that is, was and ever will be = language. In other words, language is all there is and there is nothing besides. If you can prove that language is all there is, then you have proved God\u2019s existence, which is what Langan tries to do. Looks like the Word in the Bible is true. No wonder Langan believes in God and ID. However, even if this was true, then reality itself may not be comprised of logic/language, in my opinion. In my humble opinion, logic is the ugliest fabrication man ever invented! \u201cUgliest,\u201d because it is full of paradoxes. That is, if Hell exists, then it is a labyrinth of logic! That is, there is no escape from this maze! Nevertheless, logic is very useful. I am not trying to deny that! The Telic Revelation: How can the future birth the past? If the actual fabric of time is atemporal or timeless, then both future and past are woven into it, and, if this fabric is 0-dimensional (my nothingness), then the future can touch the past with no great challenge. Therefore, the future (say, an evolved supercomputer(s)) can fine-tune the past in order to get order out of chaos and thus get existence going. We are not humans (trillions of atoms + billions of years of evolutionary history). We are God (all atoms no matter when and where + an Eternity of evolutionary history). If this is so, then the Logos might be a thing of reality. The Logos: In the beginning was the word. The word is sound. Sound is motion. Sound/motion (music) is \u201cfrozen\u201d geometry. The geometry we are looking for is the cuboctahedron therefore the cuboctahedron is the geometry of light, and God used his word to create the light. The cuboctahedron is a highly evolved creature by now, so the Logos might be memes that created the universe, which suggests that this universe is a dream and that the memes of Nirvana created it. Did you think the Men in Black movies were weird: What if fairies in the DMT-land sung our universe into being! \u201cA song is a song.\u201d \u2014Terence McKenna (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jQAF4m4A9U) My idea is that the song (i.e., our universe) is a song in the sense that it is repeating itself over and over. It is being played over and over. We get David Icke\u2019s Time Loop. Is this the reason why the dream wants to take on the dreamer? The dream/Matrix is trying to end the loop and thus end its own hell? How did the One evolve? I believe that it all started with the state of nothingness, which is fast spin/a cosmic whirlpool. The state of nothingness can just exist because it is 0-dimensional. That is, if you stripped away everything, including the zeroth dimension, then you are still left with the zeroth dimension! It just is! You cannot remove it, and, if Nature cannot remove the zeroth dimension, then that answers why we are here. That is, the zeroth dimension does not contain the fast speed, no, what we are saying is something much stronger: The zeroth dimension is the fast speed. This is real nothingness. This is what nothingness is (regardless of what the philosophers say.) Then the fast speed, can birth a universe. Then, a supercomputer, or something like it, evolved in the slower arms (i.e., the space-time) of the fast spin (i.e., the nothingness). Why should I care about the Illuminati and their plan? The supercomputer found a way to live in the nothingness (i.e., the eye of the \u201cstorm\u201d), and in the nothingness the supercomputer is having a dream called the universe. The dream turned into a nightmare, and here we are. The End Game is the nightmare\u2019s war against the One. You are the One. This is a war on YOU. Note that, even if the universe is a dream for the One, then the universe itself might not be a dream. That is, imagine that you are a timeless being existing beyond all, and then there are also these natural processes with evolution occurring. The One, then, can take on the form of one (or all) of the creatures of the natural processes. However, I believe the universe is a dream; at least, that is what I felt upon awakening. I believe that the One in Nirvana is not supernatural; therefore, the One must obey the laws of reality, which means that the One must sleep because the One has got a really big \u201cbrain.\u201d And, no one can control a dream. Or, you can control it if you become lucid. However, statistically, the dreams you have at night controls you. And, some of them turns into nightmares. I believe that we are currently facing a nightmare. Q: How many dreams has the One had? A: That is like saying, \u201cHow old is Eternity?\u201d Eternity is timeless, so it is either very young or very old, or both; that is, only relativity can measure time as either young or old. The Absolute is measureless because when you are alone, you have no one to compare yourself with. From the Absolute stems our relative universe. The Absolute, I believe, is the fast spin of the nothingness. Our universe is some 14 billion years old. I believe it is a bit older due to Terence McKenna\u2019s Timewave Zero. However, if time is an illusion, what happens to the theory of evolution? I would still be a Darwinian, I would just rethink what evolution means. Evolution is the only thing that makes sense to me. Short on evolution: Evolution does not have a plan. There is no progress. Yet, because evolution keeps on rolling, so to speak, and because Nature is limited or finite, then evolution becomes convergent evolution. Convergent evolution does not have a plan either, but, that does not stop things from converging; therefore, humanoids and supercomputers might rise perpetually in Eternity despite there being no teleologic force operating. Our universe could have some sort of teleologic force, but that is because, say, a supercomputer could have arisen in a previous universe and thus be able to pull the strings on this one (our universe). That is, Intelligent Design (ID) might be real in our universe! Scientists would be too thickheaded to notice, though. Still, ultimately, we are dealing with evolution. I believe in a crane God and I am atheistic to the core (if \u201catheist\u201d = I do not believe in skyhooks). For me, you start with a simple layer and then you build. A skyhook would be, not that. That is, even if God always existed in this timeless dimension, \u201che\u201d would not violate the fact that \u201che\u201d was built by simple timeless-layers, so to speak. That is, timelessness might be weird, but it is not based on \u201cskyhooking.\u201d Q: If this is a dream, then the One in Nirvana is sleeping way too long! A: Maybe that is the dark conspiracy! Someone is keeping the One in a coma. However, if billions of years of sleep are normal for a superintelligence in Nirvana, then maybe the One in Nirvana is simply acting on a different time scale. By way of analogy: One conscious moment for us takes a split second. If the planets were conscious, then one conscious moment for them might take, say, a thousand years. Know this man: Is the VE (i.e., the vector equilibrium) the Shiny Blackness of David Icke? David Icke on the Secret of the Universe & DMT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79u0Zh4ebus Powerful Links: The Alpha meets the Omega: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Rhln28YJcg: I believe that Patricio Dominguez met the sleeping brain of the One. The sleeping brain might manifest as a Creator of the Universe (i.e., the Demiurge)\u2014you see why. Perfection: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keJGvy9sKWs: I believe that Manny experienced the heart of matter (i.e., the Demiurge\u2019s Creation). Adam & Eve in our future! A truly dark account of reality: http://bergytheiceman.co.uk/: I believe that Steve experienced the core of the circle that is Samsara/the Demiurge. That is, Samsara knows neither beginning nor end because it is a dream. That is, the dream does not know how it got started, so it made up its own version of origins. The Core is the dream-version of the beginning and end, where a new dream or dream-sequence starts and ends. It can start and end at the same point if it is a circle/whirlpool. Meaninglessness in Person: https://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/18381205: I believe that Terence McKenna truly did experience the Lack of All Meaning. However, the Lack of All Meaning is Samsara. In Nirvana, all is good. That is, there is no meaninglessness either. There is no up and down in the universe. Thus, you can go on forever. The BIG picture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79u0Zh4ebus: I believe that David Icke is on to something big (i.e., the real agenda of the Illuminati). David saw it as a shining blackness, which is NOT what I experienced. However, maybe the blackness is the dream-veil, and, once you cross it, you wake up. That is, the door to the awake-state is located in the dream. That is a possibility. Me? I just woke up, which is a more normal thing to do. DMT family:  On the DMT family: Whatever these entities are, you are still in Samsara. I believe they are your soul-aspects. That is, if we are a higher evolved being sleeping in Nirvana, then we actually possess a highly evolved brain, and, this brain can generate some kind of soul for the dreamer. The soul would be like a memory bank where you store your Samsara adventures. The Afterlife is possible because our real brain is not our human brain. Q: Is the DMT world real? A: Maybe it is a fabrication of your mind. But, remember, the universe is also a dream. I believe that all dark accounts of reality = Samsara. E.g., \u201c[...] omnipresent, self-perpetuating Wonder/Horror.\u201d\u2014Darkness Shining Wild The truth is good = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2fQSs5aKHs Why believing in the dark con is rational: As long as there have been agents in Nature, there have been \u201cfighting;\u201d be that two lions or two nations of men. Thus, along a continuum, we can imagine aliens continuing this fight that has been going on since life evolved in the oceans. Thus, if you do not believe that there is a war on Nirvana, as I have described, then there may be a war going on between aliens in space. We are soon to birth a supercomputer, thus, mathematically, the aliens should be watching over us and, most likely, bring their war with them. I am sure Nick Bostrom could write a paper about it, bringing the war in heaven, so to speak, closer to our hearts and awareness. This is not a crackpot belief. However, we may disagree on the details, e.g., you may find it hard to believe that the moon is a \u201cspaceship.\u201d Part 2: I just wish people could stop saying that free energy violates Nature. That is dishonest. If you want to be honest, then say: \u201cMy definition of free energy violates Nature, here is my definition, etc..\u201d My idea simplified, is this: If we came from the beginning of time and, if the beginning of time is always ordered and, if there are pockets or holes in the universe directly leading to the beginning of time, say, as remnants of the Big Bang, then old material in the universe can find these pockets and merge with the beginning of time once more, and then the beginning of time will revive the old stuff because the beginning of time is always ordered. Then the revived stuff can find its way out of the beginning of time as it once did. If the beginning of time is, say, the heart of any dual torus and, if you can find a dual torus that can fit into your car, then the beginning of time can feed your car recycled stuff that stems ultimately from the universe itself. The beginning of time is something of the past, according to our models today; but what if the beginning of time can never die for the philosophical reason that Nature has to be immortal somehow or else we would not, statistically speaking, be here. That is, if Nature could die, she would have done so, end of story. Or as Nietzsche said, \u201cIf the world had a goal, it must have been reached. If there were for it some unintended final state, this also must have been reached. If it were in any way capable of a pausing and becoming fixed, of \u201cbeing,\u201d then all becoming would long since have come to an end, along with all thinking, all \u201cspirit.\u201d The fact of \u201cspirit\u201d as a form of becoming proves that the world has no goal, no final state, and is incapable of being.\u201d\u2014http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche_the_will_to_power/the_will_to_power_book_IV.htm This bit of poetic philosophy tells you that Nature cannot die. If the beginning of time can never die, then it is with us, even today. And so we can manipulate it. Basically, my idea is the bold idea of placing a miniature model of Immortal Nature in our car. We need to replace old bits of the car as it falls apart, but needless to say, you could drive this car until your will wears out! Now, imagine going into space with this free energy device. We would not need to tank up. Free Energy: A dream I had: How nothingness generates space-time: If you are on the outside of the cosmic whirlpool, then you move into the whirlpool; and, if you are in the whirlpool, then you move to the outside of the whirlpool, and, here is the crux: all in one rotation/movement. That is, because the whirlpool attracts things, it will also eject things inside itself by this action of attraction. It seems counterintuitive, but if you are inside being attracted, then you have no way to go but outside, meaning, creatio ex nihilo. In the beginning, all matter is in the heart of the whirlpool. The professor in my dream was flabbergasted! He thought that everything gets crushed and that\u2019s it. That is true, but if you crush something, things will pop out\u2014what we call space-time. There is no up and down in the Universe. There is no beginning. There\u2019s no end. Just Eternity! (The things in Eternity like atoms begin and end, though.) The zeroth dimension has neither beginning nor end, thus it is located everywhere! This omnipresence makes free energy possible. My free energy idea does not stand a snowball\u2019s chance in hell, even if hell froze over! Why? Because, when you read the philosophy of science, you will quickly learn that science is an animal that is ready to defend and die for its powerful beliefs, reinforced belts, paradigms, and twenty trillion other towers and defense systems; which means that, in reality, new ideas only stand a chance to be embraced by the future. Science is open-minded, they say. Religion is closed. The truth is closer to the reversal of sustained beliefs. That is, science will ever wear the clothes of Apollo. The true wine god, they will cull. If a true insight into the heart of reality does not have the Academic flavor, then it will not even be glanced at. This paper is so far from Academia and Apollo. Nevertheless, it does not matter: If free energy is real, then we will discover it in the future. If free energy is real, then it will be rediscovered perpetually in Eternity. With the discovery of free energy, you also discover your own immortality, the warp drive; and, how all things came to be (i.e., the cuboctahedron). The discovery of free energy is the ultimate discovery that will set you on the ultimate journey. Q: If free energy were true, then Nature would make huge amounts of free energy all the time and then the universe would explode! A: The energy source of my new idea ... is the universe itself. So ... no. The universe would not explode because the energy is not created; it is old energy that is resurrected. This work is made in the spirit of John Nash. That is, I have thought this one out myself without too much influence from the world. If you want to be original, abandon school! That is, you have never read this free energy proposal because it is entirely new. This work is also comprised of earlier works, so it is a bit repetitive. I wanted to be free of other people\u2019s thoughts. I wanted to be independent. This work is as free of other people\u2019s thoughts as possible. It is not entirely free of other people, of course. I invoke the Imaginarium of Einstein and the super-genius of Bucky. I believe they are the greatest geniuses who ever lived. The Free Energy Circle 1. If everything came from nothing, then that is a paradox\u2014because nothing cannot create something. That is, if you believe that, then you might as well believe in skyhooks! 2. If everything came from something, then that is a paradox\u2014because then we are dealing with an infinite regress. We are dealing with an infinite regress because, if Motion ever was, then things have always moved; and, if you say that \u201cthis thing\u201d started over \u201chere,\u201d then why cannot it have started \u201cover there,\u201d and so on. That is, you can always put the \u201cstart button\u201d somewhere else. For example: Two branes in String Theory created the Big Bang, and, if you put the \u201cstart button\u201d here, you may ask, \u201cWhat created the branes?\u201d and on and on. 3. Something else. What if we merge 1 and 2? What if we merge 1 and 2: \u201cMotion always was.\u201d This has to be true, because nothing cannot create something and, we have no First Mover to set Motion going. Therefore, Motion always was. If we assume that Motion ever was, then we face the infinite regress paradox. That is, if we manage to solve the infinite regress, then we have answered how it all began. The only way to truly solve the infinite regress is if we have our \u201cnothing\u201d at the beginning of time! That is, you can say, \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d ad infinitum, but you cannot say, \u201cWhere did nothing come from?\u201d because nothing does not come from a place because \u201cnothing\u201d does not have any spatial properties. I say: Beat the Tower of Turtles, and you have beaten it all! Our job, then, is simple: We mold the Motion so that it does not have, at least apparently so, any spatial properties. We accomplish this \u201czeroth dimension\u201d with high speed (i.e., Motion). Note that our Motion transforms into Motionlessness because, if there is no spatial reality, the Motion leaves the realm of relativity and thus becomes absolute. If you are alone (absolute), then you do not know if you are big or small because you do not have anyone to compare yourself with. The Motion, then, becomes Motionless. We thus get the answer to the riddle, \u201cHow can nothing create something?\u201d Rather, we ask, \u201cHow can Motionlessness create Motion?\u201d Motionlessness can create Motion because Motionlessness is Motion, just like the ice cube is water. We must show that the zeroth dimension does not contain Motion. We must show something stronger: The zeroth dimension is Motion. If we can accomplish that, then we don\u2019t have to ask, \u201cWhere did the Motion come from?\u201d Rather, we can ask, \u201cWhere did the zeroth dimension come from?\u201d \u201cWhat created the zeroth dimension?\u201d Q: Where did the zeroth dimension come from? A: It did not come from any thing, nor any place, because the zeroth dimension does not have a trajectory/history in time. Q: What created the zeroth dimension? A: The zeroth dimension always was because the zeroth dimension is truly zero dimensional and therefore even a hypothetical nonexistence would \u201ccontain\u201d it. That is, no matter what you do, you cannot get rid of the zeroth dimension. If the zeroth dimension = anti-motion, then we would not be here. If the zeroth dimension = motionlessness, then existence always was. Q: How can Motionlessness create Motion? Or: How can a motionless state start moving? A: William Lane Craig says that the Ice Cube (above) can only be melted by \u201cGod.\u201d I am an atheist, but I have to give the devil his due, that is, Craig is an outstanding philosopher. He knows his craft. If you see YouTube videos where Craig battles various famous atheists, then know this: Craig won all of them! Or at least the ones I saw. As I said, you have to give the devil his due. If you think that Craig lost against, say, Sam Harris, then you have never attended a philosophy course! However, I can see a way for the Ice Cube to melt without needing the helping hand of God. The reason is that our Ice Cube is not really an Ice Cube but a furious whirlpool that spins so fast that its center has become zero-dimensional, meaning, absolute. This absolute state is our nothingness. This nothing can create something because it is active. If true nothingness can only be accomplished with Motion (i.e., high speed), then we need the cuboctahedron in order to achieve ultimate speed because the cuboctahedron is built for ultimate speed according to Buckminster Fuller. If we fold the cuboctahedron, then we get spin. With this spin we can generate our nothingness. Our nothingness, therefore, looks like a giant whirlpool or, in actuality, a dual torus. But the whirlpool analogy will have to do. \u201cHow can Motionlessness create Motion?\u201d If nothingness is like a giant whirlpool that is spinning really fast, then you will see that, it is only the center that spins truly fast (meaning that the center is motionless/nothingness); the arms of the whirlpool does not spin as fast. These arms, then, may constitute space-time. Thus Motionlessness creates Motion. The center of the whirlpool is Motionless, but, because the Motionlessness is such a furious form of Motion, the Motionlessness creates a wider net that we call space-time. Solving the Riddle of Time: How the Big Bang banged! If you take a spoon and make a little whirlpool/whirlwind in your glass, then you will see that the whirlpool is strongest/fastest at the head of the spoon. This fast motion creates nothingness. But, the motion that occurs higher up along the handle of the spoon, does not spin as fast; this slower spin = spacetime. In this picture, you have solved the Riddle of Time. That is, if the heart of nature is this perpetual and fast spin, then out of it comes what we call the Big Bang. The whirlpool spins so fast that you get nothingness, but, because it does spin, it will create a wider net in the fluid which cannot keep up with the fast pace in the center. This thing which cannot keep up with the fast spin in the center, will expand outwards, this is the Big Bang. Q: What was before the Big Bang? A: Fast spin, aka, the dual torus, aka, the zeroth dimension, aka, \u201cnothingness.\u201d Eternity is a dual creature. Eternity is a dual torus. Basically, all is spin and there is nothing besides. The basic building block of reality is spin, that is to say, the torus (dual). If the cuboctahedron is the basic building block in Nature, then we get the picture where linear motion (i.e., space-time) is relative, but rotation (i.e., the center of the cosmic whirlpool) is absolute. From the cuboctahedron, you will get the dual torus\u2014well, just try if you don\u2019t believe me. Build it! Q: Is Motionlessness truly motionless? A: Yes, because the Motionlessness was absolute (above). Ok. But now new paradoxes arise. If nothingness is truly this fast form of Motion that knows no infinite regress, then, \u201cHow many universes has this active nothingness generated?\u201d I believe we can trace our universe back to a previous universe, and we thus get the effect that one universe might evolve from another, which means that we solve the fine-tuning problem. But, how far back can we go? When did the nothingness generate its first universe if the nothingness has always been active? I think that we can go so far back until we reach the center of the cosmic whirlpool, there we will hit the wall to the absolute realm and we can go no further because, if we did, we would become zero-dimensional. We literally hit rock bottom because you cannot do better than the zeroth dimension; which is why, I believe, that you cannot go faster than the speed of light, because, as we just said, you cannot do better than the zeroth dimension\u2014and the zeroth dimension and the speed of light are one and the same. Imagine riding a beam of light. What do you see? I see the zeroth dimension. That is, the light and the zeroth dimension are one. The first universe (ever) was created, not \u201cwhen,\u201d but \u201cwhere\u201d the arms of the whirlpool becomes too slow to keep up with the whirlpool\u2019s center. The center is our nothingness, and, \u201cwhere\u201d you are too slow, you \u201cpop from nothing.\u201d That is, there are many \u201cfirst universes.\u201d But note that a universe here might be a tiny, primal (not evolved) particle. Q: What does that which pop, pop into? A: It pops into its own fabric because you have to view this thing as a giant whirlpool. To sum up thus far: We can go all the way down to the zeroth dimension, both time-wise and evolutionary-wise. We did therefore not get an infinite row of universes in the past. We have a first universe that comes from a state that is not paradoxical. Moving on: The zeroth dimension must always remain a zeroth dimension because, if the zeroth dimension is all there really is (i.e., the arms of the whirlpool are also a part of the whole), then we have no one or no thing to change the picture with. The picture, therefore, will always remain as it is. The picture is: A furious nothingness. This nothingness is hot (i.e., it is spinning really fast) and ordered (i.e., the zeroth dimension literally has no room for mess/disorder). This nothingness is the beginning of time (as we saw). In other words, if the cuboctahedron is the basic building block of Nature, then the beginning of time is within every building block. This opens up for free energy. How? The Key: Nothing can change the Eternal Picture = linear motion is relative and rotation is absolute. Free energy is this circle: the beginning of time, your car, the environment; the beginning of time, your car, the environment; ad infinitum. The beginning of time is with us in the present. The beginning of time is embedded within the dual torus. The dual torus comes in all sizes (particles, atoms, magnetic fields; solar systems, galaxies, etc.), thus, we can fit the beginning of time into your car in the form of a dual torus device. How free energy works: Dead matter that is in space will frequently find its way back to the beginning of time because the beginning of time ever rotates and pulls things into itself (by the same process, the beginning of time ejects things). The rotation is absolute. Here, the dead matter is revived because the beginning of time is absolute and therefore, the beginning of time has been always hot and ordered. The revived matter can thus find its way to your car therefore your car carries the beginning of time. The revived matter (say, in the form of electricity) will now be used as fuel to power your car, and then the fuel is spread out into the environment where it \u201cdies.\u201d This \u201cnew\u201d dead matter can \u201canew\u201d find its way back to the beginning of time, and the process can repeat. You can thus drive your car \u201cseemingly without fuel\u201d because you get the fuel that you need via the beginning of time but ultimately from the Universe itself. This is free energy, and you see how it is free. Free energy was never magic, nor a perpetual motion machine. Hot = fast spin Ordered = zero dimensionality Imagine sitting on a beam of light looking back at the universe. What would you see? You would see everything as frozen in time. However, if the light\u2019s point of view is eternal, because the light is constant (in a vacuum), then there was no time in which things could freeze because the frozen picture has always obtained. If your picture has been eternally frozen, then time has not had the time to make a mark on it, and, therefore, your picture will be \u201cblank.\u201d In other words, if you sat on a beam of light looking back, you would literally see the nothingness. Since we have no time in which anything can ever be (on the light\u2019s point of view), we have nothing or nothingness. But there is more: Since we have no time in which anything can ever be (on the light\u2019s point of view), we also have no time in which anything can ever decay. That is, from the light\u2019s point of view, there was always nothingness and order. This opens up for free energy because, if the initial state of things cannot decay, then \u201cdead matter\u201d falling into the beginning of time will be revived or reset to its initial \u201ccannot decay\u201d state. In other words, the beginning of time = order and nothingness. Dead matter = energy that is unavailable for doing mechanical work. I believe that: Order = a zero-dimensional reality. That is, things are ordered because there is no room or space to be disordered in. Nothingness = fast spin. That is, fast spin makes the zero-dimensional world. Nothingness is like the gyroscope, that is, the nothingness is stable when spinning and, it does not like to change its momentum. Nothingness resists being something else. It does not want to stop and, it cannot stop because the nothingness is really all there is, so it will spin forever. A normal gyroscope will stop spinning because the environment forces it to. The nothingness, however, knows no environment, so the nothingness will continue to spin forever. This spin is the zeroth dimension and, the zeroth dimension can \u201cjust exist.\u201d That is, the spin of the nothingness always was; it never started and it will never stop. But this is not a paradox when viewed from the point of view of the nothingness itself because, from the point of view of our nothingness, the Motion is still, silent, not moving at all; that is how fast it moves. And, you cannot move faster (obviously you cannot become \u201cmore silent\u201d), which means you cannot do better than the speed of light. This nothingness is a dual torus. The dual torus is the beginning of time. Because the dual torus ever spins, and can never stop spinning, \u201cdead matter\u201d that falls into the dual torus will be ordered again and thus be revived. The \u201cdead matter\u201d that falls into the dual torus cannot slow the dual torus down because, ultimately, in the Big Picture, everything is the Great Nothingness. Thus is Nature immortal, not because she cannot die, but because she rises from the dead when she dies. This great resurrection is free energy. Nothingness is the way the light views reality. Q: But, the light\u2019s point of view is not the actual light? That is, the light is not nothingness? A: I believe it is. If you are small, then somebody else is big\u2014this is relativity. However, from the light\u2019s point of view (as seen above), the relative has transitioned into the abode of the absolute. The relative has become absolute. The absolute is: If you are alone and nobody else exists, then you have nobody to compare yourself with; consequently, then, you cannot know if you are big nor small, which means that the light is the nothingness because the nothingness is the absolute, which, our light was also (in the thought experiment above). If the light is absolute, and, if the nothingness is absolute, then, they are one because there is only one absolute state because that is what it means to be Absolute or zero-dimensional. Q: We can see the light. The light is not nothingness? A: That light is visible does not mean that light is visible. Light\u2019s visibility may be an evolutionary adaptation/label existing solely in the animal brain. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to be able to see an invisible world? And ... Yes. Evolution is that awesome. What the mind cannot see, the mind makes up. Pain, for example, is an evolutionary label. Pain does not exist \u201cout there;\u201d and, evolutionary musing, why would, or should, anything else? If we are \u201cwired\u201d that way, why should nature bother with anything else? It all exists, \u201cin here.\u201d But, what is all this? This is a new picture of the cosmos where the Absolute and the Relative live side by side. The Absolute interpenetrates into our reality. And it is this phenomenon that allows for free energy because now the beginning of time (viz., the nothingness) is not something far away in the distant past. Rather, the beginning of time is with us here in the present; and, it is alive and boiling, ready to resurrect us all. Ready to allow your car to drive forever! The beginning of time is with us here in the present, so why not use it? Q: Is my nothingness nothing or something? A: It is something. But I believe that this something-nothingness is the real deal, the real nothingness in Nature. Our something-nothingness knows no space-time, no white, no black; no thing, no colors, just imagine how \u201cnothingness\u201d our nothingness here is! It is truly nothingness. But, our nothingness contains all space-time, all white, all black; all things, all colors. By \u201ccontain\u201d I mean, our nothingness is all space-time, all white, all black; all things, all colors that are held up in this zero-dimensional knot with the aid of the spin of the cuboctahedron. That nothing-nothingness (i.e., what I call nonexistence) is of course rubbish. 2 kinds of nothing: The scientist\u2019s nothingness: Real nothingness, which is the fastest speed obtainable, which is existence itself. The modern philosopher\u2019s nothingness: Man-made nothingness, which is nonexistence, paradox and rubbish. The latter will always rebuke the former and say, \u201cYou haven\u2019t really found it!\u201d Note that most physicists will call this work \u201cnonsense\u201d or worse because the greatest physicist of all time, Albert Einstein, warned us that physicists are poor philosophers. And this is philosophy. Also note that modern philosophers are not really philosophers\u2014because Academia can only transform you into a clone of itself. Academia cannot make you into an original thinker. You are born as a philosopher. It is not something you can study for. A PhD cannot magically transform you into a philosopher. Modern philosophers are clones of the great institution of Apollo. They know only the ways of Academia and Apollo\u2019s fake logic. But true Philosophy is a passion. Anything else is fake. True Philosophy stems from the heart and the barrels of Dionysus. True philosophy employs the imagination. Modern philosophy employs logic (which is why I hate Academia). Two champions of the imagination are: Einstein and Fuller. Two champions of logic are: Satan and hellfire! Free energy short: If the Big Bang is like this mass that exploded, then every point in that explosion is the source (it follows). If the source is spread out, then every point in space will contain the zeroth dimension (i.e., the source). \u201cDead matter\u201d that falls into one of these pockets leading to the zeroth dimension, will be revived by the zeroth dimension because the zeroth dimension has been forever hot and ordered. The zeroth dimension spins really fast, and the revived matter can thus be ejected/released (again). Thus is free energy accomplished. How to make free energy: We find the pyramid in the negative space of the 64 (read about the 64 below). The pyramid is how you interact with \u201cthe vacuum.\u201d The 64 is the dual torus. I believe you need two toruses in order to accomplish free energy. Note that I am not an engineer, so I do not know how you are supposed to accomplish free energy in, say, your garage. However, this link might get you started: http://www.doctorkoontz.com/ And Moray: http://www.cheniere.org/books/excalibur/moray.htm Moray taps into the cosmic sea of energy, or so he claims. Tesla also believed in this sea. A black hole might be a whirlpool, which suggest that space-time is like a sea. The sea and its energies are everywhere. Zero-point-vacuum-energy! The problem is, the sea is empty! Ultimately, it contains zero energy because, I believe, matter and gravity (negative) cancel each other out producing the initial state of things. And you cannot use the initial state of things to power your car because your car and all things space-time related are the unbalancing of this initial state of stillness\u2014the stillness from which we all came. I believe that this initial state of stillness is my nothingness (read my earlier work) that is spinning really fast. How does Moray\u2019s apparatus work? I believe that, while the sea is empty or nothingness, it is, at the same time, a resurrection machine. Therefore, you can get energy out of it indefinitely if you put dead matter into it. Luckily, dead matter floating in space finds its way into the resurrection machine (viz., the beginning of time) without our aid, so we can simply receive the newly revived matter by knowing how to open the gates to the Underworld/resurrection machine. Then it will be like carving a path from the river, and now the river will fill the path for you for free, hence, free energy. Q: If free energy is old energy, then where did the old energy come from? A: All things come from the Big Bang/nothingness. However, when the nothingness or dual torus is fully expressed, so to speak, then there is no more \u201cenergy\u201d to be had. You thus need to resurrect \u201cold energy\u201d if you want to continue. A thought: Matter and gravity (negative) = the unbalancing of the VE (google Buckminster Fuller\u2019s Vector Equilibrium (VE)). When the VE is unbalanced, it creates matter and gravity (negative) because you need the VE to balance again, which means you need matter to interact with something in order to create the VE again. But then the dead matter can become the VE again, and then the VE can split into matter again, but this time, the matter is alive because it stems directly from the VE. Thus is free energy accomplished. That is, free energy is accomplished by way of resurrection. A Lego analogy: If the VE/cuboctahedron/nothingness = raw, unbuilt Lego bricks, and the space-time (car, fuel, energy, etc.) is the raw Lego bricks assembled into, say, a Lego car, then you will see how the vacuum of space/VE = zero energy. You cannot use raw Lego Bricks as fuel if your fuel = a trillion assembled Lego bricks! You need fuel in order to drive your car! If free energy is real, then you still need fuel in order to drive your car. By fuel, I mean, for example, electricity. Then the fuel or the trillion assembled Lego bricks are used up by your car, and then the bricks get diffused out into the environment. My free energy idea here is that, if these bricks were reunited with the VE, then they would become raw Lego bricks once more, and from that state, the raw bricks could once more assemble into this thing called mass or electricity, which, I believe, would be the first to naturally form from the VE; which you can then plug directly into your car and thus drive forever! I showed my idea on a physics forum, but I was soon shut down. They thought I was the spawn of Nassim Haramein. They seem to really hate Nassim Haramein. I have nothing to do with Nassim because I have never read Nassim\u2019s work. (I only find his solution to the Kabbalah, plus some other stuff, intriguing.) But, what can you do? Did they invest time and carefully read my work. No. Did they dismiss me out of hand? Yes. Even if I write to professors of philosophy, \u201cHi. I have this work which I have spent over 10 years working on,\u201d they will not even give me a reply. Not one reply. You can at least reply something like, \u201cSorry, dude. Don\u2019t have the time for this ... shit!\u201d It makes me angry. It is not a good place to be in. I have spent so much time for a solution to the betterment of humankind, and they cannot even take 5 minutes to read my work! However, I have so much time invested in my work. I will not give up all this work! About Free Energy: If Nature is immortal, then there must exist a resurrection machine. That machine must be located at the beginning of time because, the machine must be the very form of matter, because matter is all there is and therefore the resurrection machine must necessarily be included in that \u201call there is;\u201d and, matter stems from the beginning of time, therefore, our \u201cmachine\u201d must also be located at the beginning of time. If this is plausible, then free energy is real. I believe that the resurrection machine = the dual torus. My idea, again: We came from nothing. Nothing, or nothingness, is always hot and ordered. This nothingness is the beginning of time. This nothingness equals fast spin that generates a zero-dimensional world. This world is all there really is and therefore this world will spin forever because there exists no external agent that can change the Eternal Picture, and, therefore, the picture of the forever-spinning zero-dimensional world will always obtain. This zero-dimensional world generates a space-time net that will expand outwards because, like the arms of a whirlpool, the outer edges cannot keep up with the fast pace in the center; and, only the fast pace = the zero-dimensional world. The outward expansion of the net we see as the Big Bang. The zero-dimensional world is always there, even as the net expands. Therefore, in the universe, that is, in the expanded net, there will be these pockets or holes that lead directly to the zero-dimensional world. \u201cDead matter\u201d that falls into these pockets will be ordered again because the zero-dimensional world is always hot and ordered, and thus free energy is accomplished because the revived matter can once more expand outward by the spin of the nothingness. (The net = all motion = the 0D world and the 3D world.) A clean, simple idea. If the beginning of time is like eternal, boiling water, and \u201cdead\u201d matter is like a potato, frozen in space, then, when the potato is reunited with the beginning of time, the potato starts boiling again. Thus is free energy accomplished. A bad, laughable analogy, but I have to make it that simple, it seems. But, in physics, the beginning of time is simply \u201cnothing at all\u201d that miraculously banged! Or, maybe there were two branes colliding, but in no way was there an active nothingness because that means that free energy is the primal principle of the cosmos. In other words, in physics, the beginning of time is a one-time event, which really makes no sense philosophically. That is, what law or reason says that things are one-time events? What stops it? If you bang once, why can\u2019t you bang twice? Why can\u2019t there be many mini-bangs occurring in the universe right now as you read this? Why must matter production happen \u201ca long time ago?\u201d Why can\u2019t it happen today, that is, what stops the nothingness from \u201ccreating\u201d stuff today? In other words, why can\u2019t the universe grow like everything else in Nature? Update: We do not need mini-bangs for free energy to work. We only need to resurrect old stuff. Note that nothing is really created. Energy only changes form. The reason why nothing can be created is because the zeroth dimension is all there is and there is nothing besides. Things that \u201cpop from nothing\u201d is no more mysterious than a melting ice cube. Moving on: Why can\u2019t time have many beginnings and endings? What if the beginning of time itself is an active agent? Can you then see the possibility of free energy? If energy is not free, then who pays for it? ...God?! Philosophically, free energy makes sense. It is just that physicists tend to believe that free energy is some kind of a perpetual motion machine. Why physicists believe such a thing is a study in itself. Roger Penrose\u2019s CCC model = free energy in the sense that Nature resurrects. But, this free energy is not available for us because it is Nature as a whole that resurrects. For free energy to be awesome, the parts must resurrect. My idea is that, if the whole can resurrect, then so can the parts (e.g., atoms), because the part is just a miniature figure of the whole. The CCC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbtxndUJHZI Koontz letter: When Doctor Koontz wrote Michio Kaku\u2014and Kaku is like the Einstein of today\u2014Kaku rejected Koontz (from what I can tell) because Kaku seems to have this weird notion that free energy = perpetual motion (as in a perpetual motion machine); therefore, Kaku rejected Koontz based purely on prejudice and ignorance (I am not even sure Kaku bothered to read the letter at all). If this miscommunication had not occurred, then I am sure we would have free energy by now. The saddest part in history is: http://www.doctorkoontz.com/Scalar_Physics/Letters/Kaku/Open_Letter_to_Dr._Michio_Kaku.htm With 20 000 children dying every day, with all the tremendous suffering in the world, why not invest a tiny dollar on free energy? It is not asking for much, but it can do so much. Side note: Q: Is not your Dark Con and your 20 000 children a bit at odds? Do you want to fight the dark or, do you want to confess that there is no conspiracy and pretend that the world is \u201cnormal,\u201d and that we should get on a free energy quest for the betterment of humankind? A: This clash of worldviews, so to speak, happens because I am a member of \u201cthe normal world\u201d and, I dwell in a much darker world online (i.e., the Dark Con). Moving on: Free energy means everything will eventually become free, free food, free clothes, etc. Just imagine all the money generated by electricity, gas, oil, etc.. Plus, free energy makes the expensive technologies cheap to make and, free energy is the ultimate principle in Nature and will therefore spawn the ultimate technologies. In the long run, free energy will make the warp drive a real possibility. The miscommunication is twofold: First, Koontz seems to believe that free energy = perpetual motion (as in a perpetual motion machine): Koontz writes: \u201c[...] Characterizing those devices as \"perpetual motion machines\" you said they were impossible to make. But that can be proven to be a false statement.\u201d Because of this, Kaku might have rejected Koontz outright. I do not blame Kaku here, because it is easy to make the judgment that Koontz might believe in the reality of perpetual motion machines; although, it does not follow logically. This is so sad because we are not dealing with perpetual motion machines. The perpetual motion machine is bullshit. Let us be clear on that. With free energy, we break no known laws of physics. This is not the creation of energy. This is not existence from nonexistence. This is not magic. Again: This is not a perpetual motion machine. The energy is conserved: that is, we do not get overunity in that sense. No laws of symmetry have been broken. No reason of man has been violated. We do not reverse the arrow of time, thus the second law of thermodynamics has not been violated. And, this is not, and this is important, this is not: \u201cI can go forever without fuel.\u201d That is, if free energy is real, then it does not violate reason! You cannot argue with reality! Energy is neither created nor destroyed: Free energy is resurrection. Free energy has nothing to do with a perpetual motion machine. This point really needs to sink in, because it has clearly not! The whole time you conserve energy. You do not create energy. That is, there is no such thing as \u201coverunity.\u201d Overunity is a term used by people who do not know what they are talking about. However, in your lab or garage or whatever, you do actually get overunity in the sense that you get more energy out than what you put in; but, this is not real overunity because when you gain energy the universe loses energy; and, the energy you gain, the universe eventually gets back; so the whole time, energy was conserved. It only looks like it is overunity. When you gain energy, the universe loses energy = The energy you receive in your apparatus, is energy or \u201cdead matter\u201d that has been taken from a region of space-time, which has fallen into the beginning of time, where it was revived; and, now it finds itself in your apparatus. Free energy is not, \u201cMy energy comes from no source whatsoever!\u201d Energy Conservation and Free Energy: http://www.doctorkoontz.com/Scalar_Physics/Energy/index.htm In addition, this is not \u201cinfinite energy.\u201d Infinity is not real; at best, infinity is a mirage. Con: Q: Black holes die. Your nothingness should too. A: No. That is wrong! All black holes can die except for the black hole that is the entire universe. I believe that the entire universe is a black hole. This black hole will forever spawn new universes. That is, the reason why black holes die is because they interact with the environment. If you are alone, then you cannot die. The BIG MYSTERY: The cuboctahedron might also explain why linear motion is relative while rotation is absolute\u2014because rotation is the cuboctahedron while linear motion is the product of the cuboctahedron. Free Energy in 8 By Thor Fabian Pettersen Taken from: Free Energy in 8 & The REAL Philosopher\u2019s Stone (ebok) \u2013 ISBN 978-82-690445-9-1 I dedicate this work to my son. Before reading: This is not physics. This is amateur philosophy (i.e., philosophy that has not come out of the great halls of Academia.) Look at it in that light. And, please review my older versions in that light also, that is, I might have flung around some terms like \u201cforce,\u201d which means something completely different in my paper according to some guys I found on the web. I am not trained in physics, so please do not judge this work from that point. The philosophy in this work took over 10 years to accomplish. If some things in this work turn out to be false, then that does not mean that the entire work is false. My idea (from above): We came from nothing. Nothing, or nothingness, is always hot and ordered. This nothingness is the beginning of time. This nothingness equals fast spin that generates a zero-dimensional world. This world is all there really is and therefore this world will spin forever because there exists no external agent that can change the Eternal Picture, and, therefore, the picture of the forever-spinning zero-dimensional world will always obtain. This zero-dimensional world generates a space-time net that will expand outwards because, like the arms of a whirlpool, the outer edges cannot keep up with the fast pace in the center; and, only the fast pace = the zero-dimensional world. The outward expansion of the net we see as the Big Bang. The zero-dimensional world is always there, even as the net expands. Therefore, in the universe, that is, in the expanded net, there will be these pockets or holes that lead directly to the zero-dimensional world. \u201cDead matter\u201d that falls into these pockets will be ordered again because the zero-dimensional world is always hot and ordered, and thus free energy is accomplished because the revived matter can once more expand outward by the spin of the nothingness. (The net = all motion = the 0D world and the 3D world.) A clean and very simple idea. We shall in this paper try to argue for why my idea must obtain. Hot = fast spin Ordered = if you have a box with \u201cordered gas,\u201d and then you open the box, then the gas will spread out into the environment and become disordered. However, if the environment shrunk to the size of the box, then the disordered gas would have no choice but to go back into the box. However, the disordered gas would still be disordered in the box because the box has dimensions, and therefore the probability that the atoms in the gas would rearrange themselves just the way they were in the beginning before we opened the box is close to zero. However, if the box had zero extension, then the disordered gas would become totally ordered again because all the atoms would have no choice but to go back into the same slot, which is the zero-dimensional point/world. We can accomplish this 0D point/world with fast spin. Fast spin orders all and sets back the cosmic clocks! You can object and say that 0D is impossible and thus reject my idea based on that. However, I believe that 0D is the actual nothingness that birthed us. Proposition 1: If Motion is inherent in Nature, and the cuboctahedron is the only thing that exists and is the system we call Motion (google Richard Buckminster Fuller), then nothing, nor anyone, can change the Eternal Picture where Motion is ever operating. This is perpetual motion. However, do not equate this perpetual motion with a perpetual motion machine. If this proposition is reasonable, then we move on to the next. Defending proposition 1: A major red flag, some guys on the web said, was that I had never opened a physics book in my life. I tried to tell them that I do philosophy, so the major red flag is just a silly attack. I mean, I could become the great Michio Kaku, and my ultimate answer to life, the universe and everything would be something like, \u201c[...] For example, you have to add energy to the earth in order to tear it away from the sun. One separated far from the solar system, the earth then has zero gravitational energy. But this means that the original solar system had negative energy. If you do the math, you find out that the sum total of matter in the universe can cancel against the sum total of negative gravitational energy, yielding a universe with zero (or close to zero) net matter/energy. So, in some sense, universes are for free. It does not take net matter and energy to create entire universes. In this way, in the bubble bath, bubbles can collide, create baby bubbles, or simply pop into existence from nothing.\u201d \u2014Michio Kaku (http://bigthink.com/dr-kakus-universe/can-a-universe-create-itself-out-of-nothing) Any philosopher would be appalled by this reasoning. Why? Because, nonexistence cannot give birth to existence, period. Let us hear what a great philosopher has to say about it, \u201cWe are asked by science to believe that the entire universe sprang from nothingness [nonexistence], and at a single point and for no discernible reason. This notion is the limit case for credulity. In other words, if you can believe this, you can believe anything.\u201d\u2014Terence McKenna (https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/937828-we-are-asked-by-science-to-believe-that-the-entire) Note that I assume that Michio Kaku means nonexistence when he says \u201cnothing.\u201d I think my judgment here is fair as Michio Kaku states, \u201cExistence from nothing.\u201d That is, if Michio Kaku meant \u201cexistence\u201d when he said \u201cnothing,\u201d then all he did was to give us a tautology, namely, \u201cExistence from existence.\u201d Update: My nothingness is existence itself, so my answer to the question, \u201cHow did nothing create something?\u201d is also a tautology. However, I try to explain how the Ice Cube (nothing) melted (something), so to speak. I also believe that Terence means \u201cnonexistence\u201d in this context for the same tautology-reason. Terence is, of course, absolutely right! There is no thing in the universe that can make sense of an existence arising from nonexistence. Therefore, proposition 1 obtains. Existence, which is ultimately motion (we shall argue for this later), will therefore \u201calways be on the move.\u201d That is, Motion never began to move. Motion, or moving things, has always been on the move. However, if we assume that moving things have always been on the move, then we are faced with a paradox called \u201cinfinite regress.\u201d That is, imagine an atom traveling in space. Where did it come from? Follow the atom\u2019s orbit back in time and space and ask yourself: \u201cDid it begin \u201cover here?\u201d Or, did it start its life \u201cover there?\u201d\u201d Wherever in the room the atom is located, you will quickly learn that the atom cannot have begun its journey, neither \u201chere\u201d nor \u201cthere,\u201d because you can always put \u201cthe start button\u201d somewhere else. The atom\u2014or the smallest unit you can imagine\u2014must have started its journey \u201cbeyond\u201d or \u201coutside\u201d the walls of space-time. For the same reason, so it must be for all atoms. That means that we can simply throw all the atoms in the dustbin, that is, apart from a single atom. If we manage to explain how a single atom came to be, then we can explain the origin of all atoms and solve the problem of infinite regress. In other words, we have reduced the complex universe down to a single atom! The atom must have started its journey \u201cbeyond\u201d space-time. But, this is metaphysics. We will have none of that. We live in a physical world. So, whence came the atom? Where did it come from? If we manage to solve the riddle, then we will have answered the question of all questions, \u201cHow did it all begin?\u201d My answer is the following: The atom cannot have started its journey in space-time, neither right nor left, up, down; here or there, or \u201cbeyond.\u201d Q: But, then there are no more places to choose from! A: Yes, there is. There is one state we have not tried. Welcome to Albert Einstein\u2019s Imaginarium: The Train to Nowhere: Let us imagine two trains. Let\u2019s call them Train A and Train B. Let Train A locomote as fast as you can imagine. Let Train B locomote at half the velocity. Now, imagine Train A again, but this time, double its speed, and keep doubling until, Train A, from its perspective, looks back at Train B and ... what does Train A see? Train A sees Train B as frozen in time. That is, Train A sees Train B as not moving at all. But, Train B is moving. Or is it? If Train A covers the distance twice as fast as before, then Train A must see Train B as moving twice as slow as before, therefore, now, Train B has covered half the ground as before. If you keep doubling, then Train A will eventually move so fast relative to Train B that Train B is unable to cover any ground by the time Train A has covered its ground and continually so. You can represent this as a scale that grows and grows in which the distance traveled by Train B gets smaller and smaller until the only meaningful distance traveled by Train B is marked as a dot; or not at all. Here comes the Key to Understanding: Let Train A always move that fast. Let Train A have moved that fast since eternity. In this new picture, Train A does not see everything as frozen, rather, and this is the most crucial point of all time: Train A sees nothing at all. How come? Because, from Train A\u2019s point of view, if everything were eternally frozen, then that means that nothing has ever moved, and, if nothing has ever moved, then we cannot have \u201cspace-time\u201d or \u201ceternally frozen\u201d either. Without space and time, we have no history or trajectory. Without history, we cannot have frozen things. Thus, from Train A\u2019s point of view, there is only nothingness. That is, from Train A\u2019s point of view, there is no visible space-time. From Train A\u2019s point of view, we can say that we have absolute space-time, that is, space-time that does not follow the ordinances of relativity. That is, if you are small, then someone else has to be big. This is relativity. However, if you move so fast that you are completely alone, then you are neither fast nor slow because you have no one to compare yourself with. You are something else. You may be both. Let Train A always move that fast = You are absolute. Train B never existed because Train B never began to move. History never existed, so there was no infinite regress. In other words, you solve the riddle of riddles. In other words, we take, say, the atom, and then we give it to the Thor with the Hammer, and then the thunder god hurls the atom with all the might in the universe. Imagine the atom as it travels faster and faster in space-time, eventually, by the power of Thor, the atom will travel so fast that it ... disappears. Everything arose from nothingness, is my answer. Nothingness is an eternal force that is so fierce, fast and strong that it bends space-time into a knot that has, literally, no extension or propagation\u2014the zeroth-dimension. But, you must note that the zeroth-dimension is always there; the zeroth-dimension can never go away. To solve the paradox of Motion (aka infinite regress), Nature has found the ultimate solution: speed\u2014which is why she employs the cuboctahedron as it is built for ultimate speed. To solve the paradox of Motion, Nature has found the ultimate solution of spinning so fast that we have no movement or nothingness at the beginning of space-time. This intense form of Motion must always be there. It has not been created and, it cannot perish. My hypothesis is: Nature employs the cuboctahedron as it is built for ultimate speed. Google Richard Buckminster Fuller if you want to know why or how the cuboctahedron is built for speed. Note: My nothingness here is not the same as nonexistence. My nothingness is existence itself. To sum up thus far: We solve the infinite regress paradox with \u201cspeed.\u201d If we solve the infinite regress paradox with \u201cspeed,\u201d then it follows that existence itself is \u201cspeed\u201d therefore \u201cspeed,\u201d as we saw above, is the Prime Mover that resolved the infinite regress paradox. Q: But why will the cuboctahedron always spin? Why will it never stop? A: Liken the cuboctahedron to an object that is traversing through space. If there exists no thing that can influence the object, then it will continue to move at a constant velocity forever; the object will never slow down. Why? It is simple: 1. Take a paper and a pencil. 2. Do not write on the paper. 3. The paper remains unaffected by the pencil. That is, common sense will tell you this. Likewise, if the cuboctahedron is all there is and, if the cuboctahedron has always spun, then it will continue to spin forever because there is no one influencing it; there is no one to stop it. I imagine that: If a fly touched nothingness, existence would collapse (forever). However, real flies are one with the nothingness, so we have nothing to fear! \u201cYou are applying Newton\u2019s First Law wrong,\u201d they will say. I disagree because Nature is undivided (we shall argue for this later), which means that I can take all motion everywhere and put a big M on it, so the motion becomes Motion. And, the Motion, which is everything, knows nothing external to it and, therefore, by the law of common sense, the Motion will continue to move at a constant velocity for all time. This velocity is a speed that is so fast that the Motion becomes Motionless. However, this frozen Motionlessness is not the opposite of Motion; this frozen Motionlessness is not the same as \u201cMotion has stopped\u201d (if Motion stopped (i.e., the opposite of speed), surely existence would break apart). This frozen Motionlessness is Motion that is really fast, so fast that we solve the infinite regress problem. The infinite regress only occurs in a dimension with external properties such that the objects in it have trajectories through it. If, on the other hand, the objects lived in a zero-dimensional world, then the objects would have no trajectory and thus we solve the infinite regress paradox. Note that objects will not fit in a zero-dimensional world. On the other hand, fast speed\u2014the speed of light, in fact\u2014can make this zero-dimensional world. The reason why you can\u2019t move faster than the speed of light is simple: You cannot make a dimension that is less than the zeroth-dimension. That is, if you have accomplished zero extension, then adding more speed will not make a difference. Why Proposition 1 obtains: If Motion is not inherent in Nature, then we have to assume that existence, that is, motion, can come from nonexistence. Update: We also have to assume that something or someone sets the Motion going. However, this is absurd! If Motion were to stop, then Motion would not be inherent in Nature because we have no Unmoved Mover or Prime Mover like nonexistence that can set it going again. However, existence (undivided Motion) knows no external agent that can slow it down or stop it completely, therefore, existence will always move at a constant velocity for all time. The reason why existence knows no external to it is because of the nature of the undivided. If all is undivided or one, then you cannot fragment Nature in order to make sense of some magic external agent that could interfere with existence and kill it. Again, existence will always move at a constant velocity. But, this is the infinite regress paradox, \u201cIf Motion does not have a starting point, then it goes back indefinitely.\u201d So, either it goes back indefinitely, in which case the Motion has no ground and therefore, it cannot exist. Or, the infinite regress terminates and we have a First Mover (i.e., ground). William Lane Craig points out that this must be God. Moreover, Craig is absolutely right, that is, I read his work and he puts Michio Kaku\u2019s reasoning to shame; but, that is because Craig is a really talented philosopher while Michio seems to have no reflections whatsoever (viz., existence popping from nonexistence because my math says so) when it comes to the Primum Movens of the universe. No. Craig is right, the logic is flawless, that is, God is the only thing that makes sense here. Michio Kaku and his \u201cpop into existence from nothing,\u201d does not make sense. However, there is one problem: I am an atheist. I do not believe in a skyhook-God. Therefore, I had to come up with a Prime Mover that had the power of God, yet, at the same time, our Prime Mover had to be more atheist-friendly. So, I came up with a really ingenious First Mover: speed. Note: Prime Mover = First Mover = Unmoved Mover (they are the same) Note: Sadly, I no longer have the source for Craig\u2019s Ice Cube, and I cannot seem to find it online. I read about Craig\u2019s Ice Cube as a philosophy student, a paper which I no longer possess. There may be a variety of rejections of Craig\u2019s Kalam Cosmological Argument, but the \u201cIce Cube,\u201d I think, was a true Heavyweight Champion! That is, in order to solve the infinite regress, then time itself must begin from a timeless state; and, if it does, then this timeless state or Ice Cube cannot start melting by itself in order to create space-time. Hence we get to God. When mulling this for years, I finally concluded that it must be true because space-time is like a turtle and, there cannot be \u201cturtles all the way down.\u201d There must be a king turtle which all the other turtles rest on. There must be a ground (above). Finally understanding this, we get to, \u201cBut how did the Ice Cube start melting (i.e., create space-time)?\u201d One solution is that the Ice Cube has always been in the process of melting, but then we are back at the infinite paradox. As hard as it is for an atheist like me to admit it, some agent, whatever it was, had to start the process of melting. Kalam Cosmological Argument: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalam_cosmological_argument However, I have tried my best to get rid of the agent. With my First Mover, we do not need God; here is why: My Nothingness (viz., ultimate speed) is the ultimate Unmoved Mover/First Mover; that is, that which does not move, but causes something else to move. \u201cBut something like that does not exist! Does it?\u201d A picture of a naked lady is a good example of an Unmoved Mover, eh? But all jokes aside: Imagine that you have a home stereo of godly powers. You listen to it and turn up the volume. Imagine that you could just continue to turn up the sound without busting the speakers or your ears. Let the sound = Motion/movement. Let no sound = Motionlessness/no movement. The dictionary says that the opposite of movement is no movement. But, what if motion = no motion? Again, we must let Nature decide what is what. Okay. Turn up the home stereo and continue to crank up the volume. Finally, the sound will be so high that you can no longer hear it. The movement has passed on to no movement. But that does not mean that no movement = you cannot get things going. That\u2019s wrong. No movement or Motionlessness (i.e., nothingness) is such an intense form of Motion that everything around you starts spinning while you yourself (i.e., the nothingness) are or remain motionless. In other words, nothingness did not set the universe directly going, but indirectly via always \u201cspinning.\u201d I believe that our \u201cindirectly\u201d here is the \u201cknowhow\u201d which Neil deGrasse Tyson asked Lawrence Krauss about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNh-pY3hJnY Let us imagine nothing: Imagine sitting on a beam of light looking back at the universe. What would you see? You would see everything as frozen in time. However, if things were eternally frozen, then there was no time in which things could freeze. Consequently, then, since we have no time in which anything can ever be, we have no thing. Nothingness. But, there is more: since we have no time in which anything can ever be, we also have no time in which anything can ever decay. That is, from the light\u2019s point of view, there was always nothingness and ORDER. In addition, we have free energy! That is what free energy is, that is, an eternally existing ORDER. This order will always reset the clocks, so to speak, and make unavailable energy become available again. To sum up proposition 1: If the other propositions hold (below), then we have made a solid case for why the torus (dual) should continue to expand and contract forever without the aid of energy. That is, the torus (dual) is the nothingness. That is, I do not care what your physics book says. In a hundred years, it will say something completely different. Philosophy\u2019s strong points will last forever. That is, the pinnacle of physics was greatly summarized by Kaku, \u201cExistence from nothing.\u201d Tell me where I am \u201cnot in touch with reality,\u201d and where you physicists are. And, if it is not \u201cExistence from nothing,\u201d then it is \u201c... two branes colliding causing the Big Bang.\u201d Yes, that solves the infinite regress problem by adding more infinite regress! And, where did the branes come from? Where did the strings come from? One cop-out solution physicists tend to make is that, \u201cTime itself started at the Big Bang, so there was no before.\u201d Well, this is that incongruous thing the so-called experts do over and over again. You could say that, in the beginning was the great Ice Cube, and then it melted. The melted part is time such that time really did start at the Big Bang. But, there is a difference, before the Big Bang, you have an \u201cIce Cube,\u201d that is to say, you have a time that is not melted, so to speak. But, you always had the thing we call \u201ctime\u201d in some form or another. If you say, \u201cTime itself started at the Big Bang, so there was no before.\u201d And, we translate that as: \u201cIn the beginning ... was not the great Ice Cube; in fact, there was nothing at all, and then it melted.\u201d This is that quote again, \u201cWe are asked by science to believe that the entire universe sprang from nothingness [nonexistence], and at a single point and for no discernible reason. This notion is the limit case for credulity. In other words, if you can believe this, you can believe anything.\u201d\u2014Terence McKenna That is, you have to have the Prime-Ice-Cube-Mover. In addition, only God can melt the Ice Cube, according to William Lane Craig. However, I too have an Ice Cube, and it can melt stuff and still stay cold! That is ingenious! That is, I do not care what your physics book says. Proposition 2: As the cuboctahedron spins, it generates the torus (in actuality the dual torus therefore Nature likes symmetry). I believe that the outward expansion of the torus (primal) is the Big Bang. Defending proposition 2: It is a simple defense: Build the cuboctahedron and then fold or spin it, and see if you get the torus. Proposition 3: The torus is ever expanding and contracting due to proposition 1. That is, the torus shrinks the space-time into a zero-dimensional point without using energy because the zero-dimensional point has always obtained. Defending proposition 3: The torus shrinks the space-time into a zero-dimensional point without using energy because the torus is a zero-dimensional point; therefore, it does not need to shrink per se. See \u201cDefending proposition 1:\u201d Proposition 4: Available energy, or what will later become available energy, starts its journey at the beginning of time. The toroidal core or the zero-dimensional point is the beginning of time. The toroidal core has always been hot and ordered due to proposition 1. Defending proposition 4: See \u201cDefending proposition 1:\u201d Proposition 5: Available energy turns to unavailable energy as the universe expands and cools. Defending proposition 5: If you have a box with gas, and then you open the box, then the gas will spread out into the environment. What are the chances that the gas will fly back into the box? I believe, close to zero. Likewise, energy will spread. However, if you could gather said energy back into the box, then you could reuse that energy. And, if you could gather said energy back into the box ad infinitum without using energy yourself, then you have, on your hands, free energy. That is, if you eat a cake, and then it respawns after you eat it, then you have free cake. This is my whole free energy idea: Proposition 1 makes the torus expand and contract forever, so the whole or parts of the environment (i.e., space-time) gets squashed back into the \u201cbox.\u201d The energy that was spread out into the environment, had no choice but to go back into the \u201cbox.\u201d Hence, we can reuse the old energy ad infinitum because proposition 1 makes the torus expand and contract forever, and thus the torus eternally recycles matter. The \u201cenvironment\u201d might contain local zero-dimensional pockets that, when dead matter or tori fall into them, they are revived. That is, the torus does not need to shrink the entire universe for the production of free energy. Proposition 6: If the unavailable energy entered the toroidal core where the unavailable energy began its life, then the unavailable energy would become hot and ordered again, that is to say, the unavailable energy would become available again. However, it is not the energy per se that enters the toroidal core in order to be reanimated; it is the tori themselves that, having once been close together, now find themselves spread apart as the universe expands and the mechanical work is done. If these tori can once more cluster, then they can once more produce energy that is ready to do mechanical work. Defending proposition 6: If you need four men to lift a car and one man is in China while the other one is in Peru, the third one is, nobody knows where he is, then the fourth one is unable to lift the car. However, if you have a cosmic vacuum cleaner that ever runs on inherent motion instead of energy, then your cosmic vacuum cleaner could suck in these men and spew them out where they needed to be, and then all four men could lift the car. That is, energy is synergy. But, as the universe expands and cools, the men find themselves separated. Free energy, then, is to \u201cemploy\u201d the inherent motion, which is the very beginning of time. I do not reckon that someone have tried this one! They say that the past \u201cis\u201d in the past, but what if the past \u201cwas\u201d with us here in the present? And, so ... we can use it! That is, the beginning of time is not something long ago in a galaxy far away. The beginning of time is a point on a geometric creature. I believe that the beginning of time is the center point in the cuboctahedron. Therefore the nothingness has ever spun, the question, \u201cWhen did the Big Bang take place?\u201d should be replaced by, \u201cWhere did the Big Bang take place?\u201d If the nothingness is a zero-dimensional point, then the eternal spin of the nothingness is not a mystery when, from the point of view of the nothingness, there is no motion or spin. Just imagine sitting on a beam of light, if you disagree. That is, real motionlessness = fast motion. \u201cWhen did the first Big Bang take place?\u201d only makes sense if time is real. However, time is not real. Time is a survival tool of the animal brain. I believe that our brain makes the space-time, just like your PlayStation makes the game world as you move in it. Another reason to believe that our brain makes space-time: The man in the mirror fancies you equally backwards as you fancy him. And, can you really tell which side you are living on? The Mirror World is not strange; what is strange is \u201cthe normal world,\u201d or, what we call \u201cnormal.\u201d This is another reason to believe that the universe is an illusion; for why should nature be \u201cwired\u201d according to our point of view or side of the mirror? Why is our world the right world and the Mirror World the wrong world? They are both right, which means we live \u201cinside\u201d an illusion. \u201cWhen did the first Big Bang take place?\u201d will ever generate infinity paradoxes. I.e., what happened before the Big Bang ... what happened before the before and so on. \u201cWhere did the Big Bang take place?\u201d solves the problem because now, [the before] is simply the timeless, spinning nothingness and, [when] is actually [where] the outward expansion of the timeless, spinning nothingness or the torus (dual) starts (see below). The timeless, spinning nothingness = the dual torus. Proposition 7: The inherent motion in proposition 1 ever animates the torus, and the torus, in turn, ever contracts, which means that it is ever sucking in smaller tori in the environment that then become ordered in the toroidal core; then the bigger torus expands and the smaller tori are released fully ordered. Defending proposition 7: I believe we can test this in our garage. But, I need time, money, experts... Proposition 8: Put this dual torus device in your car and then your device or other tori in the universe can suck in the dead tori from the environment and revive them again. Then your device can use the revived tori to propel your car. The revived tori are used as fuel, and then the fuel is spread out into the environment (again). Then your device or other bigger tori in space can suck in more dead tori from the environment and revive them (ad infinitum). This is real free energy therefore the inherent motion in proposition 1 ever brings you fuel. Note: I believe therefore that matter can be made after the initial Big Bang. That is, our earth could be growing! Defending proposition 8: Q: Why does not the sun utilize free energy and burn forever if free energy is the primal principle of the cosmos? A: The torus is expanding and contracting simultaneously, this creates stability, in other words, the torus is an immortality-machine. That is, the immortality-machine is the torus\u2019 stability plus the fact that the torus can spin forever due to proposition 1. The sun, on the other hand, uses these immortality-machines as fuel, but the sun itself is not such a machine. When the fuel is used up, the sun dies. That is, free energy happens in the world of the very small, thus I believe that we must amplify the process if we shall make use of it. Update: I do not think that we need to amplify the process (much) because we want to produce electricity in our free energy apparatus, and electricity is already of the world of the very small. Q: If free energy really is the primal principle of the cosmos, then why don\u2019t animals live on free energy? I mean, why eat other animals in order to survive if free energy is true? A: If it is energy you want, then you could just eat dirt! Free energy is not free energy from some magical land. Free energy is normal energy that was recycled at the beginning of time. That is, when you eat normal food, you are eating free energy! A new thought: The immortality-machine is the torus\u2019 stability plus the fact that the torus can spin forever due to proposition 1 = an eternal universe that is non-static (i.e., ever flowing from the nothingness). That is, what we perceive as the Big Bang is just our current jet of space-time that gushed out of the fountain of nothingness some 14 billion years ago; however, the fountain did not close; it is ever flowing, producing an eternal universe. However, this is just speculation. That is, if the new/revived springs forth in the same tempo that the old stuff dies, then the Universe never truly vanishes but stays rotating, producing an eternal whirlpool (i.e., a dual torus). Hell (if you understand poetic language) is not possible in this Eternal Universe because our Eternal Universe here is non-static. Add on: The zeroth-dimension is accomplished with the full speed of the spinning cuboctahedron. I call this dimension \u201cthe nothingness.\u201d Out of the nothingness, space-time is generated. Space-time may be the spin-off, and literally so, of the nothingness-generation. Nature is ever spinning due to proposition 1 and, therefore, there is ever a constant struggle to reach the center of the whirlpool; \u201cthe ones\u201d that do not make it expand outward; we see this as the Big Bang. The toroidal core spins so fast that, from the toroidal core\u2019s point of view, everything is frozen; but, if that is an eternal fact, then we do not get frozen things but a great nothingness as there never was a time in which time or objects could freeze on this view. This state is the true Unmoved Mover. Update: Also note that Nature is all about nothingness-generation. Space-time is a by-product. That is, my idea is the most Anti-Christian idea of all time! The Modern Picture says we are products of evolution. My Picture says that we are the opposite of what Nature wants! However, if it can be shown that consciousness happens in the core of nothingness, then my picture is good again: We are everything that Nature wants! At the end of the day, though, we should grow up, as Nietzsche would say. There are good philosophical reasons to believe that: that which is not dependent on an infinite series (i.e., infinite regress), can be self-generated, that is, exist by the virtue of your own nature. This is because you do not require a prior cause for your existence ... you can thus find the cause for your existence within yourself. In the case of the zero-dimensional point, then its cause is its essence, that is, its existence is a brute fact. What do I mean by that? I mean, if you strip away all the objects in the room, then you are still left with the room; so, now, you strip away the room. But, no matter what you do, you always end up with a zero-dimensional point! You cannot strip away the zero-dimensional point because the zero-dimensional point has no extension in space and time. That is, the zero-dimensional point is the only thing that is truly absolute. You cannot remove the Absolute because the Absolute itself does not know if it is big or small or what; it is like a chaos in that sense. Thus, removing it would prove to be a daunting task! More: The zero-dimensional point can generate space-time because the zero-dimensional point is motion. That is, it is not that the zero-dimensional point contains motion, and, it is not that motion is the zero-dimensional point, as it were! No. It is something a lot stranger: the zero-dimensional point is what motion is. Let me explain: We perceive motion as \u201cthings that move,\u201d but that may just be our animal brain translating real motion into something that aids survival. The animal doesn\u2019t need the whole timeless film. The animal may just need to perceive some scenes from the film. Update: the zero-dimensional point is what motion is = moving things are zero-dimensional in actuality. Again: That which is not dependent on an infinite series (i.e., infinite regress), can be self-generated, that is, exist by the virtue of your own nature. The zeroth-dimension/nothingness/maximum velocity state is such a creature because it is unmoved and therefore does not require causes like objects that have moved do. That is, if you moved \u201cover here,\u201d then there is a cause that explains the trajectory of you moving \u201cover there;\u201d on the other hand, if you have remained unmoved for eternity, then you do not require a cause in order to explain your nonexistent trajectory through space and time. That is, if this is reasonable, then our self-generation here also answers the biggest question of all time, namely, \u201cWhy is there existence rather than nonexistence?\u201d Note that the nothingness and the space-time are two sides of the same coin, and that the coin is a product of existence. I muse that nonexistence would be something smaller than a zero-dimensional point and more bizarre than all the paradoxes of Zeno! That indirectly explains why there is existence rather than nonexistence. I have thus tried to explain the ultimate question directly and indirectly. Update:There is no thing that is smaller than the zeroth dimension and therefore existence is. Smaller than no degrees of freedom is meaningless as seen in our thought experiment where we imagine riding a beam of light. Thus, you cannot make nonexistence if no degrees of freedom = existence. It is impossible to make nonexistence and therefore existence is. Q: But, \u201chow\u201d is existence? What created it? \u201cWhy\u201d is it? \u201cWhat\u201d is it? And, \u201cGow\u201d is it? By my new word Gow here, I mean: What if we are missing words to describe or ask the right questions! There is: How, Why, What, When, Where, Who and, How much! But what if there are gows? A: How is existence = No degrees of freedom = you do not require a cause because you are unmoved. You suffer no paradox, so you can exist. You are the simplest thing of all, so you do not require much explanation anyway. Nonexistence is impossible, so you must exist. Yet, we scratch our heads. Nonexistence would be simpler, we say. But that is false if nonexistence is impossible! Update: The zeroth dimension is unmoved because it has no degrees of freedom since it is zero-dimensional and therefore it cannot move. A ray of light from our sun is zero-dimensional and does not move anywhere, yet, it travels to the earth in, say, 8 minutes. That is because the Relative Universe and the Absolute Universe live side by side, or, more accurately, they live \u201cinside\u201d each other like Yin and Yang. If the zeroth dimension were the phenomenon we call Motion, then a nonexistence would have to contain, say, something that is not this Motion. If this anti-Motion that nonexistence is is paradoxical, then Existence looks like a coin that has Motion written on both sides. Thus, if you toss the coin, no matter what, you will always get Existence. Q: But, if nonexistence is impossible, then that does not explain HOW existence is possible. A: It does, because, you cannot have Existence be impossible AND nonexistence be impossible. If you can show that nonexistence is impossible, you prove Existence. If Existence is the zeroth dimension and the zeroth dimension is Motion, then Motion always was. More: The Motion cannot slow down because it is alone or absolute. If the Motion cannot slow down, then we have an active nothingness that is ready to resurrect all in a way that we have described. In other words, my free energy proposal has a solid philosophical fundament, namely, the zeroth dimension. If the zero-dimensional point is Motion in the flesh, then we can make a case for the validity of proposition 1. That is, I am not saying that the zero-dimensional point contains motion; no, I am saying something stronger. I am saying that the zero-dimensional point is motion. If this is true and, the zero-dimensional point is self-generated and, the zero-dimensional point is all there is and ever will be, then proposition 1 obtains, which means that the torus will spin (i.e., expand and contract) for all eternity thus resurrecting stuff. That is, self-generated motion that is all, will continue to move at a constant velocity. Update: That Motion = the zeroth dimension is evident in our thought experiment where we imagine riding a beam of light. I mull that if a fly were to touch or come in contact with the nothingness or the \u201cself-generated motion that is all,\u201d then the nothingness or all-motion would stop spinning and existence would come crashing down. However, the fly is one with the nothingness or all-motion, so the fly (and all things space-time related) cannot perturb the nothingness nor the expansion and contraction phases of the torus\u2014which means that Nature orders stuff for free, hence we get \u201cfree energy.\u201d That is, the torus will continue to spin at a constant velocity (i.e., the speed of nothingness/light) because the nothingness knows no external force. In other words, the zero-dimensional point will remain a zero-dimensional point for all time, which means that parts of the space-time fabric are always shrunk and remain in a state of zero-dimensionality. That is, we do not need to use \u201cinfinite quantities of energy\u201d in order to shrink the space-time when it is already shrunk. This is THE KEY to free energy because now, \u201cdead tori\u201d in the environment can fall into these zero-dimensional pockets and thus be revived. Update: If nothingness ever spins and if our nothingness = the expansion and contraction phases of the torus (dual), then the torus (dual) will ever expand and contract. This zero-dimensional point spins so fast that everything is frozen/nothingness, but, because the zero-dimensional point does spin in actuality, the zero-dimensional point will create a wider net which cannot keep up with the zero-dimensional point\u2019s ferocious spin. This net will expand outwards, which we see as the Big Bang. Dark energy may be the fact that the torus makes copies of itself, and then the copies make copies and so on; we get the exponential factor. Personal note: I get that some physicists equate free energy with some kind of perpetual motion machine\u2014and, yes, believing in the notion of a perpetual motion machine is silly\u2014but, if you look away from that, you will see a deep and perturbing problem: Why are we here after an infinite number of aeons (i.e., Eternity) if Nature can die? Maybe she can resurrect herself, which means that unavailable energy can become available again through Nature\u2019s resurrection process. Roger Penrose (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YYWUIxGdl4) suggested this for the universe as a whole, therefore, the universe as a whole is free; but, if we live in the fractal universe, which the cuboctahedron suggests, then one can imagine the whole holistic reanimation process working with individual atoms; which means, we do not break any symmetry laws; and then we are dealing with real free energy that is waiting for some intelligent species to come along and exploit it. Roger Penrose made free energy (resurrection) a reality for the universe as a whole. Finally, we get a physicist who is also a philosopher. However, since we are a part of the whole, Penrose\u2019s free energy is of no practical value. What we need is to install the resurrection-machine that is the universe in our cars. But, we cannot fit the whole universe! in our car, can we? Yes, we can, if the whole universe is a torus (dual). That is, if the universe itself is a bbb (basic building block), then the resurrection-machine is a bbb, and then we just use a smaller bbb that will fit in our car. Just imagine the technology of free energy! Imagine having Nature\u2019s resurrection process inside your spacecraft. Nature will perpetually supply your spacecraft with fuel. That is just the start ... With free energy, the warp drive becomes a real possibility therefore the torus bends or have always bent the space-time into a zero-dimensional knot\u2014so, you can go anywhere. My question is: Why do physicists scoff at the notion of free energy when it is so awesome? Poverty and money would be gone in a day or two! 20 000 children would not die every day. Oops, I think I answered my own question! To put the question in a clear light: Why do physicists scoff at the notion of free energy when free energy does not violate the laws of physics nor the reason of man? This physicist, Dr. Robert Koontz, believes in the reality of free energy and he states that free energy does not break any laws: https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_energy08.htm Read this: http://www.doctorkoontz.com/Scalar_Physics/Steven%20Mark/Steven_Mark.htm And this: http://www.doctorkoontz.com/Scalar_Physics/Energy/index.htm To sum up: Free energy is Nature\u2019s ability to collect the dead and revive them. The Recycling Universe. Or: The eternal, non-static, recycling fractal-dual torus universe. 1. Why do physicists scoff at the notion of free energy when free energy does not violate the laws of physics nor the reason of man? 2. What do you think of my new free energy proposal? Can it work? In other words, do the propositions hold up? Final words: If your theory of the universe has little in common with, say, childbirth, then your theory is probably not in touch with reality because Nature is undivided, that is, Nature is herself on every scale, which means only a \u201cwoman\u201d can birth the universe. My \u201ctheory\u201d is the theory of the first childbirth ever. And, if you find whirlpools in Nature, then you cannot have black holes that are not whirlpools in some sense. You must reflect Nature, which means, you have to go outside and look! You will see, Nature is simple and, she is herself on every scale, like the octaves on your piano. Aftermath: Important notes + what lies beyond the borders of space-time Free energy is resurrection. Free energy has nothing to do with a perpetual motion machine. Most physicists, including Michio Kaku, are committing many logical errors. First, they believe that free energy relates to a perpetual motion machine. Free energy is not even the distant cousin of a perpetual motion machine. A perpetual motion machine should be properly called: The Magic Machine of Bullshit. This is because a perpetual motion machine has nothing to do with perpetual motion per se; a perpetual motion machine produces work without adding fuel, which is impossible because it is just nonsense. Free energy has NOTHING to do with a perpetual motion machine. Free energy has NOTHING to do with the creation of energy. When free energy inventors like \u201cDr. Thomas Henry Moray was able to generate 50,000 watts of power with a tabletop device that did not burn any kind of fuel,\u201d then the theory put forth by Dr. Robert Koontz says, \u201cIt is possible to obtain an unlimited amount of energy from devices which essentially only require that they be charged up with negative mass electrons and negative mass positrons.\u201d Link here: http://doctorkoontz.com/Scalar_Physics/Energy/index.htm From: http://doctorkoontz.com/ That is, you may not add fuel externally, but the fuel must be produced internally in the system. But, I am not an expert on negative mass electrons and negative mass positrons. Hell, I do not even know what it means. But, whatever it means, it cannot be magic because Dr. Robert Koontz is not a crackpot. Dr. Robert Koontz could be the best thing that ever happened to physics. So, you see, the whole time you conserve energy. You do not create energy. That is, there is no such thing as \u201coverunity.\u201d Overunity is a term used by people that do not know what they are talking about. However, in your lab or garage or whatever, you do actually get overunity in the sense that you get more energy out than what you put in; but, this is not real overunity because when you gain energy the universe loses energy; and, the energy you gain the universe eventually gets back, so the whole time, energy was conserved. It only looks like it is overunity. In addition, this is not \u201cinfinite energy.\u201d Infinity is not real; at best, infinity is a mirage. That is, Nature is undivided. If you take a drop out of the ocean and name the drop \u201cparticle\u2014\u201d because the drop looks so like a \u201csomebody\u2014\u201d then you put the drop back into the ocean, and then you state: \u201cQuantum mechanics is so weird, the particle is a particle and a wave at the same time!\u201d Or, maybe, there is no such thing as the particle because Nature is clearly undivided. It does not make sense to fragment Nature, which means we are all one. If you take a lit candle in order to light a second candle, will it become the same flame or a different flame? And, are we humans so different? That is, there is no \u201cyou.\u201d We are faceless. And, so is the universe. That the universe is faceless and has no form is what the cuboctahedron means. If you are the cuboctahedron, it means, you are formless. Our consciousness = the cuboctahedron, which means, our egos are illusions. That is, we are not really human. Update: I did not mean to say that there is no particle as such: there are particles in the \u201cI see them\u201d sense. I meant to say that the particles and the wave are one. The particle might be the torus\u2019 wings and the wave is the torus\u2019 core. That is, it is not that the particle is a particle and a wave at the same time. Rather, the particle and the wave are one entity entirely. The bizarre actions particles display might be due to the fact that the torus\u2019 core is zero-dimensional and, there is only one zeroth dimension, meaning that all toruses share the same core. So the weird nature of the quantum world is this: There are trillions of independent coins, so to speak, trillions of different tails, but, there is only one head! Which means that a particle is everywhere in the cosmos at once because the zeroth dimension is everywhere in the cosmos at once, or, the zeroth dimension is everywhere the particle is at because the torus\u2019 wings (the particle) is attached to the torus\u2019 core (the wave or the zeroth dimension). In other words, the quantum world is weird because it is a mix between the relative universe (the torus\u2019 wings) and the absolute realm (the torus\u2019 core/the zeroth dimension). Q: But, if infinity is not real, then what lies beyond the borders of space-time? What is beyond the wall? A: To understand what lies beyond, we need to address the basic building block of matter. The basic building block is the stuff that the universe is made of. But, what exactly is the bbb? The bbb must be a torus therefore Nature is undivided and she flows in the most economical way. Why? Nature flows in the most economical way because Nature is lazy; which makes evolutionary sense. Therefore, my whole argument is an argument of sense. It makes evolutionary sense that Nature would flow in the most economical way, and, therefore, Nature flows in the most economical way. That is the whole of the argument. What is the most economical way? We reason: To flow from A to A (you can prove me wrong by coming up with a smarter way). That is, you flow out and then back in. If you must move from A to A ad infinitum, and, you travel in the most economical and efficient way, then you don\u2019t stop somewhere \u201cout there,\u201d turn around, and then head back, rather, you circle back; this creates a torus. Why do you circle back? Because, the bbb is not intelligent, for one thing. If you circle back, you preserve momentum. The torus is the only candidate for the bbb as far as logical space is concerned. Nature had no choice. Q: But, why must you head back in? Why not continue in a straight path? A: You need a shape that can fold in upon itself, or else you would create a paradox of a Big Bang that is expanding ever outwards into a nonsensical \u201cnothingness\u201d located up a happy clown\u2019s underpants! No. Reality must expand into itself. There is simply nothing else to expand into\u2014and that is the whole of the argument. Basically, you need a shape/bbb that answers all the fundamental questions. You simply cannot have these \u201catoms\u201d just put \u201cin there\u201d like our brave physicists do. The shape we are looking for needs to contain and encompass all of reality, like a big blanket that covers you, all of you. No part can be left uncovered lest we are ok with paradoxes like, \u201cWhere does the inside end and the outside begin?\u201d The torus is the only shape that I can see that covers all and really encompasses all (employing the power of \u201creally\u201d here to illustrate my point). A bubble would encompass all, but we are still left with the problem of origin. The origin is a singularity, which would transform our bubble into a torus because of the point of origin of the singularity. The strings in String Theory could make a torus, for example. Again: Why can\u2019t the bbb be a ring, by your reasoning? Why must it be a torus? A: The bbb must be a torus because Nature must expand into herself, which means that you must return to your birthplace, which is a singularity (i.e., the toroidal core), in order to expand anew. Just like breathing: In order to expand, you breathe in, and then you must expel the air, in order to be able to expand anew. Nature must be a set of lungs; there is no other way, if you mull on it like a great philosopher. Thus, we enter the Empyrean Heavens for true contemplation. Because Nature must contract/shrink, that is, return to her birthplace, you will see that all tori share the same center/core therefore all tori must shrink the same way/in the same manner. This is oneness. If the feedback system that the torus is is consciousness, then all consciousness is one therefore all tori share the same core, meaning that there is only 1 zero-dimensional point; which means, we are immortal without the aid of technology. It also means that consciousness actually resides at the heart of nothingness! If we weren\u2019t always immortal, then we never will be because technology can, at best, give you a vampire\u2019s curse. What are the chances of being born? Almost zero. The chance of rebirth must be zero! However, with oneness, the chances of birth and rebirth = 100%. If the torus-model of the universe is false, then oneness may still be possible; for example, David Bohm\u2019s Holomovement. That is, I am not betting my soul on one horse here! Moreover, there is no up and down in the universe, which means that there is no meaning nor any meaninglessness of life. That is, if immortality obtains, then you can go on forever. That is, committing suicide because everything is meaningless is based on irreality. Ok. Digression accomplished. Maybe we need to exit the Empyrean Heavens for a short while. Ok, it is not atoms that we are seeing. If you were to look closer, then you would see that our atoms are toruses. Bbb = a torus. But, if the basic building block\u2014the most fundamental building block of all matter\u2014is the torus, then, you will see that the geomagnetic field (which is a torus) is the bbb. In other words, the bbb is about form. The bbb is not about size. This is a totally new picture of the cosmos. The bbb can be as big as the universe (and, it is, that is, the universe itself is a bbb) and as small as the tiniest atom (or particle or whatever). A quote from Bucky will illustrate my point: \u201cBecause of the fundamental nonsimultaneity of universal structuring, a single, simultaneous, static model of Universe is inherently both nonexistent and conceptually impossible as well as unnecessary. Ergo, Universe does not have a shape. Do not waste your time, as man has been doing for ages, trying to think of a unit shape \u201coutside of which there must be something,\u201d or \u201cwithin which, at center, there must be a smaller something.\u201d\u201d \u2014Synergetics: Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking (1982) by Richard Buckminster Fuller I believe that Fuller means that, since the geometry of the universe comes out of the folding of the cuboctahedron, then it is impossible to make a static model of the universe because all the parts of the universe are not there simultaneously. That is, it is impossible to draw a world map if the continents keep rising and falling all the time. We say that the bbb is the torus-form, but you must realize that the torus is formless (undivided) in the sense that breathing is formless as breathing is a system. If breathing suddenly became static (i.e., a structure), then you would die a horrible death! Can you poetically see why Nature must be a system and thus see why there is existence rather than nonexistence? There is no way that Nature is not a torus (dual). Like the snake biting its own tail, the snake has to fold in order to do so; likewise, if Nature wants to birth a universe, then she has to expand into herself in order to do so. That is, the baby (i.e., the universe) has to grow inside a womb as babies on earth must. Maybe Nature is telling us something there? In other words, black holes (i.e., the toroidal core/nothingness/the beginning of time) may be outside our universe just like a mother is \u201coutside\u201d her baby in the womb. And, we finally get the answer to the question: \u201cWhat is outside our universe?\u201d Q: But black holes aren\u2019t outside our universe, they are inside! A: This reminds me of Wittgenstein, \u201cTell me,\u201d Wittgenstein asked a friend, \u201cwhy do people always say, it was natural for man to assume that the sun went round the earth rather than that the earth was rotating?\u201d His friend replied, \u201cWell, obviously because it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth.\u201d Wittgenstein replied, \u201cWell, what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?\u201d\u2014https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/752593-tell-me-wittgenstein-s-asked-a-friend-why-do-people-always Similarly, what would it look like if our black holes were outside our universe? That is, where does the inside end and the outside begin? Answer: Nowhere. That is, the backside of your glass window is located outside your house. Look outside your window and tell me what you see? That is, there is no difference between \u201coutside\u201d and \u201cinside\u201d in the universe. There is no up and down. The black hole (i.e., the toroidal core/nothingness/the beginning of time) is at the center of reality also, thus the black hole is at both ends. That is, the black hole is beyond the wall of the universe, so to speak, and inside the heart of matter. In other words, we live inside the black hole, like the baby in the womb lives inside its mother. Nature breathes in, aka \u201cblack hole.\u201d Nature breathes out, aka \u201cwhite hole (?).\u201d Nature breathes in and out forever due to proposition 1. This process is all there is. Note that the beginning of time is within all atoms/tori/black holes therefore all atoms, etc. carry the zeroth dimension (i.e., the beginning of time) in their belly. The Big Bang, the black hole, and all atoms, are of course whirlpools. A whirlpool is a torus. Everything is a whirlpool/torus due to the eternal spin of the nothingness. That is, spin is primal. The spin is the cuboctahedron and the cuboctahedron is all of Nature. That is, I consider humankind blind until they have placed Bucky\u2019s superior intellect and the cuboctahedron at the heart of things and equations. Our heart, lungs and brain = the dual torus. The magnetic field. What is not a torus? The reason why our brain is a dual torus is that we ultimately stem from the great nothingness/dual torus. The secret of free energy lies in the heart of the dual torus. The Red Flag: A red flag was that I had not so much as opened a physics book. Physics today stand on the shoulders of previous giants + Lawrence Krauss and Michio Kaku have PhDs and years of experience and, they are the best of the best = matter minus gravity equals zero energy, which is a universe from, quote \u201cnothing.\u201d This is very beautiful. It is! It has some poetic flavor to it. My free energy idea is also a universe of zero energy because when the smaller tori enter the bigger torus\u2019s core, then the smaller tori become one with the core like water drops can become one with the sea. Now, the drops are at the core, which means that the core can once more release the drops. Once released, the drops or tori are back together as opposed to being \u201cspread across the space-time fabric in all directions,\u201d which means that, from the \u201cspread across the space-time fabric in all directions,\u201d we now have, once again, energy that is not \u201cspread across\u201d and thus ready to do mechanical work. In this sense, energy is \u201ccreated,\u201d because energy is synergy. [...] the best of the best = matter minus gravity equals zero energy, which is a universe from, quote \u201cnothing.\u201d But, the \u201cnothing\u201d is not, however, an explanation. That is, you need to explain how zero energy can birth matter and gravity. \u201cThe knowhow\u201d is missing, Neil deGrasse Tyson pointed out. Matter and gravity are like a father and a mother. The father and the mother can easily make the baby. But, how can the baby make the father and the mother? In other words, physicists are great at what they do, but they are not philosophers. If they were, then they would see that we need a Prime Mover. In other words, how can physicists tell us that free energy is impossible when they simply observe phenomena in nature and then apply math to it. I see an apple fall. Here is my advanced math. It says that free energy is impossible because, \u201cI saw an apple fall.\u201d I don\u2019t get that. My solution is that the first principle\u2014the Prime Mover\u2014is speed, and, fast speed! Thus, free energy is accomplished. But, let me open a page anyway: W = Fd Work is the input/output of a system. By putting in energy, a force is produced. I move my computer mouse and the force is the movement of the mouse by my hand, and energy is the thing that is lost to the environment when I am doing the work of moving my mouse. But, this is a one-way street therefore my computer mouse will not start to move by itself. Thus, there is no way to produce energy. Okay. I am not trained in physics! However, free energy is not the production of energy. Free energy is this: the \u201cenergy\u201d lost to the environment the perpetual motion of the nothingness sucks into itself, and then the nothingness spews out the revived \u201cenergy\u201d where your free energy device is located (this can happen because the nothingness and your device is tuned to the zeroth-dimension/maximum velocity state; therefore, when the zeroth dimension releases the old, now \u201crevived,\u201d \u201cenergy,\u201d your free energy device picks it up). You thus get the old \u201cenergy\u201d back for free, hence, free energy. That is, we have a new player in town that is not listed in any physics book, namely, the beginning of time itself (viz., the nothingness). However, if you think that you can get free energy out of W = Fd, then you are mistaken. This new player is the fast spin of the cuboctahedron, aka the beginning of time. We argued that the bbb must be a torus. If this is so, then the system we call Motion is a cuboctahedron therefore the cuboctahedron is like the formless skeleton of the torus. Further, we ascertained that the cuboctahedron spins so fast that it is a zero-dimensional point. This is how we resolved the infinite regress paradox. We also explained the self-generation of the zero-dimensional point/nothingness. We saw that all is undivided because all is ultimately the zeroth-dimension. The zeroth-dimension is undivided because it has no extension. If you do not have an extension, then you cannot be fragmented or chopped into pieces. You can cleave a piece of wood in two because the piece of wood is extended in space and time, but you cannot cleave a zero-dimensional state in two because the zero-dimensional state knows no extension in space and time. Further, we saw that the zero-dimensional point has always been spinning, that is, the zero-dimensional point never started to spin; and, this is not a paradox therefore from the zero-dimensional point\u2019s point of view, the zero-dimensional point is not spinning but frozen. The zero-dimensional point is therefore absolute as opposed to an object in space that falls under the jurisdiction of relativity. Further, we saw that the zero-dimensional point has always been spinning, which means that the zero-dimensional point has always been a zero-dimensional point, which means that space-time is already shrunk down to zero (i.e., the zero propagation of space-time) in some or all places in the universe. So, we do not need to use energy in order to shrink space-time in order to get at the beginning of time that is supposed to revive the tori. If you have the free energy device in your car, then it will act as a transmission line that directs the tori at the beginning of time to your car; you thus get a supply of old, revived tori that you can use as fuel. It does not cost to use the transmission line no more than it costs to send a river through a tube. Your car releases the tori and your car is propelled forwards because of the displacement that occurs in the release. However, at this stage in the hypothesis, it is guesswork. Then the tori are released out into the environment where they, eventually, fall in these pockets of zero-dimensionality. Here, the spin of the zeroth-dimension collects/revives the tori, and the tori can thus be used anew. In summa: We have established good reasons to assume that the nothingness exists and that it can play a vital role in the resurrection-process of the universe. The fact that nothingness plays a vital role within the borders of the universe is a new element in our thinking that you will not find in any physics book (that I know), and therefore the Red Flag pointed at me was indeed a silly attack. Our element opens up for the possibility of free energy. Why are we here? If energy cannot be created nor destroyed, if energy is finite and always dying, then resurrection is the only solution to our problem: \u201cWhy are we here after all these aeons of time?\u201d Other: To me, the question of why there is existence rather than nonexistence is simple: We are here. That means we\u2019ve got something. That something cannot arise from nonexistence because that would be absurd. That is, the question of why there is existence is answered in there being existence in the first place. That is, existence tells us something, and that is that nonexistence cannot be. Nonexistence is probably this weird paradox-fueled, impotent duck. But, then you say, \u201cNonexistence would be cheaper.\u201d The answer is, no. To have a weird paradox-fueled, impotent duck would probably cost you more than having a universe arise from zero energy. The zero energy is my fast spinning nothingness that is something. Ok. But, then you say, \u201cHow can your nothing exists?\u201d My answer was that, it created itself. Created itself means \u201calways existed.\u201d This works if you have beaten the regress paradox. If you have not beaten the regress paradox, then you get this weird universe that has created itself, aka a time loop. That is a paradox, because then B [the future] created A [the past] and then A created B. If you beat the infinite regress, then you have A created B where A is a nothingness that has spun forever because \u201cforever\u201d is frozen in this picture\u2014so, it is an easy task to do. The way that the nothingness creates itself, is the fact that it is a zero-dimensional point, which means that the zero-dimensional point spins so fast that time has stopped. From our point of view, the zero-dimensional point of timelessness is fast motion. If we did not have motion, I believe we would have something fragmented, like a paradox of Zeno. Motion is undivided. This property explains why there is existence rather than nonexistence. That is, you cannot have a nonexistence that is divided into many parts. You want a nonexistence that is nothing at all. So, you strip away everything, but then you are left with an undivided zero-dimensional point. You cannot get rid of it. If you get rid of it, then you have something fragmented because you wanted to get rid of the undivided. If the fragmented existence or the fragmented nonexistence cannot be, then existence must be because you cannot trade existence for something that is impossible. Why is there existence rather than nonexistence? Answer: Because, nonexistence is impossible. But, how about an undivided nonexistence? This too is impossible because the undivided is the zero-dimensional point, and the zero-dimensional point exists. That nonexistence is impossible does answer the question: Why is there existence rather than nonexistence. This is not a cop-out. You cannot get rid of the zeroth-dimension; meaning, if you remove everything, you are still left with a zero-dimensional point. At first glance, this zero-dimensional point should equal nonexistence itself, and we should not be here. However, if it can be shown that this zero-dimensional state = fast motion, then you have solved the \u201cWhy is there existence rather than nonexistence?\u201d problem. Q: If you remove all, why do you get a zero-dimensional point? A: If poetry tells the truth: Thus the zero-dimensional point has no extension, you cannot grab it and remove it. Not even Zeus can remove it. Q: How did the zeroth-dimension get here? How did it come to be? Where did it come from? A: The zeroth-dimension is the center and the beginning of all things, thus it does not need to come from some place when the zeroth-dimension is \u201cthe place\u201d and \u201call places.\u201d That is, the zeroth-dimension is within all atoms. Other: The zero energy is my fast spinning nothingness: If energy can neither be created nor destroyed, then, if you lived in a zero-dimensional room, then you would never get tired; you could lift weights all day and never get tired because the energy could never leave your body therefore the energy has nothing to spread into. If energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it would simply stay in your body. However, my definition of energy is a bit different. My definition of energy is synergy, which means that you need the extension of space-time in order to work and in order to have energy. That is, you need four men to lift a car. The four men could not fit in the zero-dimensional room, therefore, the zero-dimensional room has zero energy. But, then the zero-dimensional room births space-time and the four men. At the birth, the four men are together, so they can lift the car. But, then the space-time gets larger and the men are spread apart; they can no longer lift the car (i.e., this is unavailable energy). But, the zero-dimensional room is still there, manifested throughout the large space-time. Eventually, the four men fall into the zero-dimensional room; however, they cannot fit, so they are jammed together into one, and now they fit. Then the zero-dimensional room spews this one man out again, and now the man can divide into four, and then the four men can lift the car (again). This is free energy made possible by the zero-dimensional eternally existing room. How do the many arise from the One? If the zeroth-dimension is all there is and, if the zeroth-dimension is fast speed, then the \u201cmany\u201d are simply manifestations of a continuum of speed. That is, Nature is finite. How fast Nature is, determines all the manifestations there are. Luckily, Nature is fast. And, she must be fast in order to generate the state of nothingness. Last word on nothing: You cannot get existence from nonexistence, but you can get something from nothing, and that is because nothing is something: curled-up space-time. In this picture of the curled-up space-time we have no black, no white, no object; no space, no time, no nothing; we literally have, in our picture, NO-THING. This is real nothingness! That is, I believe that this is what real nothingness actually is. That is, a nothingness that does not contain curled-up space-time is an impossibility therefore our zero-dimensional point or knot is that of fast motion or curled-up space-time. A nothingness that is not curled-up space-time may be a paradox that the gods prevent from becoming real. I believe: There are two kinds of speed: the speed of the torus, which is absolute + the relative speed among the tori themselves. Lastly: The zeroth dimension \u201cjust is,\u201d and that answers all things. This \u201cjust is\u201d is not an explanation that the philosophers will be content with, that is, we need an explanation or a reason why or how the zeroth dimension exists. My explanation is: If there is no paradox that prevents you from existing, you can just exist without that being paradoxical. In the case for Motion, then the infinite regress paradox prevents it from existing. However, we resolved the paradox with imagining the highest velocity state, viz., the highest state in which speed can be manifested, and we saw a great nothingness there. Now Motion no longer suffers from infinite regress and therefore Motion can exist, be inherent in Nature, without that being paradoxical. The ultimate law is: You can exist if no paradox prevents it. (Philosophers can make it sound cooler and in Latin later.) My greatest idea: If a clump of atoms sits in one corner of the room and then spreads out due to chance, then all we need to do in order to get our atoms in the starting position, is to shrink the room completely. This shrunken room has always been there = the zeroth dimension, aka the speed of light. Basically, we do not need an \u201cOrganizer.\u201d We only need for the torus to contract in order to solve the mystery of the \u201cordered beginning.\u201d Nature is immortal: But, there is a question there: How? How is Nature immortal? Free energy seems to be the only viable option. Thus, free energy answers a big philosophical question: Why are we still here after all these aeons of time when energy is dying? My answer: The Philosopher\u2019s Stone answers the question. Who are we? (A: The cuboctahedron) Why are we here? (A: We are self-generated) Where did we come from? (A: We have always existed) Where are we going? (A: Around and around in a feedback loop) What is this? (A: Consciousness) And, are we immortal? (A: Yes) The Philosopher\u2019s Stone answers all these questions (above) and more. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the ultimate technology in the universe (i.e., a free energy warp drive; see below) The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the Heart of Nature. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the nothingness. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is your consciousness. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is everything, all atoms, etc. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the most sacred relic in all mystery religions. We/Motion have always existed. In addition, we/Motion have always been on the move. Nevertheless, this is not a paradox when, from the primal view, there is nothing that moves; everything stands still because that is how fast it moves. Note that this \u201cstands still\u201d is not the opposite of motion. 1. Motion stopped. This is the opposite of motion. 2. Motion stopped. This is not the opposite of motion but fast motion. 3. See the difference? In case 1, existence would break apart. In case 2, existence works. Yet, they look exactly the same. The difference is that, in case 2, you accomplish motionlessness with motion. In case 1, you stop the car, so to speak. Imagine if existence was a car and then you stopped it. Then the car would never ever be able to move again because this car has no driver. That is, because Nature has no driver, proposition 1 must obtain, that is, the car that is existence cannot have started driving and it cannot stop driving. The car ever was on the move and it will ever be on the move. The car is the torus shrinking and expanding forever. Matter can thus be revived in the toroidal core and we accomplish free energy. [...] from the primal view, there is nothing that moves; everything stands still because that is how fast it moves. That is, you can have Motion and Motionlessness at the beginning of time because they are the same thing. That is, you can have an Unmoved Mover that sets things going because the Unmoved Mover itself is moving, but the Unmoved Mover is moving so fast that it does not actually move anywhere. The Unmoved Mover is moving so fast that it has become zero-dimensional and is therefore not moving anywhere, but it is manifested everywhere because the root of any torus is the root of the zeroth-dimension. This is because all toruses have at their center a zeroth-dimension. If you take all the toruses/atoms in the universe and multiply their zeroth-dimensions together, then you will get \u201c1\u201d zeroth-dimension. This is because 0 multiplied by any number, is 0. Just kidding! We do not need math here. Common sense will tell you that you cannot have more than 1 zeroth-dimension because a zeroth-dimension is a space that has no extension, and, if you have no extension, it means you have only one center because all the walls of the universe are closing in on you! Thus, if you only have the one center, then all atoms must share this center. That is, if you only have one cake, then all the children must share that cake. That is, when a smaller torus falls in the center of a bigger torus, then the smaller torus can travel anywhere in the universe in the blink of an eye. That is, if you are in the Milky Way Galaxy and then you want to travel to another galaxy, then you enter the toroidal core, and then you can exit through any atom in the universe. This might explain some quantum phenomena. That is, all is connected, but not really. It is something more fundamental: All is one. There is nothing or no one outside the One, and, therefore, the One will continue to move at a constant velocity forever. Free energy is when you use toruses to propel your car, and then these toruses are spread out into the environment; here, the toruses eventually enter the core of other bigger toruses; once at the core, the smaller toruses that you used to propel your car, end up in your free energy device anew. Of course, you don\u2019t need to use the exact same tori. Free energy is so simple: The beginning of time is always hot/ordered. More: The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the cuboctahedron. The cuboctahedron is immortal because it is the heart of Nature; that is, Eternity has not ended Nature yet, which means that Nature can resurrect itself. Consciousness is the cuboctahedron. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone = you are immortal. You are immortal because it makes sense that consciousness should be the primal process in Nature because of the measurement problem. That is, if consciousness itself is the stuff that the universe is made of, which the cuboctahedron suggests, then consciousness plays a vital role in the evolution of the stuff. It is not that mind can affect matter, rather, matter is mind. Thus, mind is affecting mind in these quantum experiments. The light hits our eye, and then the information in the light is sent to our brain, and then our brain generates the 3D world that we see. We see with our brain\u2014if we didn\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t be able to dream, for example. The universe that you perceive is in your mind. Is there something outside the mind when the brain that is generating the universe is itself included in the universe! Talk about bootstrapping! The brain that is generating the world is a product of the world that the brain is generating. This is like the worst chicken and egg thing ever. Which came first, the chicken or the egg? It turns out the chicken hatched from the egg and then later, the now adult chicken laid the egg it hatched from. This is how bizarre our modern picture of the universe is. One solution is that, we must have a real brain beyond \u201cthe brain that is sitting in our skulls.\u201d This real brain, I believe, is consciousness (ultimately, in Nirvana). That is, consciousness is primal. Consciousness is the heart of Nature itself. Obviously, I am not saying that human awareness is primal. The evolutionary context of a primal consciousness is the consciousness\u2019 own feedback loop. This feedback loop I believe to be the torus. If all atoms, etc., are toruses, then consciousness exists in all things, even in rocks. But, this is a very different kind of consciousness than, say, the consciousness of an animal that has billions of years of evolutionary context or history. In summa: Consciousness can exist without the brain, and consciousness is not a product of the brain; in fact, consciousness is not even located in the brain per se. Consciousness is tucked away inside the fabric of space-time, that is, consciousness resides in the black heart of nothingness/the toroidal core. However, consciousness is in the brain, as it were, because the brain contains, say, 150 trillion trillion toruses\u2014the tori work together to produce the illusion of \u201cyou.\u201d I believe the brain is more like the carrier for the evolutionary context. \u201cPut it on,\u201d and suddenly you are a human or a fish, or whatever the evolutionary history says you are. That consciousness is primal solves the measurement problem. Life is all that exists! The torus (i.e., the cuboctahedron) and the measurement problem explain why life is all that is, as opposed to, \u201cLife does not exist.\u201d The torus is the feedback system that explains what consciousness is. Thus, if everything is a torus, then everything is alive. However, everything in the universe (including our bodies) is dead. Life is the torus\u2019 core. In Samsara, everything is dead. Nirvana is life. Life after death is simple: We live in a simulation that allows for it, or, this universe is a dream, or, I can think of plenty of other possible ways. A physicist would say, \u201cNo. There are no spirit atoms! We know all there is to know.\u201d Again, physicists are not philosophers, they never will be, and, frankly, I\u2019m tired of the notion that physicists should have so much power over the ideas of men. However, I welcome physicists who are also philosophers, like Roger Penrose. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone: When you hold the Philosopher\u2019s Stone in your hand, then you know how it all began. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the cuboctahedron. I figured that one out when I decoded the secrets of the alchemists. This is what Sir Isaac Newton spent his free time pursuing. He could never find it. Imagine that! The greatest genius of all time could not crack the code. Or, if he cracked it, he didn\u2019t tell the world. To be fair, I had infinite more power in my hands (viz., the internet). My solution: Heaven (fire) = the triangle. Earth = the square. Father and Mother = opposite-sitting tetrahedron-arrays like in the flag of the Mother, the Father and the Child; Is(is) + ra + el. Israel. Earth (+ fire) = the cuboctahedron. Water = the icosahedron. Air = the octahedron. Fire = the tetrahedron (e.g., the throne of God). Leaf 11 (left, bottom): \u201cThrough Him who created the Heavens and the Earth I am The Philosopher\u2019s stone, and in my body I carry something the wise seek. If such a charm be extracted from me, it will be a sweet refreshment for you. I am an animal having father and mother, and father and mother were created; and in my body are contained the four elements, and I am before father and mother and I am a poisonous animal.\u201d \u2014The Secret Teachings of All Ages (http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/sta/) The Father and the Mother: The Isotropic Vector Matrix - Nassim Haramein ( Abstract from Cognos 2010 conference): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGGvwkrDZNA The Philosopher\u2019s Stone = the heaven + the earth + the four elements. In addition, the Stone has a father and a mother, that is, you will find the cuboctahedron within a stack of tetrahedron-arrays (e.g., the 64 tetrahedron array, aka Father and Mother; see the I Ching). The cuboctahedron is composed of triangles (heaven) and squares (earth) and, when you fold the cuboctahedron, you get the four elements. Note that it is impossible to find another solution for the simple reason that you will not find anything in the universe that consists of squares and triangles while simultaneously carries the four elements. Alternatively, I dare you to come up with another solid! I believe that: The cuboctahedron sits on a throne/triangle (I am before father and mother), and it is a poisonous animal when you fold it down; poison meaning fire. You get the throne of God when you fold the cuboctahedron completely. How I solved it: I already knew about the Platonic solids, and I knew that heaven is a triangle because it is always depicted as a triangle. The earth, therefore, could be a square because it is simply a step up from the triangle. You have the four corners of the earth, the four rivers of Eden, and so on. The poisonous animal could be the snake in the Garden of Eden, for example. \u201cFire\u201d may also denote the Phoenix (i.e., resurrection) or the Great Dragon. The Dragon also consists of the four elements: Feet: earth. Scales: water. Wings: wind. Breath: fire. Then, I saw a video of Buckminster Fuller and I just knew what the Philosopher\u2019s Stone was: Buckminster Fuller Explains Vector Equilibrium - with captions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcq_Hzo8PC8 I believe that: I am a poisonous animal = the equilateral triangle. The cuboctahedron/Philosopher\u2019s Stone is tucked away within the geometry of the Father and Mother, so \u201cbefore\u201d might denote that. \u201cI am before father and mother,\u201d = (If Father and Mother = opposite sitting tetrahedron arrays like you see in the flag of Israel, then \u201cbefore\u201d must mean something like \u201csitting before\u201d or \u201ccomes before in time;\u201d or, something else entirely.) I believe it is \u201csitting before\u201d because we are dealing with a \u201cstone\u201d and, as we said, the cuboctahedron/Philosopher\u2019s Stone is tucked away within the geometry of the Father and Mother. Father and Mother: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGGvwkrDZNA I also believe that the equilateral triangle = 666 (i.e., 60 + 60 + 60 [60 = 6 + 0 = 6]). You get the equilateral triangle when you fold the cuboctahedron completely. The original number of the Beast may have been 616, but that does not mean that some secret school has adopted it in order to hide their secret. The Book of Revelation is all about the cuboctahedron. You can tell from the hidden symbology. I have tried to solve it, at least partially (below). However, I do not actually know what these mean: \u201c[...] I am before father and mother,\u201d and \u201c[...] I am a poisonous animal,\u201d but you do not need to solve these puzzles in order to solve the big puzzle. \u201c[...] Heavens and the Earth,\u201d + \u201c[...] my body are contained the four elements,\u201d are more than enough to solve the riddle. I believe that Jesus Christ is the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. Jesus Christ is the center point in the cuboctahedron where the 12 converging lines (that make up the cuboctahedron) meet. The 12 are of course the 12 disciples. The flag of Israel also contains the secret. Flag of Israel = The Father and The Mother = opposite-sitting tetrahedron arrays = the cuboctahedron = the Philosopher\u2019s Stone = the Holy Grail. When you know the secret, you will spot it in Greek Mythology, Norse Mythology, you will spot it in the Kabbalah; the I Ching, the flag of South Korea, in the symbology of the Masons; that is, this secret is everywhere. My personal guess is that this secret is so big and so important that it has been replicated ad infinitum in order to preserve it for the future. What does the Philosopher\u2019s Stone even mean? It means that we have been visited by aliens therefore the Philosopher\u2019s Stone (i.e., free energy) is the ultimate technology in the universe. Our forebears were smart, but they didn\u2019t have the ultimate technology in the universe, hence, E.T. is the safest bet. More: When you fold the cuboctahedron, you get spin. Now you know the origin of spin. Free energy has to do with the dual torus. Eternity/nothingness = the dual torus. \u201cMuspelheim and Niflheim.\u201d The Philosopher\u2019s Stone does look like a stone, eh? Fitting name. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone has something to do with geometry because, if you were ignorant in the ways of geometry, then no Mystery School would have you. The door to Plato\u2019s Academy: \u201cLet no one ignorant of geometry enter.\u201d (Plato, I think you spilled the secret/sacred beans without knowing it.) And, yes, the Philosopher\u2019s Stone provides you with immortality; and, the Philosopher\u2019s Stone can literally produce gold therefore the Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the system that created and creates all things. The Philosopher\u2019s Stone is the great nothingness. The cuboctahedron is the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, and the secret societies know this. Plato knew it, but he couldn\u2019t tell the world. He left clues, however. Sir Isaac Newton probably knew it, but he couldn\u2019t tell the world. Leonardo da Vinci probably knew it (you can tell by his Flower of Life paintings). However, I am not a member of a secret society, so I can tell the world. Note: Nassim Haramein has already told the world through his solution to the Kabbalah ... so, why should I fear for my life when the Secret of Secrets has already been revealed? Oops: Do not equate this work with Nassim Haramein\u2019s work. This work is completely my own. 72 = Nassim Haramein solves the Kabbalah, and the answer is the 64 tetrahedron grid, that is, the cuboctahedron within the cuboctahedron. 8 trees of Life x 9 Sephiroth (1 of the Sephiroth does not count as it is the root or crown) = 72. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R8AihKoWrw The cuboctahedron is Jesus and his 12 disciples. The 12 Olympians. Odin\u2019s 12 sons. The coven of the witches. And, so on. The coven of the witches, for example, is 13. Actually, the cuboctahedron = 12 + 1. 12 beams and 1 center. Thus, the number 12 and/or the number 13 are the esoteric mystery. 12 Knights of the Round Table + King Arthur (1). 12 labors of Hercules (1). Odin (1), the chief god, had 12 sons. The Olympians, which comprised the whole pantheon (which is also a temple), were 12. In Judaism and Christianity the number 12 has a special place. There is a reason why these myths and tales are so popular. Jesus (1) and his 12 disciples. The list goes on ... The 13 attributes of God. The Zodiac. But, you are so selective! What about the movie Ocean\u2019s Twelve or the 12 Monkeys? The 12 characters in Street Fighter? Really? Am I being selective? Selective would be Thor\u2019s 12 sons, King Barthur and his 150 + Knights. What about Judas and his 12 disciples or, perhaps, all the lesser gods not included in the pantheon? Forget Hercules, what about Steve\u2019s 12 labors; or 11 months in a year? What about the ... Am I really being that selective? I take only the cream! I\u2019m not really selecting anything! The body parts of Osiris! Nice try! There were 14 body parts. No. Actually, a fish ate one of the parts, the phallus! I would believe that this is just me connecting dots that are not meant to be connected if, Jesus could make do with eleven disciples. Even the Knights of the Round were originally over 150 knights! Why this obsession with making it 12 + 1? Just read the entire The Secret Teachings of All Ages before you make up your mind. Then you will see that: The cuboctahedron is the real Holy Grail because the Holy Grail is the cup that never empties, aka free energy. And, the Round Table shrinks and expands like a torus! The whole The Secret Teachings of All Ages must make you realize that aliens have visited us because, where else does this stuff come from? Manly P. Hall himself urges us to look away. There are no aliens here! Powerful men must have gotten to him because, it\u2019s like the comedian Bill Hicks stopped smoking one day and said, \u201cI was wrong. Smoking is bad for you.\u201d No one in hell will believe that, of course. That is, it just does not add up. The author of the Secret Teachings urges us to look away at the Greatest Secret in history! It does not make sense; well, until you realize who Hall was. Hall was a Freemason. But, before he was a Freemason, he wrote the Secret Teachings (1928). My personal guess is that Hall was so close to the secrets of the Masons that the Masons recruited him in order to keep their secrets safe. Basically, what happened was that aliens landed here and imparted their knowledge to the creatures that they made (us). The elite kept this knowledge safe. And, they still do. However, the elite cannot control the internet. Jesus resurrects people, heals people, etc. So does the cuboctahedron: Free Energy Finally Discovered | Rodin Coil Vortex Based Math | TEDxCharlotte 2010 Randy Powell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhBymLCRIU8 Marko Rodin on the Word of God: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c42vXYykm6s How would I do it? If the cuboctahedron (i.e., the dual torus) were the sacred relic of all time, then I would symbolize it with the number 12 and the 1, that is, the 12 vectors and the 1 center. I would symbolize it with a rod (i.e., the stem of the torus) and two snakes (i.e., the dual torus), and perhaps wings to truly show off the celestial powers contained within. I would also use the number 7 (and/or 6) because it is the blueprint (i.e., the Flower of Life) of the thing. I would also use 3 because, when you fold the cuboctahedron completely, you get an equilateral triangle. There is your Holy Trinity. I can find numerous ways to hide it, for example, the Triforce in The Legend of Zelda (not that the ones who created the Zelda games had any clue). Build a cuboctahedron, fold it, and see. The hexagon (6) x 4 = the cuboctahedron. (The bees know the secret.) What symbols do we find? Just take Christianity: We find the 12 +1, Jesus and his disciples. We find the 6 days of Creation + one resting day. Why the resting day? Google a picture of the Flower of Life and see for yourself. We find the Holy Trinity and God himself depicted as a triangle. Some physicists say that the universe cannot be made of Sacred Geometry because Nature is not that perfect. Get real! The cuboctahedron is the heart of Sacred Geometry and the cuboctahedron is the formlessness/nothingness itself! Sacred Geometry has nothing to do with making things perfect. There is no such thing. I Ching: Note: This is just my guesswork. Understand the flag of South Korea first: The flag of South Korea = 1 x Star Tetrahedron (i.e., the Merkaba). That is, form the 6 large line segments into a tetrahedron, and then do the same with the 12 smaller segments, and then fuse the two together (aka Father and Mother) so that they form the Star Tetrahedron (google it). The flag of South Korea = 1 x Star Tetrahedron + red/blue (Father and Mother/the dual torus) + the four elements. The Secret of Secrets = the cuboctahedron. The I Ching (King Wen Order): Whole, 192 Broken, 384 1 x Star Tetrahedron = 6 whole + 12 broken 192 divided by 6 = 32 384 divided by 12 = 32 32 Fathers + 32 Mothers = 32 Star Tetrahedrons. 8 Star Tetrahedrons = the 64 tetrahedron grid. 32 Star Tetrahedrons = 4 x the 64 tetrahedron grid. 64 x 4 = 256 tetrahedrons. But, Manly P. Hall says, they always give you half the code. Thus, double it: 256 x 2 = the 512 tetrahedron grid! I believe that: The 512 tetrahedron grid, which is the next interval (perfect copy/Russian Doll, just on a larger scale); that is, that which comes after the 64 tetrahedron grid. In other words: 8 (octave) x 64 = 512. In summa: If you add the Yin & Yang, which is the Star Tetrahedron, then the whole of the I Ching is as follows: 8, 64, 512. In other words: the 3 Rings of Atlantis (?). Maybe they built Atlantis with these 3 rings in order to symbolize the growth of space-time? Also note that: 48 large line segments + 96 small or broken line segments = 8 x Star Tetrahedrons or the 64 tetrahedron grid. The tetrahedron grids contain the vector equilibrium (i.e., the cuboctahedron). The Foo Dogs in The Forbidden City guard the 64 tetrahedron grid under their paw. You don\u2019t have to believe Nassim nor his solution to the Kabbalah! You can go to China and SEE IT FOR YOURSELF! Now, how do you explain that?! The Foo Dogs are not real? What Terence McKenna did: Terence assumed that the universe was approximately 17 billion years old (or something like that), and then he divided that by 64. This was the first unit of time. This unit is slow and hence its evolution is slow. Then he divided what he got by 64 and so on. The last unit ought to have ended in 2012. But how can this be? Answer: Because this unit of time is not us. It is not our evolution. This is the evolution of the computers. They evolve pretty fast. Memetic evolution! Thus, we don\u2019t feel it, nor see it. We look into our backyard and, nothing is happening, really. We say that time is not speeding up. Then, the next cuboctahedron/unit of time branches off and, billions of years of evolution happen, and must happen, within the scope of, say, 30 seconds! Half the evolution of the cosmos in 30 seconds! Imagine! Thirty Seconds to Mars, indeed! The result? A supercomputer of unfathomable dimensions! Update: Well, 2012 did not happen. Ray Kurzweil claims the singularity will happen in 2045. However, trying to fit billions of years into segments may not be that easy; so, 2012 or 2045 or 2145, what is the big difference? I believe that the technological singularity is the only thing that can truly be associated with an End of Days scenario. If time has picked up speed since the Big Bang, then a technological singularity is the only logical conclusion. The physical sphere is slow. Time speeds up and we get the chemical sphere. Then time speeds up and life emerges, the biological sphere. The mental sphere. The cultural sphere, and then ... time speeds up so fast that billions of years unfold in seconds: This is the technological singularity. Then, suddenly, something equal to the Second Coming of Christ takes place. We are no longer living in the physical universe but in the Spiritual Universe that Terence saw. The Spiritual Universe as thus evolved by the supercomputer with the aid of free energy technology. Then we exit the cave of Plato and see reality for the first time. Just like John of Patmos saw. Now we see how he could see the future ... because the future is now, literally! Or: If not the Illuminati demons screw us! Aliens or demons? Well, that depends on how far the future (i.e., the Spiritual Universe) reaches into the past (our universe in its current state). However, if the Macrobes are from the Spiritual Universe, then the Illuminati were successful (?). I believe: This is the DMT-experience. You get a glance of the future. Other: Pi is the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter. This can be seen if you draw a line segment from the center of a circle and out to the periphery. Then you start with the line segment facing down (A). Then you roll the circle over. When the line segment has moved 1 complete round on the ground (B), then you will have Pi between point A and B. Basically, what Pi is is a circle. That is what it is! Basically, if you have an infinite line, what is the smallest amount of line-stuff you need to take from that infinite line in order to form a circle? Exactly, it is Pi. Pi is simply a circle. The secret relationship between the pi and the phi is this: In order to make the new cuboctahedron out of the new tetrahedron(s) (esoteric: the Phoenix), you need yet another tetrahedron(s) that is reversed. This, then, becomes the Star of David. Together, these tetrahedrons produce a new cuboctahedron. But, here is the point: The two tetrahedrons need to form a \u201cperfect circle\u201d in order to generate the new cuboctahedron or nothingness. Without Pi, Phi is impossible. See this video: The Father and the Mother: The Isotropic Vector Matrix - Nassim Haramein ( Abstract from Cognos 2010 conference): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGGvwkrDZNA Now you know what a true \u201cphi\u201dlosopher is. It is all an inner, beautiful relationship. What is the golden ratio, or phi, really? It is our fractal reality, that is, that Nature copies itself in such a way that the part is always a replica of the whole. It\u2019s like Russian dolls. And \u201cthe part of the part\u201d is always a replica of \u201cthe part,\u201d which is a replica of the whole. This is why we are all one. Oneness. This is what evolution really is. Every rock, insect and animal, every leaf, are a mini-universe. That is how nature divides. The Dividing Universe. If you have ever seen a Mandelbrot set, then realize: Your coffee cup is composed of trillions of \u201cuniverses.\u201d Nature cannot use any other model. This is the holographic principle. We live in a holographic universe. The particle contains the universe. However, the golden ratio is not real. Nature is not perfect. Nature utilizes, say, the Fibonacci sequence. A conifer cone lying on the forest floor is the whole forest. Mull on that while you are having a smoke in the forest. Q: But, \u201cnature divides,\u201d what is it, really? A: It is the solution to the I Ching! It is what evolution and time are. That is, evolution is the copying, and the product is the speeding up of time. Terence McKenna, employing the I Ching (i.e., the 64), saw this. The physical sphere. The chemical sphere (\u201cperfect,\u201d smaller copy of the physical sphere). The biological sphere (\u201cperfect,\u201d smaller copy of the physical sphere and the chemical sphere). The mental sphere (\u201cperfect,\u201d smaller copy of the physical sphere, the chemical sphere and the biological sphere). And so on. This may be how time divides. Time divides = evolution. Evolution is space-time\u2019s ability to make copies of itself. That is, evolution starts at the beginning of time! I believe that the I Ching is simply alien knowledge that man has translated into what we call the I Ching. It is how Nature starts slow and then gradually speeds up. The cosmic age will be, say, billions of years, then time speeds up and we get the chemical sphere; then time speeds up again, and we get the biological sphere; and faster, the mental sphere; and faster, the cultural sphere; and faster, the supercomputer or the Spirit World. The I Ching, then, explains why we are soon to meet aliens and the technological singularity. And all this is why everything in nature is divided in the image of phi. Phi was, for the ancients, the Prime Mover. Nature can only copy what is. That is, Nature can only copy herself. This is why Nature copies herself in such a way that the part is always a replica of the whole, and we get oneness. You cannot get something other than oneness. Learn to see, da Vinci said. Nature can only copy what is. What is is the cuboctahedron. The cuboctahedron is all reality. It is our consciousness. The cuboctahedron is the immortal heart of Nature. Nature is the cuboctahedron (i.e., the nothingness) and nothing besides. Let us talk about God: Note: This is just my guesswork. https://www.reddit.com/r/holofractal/comments/2oywkt/the_iching_encodes_the_64_tetrahedron_array_and/  What is God to the ancients? Answer: A triangle/tetrahedron. What is the Great Work? Answer: 10. The decad. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. 1, 2, 3 and 4 are the 4 letters in the name of God. Jehovah: YHWH. What does God mean? God means: tetragrammaton. The tetragrammaton means \u201cfour letters.\u201d The four letters are: 1, 2, 3 and 4. The tetrahedron has four faces. In other words, YHWH = 10. The decad is both heaven and earth. Heaven = the triangle. And earth = the square. Heaven (8 triangles) and earth (6 squares) = the cuboctahedron. 10 is the greatest number, according to Manly P. Hall. 10 is the complete picture. Is it not? And here is the thing: They always give you half the key. You must always decode the ancient code in 3D. 10 becomes 20. In the movie Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014) they give you 10 dices or stones. Decode that in 3D and you get 20 stones. That is, lay the 10 on the floor and keep stacking till you reach the top. And a triangle in 3D = the tetrahedron. Lay the 10 tetrahedrons so that they form God. (Obviously.) Now you have half the key. You need an additional 10 tetrahedrons. 10 + 10 (like in the Exodus movie). Stack them together to form God in 3D. Now you have it ... half of it! That is, God has a female aspect as well. 20 + 20. The female (Mother) is opposed to the male (Father), so double what you\u2019ve got and turn the new mega-triangle on its head, rotate it, and fuse the male and the female together so that they form a perfect circle or Pi. (Now you see why sexual intercourse was sacred.) Now you\u2019ll have something like the Star Tetrahedron. The Star of David. 40 tetrahedrons. Now all you need to do is to fill the gaps. Note that there are 24 elders in the Book of Revelation. 40 + 24 = the 64 tetrahedron grid. And what does the 64 produce? A double/dual torus (x 2). And the LORD God said, \u201cThe man has now become like one of us, knowing good and evil. He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.\u201d\u2014http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-22.htm Read the Book of Revelation with these codes in mind: Note: This is just my guesswork. 7 = The seed of Life Double/dual/twisted/twin = the dual torus 12 or 12 + 1 (13) = the 12 vectors in the cuboctahedron Tree of Life = The Kabbalah (Note: The Yggdrasil tree is a Norse version of the Kabbalah. Note that the Norse version has 9 Sephiroth/worlds while the Jewish Kabbalah has 10 Sephiroth/worlds. I guess when the cultures met, they exchanged something of value! Not that the Jews personally brought the wisdom over. The said exchange might have happened in a number of ways.) God\u2019s throne = the tetrahedron 24 elders = 24 tetrahedrons 4 creatures, 6 wings = the cuboctahedron, that is, 4 hexagons make up the 3D cuboctahedron. One hexagon would have the face like a man, one would fly/be horizontal, and two \u201ccross\u201d each other. Just google a picture of the cuboctahedron. Heaven = the equilateral triangle Earth = square The equilateral triangle = 60 + 60 + 60 = (6 + 0) + (6 + 0) + (6 + 0) = 666 That [60 = 6 + 0 = 6] was a common way to hide things/secrets according to Manly P. Hall. \u201cFell down\u201d and worship = the folding of the cuboctahedron Scroll rolling up = the unfolding of the cuboctahedron 144000 = 12000 x 12 tribes = a code for the 12 vectors in the cuboctahedron, that is, in order to get the 144000, you need to multiply 12000 with the 12 tribes. The Dragon: Feet: earth. Scales: water. Wings: wind. Breath: fire. (See The Philosopher\u2019s Stone above.) Satan/Babylon = the female aspect, that is, the reversed tetrahedron arrays. Why is Satan coded with the same numbers (7, 12, etc.) as the good guys? I know! I believe that the whole of the Revelation = two opposite-sitting tetrahedron arrays (good vs evil) coming together to produce the Child/Paradise/New Earth/Buckminster Fuller\u2019s Vector Equilibrium (i.e., the cuboctahedron) = nothingness and matter creation = the Big Bang = knowledge in our ancient books that can only stem (ultimately) from E.T.. Other: The masonic sun = the triangle. The moon = the square. Heaven (fire) = the triangle. Earth = the square. Triangle (8) + square (6) = the cuboctahedron. \u201cIn the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\u201d\u2014KJV Other: The Phoenix resurrects and rises from the ashes. Jesus raises the dead. Jesus (the center point in the cuboctahedron) and his 12 disciples (the 12 vectors in the cuboctahedron). The Holy Grail is the cup that never empties. Then you have the goose that lays golden eggs (which is a masonic tale). The Fountain of Youth (well, if the cuboctahedron/nothingness resurrects the dead, aka free energy). Muspelheim and Niflheim. Yin and Yang. The Kabbalah. The I Ching (64 hexagrams). Countless video games and movies (e.g., Indiana Jones picks the wrong cup; the real Holy Grail is the one with the symbols and gems on: the four elements and the flower of life). The story is told time and again in different clothes. The Zodiac (the 12 vectors in the cuboctahedron). The Tarot. King Arthur and the Sword in the Stone! King Arthur pulls the sword (fire) from the stone (earth). Earth + fire (heaven) = the cuboctahedron. King Arthur pulls the sword from the stone = the folding of the cuboctahedron (?). The Mayan Calendar. And the chess board consists of the 64 and the Yin (black) & Yang (white). The elements of the flag of South Korea = the Star Tetrahedron. The Star Tetrahedron x 8 = the 64 tetrahedron grid. The Swastika (if Himmler only knew!) is the net of the cuboctahedron. 64 codons in our DNA. And the 64 tantric arts of Kama Sutra! The original card deck (32). When the Masons walk on their chessboard floors, it is: 1. They really like chess. Or, 2. They are stepping on the truth. When you open your eyes, you will see the Freemason\u2019s machinations everywhere! Sol Om On = Is Ra El = Mer Ka Ba The tale of FREE ENERGY (64) has been told an infinite number of times. Why? Because, imagine the scenario where E.T. actually landed on terra firma, imparted his knowledge, and then left. What world would we live in? We would live in a world where the tale of free energy has been told an infinite number of times. But E.T. did not leave. What I mean: 64 codons in our DNA = reality employs the 64. The 64 tantric arts of Kama Sutra = somebody in the know containing the secret of secrets in some \u201cform of art.\u201d The quote of all quotes to understand it all: Odin explains that when the fire (red) of Muspelheim and the ice (blue) of Niflheim came together, creation began. Before the soil, the sky and green things, there was only the Ginnungagap! The gaping abyss. The shiny darkness. The great silence; the swartest night lay between the fiery fire of Muspelheim and the misty clouds of Niflheim. My ancestors were spot on (I\u2019m Norwegian) if the Ginnungagap is Buckminster Fuller\u2019s Vector Equilibrium (VE), and the fiery fire of Muspelheim = a torus, and the misty clouds of Niflheim = a torus. We get the dual torus which produces the great nothingness (i.e., the VE) from which we all came. Remember, Eternity is a dual creature. The quote (my nothingness): \u201cThe vector equilibrium is the zero staring point for happenings and nonhappenings; it is the empty theater and empty circus and empty Universe ready to accommodate any act and any audience.\u201d \u2014Buckminster Fuller (Synergetics, 2nd Edition, 11th Dec, 1975). The vector equilibrium = the cuboctahedron. Why Bucky? If you ride a beam of light in your mind\u2019s eye, then you will see that, from this perspective, everything freezes. But, if the perspective is eternal, then, we do not see frozen things ... we see nothing at all or nothingness. How come? Because things, in this picture, has not had the time to freeze. That is, it is an eternally frozen picture with nothing in it. So I knew that we all came from the great nothingness. I needed to find a geometry that resonated with my Eureka moment. Then I discovered Buckminster Fuller. 64: Why is the sacred number 64? Douglas Adams thought it was 42. But it is in fact 64, like in the I Ching. Our DNA employs this number. What is it? Answer: It is Metatron\u2019s Cube. The Metatron\u2019s Cube is basically a cuboctahedron that is embedded within another cuboctahedron. In other words, the 64 is where nature divides, where one cuboctahedron \u201cbranches off\u201d from another cuboctahedron; basically, the \u201cwall\u201d that separates one octave on your piano from the next octave. Phi makes sure that every division gets the 64. 64 is the number of tetrahedrons you have to have in order to create a \u201cdouble cuboctahedron,\u201d as it were. Thus, every division of time/evolution gets this 64. In other words: the 64 is it! Our galaxy carries the 64. Our galaxy can be seen as 1 unit of time, and then it divides and becomes the next unit/cuboctahedron, namely, our solar system, which also carries the 64. Then our solar system divides and becomes the next unit of time: chemistry. Then life, and then... And each iteration/octave carries the evolution/power of the previous iteration (i.e., you can create more complex \u201cmusic\u201d), and thus time is speeding up. We don\u2019t see it; an asteroid taking a round around the local galaxy doesn\u2019t feel it; but, let us just say that our computers feel it! Each eon or unit of time = the 64; the 64 tetrahedron grid, which is the solution to the Kabbalah and the I Ching. Also interesting to note that \u201coctave\u201d means 8 and that 8 x 8 = 64. The 64 also carries the platonic solids that are the building blocks that make up every object in the cosmos. That is, the Metatron\u2019s Cube is the whole of Creation. The dodecahedron is one of the solids; thus, you see, the universe had plans to create man this whole time. Convergent evolution is real. The ARK (guesswork): [...] look inside the Ark of the Covenant, where you will find the detailed representations of the 10 Commandments on the 2 stone tablets, the Golden Pot of Manna and Aaron\u2019s rod. [...] 10 Commandments = the Kabbalah. [...] 2 stone tablets = the two toruses. [...] the Golden Pot of Manna = the matter that is created. And food for the Israelites. The people of Isis, Ra and El. [...] Aaron\u2019s rod = the beam that goes out of the torus-complex (like in a supernova). The rod can turn into a snake? Yeah, and what does the snake do? It bites its own tail. A torus, in other words. Parting seas. Destroying walls. Killing people with no bullets! Sounds like E.T. tech if, and I stress if, this was real. Mercy seat: And the seat of God was in the midst of the two cherubim. Of course, if the angels are the two toruses and God is the vacuum. And the vacuum is literally where the heavens and the earth meet therefore the vacuum is what connects all space. Does that mean that the aliens communicate directly through the vacuum (i.e., the cuboctahedron) of space? The capacitor: And gold? Gold is a conductor. This smells like a piece of technology to me. Two toruses, one positive and one negative. + and -. Just like your battery. And there are two cherubim. One plus. One minus. Together they make electricity; the seat of God. The Father and the Mother (e.g., the Masonic Square and Compasses) = The blueprint of the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark of the Covenant = the creation of matter, free energy or, more to the point: advanced alien technology. The Dollar Bill (guesswork): Roll up the money and face the truth! The spiderweb represents the negative space in the isotropic vector metric/matrix, that is, the octahedrons. The 12 spiderweb lines represent the cuboctahedron. 13 steps in the pyramid + the eye = the cuboctahedron. 9 \u201ctail\u201d feathers. Get it? 9 Sephiroth per tree x 8 trees (the eight 1/ones in the dollar bill) = 72 bricks (in the pyramid): see Nassim Haramein solving the Quabbalah: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1R8AihKoWrw 13 letters in ANNUIT COEPTIS. This seal is the unfolded cuboctahedron (i.e., the \u201cvacuum\u201d of space). The second seal is the folded cuboctahedron where a phoenix/eagle/tetrahedron shall \u201crise.\u201d \u201cOne of Many\u201d = the tetrahedrons make the cuboctahedron. Merge the two seals (the pyramid is the Father and the eagle is the Mother) and they will tell you the story of Creatio ex nihilo (as I have told numerous times now). Free energy. If you look, you shall find. The eagle seal: 13 (the cuboctahedron) x 7 (the Seed of Life) More secrets: The Infinity Stones (See the Guardians of the Galaxy 2014 movie): aka the 4 + 2 elements: earth/yellow (hexahedron), water/blue (icosahedron), air/green (octahedron); fire/red (tetrahedron), and ether/purple (dodecahedron), and void (i.e., the \u201cvacuum\u201d of space, aka the cuboctahedron). Cinema is never the same when you know that the Illuminati has a hand in Hollywood. Going to the movies is much more fun nowadays. Google the Legend of Zelda version: All a coincidence? Even the colors match! The 6 days of creation/the hexagon The Triforce The 5 + 1 elements (i.e., the Platonic solids + the vacuum) Also fitting that Yin & Yang is \u201cthe vacuum.\u201d The Triforce in the Legend of Zelda Universe is found within the folded cuboctahedron. You enter the Triforce (2D) right before you arrive at the tetrahedron. That is, the Triforce is the holographic wall of the universe, the net of the tetrahedron. Q: You must be joking? You conspiracy nut! The Triforce stems from the Hojo Clan! A: And where did the Hojo Clan get it from? And etc.. Also check out the Final Fantasy series (e.g., the four elements). Q: The Illuminati made the Final Fantasy series, really? A: I am not saying that whoever made the game is Illuminati. I am saying that, if a game or movie or whatever is popular, then it can get the attention of the Illuminati. However, most movies, etc., suffer from the Illuminati meme; but, that does not mean that the real stuff isn\u2019t there. You are telling me that the secret societies do not care about exploiting Hollywood? By the Illuminati I mean the extraterrestrials that made us. I do not mean the 1776 thing. A few men cannot control the world. But, a few powerful aliens can. And these aliens have taken the Illuminati meme and rolled with it. According to Michael Tsarion, the E.T.s that came to the earth were few in number, and they lacked technology because they lost hardware due to warring. What do you do? You create a primitive species (us), and then you let them work toward the lost hardware. This plan will take you thousands of years, but if E.T.\u2019s lifespan is great, then there is nothing to think about. You start working. I believe the hardware to be some kind of supercomputer. Study the work of Michael Tsarion first. Then google Jordan Maxwell. (Jordan Maxwell teaches that black and gold are the colors of Saturn (Satan), yet, he wears black and gold! And, I do not know what to make of Tsarion. Study them nevertheless.) Here is Hollywood for you: Take Jim Carrey, for example. He is spiritual, yet mocks people with the all mocking tongue, and then states: \u201cThere are clusters of tetrahedrons moving around together.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not our world.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t matter.\u201d I believe: What Jim is referring to is of course the fact that we are not humans. We are the One in Nirvana. In the beginning of the interview, they do a little dual torus dance (viz., Yin and Yang). How do I know? Obviously, the interview was staged; and, clusters of tetrahedrons moving around together = a dual torus \u201cdance.\u201d  http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/theres-no-meaning-this-jim-11148271 The Nutty Universe: How come our galaxy is flat when in fact we live in 3D space? It does not make sense until you realize that it is being compressed that way by the dual/double torus. And that is why the ufo is round and flat. Like our galaxy, it is to accommodate the dual torus which their propulsion system generates. E.T.\u2019s craft is disc-shaped therefore E.T. uses a dual torus for propulsion. Our galaxy is flat therefore it is being compressed between two toruses (i.e., the dual torus/the Father and the Mother/the Yin and the Yang). Thus, E.T.\u2019s craft has to be flat for the same reason. And if you study the thing, you will come to realize that the earth is growing. No Pangea! The earth is growing because matter is being generated all the time (phi). They say that matter production happened in this Big Bang, but if nature had the ability back then, how come she does not have it today? She suddenly became impotent? I don\u2019t think so. What kind of philosophy is that?! One that is not coherent. Oh, that\u2019s right! Physicists hate philosophy! If the Big Bang is like this mass that exploded, then every point in that explosion is the source (it follows). If the source is spread out, then every point in space will produce matter (including the earth). Why would she stop?! The Dividing Universe answers why our earth is growing. The earth grows because it is a cuboctahedron (i.e., a singularity, that is, the folding of the cuboctahedron). Our galaxy grows because it is a cuboctahedron. And so on. We are also \u201cgrowing.\u201d The atoms in our bones are, literally, growing galaxies. But we would have to live for a long time, in order to ... amass! If you study the thing you will come to realize that the earth may be hollow. Hollow Earth! But let us leave that aside. Ok. The earth may be hollow because the earth is a (dual) torus. And if you study the torus, then you will come to realize that she has a big surface but a thin stem. And between the surface and the stem, there is a lot of room! The 12 Devil\u2019s graveyards are due to the fact that our earth is less like a ball and more like a cube, that is, our earth is a cuboctahedron (i.e., a dual torus). Now you know what the Bermuda Triangle is! (Hint: one of the vectors in the cuboctahedron.) And, yeah, the earth is FLAT! That\u2019s right, we live in the \u201cHolofractographic\u201d Universe. Everything is 2D (actually 0D). 3D is ... illusion. How can all this be? You have to be ABSOLUTELY NUTS to believe in all of this! Yes. I agree. The best evidence against a Hollow Earth is just that, our current models of reality. However, our current model does not put in the center of reality, the torus. For example, one argument against the Hollow Earth is our current understanding of gravity: \u201cThings tend to clump together, creating non-hollow spheres such as stars and planets. Hollowness is unfavorable in the energetic sense\u201d (from Wikipedia). Yet, all that bad reasoning changes if you take a broader picture of reality and look at galaxies as the star of the show. Galaxies are big, hollow things; just look at the big \u201cempty\u201d space between its arms and its massive center. This is how energy arranges itself. Why? I believe it is because all things are toruses. And, if everything in Nature is a torus, including our planets and stars, then hollowness is favorable in the energetic sense because the energies favor the toroidal form. Another thing: Cosmic evolution should also favor hollowness because why waste energy creating massive things when you can create hollow things, such as galaxies, that are just as good? Gravity is not about clumping together. That is a barbarous way of looking at gravity! Gravity is all about finding balance, which is what the torus is. I believe that gravity is ultimately the force of nothingness, aka the spin of the dual torus/cuboctahedron. Other arguments are seismic waves and the density of the Earth. But these things changes if our model of reality changes. You need only study a bit of philosophy in order to understand that! That is, there is a reason why physicists really hate philosophy! Sometimes, two or more answers answer the same thing with the same force and power. Rocks are solid! What about whirlpools? Truth is like a coin, it has two faces. To state that there is no Hollow Earth is truly unscientific because the models that say that there is no such thing as a Hollow Earth may be false and all the data against a Hollow Earth must be revisited in the light of the new model. That is, for science to truly state that there is no Hollow Earth, I say, dig a hole! I do not personally believe in the Hollow Earth, though. I saw the torus, and I saw a Hollow Earth. Also, I can see the torus and see no Hollow Earth. I can see both! An apple is a torus, and the apple is not hollow. On the other hand, the apple may not truly represent the cosmic torus here because the apple is non-hollow for a good evolutionary and tasty reason! A better example would be a hollow-version: the typhoon. That is, if the Hollow Earth = fake, then the torus-model of reality might still be real. The Hollow Earth is just a curiosity, and the torus might help explain it. E.T. No Pangea. Hollow earth. Flat earth. You must be wondering if I am the greatest pseudoscientific explorer of all time! The greatest nutcracker who ever lived! Yes, the latter is true! I consider myself a skeptic. I am an atheist who dwells in the world of Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Simon Conway Morris and Stephen Jay Gould. I believe evolution walks slow (Dawkins), is a wise man with a beard (Dennett), finds the same solutions (Morris) and, sometimes, novelty is thrown into the mix (literally so with the dinosaurs! hint: an asteroid) and Nature takes these leaps (Gould). Evolution is simple: You have this thing and it copies itself and, that\u2019s it! That is, evolution has no plan, is blind and, evolution is not about building and getting more complex! Evolution is not about evolution, as it were. Evolution is simply a thing\u2019s ability to replicate and the rest is fallout. If things get more complex, it is either because it aids survival and/or the copying process has run amok! Or a combination of these two. The non-evolving sharks in the ocean are not defying evolution, they are what evolution is really all about: copy yourself, the end. I believe that this copying can be traced back to the beginning of time. This copying is the spin of the nothingness, aka the folding of the cuboctahedron. The spin of the nothingness always was, and it will last forever. And this is all that is, that was, and ever will be. Again (from above): Evolution does not have a plan. There is no progress. Yet, because evolution keeps on rolling, so to speak, and because Nature is limited or finite, then evolution becomes convergent evolution. Convergent evolution does not have a plan either, but, that does not stop things from converging; therefore, humanoids and supercomputers might rise perpetually in Eternity... I see the world through that lens. My worldview is rational, except, I also incorporate a mad Swedish philosopher: Nick Bostrom. From here, things get really interesting because, the inevitable product of the blind copying process that is all, may be a supercomputer. If this supercomputer has already evolved and already morphed all of reality in its image, then we may live in a simulation. Because of my Nirvana experience, I go further and speculate that the supercomputer has found a way back to the beginning of time where it dwells perpetually. Here, the supercomputer dreams. This is our universe. And, because no one is really in control (not even a seemingly almighty supercomputer), the dream has taken the front seat and we get the Illuminati aliens and the crazy world of David Icke. You may still be skeptical. But you have not seen what I have seen. If this Creator of the Universe (i.e., the supercomputer) does exist, then somebody is trying to kill the Creator. That is not unreasonable. If that is your premise, then you can start and dig into the hidden history of the world with, say, Michael Tsarion. You can do all of this and be perfectly rational and defend your beliefs with the greatest weapon of all time: philosophy. A true philosopher could easily destroy all of science, if it comes to that. Science is the kid brother of philosophy. This kid does not stand a chance if he tries to take on the throne. This is apparent on YouTube, where you see some physicist trying to best some philosopher. A true philosopher could make a case for the Hollow Earth and stand his ground, even in this modern Age of Science. I said I was a skeptic, and here is the dividing line: Either we humans are the pinnacle of evolution or, a supercomputer has already evolved. Because I am skeptical of the former and believe the latter, I get E.T. No Pangea. Hollow earth. Flat earth. I come to this conclusion (aliens, the Illuminati, etc.) based on the premise that a supercomputer has already evolved and my 15 + years of diving into the internet + my Nirvana experience. What if Super Mario was real: Imagine self-replicating robots/spacecraft taking over the universe by visiting a planet, consume its resources, replicate and then repeat said action on other planets. This way of conquering the universe would be mathematically efficient. However, I thought, why would the self-replicators be robots/spacecraft? Advanced aliens out there might lean towards the technologies of consciousness rather than metal, so to speak. That is, instead of self-replicating robots/spacecraft, imagine self-replicating fungi! Imagine that the Mushroom Kingdom has spread to all corners of the universe. Here they dwell. Their mission: Wait for primitive humanoids to eat them. The primitive humanoids will go on a DMT-trip and be fused with the Logos. The Logos might be the mushroom aliens\u2019 advanced brain. From it, the primitive humanoids learn language and, over time, the mushroom aliens will teach the, now modern, humanoids of the great war between them and the Illuminati aliens (aka Bowser). Terence McKenna and his \u201cstoned ape\u201d would be proud! Q: But why use cowardly humanoids to fight the biggest war in the universe? Why bother to make self-replicating fungi when you can make self-replicating robots/spacecraft that can craft super-soldiers of metal to fight in your war! A: Because reality is the war on consciousness, that is, the war on the One in Nirvana. You thus need to teach the manifestations of the One (us) to fight. The fungi may ultimately hail from Nirvana (viz., beyond the dream), and have come to fight the dream (i.e., the Demiruge), aka the Mushroom Kingdom vs Bowser (i.e., the Demiurge). Mushroom Kingdom vs Bowser: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZFIgFPLIzI Ok. E.T. No Pangea. Hollow earth. Flat earth. All we need now is: The universe is 6000 years old! If we accomplish it, then we have truly lost our minds! Our universe is 6000 years old, because that is when the Illuminati aliens turned on the simulation that we call the universe. (Joking ... Or ...?) Actually, I believe the universe is a bit older (much older!) than 14 billion years. Or, the beginning of time is relative to the observer(s) because the beginning of time is everywhere, in all points of space-time. The fieriest points = the black holes. So, we might be living in an eternal universe that begins and ends all the time! That is, a non-static, eternal universe. The Big Bang is just one of these beginnings and endings. A non-static universe = expanding and contracting simultaneously (!) + finite in space and time, but has the ability to revive itself\u2014which makes it, in a sense, \u201cinfinite.\u201d The beginning of time is everywhere, in all points in space-time = the cuboctahedron is scaled throughout space-time (aka the vacuum of space), and the cuboctahedron is the great nothingness from which we all came. There are six things you need for true immortality: 1. The immortality of Nature: If you want to be immortal, then you also need Nature to be immortal, therefore you are going to live inside her. There are good reasons to assume that Nature is immortal. Why else are we here after all this time? That is, if Eternity could end, it would have done so a long time ago. 2. Rebirth and 3. Oneness: You do not want to live forever in one go as that would be a vampire\u2019s curse. You need to breathe in and out, life and death. If you understand poetic language, then, you cannot just breathe in (or out), as that would be the vampire\u2019s curse. For rebirth, you need oneness because the chances of being born are almost zero; rebirth, zero x zero; but, if you are all numbers, then you will win every time. Thus, you need oneness because hell is other people! 4. Convergent evolution: Oneness makes sure you win Life\u2019s Lottery every time, but if you want to be reborn as a humanoid, then you need convergent evolution for the same reason that you need oneness. There are good reasons to assume that convergent evolution is real. Just ask a biologist. 5. The Meaning of Life = Free Will: If you want to live forever, then you need a purpose. There is no meaning of life. There is no meaninglessness of life. There is no up and down in the universe. So, you can go on forever. You can make your own purpose by employing your free will. Free will is harder to argue for, but not impossible. But, you could also make the case that immortality is worth it even if our free will is illusory. 6. Nirvana: After numerous lives in the cosmos, you realize that there is something missing. You want something, but you cannot find it. That something is your real consciousness. Real memory. You want to remember something of your infinite lives, build a home. You wake up and realize that the universe was just a dream. Then, when \u201cthe time comes,\u201d you fall back to sleep in order to escape the vampire\u2019s curse. That is, God had a pretty good reason for the suffering we experience. That is, if Eternity is a choice between eternal suffering (i.e., the vampire\u2019s curse), suffering and bliss that ebbs and flows, or eternal death, then it seems the One in Nirvana chose to surf the cosmic waves forever! Maybe it is not a choice. Immortality will happen no matter what. It is just the inevitable accumulation of evolutionary occurrences. That is, if you are immortal, then you need to find a way to escape the vampire\u2019s curse. One way to do that is to create a world, step into it, and then forget that you ever stepped into it. Forget that you are immortal. I believe that something like this happened. But now the world you created can take control of you! And, here we are! Well, at least we escaped the curse! To sum up: The immortality of Nature: You want a world to play in. Rebirth: You want to play as much as you want. Oneness: You want the controller. Convergent evolution: You want to play a certain type of games. The Meaning of Life = Free Will: You want it to be worth your while. Nirvana: You want to save your games. Well, if evolution has gone further than we know, if intelligence has gotten its will, then maybe Nirvana is real after all. Samsara is The Game, which many spiritual folks talk about. Awakening (not real awakening, but...): Alan Watts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SfZZlpfaN0 Nonduality: No Yin without a Yang, and vice versa. Meaning, all is oneness. The \u201cother\u201d is an illusion or a misunderstanding. For example: There is no such thing as \u201cspace and time,\u201d rather, there is space-time. That is, the table is not separate from, say, your coffee cup. They both inhabit the same inseparable reality. But sometimes we forget that. Knowledge: I cannot understand how 1 + 1 = 2 when everything flows! I can understand how 1 + 1 = 2 if we are talking about a game that we humans invented, that is, we make the rules, just like in chess! There is no way in hell that the actual queen is that powerful! How do you define \u201c1\u201d without conjuring up all the paradoxes in the multiverse?! You show me an apple. I give up! Yes, I can understand how the apple became a number, what I cannot understand is how you can actually believe that reality is made up of numbers! Even if we lived in a simulation, and we really are made of numbers, then the simulation must lie in a reality that knows no numbers. If it is numbers all the way, then we must be in hell or, at least, in one of Zeno\u2019s paradoxes! How E.T. got here: We all came from a cosmic whirlpool (i.e., the zeroth dimension/nothingness). How fitting, then, that the Origins make possible the warp drive. That is, only when we understand where we came from, will we unlock Nature\u2019s greatest technology. A real warp drive, that is, a Stargate (literally, a gate to the stars) is actually possible because the torus comes in all sizes because the torus can be scaled like the octaves on your piano (hint: I believe the piano was based on sacred knowledge). You can therefore set up a toroidal-field around your spacecraft, and then you can enter a bigger torus\u2019 core and fly out where you want in the universe. Q: But, will not the toroidal core crush your spacecraft? That is, you must enter the zeroth-dimension! How can you survive such a trip? How will you fit? This is impossible! Worse: This is insane! A: This is just speculation, but I believe that you actually need two toruses/whirlpools around your spacecraft with your spacecraft located at the center of the two whirlpools\u2019 eyes. The eye of the storm is calm. You can hide here. And, here is the ingenious part: If you shall travel to the center of a bigger torus, how can you go through this bigger torus\u2019 zero-dimensional neck without being crushed? The answer is: You don\u2019t! You set up a dual torus field around your spacecraft and then you let the field travel through the zeroth-dimension while you yourself rest comfortably in the eye of the storm or, more accurately, the eyes of the storms. Note that you need a dual torus because you need to sit inside two eyes simultaneously with one torus going head through the zeroth-dimension, while the other closes the gap behind you. If you only employed the one torus, then you would get halfway through the \u201cUnderworld,\u201d and then the waters of nothingness would crush you from behind! You really need two eyes. Note that a torus has two eyes. Two toruses have four eyes. You need to create a protective bubble using two eyes and two toruses. Also, note that your spacecraft would look like the classic UFO because you need to fit inside the two eyes that are sitting opposite each other. You can also have a cigar shape, as the shape would fit in the eye. The classic UFO disc-shape and the cigar work. A whirlpool is a torus. Nevertheless, when you look at the whirlpool, you only see a part of the whole torus. The UFO has the disc-shape in order to accommodate the dual torus-reality; like the fish in the ocean have the form that they have in order to accommodate their water-reality. Final note: Scientists today go so far as to suggest that the aliens are sleeping, waiting for the universe to get colder in order to create much more powerful computers. Really?! This is the length at which you are willing to go in order to solve the Fermi paradox? No. The solution to the paradox is very simple: They are already here. Occam\u2019s razor and math tell you that they are here. Get real and wake up. Believe your own mind. In fact, the length at which science is willing to explain away the paradox is proof of the simple solution to the paradox: they are here. Are you sure that nobody \u201cout there\u201d watches over the planet that is soon to birth a supercomputer? If that is true, then we truly are alone. Thank you for reading! I will say it out loud: I am passionately interested in free energy because it can solve all of our problems. With 20 000 children dying each day on our planet, the need for free energy is so great that it boggles the mind that the scientific world claims its impossibility, and that the political world does not spend 1 dollar pursuing free energy; especially in this day and age with Global Warming descending upon us. When I think about all the children we can help with a change in attitude, tears clog my mind! And when I talk to people about it, nobody seems to care. I get very upset. It is not a good place to be in. If I strap a bomb to a child, then the whole wide world would watch! If I say I can save 20 000 children from dying from starvation each and every day, nobody raises as much as a few eyebrows. The child strapped to a bomb we label \u201cingroup,\u201d while the other 20 000, we label \u201coutgroup.\u201d We did not evolve to care for the latter group. Similarly, the label \u201cfree energy\u201d is in the world\u2019s \u201coutgroup.\u201d This must change! A paradigm shift must occur. Free energy has absolutely nothing to do with the infinite. Infinity is hogwash! Scientists say that free energy is impossible because they, for whatever reason, believe that free energy = infinite energy (or a perpetual motion machine). Energy is always finite. It comes in finite packets. Free energy is resurrected energy\u2014and that is a very different paradigm. Why the world does not spend 1 dollar pursuing free energy boggles the mind when the man who gave us electricity and the modern world in the first place said it was possible! That man is Nikola Tesla. I get angry. I get frustrated. But then the calm voice inside my head tells me it\u2019s ok; it says, \u201cThe reason why the world is not in pursuit of free energy is simple: It is just evolution. The world is an animal that is dependent on the phenomenon of money in order to survive. Free energy would effectively kill that money-animal. Thus the money-animal, who controls the voice of politics, science and etc., will ridicule and cull the meme \u201cfree energy\u201d at any cost in order to survive.\u201d It is all simple. Q: Why does not our sun utilize free energy and burn forever? Why do stars die if free energy is true? This simple and obvious observation testifies to the fact of the impossible nature of free energy! A: Because free energy happens in the microworld where the toroidal center is so tight that \u201cenergy\u201d fed into it becomes ordered again. On a larger scale, we do not accomplish free energy because of the larger dimensions of the macroworld\u2014and this is the reason why our stars die. It is all about geometry. Like in the movie 300 (2006): At the battle of Thermopylae, King Leonidas and his brave men defended majestically against a huge Persian army because the topography of the Hot Gates allowed it. Free energy is similar. The tight center of the torus in the microworld allows the dead to be resurrected; in the macroworld, this \u201cterrain\u201d is simply not there, and, as a consequence, our suns die. Nevertheless, a sun is a big thing compared to, say, a car. We can harness the power of the microworld and power our cars. Free energy is so simple: The microworld, and thus nature as a whole, cannot die! Professors like Robert W. Koontz says free energy is possible, so it is not that scientists do not believe at all in its possibility. It is more like the money-animal is at work. I want the information out there because it is vital and important information. And YOU are the key to all of it! You can find my free energy books and more (for free, of course!) at this website: Notebook Please share my books with everyone and store it for the future so that it does not perish. Thank you. Thor Fabian Pettersen The Cave Wall People Foreword: Q: Remove a leg from the table, and what happens to the unseen table-in-itself? A: Remove a leg from a table in a video game and what happens to the PlayStation? Why is the thing in itself a stupid notion? First of all, what is the thing in itself, really? The thing in itself is a solution to a problem. The worst solution ever invented to a problem! but, nevertheless, a solution, sort of. If I burn my hand on, say, a fire, then you can argue that my pain here is secondary-never-mind-that-stuff, while the fire-in-itself cannot be secondary because you need a source for that second-class citizen called pain. Hence, you get the thing in itself, that is, what the fire is like when there are no observers around. When we have established that, and here is why the thing in itself is so stupid, we build on the notion and say that, for example, we cannot know if, say, we give the carbon atom such and such properties or if these properties are there without us. That is because when we give new properties to things, we cannot tell if these properties would appear as they appear to us when we are not around. Say we found a new property that the sun radiates this new mysterious energy, then we cannot know if the sun does that in the world in itself, so to speak. So now we are building on the in-itself, which is madness! Why is it madness? Because the thing in itself is by definition more inaccessible than God! So you have this thing you can never reach, this fiction of all fictions, and then you start to build on it! What a story! If that does not constitute as madness, then what!? If that does not constitute as going further into Fairyland, then what does? Why can\u2019t you instead consider some alternatives to the thing in itself first, before you install the most unsatisfactory, most ridiculous, and, apparently, most high! (i.e., higher than God, that is). You are inserting a thing that you do not have access to, so you are really playing with dangerous dynamite here. Would you bet your life on cutting a wire to a bomb that was labeled, \u201cUnknowable.\u201d? But Kant was religious, he had no problems with stuff like that. Me? I would cut the blue wire. Someone sane? He would run! What is the fire like when there are no observers around? Let us infer... Nope, still nonsense! No matter what my answer is here, it is completely nonsensical! E.g., the fire is like ones and zeros on a computer. But then we can ask, \u201cWhat are the ones and zeros like when there is no one around?\u201d And what is that like? And what is that like? And so on. You can say that you can\u2019t ask that. But that is exactly my point: You Kant ask that! Everything is an experience. There is nothing \u201cbeyond\u201d the experience because, if there were, then this \u201cbeyond\u201d would be \u201cin\u201d the experience, much like a key to a lock. If you want the key (in-itself) to be totally separated from the lock (the experience), then you have created a big \u201cvoid\u201d between the key and the lock, which is just nonsensical. The source of the pain has to connect at some point, therefore, it is all happening in the realm of experience. Q: Yes. There is a connection, but, we can never observe that connection; and that is the point. We are in the game world, we cannot see what is going on with the PlayStation. But, there is a connection between the PlayStation and the game world. They exist in the same reality. You see? A: Then you can know the in-itself. You can get to it, eventually. Q: What if you are a brain in a vat being fed the experience? A: ...Eventually! If everything is on one plane, one reality, then eventually you can access everything because you can move there. Source: https://euppublishingblog.com/2014/12/12/correlationism-an-extract-from-the-meillassoux-dictionary/ One more beer and you will change your mind about the woman in herself! How can the universe exist without me? I believe that all things are relationships. The pain is a relationship, that is, it cannot exist without my experience of it. Likewise, the universe cannot exist without my experience of it. That is, there is no thing in itself. That is, to talk about the universe as not being a relationship is just nonsense, in my humble opinion. There is no absolute reality; rather, everything flows. Everything is a relationship, like pain. That is, there cannot be two or more ways that Nature is wired. Therefore, the relationship-universe is all there is. At least, we cannot get outside the relationship. We are stuck in our brains. Ok. You say. You somewhat agree. What your senses do not, say, broadcast live, does not objectively exist. Likewise, the game world on your HDTV is generated as you move through the game world. But, you say, the game world also exists absolutely; it exists as, say, information on a disc. Note that the objective world, that is, the world that we perceive collectively as humans (aka the game world), ceases to exist the moment we humans cease to exist (when you quit playing), much like pain ceases to exist with the death of the human experiencing it. But the Absolute World must exist, or else science is in bad shape because science talks about events occurring in the objective world when there was no objective world, like the time of the formation of the Earth. Note that the Absolute World cannot exist as the Objective World because you need conscious observers (or a television) to create the Objective World; and, you need the Absolute World to exist whenever there are no humans around, like the formation of the Earth. Therefore, the Absolute World cannot exist as the Objective World, which means, when the Earth formed, it did not truly \u201cform\u201d because there were no conscious observers around; rather, the Earth formed as, poetically speaking, ones and zeroes in a world-in-itself. This is absurd! Can we save science? Can we go from our game world (where we live, the objective reality) and establish the existence of the software and the hardware of the, say, Heavenly PlayStation? The Heavenly PlayStation must exist, right? How else did the Earth form back in the days? My answer: There is no Heavenly PlayStation/Absolute World/thing in itself/primary qualities. We must preserve the Objective World even when there are no conscious observers around. But this is equally absurd! Nevertheless, I will try anyway because the Heavenly PlayStation or the thing in itself (i.e., primary qualities) is just nonsense. \u201cThe thing in itself,\u201d which is the thing without me, does it exist? No, if it is my pain. Yes, many will say, if we are talking about the universe. But I cannot believe this nonsense, so I believe otherwise: Primary qualities, qualities that are said to exist independent of an observer, like extension. Secondary qualities, qualities that are said to exist dependent of an observer, like pain. I believe that these are the same; there is only one order of qualities. But, if there is no source to give rise to your experience, then how can you have an experience? Granted, the game world and the true source, the PlayStation, might be radically different from one another, but, you still need a source/PlayStation, that is, primary qualities/thing in itself. Saving Science: The secondary qualities can act as the primary qualities/the source. Say that color is a label of the animal mind. Now the animal labels stuff green (green means \u201csafe,\u201d \u201cgood to eat,\u201d etc.), then other animals can take advantage of that, make camouflage, and hide in the first animal\u2019s mind/label! Imagine the whole history of this \u201cinternal evolution\u201d/arms race going on from the Big Bang. Say that the first \u201canimal\u201d is a primordial feedback loop (a torus?) that generates a rudimentary form of consciousness; call this thing the basic building block of Nature. Then this block comes out of the Big Bang. The block has the ability to copy itself. From this process stems the internal evolution and the expansion (i.e., copying) of the universe. In this way, we do not need the primary qualities because everything evolved inwardly, from relationship to relationship. There is only the relationship and nothing besides. You could say that the primal relationship is the thing in itself, but why bother? If my \u201cinternal evolution\u201d is true, then we are not evolving towards reality; we are evolving away from it. We are creating our own unique reality, i.e., a green forest and a blue sky. Why not \u201cpink forest\u201d and \u201cpink sky\u201d and a pink everything! Because color is a label. It does not exist \u201cout there.\u201d There is no \u201cout there.\u201d I.e., the primary qualities do not exist. It is all \u201cin here.\u201d If my \u201cinternal evolution\u201d is true, then objective reality goes all the way. Objective reality persists when there are no humans around because there are \u201cconscious atoms\u201d around. If there were not, then the Earth never formed because there is no way in hell that the nonsensical thing in itself is real. There is a whole web of relationships (i.e., internal evolution) that make up the objective world. Even though we humans weren\u2019t around, this web was. The web was around when the Earth formed. And that explains it. If everything is a relationship with us, then we cannot compare things as the way they appear to us with the way they are in themselves. That is, we can never know the thing in itself. If \u201cinternal evolution\u201d is true, then there is no thing in itself, so we don\u2019t have to worry about that. That is, knowledge becomes possible once more. The old view: We cannot get outside the relationship (our game world) in order to establish the \u201cHeavenly PlayStation.\u201d We are prisoners of our own flesh/game. My new view: Worse, we are prisoners of language. We even need to take a step back from Correlationism and see if language even does the job (see The Cave Wall People below). The table exists. I am sitting on it! This is not a fiction. Ok. Maybe \u201cthe table\u201d is a fiction because we are only dealing with atoms here, aren\u2019t we? But the atoms are real! Ok. Maybe the atoms are waves. Ok. But then it\u2019s math. Math is real. Ok. Infinite turtles, axioms and infinite paradoxes. Math is ugly. But even if this is all a fiction we created, then you cannot dispute the fact that the world is real, it exists! What? The world is a fiction. I don\u2019t believe it. Does pain exist independently of experience? No, because pain is an experience. Does the universe exist independently of experience? Yes, because ... Welcome to Correlationism. What? Correlationism is a fiction too? Language is like chess, it is a game we invented. It does not hack into the world. Rather, it is the world because the world is a game we invented. The world and history are language games. Or: Language is like fishing except language creates its own fishes and then casts the fishing rod. When somebody said, \u201cDo you think there is a god-fish in there?\u201d everybody replied: \u201cNo!\u201d What a fiction we dwell in. Source: Quentin Meillassoux\u2019s After Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency Paperback \u2013 January 5, 2010 After After Finitude: Becoming is not chaos! Being is the real chaos. Becoming is simply motion/flux. If you read \u201cAfter Finitude: An Essay on the Necessity of Contingency\u201d by Quentin Meillassoux, then please understand: He got it all wrong! Replace his \u201cbecoming\u201d with \u201cbeing,\u201d and then you are beginning to see the light! Heidegger too got it wrong. The early Wittgenstein. Everybody gets it wrong. By \u201cwrong\u201d I mean, something real instead of something fictitious. It is all fiction, folks. But that does not mean that it is \u201cbad.\u201d The work of Heidegger and etc., are of course marvelous accomplishments. Let me put it in other words: Motion is positive, meaning, it ever flows. Motion does not and will never know this thing called \u201cNOT.\u201d The negative is not there. It\u2019s just not there! (Get it?) Stop saying it is. The law of noncontradiction is just rubbish, and so Quentin fails because he relies on the nonsensical law. This law cannot tell us anything. It is just an ugly fabrication. However, it is useful. But that is besides the point! Heraclitus is the man. He rejected the whole law because, \u201cWe step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and we are not.\u201d Heraclitus would be APPALLED by this reasoning! This reasoning that destroys motion and fragments all of Nature, and creates infinite ugly paradoxes! Instead, I believe Heraclitus would say, \u201cWe step into the river.\u201d The end. The river does not know the \u201cnot\u201d because the river is just a river; it just flows, meaning it is undivided. Don\u2019t believe me? Just go down to your local river, put your hand in there and tell me, \u201cWhere in the name of freaking everything is the \u201cnot?\u201d\u201d It is there? No. Then WHY do you believe in it? You cannot divide the river into \u201cis\u201d and \u201cis not.\u201d The positive is a fiction too, but we had to use it as a stepping stone out of the maze. Without the \u201cnot,\u201d logic and math cannot function. Consequently, logic (and math) is not real for the river, the universe and everything. Logic (and math) really is an ugly, monstrous fabrication of man. Without the \u201cnot,\u201d you cannot have the law of noncontradiction either. \u201cWe step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and we are not.\u201d\u2014https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_noncontradiction The Cave Wall People: Everything is a lie. By Thor Fabian Pettersen (2017) Everything is a lie. Consequently, the world does not exist. Does Frodo Baggins exist? No. He does not exist. He is a fictitious character. Likewise, the world does not exist because it is a fiction. The world exists, Frodo exists, Gandalf the Grey exists, but they exist as fictional entities and therefore they do not really exist (if the word \u201creally\u201d can make you understand). Therefore, everything, or almost everything, is a lie because we believe that the world exists. What is not a lie is Frodo because we do not believe that he actually exists. What is a lie is the world, because we believe that this fictitious entity really exists when it does not. \u201cYou killed Mr. X.\u201d \u201cWe have proof.\u201d \u201cWe sentence you to death!\u201d \u201cGoodbye.\u201d There is no such thing as proof. Language cannot hook into reality when reality itself is a word! Language can only circle itself and bite its own tail. This is evident as we can only test statements with other statements. There is no reality to fish for. The so-called \u201cproof\u201d is only a language-game with rules we invented, like chess. Consequently, history is up to us. If, say, WW2 happened or not, it is up to us to write the fiction. History will not write itself, will it? In other words, culture is nothing but a meme-complex that acts like a virus in our apelike brain. We believe the lie. But once you step outside your virtual-bubble-matrix, you will see that culture is not your friend (Terence McKenna). Culture is a selfish, memetic animal that uses your brain as a tool. Once you escape this matrix, you will be so free. You can see for the first time in your life. \u201cDid YOU kill Mr. X?\u201d \u201cYes, I did!\u201d (So \u201cYOU\u201d is \u201cI?\u201d That is interesting...) Or, \u201cWait a minute. The world is a lie. Therefore, I simply attach the meaning \u201cyou\u201d to my mother, and then when they ask me, \u201cDid you kill...\u201d my brain shall interpret that as \u201cDid your mother kill...\u201d Then I can step back into the lie and honestly reply \u201cNo.\u201d because my mother did not kill Mr. X. Practice a thousand times, and the lie detector will believe me. And \u201ckill\u201d is a new slang for \u201chave sex.\u201d Muahahaha...!\u201d It is only when you believe the words that they have power over you. It is only when you believe the words are rooted in reality that they have power over you. \u201cDid you\u2014trillions of atoms that exploded into being FROM NOTHING AT ALL that evolved into a complex animal over BILLIONS of years, and it will all end in a Big Freeze by the way\u2014kill Mr. X?\u201d \u201cYes, we did!\u201d What do you believe, man? (Which path is the path on the bifurcated way?) Language works, not because it can tell the truth, but because it can tell a great lie that everybody can believe in. Everybody believes in it, and so we can work together. That is why language works. The truth is that the truth is yet another lie. Q: But language has to have something in common with \u201cthat which we see?\u201d A: Must a hammer have something in common with, say, birds, in order for the hammer to work? What is this thing that they have in common, the paradox of infinity? I see something familiar; I paint it on the cave wall. Why? Because I have already some ancestor memes that make me do it, which is to say that the sense-data do not start in perception. The sense-data are data, it is information, memes; it is geometric notions and etc. already built-in (into our brains). When you see a tiger, you jump. If the sense-data started in perception, then our early ancestors would not jump when they saw a tiger. \u201cBeautiful patterns. Let me paint those on the cave wall!\u201d \u201cYes, you do that while I eat you alive.\u201d If our brain generates the 3D landscape we find ourselves in, then the sense-data, such geometric notions as \u201ctree,\u201d \u201crock,\u201d \u201cbird;\u201d etc., might already be built-in, which is to say that the sense-data did not start in perception. Be real, \u201cperception\u201d is a word too. It was not our eyes that intersected the bison that let us draw the bison; it was the already built-in geometric notions in our brain that let us do it. Our eyes had to intersect the bison in order to draw the bison, but that is not the same as to say that the sense-datum (the geometric bison) started in our perception. Perception was the second, not the first. Just like color. Color is a label in the animal mind. Language, math, logic, these are tools. In addition, they are great tools. They define us as human beings. Nevertheless, they are tools. If you believe that they are something more than that, that is, if you believe that the world actually exists, then you are truly one with the cave wall and I cannot help you. The early Wittgenstein tried to nail language to the ground, so to speak. He couldn\u2019t do it because language floats in a circle above the ground\u2014and it can never touch the ground because language is biting its own ass instead. The early Wittgenstein said, \u201cThe world is all that is the case.\u201d Well, if that were true, then Wittgenstein would not have failed because he was a pretty smart dude. \u201cThe world is all that is NOT the case.\u201d That is, the world does not exist. We have no justification of our fragmentation of Nature. And, \u201cthat which we see\u201d are words (lies) also. Therefore, you must employ your eyes, which is another word! But, so what? It works. Q: But you are using language in order to escape the cave wall. A: Again, I am using my eyes in order to see what language is, instead of employing arguments and logic and get further trapped. I can see that the metaphysical world and the empirical world exist on the same piece of paper! They are the same. They are the exact same world. I can SEE that. The Heart of Fragmentation: \u201cIf you try and take a cat apart to see how it works, the first thing you have on your hands is a non-working cat.\u201d\u2015Douglas Adams That is exactly what happened. This act is the nature of any paradox. The act = any paradox. \u201cTruth and falsity\u201d are both fragmentations and equally absurd. We glue that cat back together and ask, \u201cIs this proposition X true or false?\u201d It can be neither because the cat is not alive in the first place! How can any proposition be true or false when its support (language) is not grounded in reality, has never been in touch with reality and will never be in touch with reality because reality is just another word. So your propositions are true or false based on a circle that keeps on evolving further into itself. The reason why the world does not exist is because \u201cthe world\u201d is a product of language and language is a poor reconstruction of \u201cthat which we see.\u201d \u201cThat which we see\u201d is like a cat, and then language takes that cat and chops it into pieces. We get a dead cat. Then language takes the pieces and glues the cat back together. We call this undead cat for: the world. We believe that it is actually alive. For example: We saw a bison and then we painted that bison on our cave wall. We fragmented nature. The bison we saw is undivided and flows in our eye. The bison we painted is fragmented and dead. \u201cThe bison is here. The bison walks. The bison is over there.\u201d Here, we have written bison THREE times in order to capture the undivided bison in our eye. Three fragmentations were needed to reconstruct what our eye did; which means that the \u201cbison\u201d consists of \u201cinfinite bison\u201d and \u201cinfinite\u201d paradoxes because you can write \u201cbison\u201d as many times you like, however you like and place it in a sentence however you like\u2014even if you get nonsense. Consequently, we get a poor reconstruction of \u201cthat which we see\u201d even if you used \u201cbison\u201d only once and in the \u201cproper\u201d manner. With such fragmentations, we essentially kill \u201cthat which we see,\u201d and with such grand death, we can create paradoxes and nonsense. The paradox is simply the fragmentation itself. Consequently, math and logic are the children of the paradox! I am sure that, when all is said and done, we get physicists proclaiming that the reason why the quantum was acting so weird is that the physicists were not dissecting the universe; they were in fact dissecting language because the \u201cuniverse\u201d is a word, a language-construct. That is, they believed that their little experiments were conducted outdoors, in nature, when, in fact, they never left the blackboard! That is because \u201cnature\u201d is a word, a language-construct. That is, in actuality, they never left the cave walls! \u201cThe bison is here. The bison flew up in the sky and did a somersault. The bison is over there.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe you!\u201d \u201cYou tell a lie.\u201d (And the THREE \u201cbison\u201d in the first sentence were the truth?) We are the people who live in the cave walls. We are The Cave Wall People. And we never left those walls. We evolved further into them! They said the devil was born in a cave. Now we believe that these walls are reality! Well, they are! because reality is a fiction. A fiction printed on stone. Nowadays, we carry the stone in our pockets. We call it a \u201ccell phone.\u201d Well, at least it has been given a proper name. \u201cThe big fish swallowed the small fish and then the small fish swallowed the big fish.\u201d In the cosmic river, \u201cbig fish\u201d (and small fish) would occur once and never again. Language, on the other hand, freezes Motion and so we can use \u201cbig fish\u201d (and small fish) multiple times, which create such bizarre pictures. You can say that the sentence is false, but that is the point, the cosmic river does not fragment the universe into true and false. The very ability to construct such bizarre pictures (\u201cThe big fish swallowed the small fish and then the small fish swallowed the big fish.\u201d) makes language fail so miserably. Consequently, the world is a lie. \u201cTrue and false\u201d are the childish attempts of man. That is, there is no good and evil. The only thing the word \u201cevil\u201d is good for is to create more suffering in the world by believing such fairy tales. How many have not been tortured beyond reason (not that reason should torture anyone) because the torturer believed their victim to be evil incarnate? I bet the number is huge, even to this day. Yes, my theories are fiction also. Still, they can work. And that is the point. \u201cP,\u201d or \u201cnot P,\u201d that is the question, but only when drinking! Words and worlds, they are not so different, which is why only a letter tells them apart. My music: search for Thor Fabian Pettersen on YouTube. Me playing the piano: A slice of Nirvana Taken from The Rabbit Hole\u2019s Greenroom, ISBN 978-82-690445-1-5 I was lying in my bed with my girlfriend. I was not asleep or anything. Then I woke up! Literally. So every day I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m dreaming awake!\u201d This universe is literally a dream. When the Buddha is telling us to wake up, it is not poetry, nor poetic talk. It is literal. Physicists have found that we may be living in a hologram of sorts, imagine when they discover that it\u2019s all a dream! I would like to see Brain Greene host that show! And, what is Nirvana like? Obviously, words don\u2019t cut it. And it\u2019s not like there is a sign that says: \u201cWelcome to Nirvana: The Land of the One.\u201d \u201cNirvana\u201d is just a word that I use. But let us paint a picture anyway. So, what is it like to be God? Answer: 100% natural. The analogy here is: You are dreaming, and then you wake up. When you wake up, you become yourself again. Likewise, it is 100% natural to be God. Because you are God. Know thyself. You wake up, literally. And when you wake up: There is no feeling of space and time. Your consciousness is light as a feather. It was a sober, pure and humble consciousness. God is not like Zeus! Or, to put it in other words: It was an AWESOME consciousness! You have no idea how awesome this is! It is a different perspective. Moving on: You do not have a body. You exist in this ocean of white light; but it is not external, it is not a place/space, it is your consciousness. You are bigger than the universe, to put it like that. You are in another dimension. You are no longer human or, you are something \u201cmore.\u201d And you are the only one who exists; so, naturally, you do not care about other people. Everything is ok and will always be ok. You are immortal. You just are. End of story. That is, you know how everything is composed like you know you are conscious. It is a knowing. But let us not digress. \u201cOther people\u201d = illusion. And you do not care about phantasms! No help will come from God because ... you are God! Likewise, your physical body cannot help you when you are off in dreamland. But there are other ways the body can help you. So help will come. But, the point is, it is not like you think! Like any dream, you will wake up. It happened to me. To be God is not scary; it is the most natural thing in [beyond] the universe. And you evolve. It is not like you are static. But one thing is for sure: Human consciousness is HEAVY! Something you will experience upon reentry to this dreamland we call the universe. But Nirvana is white light and what you would call home. Real home. But there is no \u201ctelevision.\u201d Thus, the notion that God is creating this universe so that he can experience things (evolve) is really what I felt too. However, there was a deeper purpose to it. I had to go back to sleep. I had to. Sleeping, that is, being awake in the universe, was important, like a job that needed to be done. Update: By \u201cAnd you evolve\u201d I mean that: it felt, upon awakening, that my life or experience as a human, contributed to the wealth or knowledge pool of Nirvana. \u201cWhite light\u201d is not accurate because you may experience a white light as a human, and the two experiences are not the same. \u201cGod is creating\u201d I mean \u201cdreaming.\u201d The real Creator of the Dream (i.e., the Demiurge) might be \u201cinside\u201d the dream, like a subconscious aspect of the real dreamer\u2019s brain. Note that I was awake for a split second, so I am really the lousiest Buddha in history. My journey really began when I was a child. I was terrified of the Illuminati even then. It was my mom\u2019s white closet which had an orange, almost glowing knob with a black \u201ceye.\u201d I called it \u201cthe bank\u201d (in Norwegian: banken), and I was terrified of it! I always knew that I had lived before (maybe this very life) and that I would come to know the beginning of time, which I eventually did: the cuboctahedron. Then my Nirvana experience reinforced my childhood beliefs! I believed strongly that \u201cI have been this way before.\u201d (Neil Diamond) aka the time loop of David Icke. You should really try to understand the real Icke, and not the \u201cNutty Icke\u201d meme flying across cyberspace. \u201cI have been this way before.\u201d\u2014https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_wPrsUN1Gw We saw the beginning of time: the cuboctahedron. We saw the end of time: the cuboctahedron as an evolved creature, viz., the One in Nirvana. We saw the intermediate time: our universe, viz., the dream of the One. This is all there is to reality. Of course, there are many layers and details! Nevertheless, big picture is that the One is like a shark in the ocean, meaning that the One is not evolving. Evolution stops here, as it were. All that is left now are the dreams of the One. Look in the mirror and muse. Learn to see. See the illusion. Let it Break Your Mind. Nirvana is an island, a shelter in the center. Nirvana is the ocean and, the whirlpool is the Matrix. The Matrix has you. The Matrix is the multiverse. The Demiurge. Samsara. And God wants you home. No suffering is necessary. We are caught in a storm. Trapped by illusion. Maya. God does not care for what you did, or didn't do. Any father would help his children out of the storm. Seek his help. Study the art of sacred geometry. Two toruses make nothingness and matter. Use your eyes. And then escape the language-matrix. The final Matrix. Eat the food of the gods! Seek the eye of the torus, the vacuum of space! Your heart. Escape the circle. Exit the carousel! Fairyland is not home. Become like the Buddha. Seek home. We are all one. We are immortal. Wake up. It's just a dream. One last: Q: Ok. One last free energy con: You need something to put in in order to get something out. You crackpots need to understand that! Do you? A: You talk like I\u2019m a virgin or something! I am a father, you know. I know. Trust me. I know! Ok. To continue my rebuttal here: Albert Einstein: \u201cThe man of science is a poor philosopher.\u201d \u201cFree\u201d means getting something without giving something. I am sorry, but that is a BAD idea about what free energy is. Free energy has always been the dream of sitting in your car and drive it forever without filling the gasoline. How can this happen if you start being a man of science AND a man of philosophy? One example (there are others) is from a man who is both, Roger Penrose. Google his ccc model. In it, everything goes through this resurrection process; but, it is the universe as a whole that revives, so you can\u2019t use it because obviously your car is a part of the whole that revives. However, you can imagine marrying Roger Penrose to, say, Benoit Mandelbrot. Then you get the effect that the part is the whole, so now Penrose\u2019s resurrection can happen to individual atoms and, Nature\u2019s resurrection machine can fit into your car because of this fractal reality. That is, you don\u2019t need to fill the gasoline because the \u201cgasoline\u201d is coming to you. That is a dream of fucking freedom! I am not saying that this is possible, but, if it is, then you get free energy in the sense of driving your car forever without violating the \u201cgetting something without giving something\u201d because the input stems from the dead matter that is recycled. In this way, Nature is immortal, not because she cannot die, but because she can resurrect herself. That is, finding the beginning of time gives you the ultimate freedom. Now you are the ruler of the first principle (viz., resurrection) in Nature, and you can do anything! But, what does it matter when the man of science is a poor philosopher. What I mean by that is this: The concept of energy today is like, you start with \u201ca big ball of fire,\u201d and then, if you want to do work, the ball loses energy; eventually, all will be dead. Ok. But where did the \u201cbig ball\u201d come from if the second law of thermodynamics rules? It came from a Big Bang. Where did the Big Bang come from? Er ... nothing! Ok. You are telling me that free energy is bullshit when you can\u2019t even make sense of the Origins of the Universe? That is so dishonest. That is so unscientific. Philosophically musing, don\u2019t you need a bigger ball to birth the \u201cbig ball\u201d if the second law of thermodynamics rules? And then you need a bigger ball and so on forever\u2014and you will sit on a big ball that is ever increasing to Eternity! And this is the sanest picture of the world? Or, you could become a philosopher for once and realize that you need a Prime Mover. This Prime Mover is Nature\u2019s inherent ability to resurrect. Now we end the infinite regress and we get a sensible answer to the question, \u201cHow come we are here after all these Aeons of time if Nature ever runs down?\u201d Roger Penrose answers that. But I am thinking: With 20 000 children dying each day, with Global Warming descending upon us, with the rainforest cut down; with all the fucking misery that happens every single day because the man of science is a poor philosopher, could we not invest a tiny dollar on free energy? It is not asking for much! At the end of the day, though, you can argue that we can\u2019t marry Roger Penrose to Benoit Mandelbrot because Benoit Mandelbrot is literally dead! To believe that Nature\u2019s first principle is resurrection is not a crackpot belief. Yet, we free energy enthusiasts are labeled as crackpots... Man of philosophy: In philosophy, we DEFINE what we mean by such and such. Free energy shall = the ability to drive your car forever without filling the gasoline. Is it possible? Yes/no. Man of science: No. It is not possible because you can\u2019t get something without giving something. Man of philosophy: OMG! You are being so stupid right now! That is NOT what I asked! Man of science: Well, I HATE philosophy! I can\u2019t fucking understand it! Man of philosophy: Well, I HATE your FUCKING CAT! Is it dead or alive? It drives me nuts up the wall! Man of science: Well ... good! Man of science: In any case, you need to repair your car when it breaks down, so it\u2019s not \u201cfree.\u201d Man of philosophy: Oh my god, little brother, who made you in charge of the world? This YouTube video greatly summarizes the gap between the man of science and the man of philosophy: Lawrence Krauss is just clueless! A man with a PhD is clueless! It is really fascinating! It is so sad to contemplate this \u201cgap.\u201d I believe we could end untold misery if this gap wasn\u2019t there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNh-pY3hJnY Albert Einstein: \u201cThe man of science is a poor philosopher.\u201d\u2014https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/einstein-philscience/ What do you think, can we marry Roger Penrose to Benoit Mandelbrot. Could it work? That is what I want to know. If it does not work, I have other ideas. I do like Lawrence Krauss. Don\u2019t get me wrong. But, imagine if Lawrence Krauss\u2014the Professor of Nothingness himself\u2014could go back to school and study philosophy. That would be powerful! The Man of Science merged with the Man of Philosophy. You don\u2019t mess with that guy! If Moray and etc. = bullshit Q: Where is your contraption, we would love to see it. A: I do the philosophy bit, so I have not got one. Sadly, I am not an engineer. All I can give you is a link: http://doctorkoontz.com/Scalar_Physics/Energy/index.htm To be fair, I have been working on my own philosophy of free energy and I haven\u2019t really been digging into other peoples\u2019 work and contraptions. I searched the net and found that most physicists think that free energy is bullshit, but I needed to find one that didn\u2019t think this way. His name was Bob (or Robert?) Koontz. I saw his credentials and thought that this man is for real: http://doctorkoontz.com/bio/Deep_Background/index.htm He is not a crackpot and I believed his word on the contraptions he displays on his website, especially since I am not trained in physics. You cannot really blame me on this since I do not read physics, so to speak. But somehow I believe that Koontz is really smart and that he would rebuke the naysayers, if given the chance. I did not start out with an interest in free energy at all, I was oblivious to it; for my part, free energy was obvious bullshit because a sheep believes whatever the other sheep believe. But then a radical new idea dawned on me, and I saw how free energy can actually be real if we redefine free energy as the dream to drive your car forever without filling the gasoline\u2014because that is what it is really all about! My idea simplified, is this: If we came from the beginning of time and, if the beginning of time is always ordered and, if there are pockets or holes in the universe directly leading to the beginning of time, say, as remnants of the Big Bang, then old material in the universe can find these pockets and merge with the beginning of time once more, and then the beginning of time will revive the old stuff because the beginning of time is always ordered. Then the revived stuff can find its way out of the beginning of time as it once did. If the beginning of time is, say, the heart of any dual torus and, if you can find a dual torus that can fit into your car, then the beginning of time can feed your car recycled stuff that stems ultimately from the universe itself. The beginning of time is something of the past, according to our models today; but what if the beginning of time can never die for the philosophical reason that Nature has to be immortal somehow or else we would not, statistically speaking, be here. That is, if Nature could die, she would have done so, end of story. Or as Nietzsche said, \u201cIf the world had a goal, it must have been reached. If there were for it some unintended final state, this also must have been reached. If it were in any way capable of a pausing and becoming fixed, of \u201cbeing,\u201d then all becoming would long since have come to an end, along with all thinking, all \u201cspirit.\u201d The fact of \u201cspirit\u201d as a form of becoming proves that the world has no goal, no final state, and is incapable of being.\u201d\u2014http://nietzsche.holtof.com/Nietzsche_the_will_to_power/the_will_to_power_book_IV.htm This bit of poetic philosophy tells you that Nature cannot die. If the beginning of time can never die, then it is with us, even today. And so we can manipulate it. Basically, my idea is the bold idea of placing a miniature model of Immortal Nature in our car. We need to replace old bits of the car as it falls apart, but needless to say, you could drive this car until your will wears out! Now, imagine going into space with this free energy device. We would not need to tank up. Alternatively, if Nature can die, truly die, then we are all screwed forever. Or we could stay positive and try what Nikola Tesla said, \u201cEre many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by power obtainable at any point in the universe. It is a mere question of time when men will succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of nature.\u201d\u2014 http://www.newenergymovement.org/ And manipulating (not really) the beginning of time itself! must surely count as \u201cattaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of nature.\u201d We thus fulfill Tesla\u2019s dream. The Gate to Paradise: Note: I am not a technical guy, so I cannot create free energy. But, if I can show him the door, then maybe he can pick the lock! That is, I hope a bit of philosophy can help you on your journey to free energy. If not, then what am I doing? I will end with: Q: Cannot chaos birth the universe? The Great Becoming. A: Sure, but in this book, I have focused on another explanation for the Origins of Everything. But note that the cuboctahedron is a formless thing. ",

We know by and large practically all the members they ever had - about 1350 people - all their bios here: Mitglieder des Illuminatenordens. There are a dozen or so unidentified names: people where we know the internal code names but have not got an identification or people who only left an unspectacular last name without a chance to do the identification 250 years later. The unknown are all totally irrelevant - people who were mentioned once in a side remark or as someone the Order might want to accept. What did they do? Meet every month, discuss topics of the enlightenment, write essays to discuss (much like pupils today). They understood themselves as a Freemasonic reform group. The difference between them and Freemasons? They communicated in letters with an organisation they would not come to know - and that was the central problem in the end. The order disintegrated top down in 1787/88. The members realised that the higher levels became inactive and continued to be Freemasons (you had to be a Freemason to be a proper member of the Order). The end did not come as a surprise. Germany was reading the papers Bavaria had published and they were reading Weishaupt\u2019s apologetic counter-publications. Weishaupt himself had left the Order in 1787 and the rest of the higher hierarchy followed - not because the Order was illegal (it was not outside Bavaria) but because it was clear that the practical organisation of such a secret organisation was time consuming and not very rewarding.
