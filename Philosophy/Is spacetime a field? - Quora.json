            "answer_text": "Yes and no. This is an expanded version of a reply I made to a question in Jay Whacker\u2019s answer. In \u201cordinary\u201d field theory such as the Standard Model (and its particular components such as electromagnetism) & general relativity, spacetime is the base-space of various bundles (& perhaps sheaves) that appear in all matter & gauge theory models: E&M, electroweak, strong interaction (QCD), grand-unified models, and including general relativity where, with some technical caveats, the metric (and/or the Christoffel symbol) on the spacetime manifold is the section in question. So, the \u201cunderlying spacetime\u201d that is the base-space over which these various bundles (& perhaps sheaves) are defined is not itself a \u201cfield\u201d\u2014after all, that field would need its own base-space over which to \u201clive.\u201d However, citing Einstein\u2019s \u201ctime is what we measure with clocks\u201d adage, that underlying spacetime (the base-space of the various bundles) is a construct, reverse-engineered from observations of the sections. So, while spacetime (as that underlying base-space) is not itself a field, our only recourse to gathering information about it is through fields, so that it is, in this \u201cphysical\u201d sense, defined in terms of fields. Resonant with this thought (and echoing Korzibsky\u2019s \u201ca map is not the territory\u201d) is also the realization that \u201cspin\u201d of the various particles is not at all the spinning of anything. The spin of an electron is a reverse-engineered concept: what we can measure is the magnetic moment of an electron, and we can ascribe it to a multiple (by the gyromagnetic ratio) os a quantity called \u201cspin\u201d which has some fantastically useful properties including: Unlike the magnetic moment (since the gyromagnetic ratios are non-integral and differ from particle to particle), \u201cspin\u201d satisfies simple and robust algebraic relations known as the \u201cangular momentum algebra.\u201d\u201cSpin\u201d is a characteristic of the representation theory of the Poincar\u00e9 group of linear transformations of spacetime. [I hope, you see the connection with the question at hand]To echo Voltaire, if it did not exists, we\u2019d have to invent it!  In string theory, there exists a more fundamental/underlying level of understanding reality: the world-sheet (field theory) level. At this level, what we normally mean by \u201cspacetime\u201d is spanned by the vacuum expectation values of ordinary scalar fields = sections of certain line bundles, the total number of which equals the dimension of what we normally mean by \u201cspacetime.\u201d Line bundles over what base-space, you ask? Over the manifold of the world-sheet, the 1+1-dimensional intrinsic spacetime of strings, spanned by their spatial extent and their own, intrinsic, proper time. So, in string theory, there is an \u201cunderlying 1+1-dimensional spacetime\u201d upon which our spacetime lives. But, as this answer is stretching looong, perhaps a peek into \u201cAdvanced Comcepts in Particle and Field Theory\u201d might be of help? ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, but some explanation is in order. There are things called \u201cfield gravities.\u201d In these, an ordinary field is proposed to cause gravity. Any changes in time or space are presumed to be consequential. Most of these field gravities (proposed by people like Feynman, Puthoff and many others) are illustrative or pedagogical or thought experiments. It is fairly easy to get them to explain time dilation, but not so easy to get them to explain spatial distortions. (For my thoughts on solving this problem see here) So, a field would influence matter and energy. Without success at formulating a field which does this in a way compatible with observations of space-time (particularly observations of space, e.g. Shapiro delay), it has been conceded for the time being that we\u2019ll consider space-time itself to be the field. This has worked for general relativity, a large scale classical theory. But attempting to quantize space-time has led to insoluble problems. The path integral diverges, becomes infinite in a way that cannot be renormalized. Making space-time \u201cthe field\u201d lacks a constructive or quantum understanding and limits our progress. It also leads to possibly spurious ideas about wormholes and warp drives and even time travel, which if not true amount to a return to fantasy and wishful thinking. Einstein gave his reasons for not proposing a constructive theory (special or general) in a Nov. 1919 NY Times article. The theory of matter was not sufficiently well developed. Currently, using quantum field theory, it could probably be done. But changing the mindset is hard. ",
