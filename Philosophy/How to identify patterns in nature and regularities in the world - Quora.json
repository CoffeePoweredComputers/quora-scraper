            "answer_text": "Linguistic patterns The most ancient one would be that you describe verbally all of a set of animals, take the descriptions back to the lab and you notice that they all the descriptions have something in common, or most of them.Physical patterns your eyes just pick out the fact that two rocks are significantly similar. Back in the lab you find out what it is they share.Instrumentation. You bring a selection of bark pieces from forests in various parts of the world. When you do you find that all the members of a set from a single forest have a shared interesting composition.Dreams. A famous case involves the double helix, the rough supportive structure of genetic materials whose details had escaped researchers. You suddenly see that it must be double helix. Nobel stuff. But later the discoverer reports having had a dream of a double helix the night before the solution occurred to him. James Watson.Emotional outbursts, things someone says quite unconnected to the research and the scientist hears them and runs back to the lab cursing.Play: You are playing with blocks with your young sun. One of them falls off the castle. You think about it \u2026 it did not fall straight down and you had been ignoring that error in the lab. A correction solves the problem. Buy the kid a popsicle.Look up De Broglie\u2019s greatest discovery and how it happened.8. Serendipity: You\u2019ve got a bunch of frog legs hanging over your lab table, hanging from, lets say, a copper wire. You touch one of them with a zinc blade and WHAAAAT? it twitches, comes to life and twitches. Works with the other ones too. Alessandro Volta has made a huge discovery that changes the world. Alessandro Volta has found batteries in frogs legs. Very Italian. All these need to be checked but the message won\u2019t change. Usually, discovery happens by surprise after extremely hard work. Usually. My discovery of the flaws in Ordinary Language Philosophy happened as me and my three year old were trying to reach the Moon with longer and longer \u201cMoon Sticks\u201d. That insight got me a PhD. Moon Sticks! We got up to ten feet long, waving them in the air until Forbes said \u201cDad \u2026 longer.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "To begin you will need to study the Feigenbaum constant. It represents the progression of natural processes. A ratio of 3-1-3. It traces a process from the singularity through the dimensional world we live in. It is a universal pattern. An example is human life. A range of up to 146 years. Divide 146 by 2 the ratio becomes 73\u20131\u201373. Normalize this to a scale of 1 to 100. ",
