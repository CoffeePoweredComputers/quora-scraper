            "answer_text": "We only have slight control over what will happen in the next few moments, this is based on the limits of our physical abilities, knowledge and past experiences\u2026. I remember when I was in my teen years, me and my friends all road BMX bikes and we would learn how to freestyle all these tricks one that I had a hard time learning was an Ariel 360 or 180 pulling your front wheel up off the ground then the rear and turning the bike around a full 360 degrees while in the air .. I finally learned how to do this but not until my early 20\u2019s . My friends had a lot to do with my confidence and how saw myself.. when I did finally do the trick I learned that I didn\u2019t do it like everyone else. The way I was being told to do it didn\u2019t work for me . Another time we were all in the mountains snow boarding, I didn\u2019t listen to anyone instructing me on how to ride a snowboard I just did it my way and it worked I was doing fine until a friend. Road by me and laughing said what are you doing that\u2019s not how your supposed to do it and instructed me to do like he was doing I tried and instantly fell and broke the bindings. In school I never passed the 8th grade .. but later got my GED without studying for it. went to college and dropped out after a few months . Then in the early 90s started build computers from scratch, I learned how just from reading a few magazines. I play piano and keyboards by ear .. when I try to read sheet music I fail horribly.. can you see the pattern in my learning? At the moment I am homeless.. but I also help a few people run there businesses .. I do there billing I will wright up a job proposal / estimate or take care of invoices. I market and advertise there services or products. All of which I taught my self how to do with no help from YouTube.. I am a painter by trade taught from my father and am very good at what I do .. I have painted commercial buildings and homes all over Colorado.. I wouldn\u2019t say anything is possible with the right mind set .. you have to be passionate about what your doing and I don\u2019t know anyone that is passionate about everything.. if you were Born with a small skeletal frame and are skinny your chances of becoming a sumo wrestler are slim .. if you have no passion for sports then become a baseball or football player is slim if solving mathematical problems bore you then becoming a rocket scientist is slim and if you have no passion for playing a musical instrument or a voice that sounds like a frog being a rockstar will be slim . And I know of nobody that is all of these at the same time .. ",

            "answer_text": "I assume that the term \u201cbelieve in themselves\u201d refers to having confidence in their abilities to succeed at anything they put their mind to. Perhaps we should look to the most prominent example of this being a fallacy - Donald Trump. Regardless of political affiliation, anyone honestly assessing his ability to govern must come to the conclusion that he has conned a large swath of the American electorate. His immature tantrums, his problems with language and expressing himself, his egomaniacal ramblings, his obvious lack of knowledge regarding international trade and relations, his constant need to blame others for his shortcomings, combined with a long history of business failures, does nothing to diminish his belief that he is the most successful president in history. He is a reflection of the voters who want simple answers to complex issues. If only it was that easy. That fact that many people still support his anti-science positions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic may become the most tragic act of self-harm ever committed by the US citizenry. It is sobering to contemplate what the post-pandemic world will look like but especially in the US, where the sheep go willingly to slaughter. ",
