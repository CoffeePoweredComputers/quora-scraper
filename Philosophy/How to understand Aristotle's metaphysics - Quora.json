            "answer_text": "There is no \u201cunderstanding\u201d Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics, there are only many attempts at doing so. The book itself cannot be restricted to one single interpretation; it is too multifaceted and difficult to understand for there to be only one way to analyze it. That said, there are \u201ctraditions\u201d of interpretations, i.e. schools of thinkers who have interpreted it one particular way. For instance, the Catholic Thomist tradition has largely interpreted it at supporting a standard substance-accident metaphysics, where \u201cbeing\u201d is said to pertain to matter-form composites. But there are many other schools of interpretation, such as the Hegelian or the Heideggerian. Myself, I tend to think that the Thomistic interpretation best follows the plain intention of the text, and is thus likely to be the most faithful interpretation out there, on the basic of fidelity to the text alone. The key is to actually read the Metaphysics and develop your own interpretation, or else adhere to one school of interpretation or another. Myself, I tend to think that Aristotle did not develop a definitive metaphysics in this book, especially because the principal book on being, Book VII, does not end in a definitive statement of what it means to be, or perhaps that which is principally said to be, and therefore he has no intention of becoming dogmatic, but rather exploratory and tentative. I believe this interpretation is supported by the fact that Aristotle does not appeal to any metaphysics in any of his other works, save perhaps the Physics. If he had had a definitive metaphysics, I think we would have seen him using it in many places in order to make his explanations easier and more consistent. But he does not do this, and in all of his particular \u201csciences\u201d, he seeks their own specific principles and does not seek to bring in any \u201csuperordinant\u201d principles that would put everything in its place.
