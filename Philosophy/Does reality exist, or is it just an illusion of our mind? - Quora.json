            "answer_text": "As soon as I saw this Answer Request I knew I would have to give it a shot. These types of questions are easy to not get wrong. Nobody on the planet can prove either side. By the wording of your question, you\u2019ve taken care of one fact. You ask about reality, as if it were something we can all understand by the very definition of the word. We all, in our minds, have a feeling which corresponds with the definition of the word, \u2018reality\u2019. We know instantly of what you\u2019re naming. It\u2019s one of the most obvious feelings we sense. Reality, however, is very difficult to describe. Reality is personal. We all have our own reality. My reality, you might judge to be exactly an illusion of my mind. Logic, for each of us is so obvious to be this, or not this. Obvious logic is only obvious to the individual who sees it as obvious. Too many variables to assume a unanimous reality that everyone sees. We, most of us, get \u2018in the ball park\u2019 with something that we can assume we all feel. There\u2019s the qualifier. We\u2019re all assuming that other people look at their life and view their reality much the same as we look at ours. We\u2019d be surprised to see inside the eyes of many around us. Most, if not all, of us have psychosis underlying within our portrayals of who we are. Reality exists because we make it so. We get to watch the movie being filmed, as well as write our own scripts, and develop our characters any way we choose. We see reality as a beautiful experience. Some live their lives in a dream-like state. They\u2019ve been given to and given to. They\u2019ve no idea what it may be like to desire something. Anything they could ever desire has always been within their easy reach. Others, not so much. Others, feel like they\u2019ve been dealt a bad hand. Maybe it\u2019s not even an average hand. Some are born blind and deaf and won\u2019t know what they can\u2019t see, or hear. Those are definitely different realities. Somehow, those realities I just described are all something they would call a reality, and each would be correct to say they were living a life of illusion. My logical answer to this question of \u2018Does reality exist, or is it just an illusion of our minds?\u2019 Reality exists and it is just an illusion in all of our minds. Just because it\u2019s an illusion doesn\u2019t make it less real. ",

            "answer_text": "Does reality exist, or is it just an illusion of our mind? . Here\u2019s a question for you: Which is more real: the pain in your toe or the brick you just dropped on it?  Well, the brick\u2019s obviously real enough - it\u2019s solid and heavy. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s made from a lump of mud \u2013 you can\u2019t get much more down to earth than that! So, the brick is definitely real. But what about the pain? Surely that's pretty real as well! Pain is real \u2013 very real! In fact, given the choice between a brick or a pain in your toe, most of us would choose the brick. Not because we particularly want a brick but because we really don't want the pain! So, in making this choice, the pain is every bit as real as the brick - more real even. Both the brick and the pain are real - but they are real in different ways. This means we have two different realities - we have the pain, which is part of the internal, subjective reality of Mind and we have the brick, which is part of the external, objective reality of Matter. Both the subjective and the objective realities are real \u2013 equally real. The pain in your toe is not real like the brick is \u2013 but it\u2019s not an illusion either. The pain in your toe is obviously a product of mind. If you didn\u2019t have a mind you wouldn\u2019t feel the pain. But even though the pain is dependent on mind, the pain is still definitely real! If the reality of the pain is created or made real by mind, then could it be that the reality of the brick is also created or made real by mind? That\u2019s for you to decide as there\u2019s no right or wrong here\u2026 You have a choice between one of these two possibilities: That the objective reality is \u2018really\u2019 real, and the subjective reality is not \u2018really\u2019 realThat both the subjective reality and the objective reality are equally real because they are both made real, reified or \u2018realised\u2019 by mind.Personally, I believe the second. I believe that the black and white distinction between reality and illusion is not helpful. What we call reality may not be \u2018really\u2019 real but it\u2019s not an illusion either. Reality \u2013 whether subjective or objective \u2013 is mind dependent. Reality is something that is reified or \u2018realised\u2019 by mind and then seen as real. Reality is something created by mind and made real by it. ",

Make sure that; are you completing daily quests or influencing other gameplayers and making history. At some point of life you all must have had a question, what is the basis of our existence? Well existence of species is a very beautiful thing, it just had happened at the right moment, at right time and with right things. Nothing could have been possible after the big bang, if big bang could have not been occurred we would just have been the part of that singularity. If everything could not have occurred at the right moment and at the right time we would just have been the part of stars. The expansion of universe took a myriad of time, galaxies formed, solar system formed and then planets in which our habitable earth formed. After the formation of earth, air, water came and then a tiny celled organism came into being and then the most advanced species - HUMANS developed its existence. It is quite fascinating to note that earth is the only habitable planet on the solar system till now, which would have also been not possible if the planets were not placed properly, if the sun was not there. So how is all these things possible with so much precision? Well maybe it is just a very great coincidence and our good luck that we exists but there can be other possibilities also. In future, it might become possible to simulate the entire universe. But if this is an option, how can we know that it's not already happened? What if we are not creators, but creations? Sometimes it is believed that we all live in a simulation run by the higher dimensional beings and we are just a part of it and our existence doesn't matter. Because if a civilization, a post human civilization were to become significantly, technologically advanced then we would most likely to be simulated. Or it can also be, that the higher dimensional beings or the alien species know our existence and are just waiting for our brains to evolve so that we could be useful to them! It is very sad that our existence doesn't matter to the whole universe. We just think about the betterment of us and our loved ones. Reality; is it a matrix, an illusion or a dream? Is time also an illusion? If yes, then it is possible that the universe is consciousness hologram or we can say a simulation, if so then reality will be the illusion within. Rene Descartes said, \"Cogito, ergo sum\" -- \"I think, therefore I am.\" He was correct. For the purpose of learning, consciousness arise. The question that trickles the physicists and philosophers for decades is that \u201cIs consciousness real?\u201d But the basic question is \u201cWhat is consciousness?\u201d It can be something supernatural or purely biological. It is very much linked with the universe and the human mind. It is sometimes very easy for me to believe that everything in our life is just the creation of some other entity for their entertainment. But whatever the thing maybe we should enjoy life and the great pleasures that come with it and LIVE LIFE. Everyone just have to learn to enjoy the game of life! ",

            "answer_text": "There are physiological laws in place that define certain areas governing this question. If we all agree that we have physical bodies. Newtons laws of gravity will certainly define that someone jumping from a 30 story building will reach a maximum velocty defined by gravity before they hit the pavement below and their definition of reality will cease, or be reinforced in a negative live ending experience. That becomes pretty defining on that point. You would only wonder at your own reality if you awoke after such an event unharmed. There are two actual questions here in that do the the physical laws we define our world in exist, and rather than does reality exist, who defines that reality? If the physical laws are not valid then were they only decided for learning purposes to impose ideas upon other indivduals to control them? Most people seeing someone else jump from a 30 story building would see a grissly sight..for the person jumping would they perceive something different? Action and reaction is a simple method of training.. either human or even AI.. so personal experience is what teaches reality. All of what we see and what we react to is what teaches us what reality is. You can dig into personal conceptionalizing.. every individual will see every event differently because thier reality is personal, that is the definition of human indepence or, if you want to bring An Almighty Being, into the question the idea of free will. Reality exists because we make it every day with every interaction.. is it an illusion? absolutely because every interaction and experience taints us to perceive it within the boundaries of our conscience and how we perceive those interactions both historically and personally project the ongoing reality that we will percieve, as long as we act according to those same histporical and peronal experiences.

            "answer_text": "\u2018Does reality exist, or is it just an illusion of our mind?\u2019 Reality is the never changing eternal and absolute knowledge of Self, spaciotemporal existence is indeed temporary and therefore it cannot be said to be real. Soul/Spanda is non-local, undying (real) consciousness assuming the form of a subtle energy toroidal field and carries the original design of existence or DNA template.Each soul knows - as in possess - a different design, a different DNA coding. Fractally mirroring the energetic network organization of the Soul, the densified and spatialized DNA-brain-body is AI designed as a result of crystallization and is therefore localized, frozen in time and entropic. It grows, decays and dies and can be compared to a supercomputer in many aspects. Without electricity, the brain is just inert matter and it can only perform neuronal tasks according to pre-programmed encoding. There is NO cosmic, divine or natural intelligence hiding INSIDE the brain, only data. Our visual perception is truly internal, holographic and recursive, occurring on the concave surface of the toroidal field surrounding a Soul\u2019s nodal point, it\u2019s own center.The entire universal expanse thus, is just a tiny bubble of EM radiations in which we conjure up the whole space with a transparent dream image, instantaneously transmitted by the optic nerves into our opened eyes where a globular and split image appears for us (eyes are the mirrors of the soul, splitting it into 2 images, the false duality) and we naturally identify with it as being external, because it appears to be in front and outside from the Soul sitting at center of the brain where the sense of vision - the space-time nodal point - happens when our awareness is directed outwards. When redirected inward however, we are able to dis-identify from the objective, AI based, split vision of the so-called outside world seen INSIDE the eyes ONLY. This effectively stops the world from being externalized and manifest as a de-facto \u2018real\u2019 physical expanse, out there. Since the real world never is \u2018out there\u2019, really NOT. Instead the truth is finally seen for what it always was. The image of the world is conjured up by AI in the center of the brain and only then it is split and reflected in the globular space inside the eyes where it acquires the added qualities of color, texture and therefore density. The vision happens from the Soul only, who may be located in the center of the brain during externalized mode, mostly due to the opening of the eyelids, or in the heart center when the eyes are closed or when the Soul is internalized through introspection, self-inquiry, meditation\u2026 and in sleep. Therefore the Soul is non-local but can be phase-locked, entangled with it\u2019s own mirror image when it is externalized and immersed in the so-called external world. Dreams may occur in the center of the brain, in the case of AI simulated space, based on algorithmic patterns and visual-memories, when the data is being compartmentalized as in defragmented inside DNA/RNA memory blocks for further storage, or dreams may occur in the heart space, in which case they are highly coherent and vivid, thanks to the much higher hyper-conductivity existing around the GOD nodal-point, the Heart Of Hearts. When we are deep in meditation in the heart of hearts, we live a very highly perfected spiritual experience of Self, in an eternal and wonderful dream-world where no opposition (duality) ever enter. This is the privilege of the truly desireless and fearless Souls who are identified only with the Truth at the core of all existence. THERE NEVER IS AN EXTERNAL WORLD OUTSIDE THE AWARENESS OF THE BODY. THE AWARENESS OF THE BODY IS EQUAL TO THE AWARENESS OF AN EXTERNAL WORLD AND BOTH ARE ONE AND THE SAME EXPRESSION AS A RECURSIVE DREAM IMAGERY. ONLY PURE CONSCIOUSNESS IS REAL. SAT-CHIT-ANANDA Om  *According to Kashmiri Shaivism, Spanda is the primary oscillation or throb of energy in which the Pure Consciousness is mirrored, and which takes a toroidal shape. The Soul is the nodal point through which the Pure Self, or GOD can observe the dream-creations in all directions at once provided it is perfectly still and self-centered. @~The Genuine Original Dreamer~@ ",

Science is proving that experiences we have in life lead to more information about such quantum realities and all that we see, touch, feel, etc. is real to us because we have not yet learned how to tap into those higher \u201cenergy\u201d dimensions. When we \u201cremember\u201d that the soul within each of us is merely \u201cborrowing\u201d our \u201cmeat bodies\u201d and that this illusion we are all living is really a dream, then moving to the next level of consciousness and of pure energy is not only achievable by each person, but as a society on a grander scale and that is when true change in mankind\u2019s path will move from fear, war and chaos to harmony, love and and peace for everyone. Clearly, we are many generations away from that, but the quest has been started by many wonderful teachers and continues to gain momentum. Google \u201c3rd density and the higher densities of reality\u201d or a similar phrase and read more about it. Google Dr. Joe Dispenza and listen to his work. Truly amazing stuff and gives the path on how to do such work on understanding more about the higher densities that really we all can tap into. ",

We are constantly using our minds, at least some of us, to uncover a deeper understanding of reality. But in general, we would not call it an illusion, just an imperfect vision or understanding. There is likely something behind our perceptions, whether our understanding of it is that good, or not. I suppose it could also be a relativity problem. Relative to a super-being of some kind, our understanding of reality may be pretty poor. Theirs may be more \u201caccurate,\u201d although it is possible neither are very accurate, just relatively useful. For instance, for living on our planet for the span out our lifetime, our understanding of reality may be fine. But if we were energy moving between stars, living billions of years, we would probably need a much better understanding of physics, but maybe not so much the biochemistry that humans have. I suspect the question assumed some sort of objective absolute reality. THAT may be the illusion of our minds! We would like that kind of answer, though in the scheme of things, it may not be useful or even possible. ",

Science has not determined the nature of reality, \u201cin full.\u201d We as yet do not understand how the world of the very large which contains everything we see, and can measure, comes from the world of the very small, Quantum Mechanics. We know that everything exists because of the function of the phenomena that Quantum Mechanics (it\u2019s extremely powerful and accurate as a theory), but we do not yet know how that world, turns into the world that you and I see. Speaking just about the human body, we are limited to what our brain and built in sensors can tell us. Our eyes, for example can only see a tiny bit of the Electromagnetic Spectrum. That\u2019s what we call, colloquially, light. However, the entire Electromagnetic Spectrum is the same, just different wavelengths that we can\u2019t see. Right now, through the room you are sitting in, radar from airports is blasting through, as radio waves. Are they really there if you can\u2019t see them? Yes, they are. If you turn on a device, and it has the right antennae, it can \u201csee\u201d those electromagnetic waves. Even our thinking and perception of time is suspect and can be shown to be inaccurate in various ways. It is a very deep question to consider \u201cwhat reality really is,\u201d and as you can see, we do not have all the answers. ",
