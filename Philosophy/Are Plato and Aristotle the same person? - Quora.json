            "answer_text": "What\u2019s puzzling is why you might think they ARE the same person. Plato was Aristotle\u2019s teacher; he was about 40 years older than Aristotle. Usually when we ask such questions it\u2019s because of stylistic similarities between two writers of the same time period. There are no stylistic similarities between Plato\u2019s dialogues and Aristotle\u2019s treatises. Not only does Aristotle criticize Plato\u2019s doctrines, his own are in most respects very different. ",

            "answer_text": "No. One could say that Plato and Socrates were, if only because we only know of Socrates mostly Plato\u2019s works, and Plato, in all likelihood, used Socrates as a mouthpiece for his own ideas. Aristotle studied at Plato\u2019s Academy, then started his own school, the Lyceum. But Aristotle and Plato are most assuredly *not* the same person, mainly because many of their ideas were and are in conflict. ",
