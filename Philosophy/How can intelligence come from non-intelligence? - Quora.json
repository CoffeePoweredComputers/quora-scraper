            "answer_text": "The answers are hilarious. Some people have a very simplistic understanding of biology. The definition given to evolution describes changes in an organism due to reacting to changes in diet and encironment. It is reactionary, not anticipatory and is limited to that organism. It never results in one organism becoming another. For example, evolutionists claim that all life evolved from an original bacterium. Not only is there zero evidence for this mysteriously unfound and unidentified bscterium, there is zero evidence that a bacterium could become anything else, nor what that \u201canything else\u201d was. So correspondingly, there is no evidence of any organism or creature becoming anything else. If evolution could not even begin, it never was. Nobody can point to the predecessor, or successor, of any organism and of it gradually, slowly, changing from one to the other. Never mind speculation, sweeping assumptions, postulating and unfounded theory, let\u2019s just stick to the evidence, shall we? Empirical, demonstrated science proves life only comes from life. Intelligence, especially human intelligence, only comes from intelligence. Even though it would appear that evolutionists consider themselves to be the only intelligent life in the Universe... Consider the human brain and mind. Scientists say the human brain is the most complex thing in the Universe. It is beyond the realms of science and physiology. Mathematics, abstract thought, future planning, a concept and a desire for eternity, for endless life, realisation of past, present and future, inherent spirituality and a need to look to a higher power. An inherent need for God, (see the book, \u201cMankind\u2019s Search for God.\u201d) For as long as Man has existed, he has sought the holy grail, the key to eternal life, and scientists today, are still trying to find out why we grow old and die, as the human body should, in the way it is designed, be able to live indefinitely. Evolution is a reactionary process and does not lead to features beyond what an organism would require. It adapts, not predicts. Man has a mental capacity and capability thousands of times greater than he could ever possibly use in a hundred lifetimes. If you lived 1,000 years, you would not \u201crun out of brain.\u201d So, in summary, evolution could not start in the first place, hence it is a fallacy, a hoax of elaborate proportions, fuelled by prejudice and misinformation, of denial of scientific evidence.

It covered non-living, non-replicating processes like sand bars or gold deposits. It also covers DNA and increases from generation to generation in a population. So, that\u2019s part of the explanation. Some is known about innate instincts and some is known about learned behavior from generation to generation. However, the answer won\u2019t be complete until consciousness is solved and that is still ongoing research. ",

            "answer_text": "A chimpanzee isn\u2019t intelligent, compared to a human being, but we both come from the same common ancestor. Except that, due to the change in the timing of one Hox gene in one of our ancestors, our skulls don;t fully fuse for about 20 years after birth. That allows them to keep getting larger for 20 years. That allows our brains to keep getting larger for 20 years. So yes, intelligence can develop from an ancestor that wasn\u2019t that intelligent. ",
