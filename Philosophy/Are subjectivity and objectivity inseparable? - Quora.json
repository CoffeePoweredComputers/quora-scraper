            "answer_text": "The human perceptive condition is irrevocably subjective. But, personally, I think we are at the point of verifying behavioral, if not material, objectivity with regards to the universe around us, regardless of the inescapable subjectivity of all neurological input. I justify it as follows: Even if there is a force at work deluding us into believing that everybody else experiences the same objective world we do to the extent that our most intricate technical instruments all agree on the objective truth of the material world, that force could still be hiding reality from us because of our inherent subjective neurology. However, if this force is in effect, then the simulation in which it is involving us, is so pervasive and so consistent itself, that we may well call that simulation the objectivity of the human condition. One way or another, whatever it is we (I) are (am) experiencing is enormously consistent across all humanity and through a great deal of time. Thus science is the characterization of our objective experience, no matter how it is generated. ",

It follows from this that both subjectivity and objectivity logicaly presuppose a particular observation. Every observation includes aspects that arise from the object that the observer is observing (such as size, shape and mass, relative to its environment) and other aspects which arise from the environment of the observers way of observing and understanding. (such as sensory stimulus, preference and associations) These different aspects, from a single observation, can be identified and separated in an analysis or account of the observation. ",
