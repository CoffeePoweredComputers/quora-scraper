            "answer_text": "This question leads to a kind of Unified Theory of Human Eternal Life. It\u2019s a great question to consider. That\u2019s because this is one of the most important things being offered to everyone all the time. In other words, your \u201csoul\u201d, All That Is and the Universe want you to know that you\u2019re eternal. It also wants you to know that you are creating your reality as you live your life. Only then can you live your life the way you intended. It\u2019s important to know when looking for proof that you\u2019re not going to find any objective evidence that the soul never dies. That\u2019s because life experience (even \u201cafter-life\u201d experience) is 100 percent subjective. The only way to \u201cprove\u201d it is to prove it to yourself, in your own life experience. It is literally impossible to prove it definitively to others with any kind of objective evidence because all the evidence is first-person experiential. Physical life experience\u2026particularly the external seeming, objective aspects.. are the soul\u2019s projections of itself onto itself. So the being experiencing physical life is really experiencing an experience of itself that it is projecting into the awareness of itself. Why? So that it can experience \u201cmore\u201d of itself as well as fulfill \u201cintentions\u201d making up the core of who and what the self is. So if you\u2019re wanting to see proof that the soul never dies, knowing what you read is a start. Because that is the context within which your proof is going to be realized by you. You also have to be willing to be patient. The answer to your question hardly ever happens in a flash. And when it does, it is often lost. Like a dream you can barely remember in the morning. But if you\u2019re willing to be patient, the gradual, unhurried nature of All That Is will reveal everything (anything really) you\u2019re wanting to know. The next thing to realize is the proof is already always all around you. You just can\u2019t see it right now. Seeing the proof requires orienting your perception so you can start seeing the evidence instead of seeing the absence of the evidence. \u201cOrienting\u201d your perception so you can see what you\u2019re wanting has little to do with \u201cdoing something\u201d and everything to do with \u201callowing yourself to realize\u201d what it is you\u2019re wanting to know. This is a very important distinction. We know we\u2019re throwing a lot of words at you, but all this is really important to understand in realizing the answer to your question. So bear with us\u2026. It\u2019s easier if the person seeking this answer doesn\u2019t use words or have beliefs that make realizing what they want harder. The word \u201csoul\u201d for example, leads people on a journey usually ending in belief constellations which make it hard (and often impossible) to realize what your question is reaching for. We wrote about that before here. Language is one way beliefs are communicated. You\u2019ll notice you talk to yourself almost constantly. Much of that internal dialogue is confirming and reconfirming beliefs, many of which work against your question\u2019s intent. So realizing how your language usually works against you and then cleaning up the language so you can begin realizing what you\u2019re wanting is the next step. For example, look at the following two statements: I want to see evidence that the soul never diesI want to be the realizer of my eternal natureNotice statement one is very action oriented. It also presumes the evidence is not being seen (it is absent) and that the speaker wants to see it. But what this statement is doing is affirming the absence of the evidence in the way it is expressed. The perceiver wants to see something she currently does not, the \u201cdoes not\u201d component being emphasized. Notice statement two is passive. The speaker is not trying to do anything. She is expressing a desire to become something. It also affirms the existence of what it is she is wanting to realize. The perceiver understands her eternal nature is a thing and she is eager to have that realized by her. This subtle distinction is crucial to realizing the \u201cproof\u201d you\u2019re asking about. Actually the word \u201cproof\u201d is problematic. \u201cProof\u201d is adversarial. It is demanding. It is confrontational. It begs the statement that what you\u2019re asking proof about doesn\u2019t exist. \u201cPROVE IT\u201d is the energy of the word \u201cproof\u201d. See the subtlety? Ok, so now you have a sense of four important premises: The evidence you want will be 100 percent subjective. It will only be convincing to you. No one else.The evidence you\u2019re wanting is all around you. You\u2019re not trying to create the evidence or discover it. You\u2019re wanting to realize the already-existing evidence. Or better stated: you\u2019re wanting to realize your eternal nature, which already always has/is existed/existing.The language used in both asking and answering the question will either support your intent or defeat it.Your beliefs will hinder or help you become the realizer of the answer to your question.So now, the process is simple: you simply ask for the answer to your question in a way which supports you realizing the answer\u2026then hold the intention that the answer is being revealed to you. What happens next is you\u2019ll begin experiencing events confirming your intent. Things will begin happening in your life experience demonstrating that you\u2019re eternal. But you have to keep the four points in mind and constantly question thoughts and reactions you have which will stop the evidence flow dead in its tracks. For example, one day you might be at a bus stop. Someone you know may join you at the bus stop. You\u2019ll strike up a conversation with this person and this person may say something\u2026mention a newspaper or magazine article, or a website, or a book, or tv show that will cause within you an \u201ca-ha!\u201d moment. What they say will sound so perfectly timed and so perfectly related to your intent to realize what you\u2019re wanting. Perhaps they will mention the show God Friended Me, for example. And your mind will then do one of many different things: It may cause you to totally miss the opportunity that is the Universe and All That Is giving you a bread crumb along the path leading to your fulfilled realization. Your beliefs will prevent you from picking up on this TV show\u2019s relevance to your question. And so you\u2019ll just say something like \u201chuh, interesting\u201d and let the mention pass.Your mind may go \u201chmm, I remember this Quora answer I read about this and here is my friend, who I happen to meet at a bus stop telling me about some kind of TV show about god.\u201d And your mind then might go: \u201cthis is a coincidence\u201d and ignore the opportunity.You may feel goose pimples or a shiver down your spine and think \u201cthis is not a coincidence. This is a clue to the answer I\u2019m wanting\u2026.\u201d Then you\u2019ll get excited\u2026.You then might go home later and watch the show, enjoy its premise and then, be inspired to casually research online the word serendipity\u2026.If you do something number three, then you\u2019re on your way. What you may not realize in reading all this is, the seeming chance bus stop encounter is the beginning of the realizing of the evidence. That\u2019s how subtle it works. Keep this up and you\u2019ll come to experiencing all kinds of realizations. You may be invited to partake in an Ayahuasca event or a meditation sessionYou may be invited to hear someone speak about eternal naturesYou may have a dream where you experience something which adds to your realizationYou\u2019ll begin having more and more events in your life demonstrating the reality of things science calls \u201cpseudoscience\u201dAnd then, at some point, you\u2019ll notice your beliefs have gradually changed and you\u2019ll begin living your life differently. As you shift your way of believing and your way of being, even more evidence will start happening: Your dreams will become more and more lucid and clearYou\u2019ll start to want to know what your dreams are aboutYou\u2019ll start playing with this whole idea that \u201cyou create your reality\u201d and you\u2019ll start getting evidence of that showing up all over your lifeThen, really amazing things will start happening that in the past you would have said \u201cthat\u2019s coincidence\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s impossible\u201d or \u201crandom\u201d or \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d or some other nonsense. Only now you won\u2019t say those things now because they happen so often there\u2019s just too much evidence to the contrary.By then you\u2019re on your way. The rest of the path is up to your realization. We promise, if you keep it up, you will eventually come to where every sincere person winds up: realizing, knowing they are eternal and that death is not the end. ",

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s reverse this, to PROVE a soul dies. FIRST PROVE YOU ARE GREATER THAN THE SPIRITUAL REALM & all of those gods that exist. Next prove that Human science is WRONG and energy can be destroyed, not converted to another form of energy. YOU must destroy it entirely. Otherwise to PROVE A SOUL NEVER DIES, just walk the Spiritual Realm. Till you walk the Spiritual Realm, you have only ONE PLANET, & only Human perspective of Existence, therefore you have not PROVEN THAT SOULS DIE OR DO NOT EXIST! You are simply someone that has a limited understanding of reality. You are a person sitting in a CLOSED UP ROOM, with all the windows, doors & outside views are closed to you. You can NOT PROVE THE OUTSIDE DOES NOT EXIST, because you are not WILLING to look outside your room. The fact that a wall exists between you and whatever is outside, is PROOF of something ELSE EXISTING! Hence, there is more THAN ONE UNIVERSE!  This is why I classify science as a religion, it CLAIMS TO KNOW EVERYTHING, but starts by saying \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a machine to test it, IT CAN NOT EXIST.\u201d Whoops, just like any religion saying ONLY OUR GOD EXISTS\u2026 the religion claims to be GREATER THAN GODS THEMSELVES.

            "answer_text": "Everyone believes there is a soul in his body but no one knows what it is and where it is. This is the reason that there is no definite definition on soul. It is not possible to prove soul never dies because soul is not a physical matter that will obey scientific laws or there is no instrument to put soul under investigation to demonstrate as a proof. I am of the opinion that soul is the energy our body receives at the time of conception prior to birth which manifests through our each and every body cells and this energy diffuse with the cosmic energy after the body dies. We can call it as a particle like photon of light and the particles are present in the entire body. Energy is neither created nor destroyed, so, if we consider soul is the energy, it never dies. This way we can explain to understand but proving is not at all possible. ",

Since Science cannot and absolutely do not want to understand transcendent facts it is necessary to mature a new way of learning transcendent so that scientific principles can also be applied to the real and immanent effects due to transcendent hypotheses, a sort of metaphysical-science. The TTR is just an attempt in this sense. TTR, for instance, proposes a logical and rational scheme of interpretation of the transcendent world that has generated, still generates and will generate even our apparent existences (human beings, animals, plants, E5, E6 and particles of matter). This metaphysical theory is therefore completely different from the religious ones based only on irrational and illogical ideas without any correspondence with the physical effects that we can find in our 3D world, considerated as part of the great 11d world in which all (including our under-dimensional souls) really exist .

God did not create humans with a soul that leaves the body when you die because death is a punishment not a cycle of life. Humans were never supposed to die. Because Adam and Eve disobeyed, all humans suffer sickness and death. The Bible defines the soul from the Hebrew and Greek words as the person itself. You are the soul. The expressions still used today as in \u201cthe poor soul\u201d or \u201cmay his soul Rest In Peace\u201d are about the person not a sprit. Peter spoke about \u201cthe eight souls that entered the ark. The Bible states that God blew into Adams nostrils and he became a living soul. Also Jesus compared Death as sleeping, supporting what the Bible teaches that the dead are conscious of nothing at all. So using the Bible as the only source of truth, the teachings of an immortal soul are false. The Bible states\u2026 the soul that is sinning dies. ",

The stories were investigated and most what being said by the children were actually true events happened from the past. I believe soul never dies and instead are being re-cycled or re-born to continue or fullfil the unfinished business. I also read that souls consist of light and energy, and thus cannot be destroyed. The reason why we cannot access the other dimension is because we are living in a 3rd dimension world and our physical (biological body) is a hindrance for us to transmute and communicate with other entities. We have glympse of the other world during lucid dreaming. Our subsconscious is the portal to other realms. ",
