            "answer_text": "I find negative contributions to be more noticeable. The idealisms of Kant, Berkely, and Hegel have given was to modern quantum idealism with super symmetry/superstrings. The hegemonies of the world employ the latter today. If your capable of noticing it it is most intolerable during times of controversy and what we'll have to call tragedy. I have a lot to say about modern idealism but won't because people's feelings and lives are caught up in their strings and symmetry. I would say that philosophy and metaphysics have given a dark voice to what is unknown to the masses. I am thankful that the poodle schoolers are as contrived as they are. From a positive view some philosophy today is attempting to bring about a better appreciation for language, fiat economics, ethology (atnleastnfrom here), and cosmology (maybe ones existence with and within the universe). I can't name any modern philosophers and wouldn't and couldn't, respectively, hear of it. ",
