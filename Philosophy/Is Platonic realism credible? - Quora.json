            "answer_text": "Credible in what sense? The universal idea of Forms as put forth by Plato concerning realism do take some unsteady and vague basis on the word of God at some points... but for the most part: the idea of paradigms, mind independent and abstract objects, existing (in whatever understanding of the term) to form the mind dependent concepts that form the structures of the human understanding, and of mind and body (which is constantly a reference point of Platonic thought) holds some strength as a theory, but is simply that: a theory. It has a nice way of putting into perspective what we consider as material shape and mass compared to ideal shape and mass. ",
