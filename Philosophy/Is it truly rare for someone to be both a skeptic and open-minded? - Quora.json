            "answer_text": "As TJ says. Being a skeptic does not imply that the person indulges in blanket disbelief of almost everything. As the developer of the \u201cNew Skepticism\u201d philosophy, Paul Kurtz said\u2026 Skepticism builds on the \u201cground of the known\u201d. When presented with a claim, or a statement, or something of the sort, the skeptic would be inclined to say\u2026. \u201cShow me the evidence.\u201d There\u2019s no reason to doubt everything. If I came in to work and told my colleagues that I\u2019d seen a nasty traffic accident on the way to work, that would probably be accepted without question. No reason not to\u2026. Hardly an unusual occurrence. But if I said the accident involved a tractor-trailer full of unicorns which had collided with a dragon crossing the road\u2026.. Well, that might raise a few eyebrows. To be \u201copen minded\u201d does not mean accepting every claim or statement at face value either. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Skeptical is not the same as closed minded, its merely being open to a claim being false or true, and being willing to explore and evaluate the possibilities\u2026 the opposite of closed minded. When a person CLAIMS to be a \u201cskeptic\u201d, but, is really just questioning things that, if accurately evaluated, would be information of value\u2026 such that they reject information of value, but accept any information not in conflict with/that supports their world view.. \u2026 they are really only skeptical of things in conflict with their world view\u2026 a different meaning of the term. Many people who reject real information because its in conflict with their world view, like to call themselves \u201cskeptics\u201d, because they are attempting to equate their rejection of meaningful data, with others\u2019 rejection of their invalid data. :D ",
