            "answer_text": "I could try to list as many applications as I could but that would take sooooo long, likely be pretty boring to read, and I would expect my list of applications to leave a lot of stuff out (because, you know, I'm one human and this is a \u201cbig\u201d question). The real life applications of probability are similar to the real life applications of, say, statistics, or the real life applications of math. In short, the world is packed full of a whole bunch of variables and scenarios in which predicting outcomes/events would be very helpful. We're faced with a lot of occurrences that might happen. A lot of people think that life is basically full of randomness (for lack of a better word) and varying probabilities which are hard to predict. However, just like math comes in super important for measuring and modeling and quantifying phenomena and such, probability is super helpful in predicting and explaining things. Probability allows us to find explanations and math in things that we otherwise would think we're completely random. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do you say in real life, in maths? Probability has applications in all areas of real life. In predicting the course of the Corona pandemic and evaluating policies to control it. In evaluating treatments. In insurance. In gambling. In physics, biology, all over industry. Probability is about randomness, and about uncertainty. Randomness and uncertainty are everywhere. ",
