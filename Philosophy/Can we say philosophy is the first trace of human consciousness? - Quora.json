            "answer_text": "Consciousness is ethically tricky. You will absolutely want to include even the smallest Amazonian tribe in its definition, otherwise your stuff might be used as material for the next genocide. There is a school of ethics that allows eating animals, because they have no consciousness, after all. So better watch out who you exclude. Likewise, philosophy is really tricky to define. If you make a descriptive definition, I usually go with: \u201cPlato, people who comment on Plato, and people who comment on people who comment on Plato. \u201c But this makes it sound like this is something that only relates to people from the western tradition who have a firm grasp on Ancient Greek (which is why I say it and it is only unfair to an estimated 2% of published philosophy). Philosophers themselves have the interesting notion that philosophy is universal. To proof this, they compare Plato comments to the thoughts and texts of other world regions, e.g. Eastern \u201cphilosophy\u201d. These comparisons usually elicit astonishment in the people who actually study these \u201cphilosophies\u201d. Well, I guess, if you have a Plato, every thought looks like a nail. So, if you are Aristotle (who commented on Plato a lot), you might get the idea that only philosophers are truly human, which I guess means I can eat people who never heard of Plato and his commentators? I would dearly hope that human consciousness does not depend on philosophy, at least not academic philosophy, but maybe on thought itself. Which may present itself as a Plato comment, but more likely as a rumination on actual nails. ",

But in this context, we\u2019ll accept you mean the multifarious aspects of cognition\u2026 Of \u201chigher function\u201d or \u201cexecutive function\u201d. Analysis, correlation, creativity, decision-making, etc, etc. And certainly these all existed in pre-history. We know that our ancestors created art and music dating back at least 40,000 years ago, and very likely well before that though examples of same would not be preserved through time. We know of music because of bone flutes found in the caves of Lascaux and Chauvet, along with all that marvelous art. Bone is preserved. Wooden drums, crude skin \u201cbanjos\u201d, mouth-bows and the like would not be. Likewise art. Art may have started as simple scratches in the dirt with a stick or a finger\u2026. We would never know. As well, we have increasingly-fine tool-making that does get preserved. All pre-dating the rise of \u201cphilosophy\u201d by thousands of years. ",

Consciousness is the ability of an individual to sense their own state of existence, internally and externally, as a subjective experience.

Consciousness is also the ability to integrate experiences with memory, thereby providing an ongoing awareness of one\u2019s environment as well as oneself. Philosophy is a product of individuals in a complex society using their intelligence to contemplate and debate the nature of reality. ",
