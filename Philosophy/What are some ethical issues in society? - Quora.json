            "answer_text": "The ones I mention here have no scientifically right or wrong answer\u2026 thus are purely ethical and personal. Abortion. This essentially hinges on when a human being gets a right to life, answers can range from conception to birth and where you fit on the spectrum determines your opinion on abortion. The issue is that from a purely philosophical position it opens the doors on human rights even out of the womb and this makes it a deeply personal position that has huge ramifications on broader societal human rights.Welfare. This is a tough issue becasue there is an economic drive to help people who require it, but also an economic drive not to. This is becasue every person who needs welfare is different and some are beneficial to help, and others are not.Freedom. This is such a broad category that putting it in a single group feels wrong. The issue here is that every society will consider certain freedoms as necessary, and other freedoms as unnecessary. There is no such thing as absolute freedom, and each person has to make a decision on how much and what type of freedom is \u2018ethical\u2019.Right to resources. This includes necessities like water and food. It also comes under the idea of welfare, but i separated it because unlike most welfare it is usually considered beneficial. The reason this is an ethical dilemma, however, is because resources are limited and thus societies will often have to make a judgement of who gets what. many cities are becoming short on water for example and thus society has to make an ethical decision for themselves and for society that can often be as harmful as it is beneficial.I will emphasize I have not included LGBT+, Race, or Gender issues here becasue in my opinion they are not ethical dilemmas, they are definition issues. How a language or culture defines such things will determine if it is an ethical decision, or even if it is an issue in the first place. The above issues, however, are important in all societies. ",

            "answer_text": "There is a deep ethical conundrum going on in society today. And since it is a societal issue, most people in our society (and a good portion of those on Quora) will dismiss it as a non-issue, or simply incorrect. The answer you are looking for is actually seen in the question you\u2019re asking. Society has drifted away from ethics, and instead found subjective morality. See ethics are a measure or what is good or bad, right and wrong, from an external, outside source, like (common) human nature, professional opinion, or a deity. Society has become very \u201cmorality\u201d centred, where the default position being expressly taught today is relativism- that is, morality is relative to people, and there are no widespread, overbearing ethics, which regardless of personal conviction and feelings, hold true and stay the same. As Socrates once said, \u201cIf knowledge can be learned, so can virtue\u201d[1]. This means that personal feelings are not the defining \u201claw\u201d on what is right and wrong, since everyone has different feelings, and since qualia can not be perfectly communicated, (no one can accurately know that the colour red I experience is the same that you experience), they cannot be learned. However, virtue can be learned- as with knowledge, it is something that can obtained through logical thinking, and can be communicated across a wide group of people. Since ethics are absolute, (another truth which Plato and Aristotle put forth) they can be reasoned, and they can be taught. Unfortunately society at large has chosen to cling to moral relativism, since it is the most comfortable line of thinking to follow. Noone wants to tell thier neighbors that they love them, but they are doing something wrong. Swaths of people across the world hold completely contradictory conviction. Their countries and societies accept different things such as gay right, punishment for homosexuality, antisemitism and racial diversity. Something else Socrates mentions is that \u201cNo one chooses evil; no one chooses to act in ignorance\u201d. This is true, even when people commit an act of something that they might see as superficially wrong in their own eyes, they eventually can determine that they acted for a reason, often determined by their deep underlying values. The determination of right and wrong is absolute, and so should come from an infallible source. Which is not fellow man, who are extremely corruptible, and ever changing. Society\u2019s issue is that we have thrust the weight of determining ethical responsibility on the conscious of the individual. This has cost us dearly, and will cost us greatly in the future. Morality has become ethics. The separation has been forgotten. Footnotes[1] The Ethics of Socrates",
