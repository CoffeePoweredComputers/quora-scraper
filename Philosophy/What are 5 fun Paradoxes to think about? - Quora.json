            "answer_text": "Sorry for the insult, but you just can\u2019t win a tortoise in a race. Thanks to the Greek philosopher Zeno, even Usain Bolt cannot win a tortoise in races. Yeah, this is the Achilles & the tortoise paradox. So here is how it goes. Imagine this: The crowd is cheering for you! The tortoises are cheering for their tortoise-friend. You, a kind and understanding person, give the tortoise a hundred meters headstart, i.e.- the tortoise is hundred metres ahead of you at the beginning of the race. You don\u2019t mind because you know that the tortoise is slow. You will defeat him. You are not the hare in the old story. The tortoise agrees. (he\u2019s sly). There we go- Three \u2014 two \u2014 one! Start!! Here\u2019s the shit part- The tortoise starts running at a highly slower speed than yours, and by the time time you reach the tortoise\u2019s original spot (which is hundred metres), the tortoise must have ran a relatively small distance, say 10 metres. Now, as you run to the tortoise\u2019s second spot (which is 10 metres), the tortoise has again ran a very small distance, say one metre. This goes on and thus, whenever you reach somewhere the tortoise has been, you still have farther to go. In this way, you can never overtake the tortoise and the tortoise wins as he reaches the finish line. Moral- Zeno\u2019s pet tortoise wins the race. Why doesn\u2019t this happen in real life? One word- PARADOX   Now, one of my favorites. Once again, imagine this: You are on the beach, chilling with a mojito, sprawling on the sand. Great. You are presently jobless. You remember your childhood, you start playing with the sand. You decide to make a sand castle. Woohoo! You start with a heap of sand (say, 1000000 grains). Here\u2019s the shit part- Suddenly, a weird thought comes in your mind. You start by taking one grain of sand and put it somewhere else (that gives you 999999 grains of sand, which is still a heap of sand). You do the same thing once more (that gives you 999998 grains, still a heap of sand). Keeping this logic, by every grain you remove, the heap remains a heap. You continue to repeat the process, down till you reach with one grain. Now, it is obvious that this is not a heap. Yes, this is the Sorites\u2019 paradox. So, at what grain or what point of time does a heap turn into a non-heap? At the grain 554678 or at grain 435897? One word- PARADOX   You will surely like this one! Sorry for the trouble, but again imagine this: You are having a holiday in your birth-town, called Barbero. Yeah, thats right, Barbero. Your town is a backward region where it took you two weeks to reach there. So, you have not cut or shaved since two weeks. You will have a cut as soon as you reach Barbero. You reach there and you find that there is only one barber in the whole town. Why the hell? Nevertheless, you go to the barber and sit in the waiting area. Here\u2019s the shit part- After talking with your fellow people who are sitting with you, you get to know a mind-boggling truth about the barber. Every man in the town keeps himself clean-shaven: some by shaving themselves, some by attending the barber. It is reasonable that the barber keeps a rule. The rule is- He shaves all and only those men in town who do not shave themselves. Fine. You then think of a thought, does the barber shave himself? You soon realise that the situation is impossible. Yes, this is The Barber\u2019s Paradox. This is because- If the barber does not shave himself, he must abide by the rule and shave himself.If he does shave himself, according to the rule he will not shave himself.So does the barber shave himself? Or his beard is presently long enough to circle the world? One word- PARADOX   Now, you know Shakespeare is the greatest English writer of all time. Hamlet is probably his most famous of all the plays. But, I say that Shakespeare did not write the Hamlet. (I am weird, I know) Trust me. You want a proof? Here it is- A time traveler buys a copy of Hamlet from a bookstore, travels back in time to Elizabethan London, and hands the book to Shakespeare, who then copies it out and claims it as his own work. Over the centuries that follow, Hamlet is reprinted and reproduced countless times until finally a copy of it ends up back in the same original bookstore, where the time traveler finds it, buys it, and takes it back to Shakespeare. Who, then, wrote Hamlet? Yeah, this it the Bootstrap Paradox. Is Hamlet just a piece of work which no one has written? One word- PARADOX   The best of the paradoxes- The Paradox Of the Court Many years ago, a Law teacher came across a student who was willing to learn but was unable to pay the fees. The student struck a deal saying, \"I will pay your fee the day I win my first case in the court\".Teacher agreed and proceeded with the law course. When the course was finished and teacher started pestering the student to pay up the fee, the student reminded him of the deal and pushed days. Fed up with this, the teacher decided to sue the student in the court of law and both of them decided to argue for themselves. The teacher put forward his argument saying: \"If I win this case, as per the court of law, the student has to pay me as the case is about his non-payment of dues. And if I lose the case, the student will still pay me because he would have won his first case... So either way I will get the money\". Equally brilliant, the student argued back saying: \"If I win the case, as per the court of law, I don't have to pay anything to the teacher as the case is about my non-payment of dues. And if I lose the case, I don't have to pay him because I haven't won my first case yet.... So either way, I am not going to pay the teacher anything\". This is one of the greatest paradoxes ever recorded. Who is right and who is the winner? One word-PARADOX   I just remembered one more paradox-story. Yes, it is a paradox in the form of a story.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll start you the obvious ones, but first, check this out (The author\u2019s name is at the bottom of the answer):  The Liar\u2019s Paradox : (I\u2019ll try and write it in the same context as it was written, by the Greek logician Chrysippos.) A Cretan sailor comes to Greece, and tells a Greek :\u201dAll Cretans are liars.\u201d A week later, the same Cretan makes the same journey, and tells another Greek he meets :\u201cAll Cretans are liars, and all I say is the truth.\u201d Where is the truth ? The Double-Liar\u2019s Paradox : (This one was formulated by the english mathematician P. E. B; Jourdain) On one side of a card is written what follows \u201cThe sentence on the other side of this card is true\u201d. The other side says \u201cThe sentence on the other side of this card is false\u201d. Wait .. What ? The Barber\u2019s Paradox : (This was is from another english man, Russell) In a village, the barber shaves everyone who does not shave himself, but no one else. Who shaves the barber ? Quite similar to the first paradox. Ship of Theseus\u2019 Paradox: (Another one from ancient Greece, by Plutarch) Take a ship. Start replacing one by one the pieces of wood that constitute it. Do that until the entire ship is made from new pieces. Now take the old planks you took away from the first ship, and build a second ship. Which ship is the original ? Small conflict of identity eh ? Grandfhater\u2019s Paradox : (I do not know where this one comes from .. But it\u2019s about time travel so ..) A boy goes back in time and kills his grandfather before he had the chance to meet his (future-ex?) grandmother. Since his grandfather is dead, the boy was never born. But then how did he kill his grandfather ? (Picture : The Paradoxical Art of \u201cInception\u201d\tby Nettrice Gaskins) ",
