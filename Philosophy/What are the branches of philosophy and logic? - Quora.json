            "answer_text": "There are two questions since logic and philosophy are two different subjects. Logic I like the following division of logic. Maybe, evause it is rather philosophical by its nature. First we define any logic to be classical iff the following principles hold: Any statement can have exactly one of the following values: true or false (or [math]1[/math] or [math]0[/math] or something like that).The principle of non-contradiction holds, i.e. [math]\\neg A[/math] and [math]A[/math] cannot be simultaneously true.Correspondence concept of truth (or Tarski scheme) is accepted, i.e. a proposition is true iff the state of affairs it describes is actually true.Extensionality of context is assumed: i.e. one can substitute propositions with one another if they have the same denotion.Non-classical logics are built when some of the classical principles are being denied. For example, paraconsistent logic can be described as logic where the first principle doesn't hold. The parts of classical logic are usually construed as parts of foundations of math (see MSC2010) and have parts as model theory, proof theory and so on. Note that this classification does not distinguish between logics within one class but different expressive power (like propositional and first order modal logic and so on). Philosophy It is a bit harder to create a classification of philosophical subjects since they are usually intersecting with one another. One, however, can classify them under such labels as \"marxism\" or \"analytical philosophy\" and so on. Some of these labels were created by philosophers who created this or that conception while others were made up by historians. The problem is that philosophers of the past were usually much easier to classify than modern or present ones (and there are almost as many philosophers that were born after 1880s as those born before that time). And although, one can say that almost all \"continental\" philosophers after 1950s are \"postmodernists\" and many of the American and British philosophers from 1910s on are \"analytic philosophers\", this would be too sweeping of a statement.

            "answer_text": "To complement the other answers, I\u2019ll focus on common branches of logic from the formal/mathematical viewpoint: Propositional logic - reasoning about sentences and their logical connections (and, or, \u2026).First-order predicate logic - reasoning about quantified quantities and domain-specific functions/predicates (like addition in arithmetic) that make up sentences.Higher-order predicate logics - extend first-order logic to quantify not just over variables, but also over sets, sets of sets, etc.Modal logics - reasoning about \u201cmodalities\u201d of sentences. Common meanings are: possibility/necessity, always/eventually, obligation/permission, knowledge/belief.Source: Logic by branch/doctrine ",
