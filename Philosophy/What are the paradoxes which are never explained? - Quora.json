            "answer_text": "1.The bootstrap paradox Imagine that a time traveller buys a copy of Hamlet from a bookstore, travels back in time to Elizabethan London, and hands the book to Shakespeare, who then copies it out and claims it as his own work. Over the centuries that follow, Hamlet is reprinted and reproduced countless times until finally a copy of it ends up back in the same original bookstore, where the time traveller finds it, buys it, and takes it back to Shakespeare. Who, then, wrote Hamlet. 2.The card paradox Imagine you\u2019re holding a postcard in your hand, on one side of which is written, \u201cThe statement on the other side of this card is true.\u201d We\u2019ll call that Statement A. Turn the card over, and the opposite side reads, \u201cThe statement on the other side of this card is false\u201d (Statement B). Trying to assign any truth to either Statement A or B, however, leads to a paradox: if A is true then B must be as well, but for B to be true, A has to be false. Oppositely, if A is false then B must be false too, which must ultimately make A true. ",
