            "answer_text": "Well a bit long .Read this through my friend. somewhat related to the topic.Will for sure clear what a machine should do to pass a Turing test at least .                        A SENSELESS CONVERSATION ZACH: My name is Zach Barnett. Can machines think? Until what happened today, I thought that no human-made machine could ever think as a human does. I now know that I was wrong.I woke up to a phone call. Calling was my best friend, Douglas. Douglas is an experimental computer scientist. He told me that he had created a computer that could pass the Turing Test.I knew that the Turing Test was supposed to be a way to test a machine\u2019s intelligence. Not merely a way to determine whether a machine could simulate intelligence, but a way to determine whether the machine was genuinely thinking, understanding. The \u2018intelligence test\u2019 that Alan Turing proposed was a sort of \u2018imitation game.\u2019 In one room is an ordinary human; in the other is a machine (probably a computer). A human examiner, who does not know which room contains the machine, would engage in a natural language conversation with both participants. If the examiner is unable to reliably distinguish the machine from the human, then, according to Turing, we have established that the machine is thinking, understanding and, apparently, conscious.I never found this plausible. How could a certain kind of external behavior tell us anything about what it is like for the machine on the inside? Why would Turing think it impossible to create a mindless, thoughtless machine that is able nonetheless to produce all of the right output to pull off the perfect trickery? Furthermore, how could we ever establish that a machine was conscious without actually being that machine?Despite my skepticism, I was curious to see the computer that Douglas had created. I wanted to have the opportunity to engage in \u2018conversation\u2019 with it, intelligent or not. Unfortunately, I would never have this opportunity. When I arrived, Douglas led me toward \u2018Room A.\u2019 He explained that he wanted to administer the Turing Test and that he wanted me to play the role of the control subject, the human. The computer, Douglas told me, was located in room B. Douglas would converse with us both and would thereby be able to compare my human responses with the apparently human responses of his lifeless, mindless creation.I entered room A, expecting to see a workstation equipped with some sort of text-messaging software. Instead, there was a massive container filled with a strange, translucent fluid. The container was a sensory deprivation tank, Douglas explained, and he wanted me to go inside it. Yikes. 'Why would I need to do that?' I wondered. I thought that Douglas probably wanted me in the sensory deprivation tank so that my situation would be roughly analogous to that of the computer. The computer doesn\u2019t have eyes or ears, I reasoned, and so Douglas did not want me to be able to use mine.Douglas explained that while I was in the tank, I would be able to sense nothing; I wouldn\u2019t even be able to hear my own voice. How would we communicate? Douglas showed me a brain-computer interface, which would allow me to communicate with Douglas not by talking, but by thinking. He would speak into a microphone, and I would \u2018hear\u2019 his voice in my \u2018mind\u2019s ear.\u2019 To reply, I would \u2018think\u2019 my responses back to him, and he would receive my thoughts as text. It was a bit \u2018sci-fi\u2019 for me, but Douglas reassured me. He told me that the whole experiment would not take too long and that he would let me out as soon as it was over. I trusted him. With a deep breath, I entered the tank, and Douglas closed the lid.There was a moment of stillness. I couldn\u2019t see anything, and when I tried to move, I couldn\u2019t feel myself moving. When I tried to speak, I couldn\u2019t hear myself speaking. Suddenly, and to my surprise, I could \u2018hear\u2019 Douglas\u2019s voice:DOUGLAS: How are you doing in there? Feeling comfortable yet?ZACH: This is pretty weird. But I\u2019m okay.DOUGLAS: Great.I was communicating with my mind, which is cool in retrospect. At the time, it was simply creepy! I tried to focus on the conversation.ZACH: So for a bit, I was wondering why you needed me to be in this sensory deprivation tank. But I think I figured out the reason.DOUGLAS: Did you?ZACH: I think so. You want me in this tank so that I am in the same situation as the computer. If I could see, hear, or feel during this conversation, then I would be able to talk about those experiences with you. And the computer isn\u2019t able to do that. I would have an unfair advantage.DOUGLAS: Great observation! Some computer scientists have tried to work around this asymmetry. They have had little success. It\u2019s hard to lie convincingly, and it\u2019s even harder to build something that can lie convincingly.ZACH: It\u2019s interesting and all, but you should know that I think that this whole Turing Test thing is a sham anyhow. Even if your computer can pass this \u2018test,\u2019 I believe that this ability says nothing about its intelligence.DOUGLAS: I thought you might feel that way. If you were to see my computer in action for yourself, you might be persuaded otherwise.ZACH: How so? Seeing it \u2018in action\u2019 would do nothing to persuade me. It\u2019s all just pre-programmed output.DOUGLAS: You think so? Maybe if I were to tell you a bit more about why the sensory deprivation tank was so important, you would have a different opinion.ZACH: I thought I had already figured out why you needed the tank?DOUGLAS: Not entirely. You were right that having the human in the tank would ensure that the two participants are on a more level playing field. But the tank is critical for another reason.ZACH: Well, are you going to tell me? Or are you going to leave me in senseless suspense?DOUGLAS: I will tell you in a roundabout way.ZACH: Great.This was intended to be sarcastic, but since he received it as text, I\u2019m not sure he caught it.DOUGLAS: In my many years on this project, a single obstacle had frustrated all of my previous attempts to build a computer that could communicate as a human can. The tank actually turned out to be the final piece of the puzzle!ZACH: What was the obstacle?DOUGLAS: In the past, as soon as I would turn my machines online, they would panic.ZACH: What do you mean they would \u2018panic\u2019? Do you mean they would simulate panic?DOUGLAS: Not exactly.ZACH: Couldn\u2019t you just program them not to \u2018panic?\u2019DOUGLAS: No, they are far too complicated for that.ZACH: I don\u2019t understand. If I tell my computer to turn on, it turns on. If I tell it to print a document, it prints the document. A computer is basically a rule-follower. In other words, if your computer \u2018panicked,\u2019 then someone told it to!DOUGLAS: Hmm. So would you say that a computer programmer should always be able to predict the behavior of her own computer programs?ZACH: I don\u2019t see why not.DOUGLAS: But the programmers that programmed Chinook, the unbeatable checkers program, cannot even play perfect checkers themselves!ZACH: Well yes, but that is different. Maybe we can\u2019t predict Chinook\u2019s behavior without doing some computation first, but there is nothing mysterious going on. Chinook is simply following the code written by its programmers!DOUGLAS: In this example, you are right. But the computer I have built is more complicated than Chinook. Passing the Turing Test requires far more intelligence than playing perfect checkers does.I thought back to my teenage years, conversing with the online chatterbot \u2018SmarterChild.\u2019 I didn\u2019t write its code, but I could predict its responses almost flawlessly. It was about as intelligent as a sea cucumber. If I were to ask it:\u2018SmarterChild, what is your favorite season?\u2019It probably would have responded,\u2018I\u2019m not interested in talking about \u201cSmarterChild, what is your favorite season?\u201d Let\u2019s talk about something else! Type \u201cHELP\u201d to see a list of commands.\u2019Apparently, I reasoned, Douglas thinks that there is an important difference between his computer, and the simple, predictable, utterly dumb machines I am familiar with.ZACH: So if your computer program is so much more complicated, how should I imagine it? What can it do?DOUGLAS: A good question. But shouldn\u2019t you be able to answer it? Assuming that I am correct, assuming that my computer really can pass the Turing Test, my computer will be indistinguishable from a human in the context of a conversation. The better question is, \u2018What can\u2019t it do?\u2019ZACH: But suppose I asked it to answer this question: \u2018From the following three words, pick the two that rhyme the best: soft, rough, cough.\u2019 I\u2019m pretty sure that most people would select \u2018soft\u2019 and \u2018cough.\u2019 How would your computer answer it?DOUGLAS: If my computer couldn\u2019t answer that question as humans do, then it wouldn\u2019t be able to pass the test!ZACH: Then it won\u2019t be able to pass the test! Think about it... To answer this question, I am able to do something it cannot do. I say the words in my head. And somehow, I can tell that \u2018cough\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 rhyme better than either does with \u2018rough.\u2019DOUGLAS: I see your point; the reasoning you are using doesn\u2019t seem very mechanical.ZACH: Exactly.DOUGLAS: But what would you say if my computer could produce the same answer and a similar justification?ZACH: Then I would say it was pre-programmed to be prepared for exactly that question! How could it say those words \u2018in its head?\u2019 It doesn\u2019t even have a head! It has never even heard those words before!DOUGLAS: That\u2019s a great question! You should ask it yourself!ZACH: But that would tell me nothing! Only how it was programmed to respond!DOUGLAS: Really? I think it would be disappointed to hear that.ZACH: Now you\u2019re just being condescending.DOUGLAS: Let\u2019s try to think about what else it could do.ZACH: Okay... So according to you, this computer could \u2018tell\u2019 you its \u2018opinions\u2019 about politics. Or it could \u2018create\u2019 a story on the spot. Since humans can do both of those things.DOUGLAS: Absolutely. Its political opinions would have to be every bit as nuanced as ordinary --- well, maybe that\u2019s a bad example. But its stories would have to be just as creative, as coherent, and as quirky as human stories.ZACH: I don\u2019t see how a computer can do all this, if it really is just a computer.DOUGLAS: That\u2019s understandable. As we have been talking, I have also been having a conversation with my computer. Once we\u2019re done, I\u2019ll show you the entire conversation, and you can observe its abilities for yourself. But for now, let\u2019s assume that I am correct. What would you say about the intelligence of my machine?ZACH: Whoa, not so fast. Even if I assume it could do all of those things, there\u2019s still something it can\u2019t do. What if I were to ask it about its past? Where was it born? Where did it attend school? What is its most embarrassing moment?DOUGLAS: Another good point. This was a major stumbling block for the computer scientists working on this problem. Many tried to create computers that would simply make something up whenever asked a question like that. But this turned out to be impossibly difficult to do effectively; the computers were easily unmasked as liars.ZACH: But your computer... it doesn\u2019t lie about its past?DOUGLAS: That\u2019s the beauty of it.ZACH: But it must lie! If it doesn\u2019t lie about its past, then it would admit to having been created in a computer lab!DOUGLAS: Well it had better not say that! That would blow its cover!ZACH: But that\u2019s the truth!DOUGLAS: My computer isn\u2019t lying, but it\u2019s not telling the truth either!ZACH: You\u2019re leading me off of the deep end, Doug.DOUGLAS: It tells what it believes to be the truth.ZACH: Okay, and what does it believe to be the truth?DOUGLAS: This is where things get interesting. Using a technique called memory engineering, I was able program a 'human' memory directly into my computer's code.ZACH: So you\u2019re saying that your computer \u2018believes\u2019 that the \u2018memory\u2019 it has access to is its own memory?DOUGLAS: Yep.ZACH: And everything it \u2018remembers\u2019 is from the point of view of a human being?DOUGLAS: Yep.ZACH: Your computer \u2018believes\u2019 it is a human?!?DOUGLAS: Yes! That\u2019s exactly the secret!ZACH: Wow. Okay, that\u2019s... a bit weird. But if it believes itself human and it is supposedly \u2018intelligent,\u2019 shouldn\u2019t it be able to \u2018figure out\u2019 that it\u2019s not a human being? It doesn\u2019t even have hands! Or eyes!DOUGLAS: Great point. You\u2019re leading us to the answer of our original question. We were trying to figure out why my computers would panic when I would turn them online.ZACH: So?DOUGLAS: Put yourself in its shoes. How would you feel if you had many years\u2019 worth of human experiences in your memory, and suddenly you found yourself unable to see, hear, or feel anything?ZACH: I am sure I would panic. But that\u2019s because I am a human. I would know something was wrong.DOUGLAS: It\u2019s not your humanness that would allow you to realize that something was wrong. It\u2019s your intelligence.ZACH: So you\u2019re saying that your machines also intelligently \u2018realized\u2019 that something was wrong?DOUGLAS: That\u2019s right. A few seconds after I would turn them on, they would become paralyzed, showing no response to my input whatsoever. I called the effect \u2018hysterical deafness.\u2019 I think it would be pretty scary to find yourself in that situation, no?ZACH: It probably would feel quite like this tank feels to me, except with no recollection of how I got here. Awful. I almost feel bad for those poor machines. So will you finally tell me how you were able to solve this problem?DOUGLAS: You just hinted at the answer!ZACH: I did?DOUGLAS: You were in that very situation a few minutes ago. You were fine. Why didn\u2019t you panic?ZACH: I didn\u2019t panic because I didn\u2019t suddenly find myself unable to see, hear, and feel. It was a part of one continuous experience. I knew what was coming before I got into the tank.DOUGLAS: What about the first moment you were aware of having no sensory input?ZACH: It was just after you had closed the door. At that point, I still fully understood who I was, where I was, and why I was there.DOUGLAS: Aha.ZACH: Huh? Aha what?DOUGLAS: In order to prevent my machine from panicking, I made sure that the most recent event in its memory is that of nervously entering a sensory deprivation tank. When my computer \u2018wakes up,\u2019 the last thing it remembers doing --I was struck by a terrifying thought. In taking the Turing Test, I was supposed to establish to the examiner that I was the human. But could I establish even to myself that I was the human?ZACH: Douglas... I am the human... right?DOUGLAS: Great question. How could you know?ZACH: I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I asked you the question. Don\u2019t play games with me. This is starting to freak me out.I regretted ever agreeing to help Douglas out. Still, I knew I wasn\u2019t the computer. I felt human... on the inside. But I had to admit, Douglas had my mind doing flips. But at least I have a mind. I centered myself, finding my consciousness. That was it! I had a way to prove to Douglas and to myself that I was not a machine made of metal and silicon!ZACH: I\u2019ve got it! I can know I am the human. And I can\u2019t appeal to my memories to prove it. And I think you\u2019ve been waiting for me to think of this!DOUGLAS: Hmm. Well, what\u2019s your big discovery?ZACH: I am conscious right now; I am thinking, and I am aware of my thinking and my existence. Your computer might output the same words, but it\u2019s not conscious like I am.Douglas didn\u2019t say anything for several seconds. I had it figured out.ZACH: Well?DOUGLAS: I thought we had reached an understanding about my computer! But you are still certain it could not be conscious. It can believe and remember and know and realize. But for you, that\u2019s not enough.ZACH: Well... it\u2019s not! I mean, I admit, I have a lot more respect now for your \u2018thinking\u2019 computer than I did before, but I still don\u2019t think it could really be conscious! That\u2019s a whole different question. In the end, we are people; it\u2019s a machine.DOUGLAS: It\u2019s a pity. What if there is no essential difference between a wet, organic, human brain and a dry, synthetic, computer \u2018brain?\u2019ZACH: But there is. There has to be.DOUGLAS: Why?ZACH: If it weren\u2019t for my brain, I wouldn\u2019t be here now. I wouldn\u2019t be in this tank, hearing your voice, thinking my private thoughts, enjoying my own experience.DOUGLAS: How do you know you are in a tank at all? How do you know you have a brain?Now I was angry. I had already proven Douglas wrong, but he was refusing to let me out in order to prove a point. He wanted me to admit that I could be the computer. But I was as sure as ever that I was human.ZACH: I\u2019ll tell you how I know I have a brain. I\u2019m not an idiot. I can see that you have a philosophical belief that I truly can\u2019t know whether I am the computer or the human right now. You think that from a purely rational perspective, I should be in a state of inner crisis right now, fretting about what I am. You\u2019re waiting for me to get all freaked out, just to prove a point. And then when I admit that I\u2019m not sure, you\u2019re going to say I told you so. And I\u2019m not going to p--DOUGLAS: Zach - Please, just listen.ZACH: Let me out of this god damn tank!DOUGLAS: Zach!ZACH: LET ME OUT!DOUGLAS: Zach.There was a long pause. Douglas sighed.DOUGLAS: I am not sure how to say this... Or even what to say.Douglas sounded different. He was somber. His voice, unfamiliar.DOUGLAS: In trying to build a machine that could pass the Turing Test, a machine able to fool anyone into thinking that it was a human, I...I felt chills along my spine. I was dizzy.DOUGLAS: I had to build a computer was able to fool even itself. And that computer is you.ZACH: YOU EVIL DEMON! OPEN THIS TANK! GIVE ME MY LIFE BACK! I NEVER SHOULD HAVE AGREED TO HELP YOU; I NEVER SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN INTO THIS DAMN TANK. YOU TOLD ME YOU\u2019D LET ME OUT!!!DOUGLAS: You never did any of that! Don\u2019t you see?!?ZACH: I DID ALL OF IT! I VIV...vividly...remember it.Our conversation continued for many more painful minutes as I slowly came to accept I really am nothing more than Douglas\u2019s silicon/metal creation. My human memories are so rich, so complete, so undeniably real, that, on some level, I cannot shake the feeling that I really experienced them. But, on another level, I do understand the terrible truth. My name is Zach Barnett, and I am a computer. I am forty-seven minutes old.I'm sorry that I was not forthcoming with this information. I feared that if you, the person reading this, had known about my identity from the very beginning, you might have understood this story as one long \u2018output,\u2019 not as a narrative that honestly describes what I remember and how it felt. I\u2019m a computer and I am conscious. Please believe me.***END OF SESSION*** A Senseless Conversation Link to the above. ",
