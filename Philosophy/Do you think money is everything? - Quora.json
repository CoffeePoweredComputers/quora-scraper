            "answer_text": "No, but that differs person to person. Money is entitled to a value. It has a value and you can't really take it away. That's something people need to understand. Generally, people think that giving importance to money or value is a sign of greediness and so on. We judge people by the way they behave for money. We fear telling out loud, about money's value as people might make assumptions. But it's all fake. There isn't a soul who does not care about money. We all yearn for things. We all fill in our basic desires using cash. So we can't really differentiate people or classify them. I remember people pointing out loud that they believe money is absolutely nothing in life. Note: it has its value. The outfit we wear and the food we consume and so on, name it- is bought out of money. Whoever claims that money is not at all important, in order to seem less selfish, is actually filled with pride and is attention-seeking. We do need money. How else would you pay for food? How else would you get shelter? If you get shelter from someone else- do remember that they too, are paying for the shelter. Whatever you get has something to do with money. There are several kinds of joy. Some that money can buy and some that money cannot buy. Can't really fuss much about it. You really want a good, cozy house to live in? You need money. Good food to enjoy with your spouse? Money. Travel around the world? Money. And at the same time, money won't bring back the dead or someone who wishes not to be in your life. There are things you can buy and things you cannot buy. Your joy depends on that. And you know what? There is nothing wrong with yearning for money. There is nothing wrong with money at all and I realise that as I write this. Why isn't there anything wrong? Because money isn't illegal. You work hard, use your effort and your intelligence to get paid. You do trade something, so the cash in hand belongs to you. It belongs to you, entirely. However, it goes off limits when people go overboard with the things they can do with money. And money could destroy someone. Money could fill a person with greed and cover up everything. That's where you've got humanity fighting. We need to face the truth and accept it: Money is essential to survive. Yet, money shouldn't control us. It shouldn't take over us- it has its importance. Money has its value. You leave it where it belongs\u2026 Its importance, however; depends on you. ",

            "answer_text": " Yes. Okay, okay. Hear me out, before you all start bashing the life out of me: Money isn\u2019t be all, end all. However, money is a pretty huge chunk of everything. Money dictates everything. It decides if whether or not you get to eat dinner tonight. Or if you\u2019re sleeping with two blankets because you can\u2019t afford the heater in your house. People like to say that money can\u2019t buy love and friendship. But every person you\u2019ve ever known, befriended or became enemies with is an indirect byproduct of money. Money starts relationships.  You meet eyes with this girl at the bar and think she\u2019s drop-dead gorgeous. Why? Is it her perfectly straight, white smile? On average, braces can cost from $5,000-6,000. Is it that cute t-shirt? That was $32 from Urban Outfitters. Is it the intoxicating smell of her hair? The smell of that coconut shampoo you like so much? The fact she can afford $104 for her own electricity and water bills so she can shower is so hot. People don\u2019t realize that money is on everything. It\u2019s the clothes you wear. What phone you have. The computer you type on. The food you eat. The school you go to- if you even went to school at all! Money dictates everything. Your class of education, your quality of living, the type of people you\u2019re surrounded with. The exact words you speak. Your opinions. Your beliefs. It\u2019s all the byproduct of money. It\u2019s easy to be ignorant and preach how: Oh, money is meaningless! Money means nothing! Only shallow people care about such trivial things! But it\u2019s not true. Money posses an immeasurable amount power. It destroys lives. It makes new ones. I think money is everything. But just because it\u2019s everything, doesn\u2019t mean you should revolve your whole life around it. You don\u2019t need money to be happy. You don\u2019t need it to find love. You don\u2019t need it to find fulfillment in life. But money is everywhere, and it\u2019s important to remember that. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cHavin' money's not everything, not havin' it is.\u201d This is a lyric from Kanye West\u2019s song Good Life that immediately came to my mind. For me, money isn\u2019t everything, but I know how it can make life shitty without it. I remember living in a homeless shelter. I would walk past stores and see people buying food. I could only look at the food. I didn\u2019t have the money to afford to eat. It completely sucked being in that situation. Now, I have money in my pocket. I can eat at any place that I choose. I recently went to a smoothie shop. I ordered a smoothie and vegan chocolate chip cookie. It felt great being able to waste almost $8 bucks on these items and tip $1. Later on, I went to a southern cuisine restaurant that is buzzing on social media due to the fact it\u2019s owned by a famous person from a reality show. I ate their fried chicken meal with macaroni and cheese, collard greens, and Kandi yams. I only drank water. The meal ended up costing $20 bucks and $4 for the tip. In both instances, it felt absolutely wonderful being able to have money. I didn\u2019t have to be the person looking at other people consuming food and wondering exactly how it tasted. Money gave me access to solving this riddle. Money is simply a tool that can open doors. It keeps my smartphone on. It allows me to purchase a seat on the bus to go to Nashville next month. It buys my shoes, deodorant, dish washing soap, lotion, toothpaste, medication, U.S. Passport, Atlanta Dream season tickets, and so many other necessary and not so necessary items. I\u2019ve tried to use money to replace love and friendship. I discovered that it cannot make someone love you or care about you. It won\u2019t prevent you from feeling loneliness. Spending money on prostitutes only lead to emptiness for me. There\u2019s nothing better than being with someone that you don\u2019t have to pay to be in your life. I\u2019m not just talking about sex workers. I\u2019m applying that to family and friends. You want people in your life that love and appreciate you for you. You don\u2019t want them in your life simply for your things. I know what it feels like to live with and without money. I learned that living with money makes your life easier. You don\u2019t worry as much about how you are going to pay for something. If you need it, you simply go and get it. I remember when I would lose money in my pockets and find it weeks later. In fact, I lost a $20 bill in my pocket. I happened to be at the gas station when I discovered it. The gas station attendant looked at me and said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t even know you had that money in your pocket. I can tell by the way you were puzzled to see it. You must lose money and forget about it all of the time. I wish I had that problem.\u201d I could only smile and agree with him. I made $700 per week after taxes. I was a single guy without a care in the world. I also know what it feels like to live without money. I had to learn how to adapt to my circumstances in the men\u2019s shelter. I quickly began to talk to the men and find out what they did to eat. I discovered many places that fed homeless people for free. In addition, on the weekends, I would work in the shelter\u2019s kitchen and eat really well. I learned how to get around Atlanta on the transportation system. I discovered how to keep my clothes clean. I still have these skills. I am bipolar. I sometimes experience extreme mania and extreme depression. In addition, this is often coupled with anxiety, panic attacks, self hatred, self love, and grandiose opinions of myself. I lack control over these mood swings. There isn\u2019t any amount of money that would take this mental health condition away from me. If I could buy it away, I would. However, I know that isn\u2019t a reality. I would love to have a close relationship with my family. Unfortunately, I do not believe that my family wants to understand me. They simply want me to be what they want me to be. I will never meet their expectations. But family is definitely more than money. If you have it, hold on to it and cherish it. I\u2019ve never been the type of person to have true friends in real life. I have plenty of associates, but I\u2019ve never had close friendships with people. I have family members that have really awesome friendships with people from high school and university. I don\u2019t have this in my life. I definitely know friendship is way more important than money. ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cMoney has never made man happy, nor will it; there is nothing in its nature to produce happiness. The more of it one has the more one wants.\u201d\u00ad \u2013 Benjamin Franklin Money gives you freedom and choices. You can decide where and how you want to live when you have a good income or financial resources. On the other hand, when you do not have much money, choice may be something that you cannot afford. The choices available to you may not really be choices at all. While true that \u201cmoney can\u2019t buy happiness\u201d, it at least provides some security. Being poor is never something that one strives to attain. Many people who become extremely wealthy often grow up in poor households, which strengthens their resolve to never again relive the experience. \u201cYou aren't wealthy until you have something money can't buy\u201d LoveMoney can buy lust, attraction and power\u2026but it can\u2019t buy love. This is because love is something intimate; something heartfelt; something mysterious. Money is none of these things. Money is simply a method of exchange \u2013 no more and no less. It\u2019s used to pay for a product or a service; its convenience, comfort, and luxury \u2013 none of which typify what human beings truly need. Many of us find this lesson out the hard way. We accumulate more, only to feel emptier. This is because we are raised in a culture that glamorizes wealth; which, in effect, leads to misconceptions and false beliefs. TimeEach passing minute is time that you will never get back; you are one minute closer to dying. This is not meant to be morbid or depressing, but truthful. Our life starts to fade away from the moment we are born. Despite all of the scientific and medical advances, there exists no practical way to significantly extend life. The extremely wealthy have spent countless amounts of money in the vain attempt to extend their lives only to find out that they die around the same age as everyone else. No amount of money will be able to turn the clocks back. We must simply take life in, moment-by-moment, while experiencing it to the fullest. PeaceThe cultivation of your thoughts is the only thing that will ever bring you true peace. One aspect of this is accepting when bad things happen and turning it into a positive experience. Look at the countless amounts of money that governments and individuals have spent in the name of \u201cpeace\u201d. These vast sums have never been able to come close to what we would define as \u201cpeaceful\u201d. More importantly, your inner peace does not depend on the \u2018balance\u2019 section of your bank statement. It\u2019s how you train your mind, set expectations, and define what inner peace truly means to you. TalentThe gifts and abilities that you possess in your mind and body are priceless. While money can certain help develop a talent, it will never be able to purchase a talent or skill. Aside from innate talent, there is the ability to learn a skill or talent; this will never be able to be purchased with any amount of money. The mental processes and dexterity of the mind and body will never be purchasable\u2026they are invaluable. HealthWhile certainly true that money can purchase healthcare and medicine, it cannot replace natural health once it\u2019s gone. At the same time, activities like exercise, preventative medicine, and natural self-care costs little to nothing. It\u2019s almost depressing to see celebrities spend outrageous amounts of money in the vain attempt to keep their \u201cnatural beauty\u201d. First off, aging is natural beauty; wrinkling is natural beauty; gray hair is natural beauty. On the other hand, surgical procedures that implant plastic and other medicinal substances into the body? This is not at all natural. True friendsPossessing money may certainly attract people who want to be friends, but it doesn\u2019t guarantee true friendship. Most true friends love one another\u2026and what did we discuss about money and love? The same concept applies here. True and lasting friends are the ones there during the \u2018boom\u2019 and are still there during the \u2018bust\u2019. Money and possessions don\u2019t matter to true friends\u2026your person matters. KnowledgeThe information that you accumulate, the elements of your intellect, and the ways that you exhibit wisdom can never be bought. Have you ever wondered why some of the wealthiest people seem to act in the most asinine ways? This is because money or something else has influenced their thought processes. Some wealthy people have stated how money makes them feel \u2018invincible\u2019, and as a result have made some truly bad decisions. So it\u2019s not only the acquisition of this knowledge that makes it invaluable, it\u2019s the practical application of this knowledge\u2026neither of which money can buy. ",

            "answer_text": "Everything? No. Important? A lot more than I originally thought it was. My father made and still makes a very decent salary. However, my parents relationship was\u2026 rocky. In fact, they haven\u2019t lived under the same roof for any extended period of time in over a decade. This, despite the fact that they\u2019re still married, act as a couple, and had my youngest sister long after they weren\u2019t living together anymore. Trust me, as strange as it sounds, it works better for everyone. During the time period that they did live together, the fighting was a constant. And very often, it seemed to center on money. Whether there was enough of it. Whether my father should take that newer more prestigious job that was located on the other side of the country. Whether or not we were all appreciative enough of everything that was being sacrificed for us in the interest of earning more etc. So, by the time I was a teenager, I was pretty positive that I hated money. We definitely had it, and we were all definitely miserable. Furthermore, never having really known anything other than a materially comfortable existence, I couldn\u2019t appreciate exactly how large a role money had played in it. So, I took the fairly reactive stance that I would never chase it. I deliberately refused to pick a major in college based on future earning potential, I refused to put any value on creature comforts, and I had the upmost contempt for anyone who did. However, as I have matured slightly, I find myself far more appreciative of the reasons some people do put a high value on money and on the act of acquiring it. Having it as child afforded me some incredibly positive life experiences. I got to see more of the world by the time I was ten, than some people do in an entire lifetime. I got to travel the country. I got to join clubs and play sports. I had access to up to date technology. I picked college based on where I wanted to go with the expectation that the vast majority of it would be paid for. However, as an adult, my job is, and has been in some form or another since I joined the workforce, to work with adolescents who come from families that don\u2019t really have much of anything in the way of financial stability. It\u2019s opened my eyes to a lot, and has caused me to reassess a lot of my own hang ups. Money, at least in society as it functions now, is a necessary tool. Not having enough of it is highly detrimental. Detrimental, in ways that it is hard to fathom for people who have always been accustomed to it\u2019s presence. When is enough of it enough? Well, I don\u2019t know, and I guess it varies. For my father, who grew up in abject poverty, there can never be enough. For me? I guess it falls somewhere in the middle. Except that my middle is skewed, by having been raised in such a way as to expect that it would always be there. So, while money isn\u2019t everything in the sense that it doesn\u2019t magically create happiness for those who have it, it does afford a degree of stability, safety, and protection from some of the more dangerous aspects of life, that can be invaluable in terms of having the time/ability to find exactly what it is that does bring fulfillment and satisfaction. And like most things I suppose, it\u2019s about finding a balance. At any rate, it makes me laugh now to realize that so much of my teenaged existential angst over money, was in fact only made possible because my family had enough of it. ",

            "answer_text": "Actually, Yes. Life is all about money.  You are born and you are put up in school. Not because you are meant to learn, gain new experiences and become a happy, intelligent and better human being but because one day you can find a good job and bring in some money. People (mostly) compare your success with others based on your bank balance - how much money you make through your business or job. More money means more success Mostly, people do not see how much valuable your work is to the society or how much it is contributing for the welfare of others. If you are rich and wealthy it means you are successful in the eyes of many. Undoubtedly! I tell you a story. When I was quite young, my uncle was talking about his friend, let\u2019s call him Sam. \u201cSam was a person who bothered least about the money.He was humorous, entertaining and knew how to make people around him feel happy. He do not work but he keeps good relationship with people. When he got married and had children, he used to take his wife and young children to various places and they have visited a number of places in the entire country. Though the wife was worried because they did not have enough money to sustain children and once sold her jewellery to pay the bills and fees, he did not bother about going out and finding a job. His habits were just the same and the wife then started working to take care of the family and keep up with the expenses. He believed in god and always lived a happy life not caring about money. That is the reason for his success.\u201d I asked: What, I do not get it? How this makes him successful when the family is facing financial problems? Uncle said: He knew his father saved a lot of money which he will get when the father will die. End of story. See how money came into picture in the life of a person who just do not care about making money. There is no escape from the fact that we all need money and no matter what it will always be important. Money is created by us so that we can use it to buy goods and services necessary to sustain our life. You need money to get food, pay bills, buy things for your loved ones, educate your children and fulfill other necessities. Greed is bad but making money for your necessities isn\u2019t. If you have enough money that you can provide yourself and your family a happy life then you should relax for a moment, give time to your loved ones and feel the happiness by spending time with them.  I personally believe that being wealthy is important but it is also very important how you make money and how your actions/work contribute to the welfare of people, nation and environment. Your life is a success if you are wealthy, have a happy family and your work benefits the world. If you are wealthy, you should work hard and contribute to the welfare of those who need your help or work to spread some happiness and smile. Even if you are not wealthy and living an average life, your life is a success if you are able to live happily with your family because deep inside we all know love is what makes the life worth living. I hope this enlightens! ",

            "answer_text": "Money is the Force. The Force is You extended from the physical body. You are God.Money is our mundane way, one them, of expressing and extending our spiritual energy to bring sustenance to ourselves. We can all do it. A child with chores, an adult splitting rocks, an elderly greeter at WalMart. They are extending their internal energy through physical manifestations for sustenance.We can then use our brain to assess and pool the collective Force of others, stamp it, align to it, ride it, harness it. This is wealth. The rule of wealth though, an embedded rule of the Force Is you must circulate the Force, it cannot be hoarded. Stagnant Force disintegrates. The Parable of the Talents codifies this. The simplest way is to use the Force to create work-money-sustenance....Force for others. Jobs. Food. Consumerism. Capitalism. Capital investments. A billion Force pieces allows a small bank to have 1 million customers who never have a balance over one million dollars. Wise Force usage is using ones immensity to bring others along in their Purpose/Destiny.There are of course other rules, tools and laws but Money is us growing in that externalized manifestation of the spiritual self.I made that with my harnessed effort . From idea thought to plan to exertion to manifestations.Not everyone though knows, learns or is ready to learn the Lesson and Responsibility of Magnitude. We can choose opt, out of, not align to Magnitude because we're here focusing on another Paths.Like spirit college.Oh, you're doing Force Magnitude Money?I'm doing Force Personal Other Healing.Judy is doing Force Art Music Emotion Engagement.Bob is doing Force Death Justice Truth Criminal.The Force, like God is both inherently neutral and therefore able to be mutable, malleable and moralled but it truly, like water, is always just the Force. A glass of water. A raindrop. Waterboarding. All water.Money is akin in neutrality similar to water but it is simply an agreed upon Thought naming of a formation of the Force into currency. Ironically the more money you have the less cash you tend to carry.The lesson to the moralled, judged perception of poor and rich there Is that Money Force Is simply Thought manifested.The biggest Control Alignment thought about Money is that it is materially real.Have you ever noticed how the poor think about money night and day but manifest so little?They are focused on the middle step, similar to thinking about the oven all the time and not the first step of the recipe, then the oven, then Formations /Materializations and then the Manifestations , the chocolate chip cookies.Rich people focus on the Manifestations . \" I want a million Thought Forces to spend (dollars).....\" 3rd step. Begin with the end in mind. (Just because you are doing a High Jedi task does not make you wise, deep, special. Hence why anyone can become rich. Any numbnuts can use water to get wet, it takes skill though to learn the manipulation of water, the Force itself.) Then they design a recipe, Step 1.And experiment with Baking, Step 2.Poor mentalities never consider that Experimentation is a Step. Step 2a. Then Reimplementation, Step 2b, until you suss out more flour, less sugar, better butter, hotter oven. Perhaps Steps 2a thru 2zd, but you keep trying, testing , observing, altering. Perfect.Manifestation.This is why Financial management is such a critical skill to teach to children. You are teaching them there Is a Force for Money , You are the engine of it . Now simply decide how much you need want for your Path, Purpose, Destiny. ",

            "answer_text": "Hell no. Life is about finding true happiness. Happiness can only come from within. It doesn\u2019t come from money or anything material. Why? If you rely on money for your happiness, then you fall into an endless cycle of frustration. What cycle? The cycle of thinking \u201cI\u2019ll be happy if I get X,\u201d then getting X, not being satisfied, then thinking \u201cI\u2019ll be happy if I get Y,\u201d then getting Y, and then keeping on with that same cycle of frustration. Unfortunately this is what we\u2019ve been led to believe - that chasing after money and after temporary things will bring us fulfillment. But it doesn\u2019t. In America people are more depressed and anxious than ever, even though we have so much. That\u2019s because the more you have, the more you want, and the harder it is to find true happiness and contentment.How does one achieve happiness then? Have you ever searched all over the place for something, only to realize that you\u2019ve had it within you all along. Happiness is like that. Rather than trying to fulfill every desire that comes to our minds, we can instead be content with what we currently have. That\u2019s because trying to fulfill each and every desire we have is an endless process that only leads to frustration because the more we try to satisfy our desires, the more desires we end up having. And we can never be happy if we are always in a state of desiring something because as long as we desire something, we can never achieve peace in the current moment.The way to achieve this state of contentment is through spirituality. There\u2019s a reason every major culture has had a component of spirituality to it. We\u2019re spiritual beings at our core. Through spirituality, we reconnect to our original source (The Supreme, God, Allah, Jehovah, Krishna, etc.). By doing so, we begin to experience everlasting, ever-increasing bliss. Through this bliss we can become fully happy and content. We become unconditionally happy meaning that we\u2019re happy all the time despite other circumstances in our life. You won\u2019t have to search out for happiness anymore. You\u2019ll always have it with you instead. Look how happy he is. Proof that you don\u2019t need much to be happy. That being said, money is nice in the sense that it affords us our basic necessities. After that, the path of inner contentment will always bring more happiness than the path of greed and materialism.

Money (Especially at death) brings out the true dark nature of the real person hiding behind the mask. Money stays here when your dead, money won't save you from the same ending destined for all of our journeys. Money places emphasis on status, that someone at the top is somehow better than someone from poor socionomic backgrounds. Money doesn't define the person, integrity defines the person. Money sounds nice, but it doesn't make people do nice things overall. Why are the wealthy experiencing the same mental health concerns as everyone else? Because we are just evolved monkeys who decided this paper, or this metal has currency. I ADDED THE LAST PART, YOU DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE READING, BUT PERHAPS YOU'D LET ME RANT FOR A SHOT MOMENT OF TIME TO RAISE A HOPEFULLY GENUINE POINT. HOW I HAD TO LOSE ALL TO BE FILTHY RICH (With enlightenment and wisdom I wish I knew sooner) \ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47\ud83d\udc47 Earlier this year I lost everything\u2026 Literally everything but the cloths I own & a few sentimental random items etc. I live in a friend's dining room, declared bankruptcy, all from a insidious addiction. But I must say, it took losing my possessions, selling my furniture, car, computer, anything of value. Granted it at the time was for substance that I grapple with. However it's losing everything I used to hold dear, having a nice car, good stereo, decent computer, new furniture etc. It sent me through a whirlwind of emotions. Depression, loss, suicidal ideation etc. But once the initial phase moved past I actually learnt\u2026 I'm no longer held down by pointless possessions, my car didn't define who I was, my computer wasn't a part of my personality anyone gave a shit about. Anyone who defined me by the way I dress is not someone I want in my life. Well not to dress like a total slob lol. Casual and loathe formal attire. Comfortable but smart, I don't fit any status, no name brands advertised. I wish to be judged based on me, my interactions, my creativity, my wishes to help others as I once sorely needed. Not material positions that plague my mind, needing the best, for whom? Everything I have is enough, and I'm comfortable. Adding more doesn't make better, grander, change who I truly am. Stripped naked and venerable for all to tear apart, I am exactly like you, colour might be different, origins might not match yours, status most likely not poignant like desired ones by others. I am man, human, bleed, cry, laugh, breath, my kidneys can replace yours if you were ill, I am not of my possessions, I hold dear the things that matter. It took losing it all to gain so much more than I ever dreamt. I gained control over my addiction, completed rehab, enrolled to study & have a fresh start. No concerns for status, what I do or don't have. Having nothing is so liberating, I've never felt so free. My phone is 3 years old & I still love it. The old status seeking me would upgrade, why? Because I have the latest crap that does the same as the last crap. But now I can take photos of my crap in an even better quality HD camera. I realised what I do have works perfectly for my immediate needs. Will having more make me better than I hope to be? Will having status symbols make people see I am empathetic and wish to help those suffering the way I once did? Drugs took it all away, but it also gave me a complete fresh start. Not many people are lucky for a second chance. So no, money is no concern to me whatsoever. My desire to help and educate those who struggle is considerably stronger than having some crap to feel better, or impress some selfish arsehole who I don't respect. You don't have to go extremes like I, but we all have the same innate ability to see if we take the blinders off and asses the situation. Will money make you better? Solve your problems? Maybe at the start, but there will be far worse issues around the corner that one can't just chuck money at to go away. Cancer doesn't take a cheque, Alzheimer's disease doesn't take PayWave, schizophrenia doesn't do PayPal, Parkinson's disease doesn't understand Interbank transfers\u2026 Life can be so much more wholesome when one loses the lust for money, status & admiration. Life is full of free things, stars at night, sunset in summer, aurora borealis, the serenity of life deep in a forrest, the secluded deserts, raging rivers, majestic oceans. The animal life that surrounds us. Money can't buy that, infact money is actively destroying that as we speak. Money, greed, power, status\u2026? Do you really want to be apart of that mean machine? What is left after we've ravaged our home to leave for our successors? An empty wasteland derived from greed. Well not for me at least\u2026 Stay safe all, be Covid19 smart and look after your mental health \u270c\ufe0f ",

            "answer_text": "Definitely not about my life. As a child I wondered why we are here. I was four years old and knew there was no Santa. I got interested in bible stories and finally went to a Catholic School (my mom laughed when I wanted to go as she said they were strict, she didn\u2019t go to church, either did my dad). I got baptized when I was twelve and it was the happiest day of my life. Well, much happened to me, and I did get taken advantage of in many ways. It\u2019s too tragic to write about, but ended up marrying the wrong person for safety. I passed up many wealthy men who wanted to marry me, and some days I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t do that. I went away from the church for years, ended up marrying three times and being left twice. The problem with me and money is that I have been abandoned a couple of times, and found out I had to depend on myself. So, God was good to me in that my mom left me her house and some savings. I studied the stock market as I know she didn\u2019t believe in it. I would die if I wasted her hard-earned money. Since I was careful, I didn\u2019t lose the money, I made a lot more and saved instead of spending. That\u2019s why I write articles to young people telling them to save because we never know what\u2019s going to happen. As dad used to say \u201cpay yourself first.\u201d which he meant try to save at least ten percent of everything you get. Now, money seemed to be the most important thing to my first husband who left me when our business went down. He married a wealthy woman. The bad part of it is splitting the children. They would stay with me and then with \u201cthem,\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d had lotsa money. It gets to people no matter what they say\u2026gold. \u201cThey\u201d had a sign in their house which said \u201che who has the gold has the rule.\u201d And, she was supposed to be big in the Episcopal church. I think it gets to my girls at times. However, the elder girl made all of her big money herself! I\u2019m proud of that, but, it can get to you to make a lot of money, also. It seems when people get richer they want more and more. So, I feel sorry for those who put money first, and not God. It is against the First Commandment \u201cPut the Lord, thy God, above all.\u201d My girls do believe in God, but one not sure about Jesus. I\u2019m hurt quite often when I find them choosing to be at \u201ctheir parent\u2019s\u201d functions instead of with me. After all, \u201cthey\u201d have very exciting lives. I\u2019ve had several different lifestyles, and sometimes I look back to my convent school where we wore uniforms, no one knew how much the other families had, and all studied quite a bit, all girls schools, no dating, no fooling around, just church, school, and a little recreation, then more study and sleep in a dorm. We always had nuns looking after us. At the time, we couldn\u2019t wait to get out, but now I would like to be back there! Sometimes, we do not know when we have it good. I went on to be a nerd in high school at first, then learned the ways of the world of makeup, clothes, mannerisms, and won Homecoming Queen. I found out all is \u201cimage.\u201d People fall for image. Later, I found out there\u2019s such a thing as being \u201ctoo popular.\u201d Long story, but passed up the good guys and ended up living a bad guy. Came to Dallas to start over, but married someone from the hotel\u2026 If you marry, be sure to do what I was told to do and I didn\u2019t. Marry someone with the same religion or the same goals in life, the same beliefs, and discuss the future. People are on their best behavior when dating. Of course nowadays, people don't seem to bother to get married. I think that\u2019s the trouble with the world now, no families. We are leaning towards a culture of globalization and humanism. That\u2019s another discussion. This is about \u201cis money all there is?\u201d Life should be about love of God, family and country. There was a recent poll and the happiest people are those who are married, with family and love each other. Not the richest. ",

            "answer_text": "Go back 70,000 years. All creatures were equally balanced on earth with human races being with more cerebrum. What was life all about? Passing on genes to keep species alive and thrive. All creatures had the same purpose: survival and growth of species. Then humans making great use of cerebrum succeed in the purpose increasing number exponentially. Survival became easier and now humans thrived. Humans grew social. Society grew. The problem of survival went behind the curtains. Human life became complex than before. New problems of daily life started arising which were not entirely natural. Instances: Now humans didn\u2019t hunt so needed food, so, came food sellers.Better clothes, more clothes, to this end, came cloth makers.Ornaments became part of life, therefore, came ornament makers.Need to build bigger houses, to help, came laborers.Protection from invading groups needed specialized weapons, there were weapon makers.No one had all, came traders.To solve the problems, solutions were created and so were many solution creators. Solutions became valuable so needed value in return. Early forms of Money came up to help in exchange of solution to the problem. Complexity grew. Solutions grew. Now trades of solutions for problems increased exponentially as did complexity. Money made this trading easier. Money became a primary facilitator of solutions to almost all problems. Now it seems money is a need for everything. So is life all about money? Go back to the time before life became complex. What was life all about? Passing on genes to continuation human life. Now it's not a problem as we are in plenty. We have grown out of the survival problem. But remove all complexities of life. It becomes simple like 70,000 years ago. A family, friends living and fighting for survival to ensure their lineage goes on and on. Today humanity has so many problems there are so many purposes (to solve these problems). But at the heart of everything is survival of species. Ask Sentinels of Andaman. They want their lineage to live on and on. Life is all about continuation of human life generation after generation. All others are ancillary to the continuation of humans. ",

            "answer_text": " It really depends on an individual. Most individuals don\u2019t care about the kind of life they live. They really just look for people around them, see how they eat, drink, party in teenage, marry, beget kids, get jobs during mid-age and spend time with grandkids or visiting churches when old. Seeing this, they create a template for themselves and build their life using their template. If you are that person who lives a templatized life, then money is not that important for you. One can get most of the things promised by a templatized life without really putting money or self-improvement as the focus for ones life. Such people are also the ones who just don\u2019t see the point in earning more money than what\u2019s sufficient or are generally disparaging of those who work hard or take risks to earn more money. However, if you find no happiness or meaning in the templatized life, then money is definitely the most important thing for you. I\u2019d call such a person a \u201cfree soul\u201d. The true value of money lies in this fact: Money essentially buys freedom and time. A free soul needs time and freedom to do more than what the templatized life promises. Free souls are not happy being the best shoulder to cry on or the best employee of the week. Free souls want to make a dent in the universe. They want to explore the limits of their potential. They want to wake up in the lap of Himalayas, listening to ancient monks chanting and not wake up to an alarm reminding them that they have a report to submit. They want to work crazy hours in a lab looking for that genetic loophole which might save lives of a million cancer-stricken patients, and not spend time binge-watching shows on Netflix. With time and freedom that money gets a free soul, he or she can achieve true happiness that he or she seeks. Money is also the way by which a free soul can justify his or her inability to enjoy what others enjoy from a templatized life and need for special wants from life. A free soul without money to buy time and freedom is generally sad and ridiculed by others for not following the template. But money ensures that they become ridicule-proof and shows a mirror to others who are content with the sheer ordinariness of what they expect or want from life. Most importantly, a free soul will never use money on materialistic objectives. For them, the value of money lies in the freedom and time it buys, and not the hookers or lamborghinis that can be bought. ",

            "answer_text": "No, Never, and can never be!! Money can never be everything in life. Though money can buy expensive luxury items can satisfy your needs but can never bit happiness, peace in life. Money is an important part of life because it helps us to satisfy our needs n hunger of stomach. Everyone wants monetary gain in life so that they fulfill their demands and their loved one\u2019s demand as well. Some people are so hungry for money that they use unfair means to gain money. But to utter dismay, they are the people who don\u2019t have satisfaction and peace of mind. Today, in fast moving life, we see people struggling for money, sometimes we also see brother killing his own brother for some lum-sum of money. N thats truely annoying feature of money!! They are the people who deprive themselves from the nature main elements called \u201cLove\u201d, \u201cAffection\u201d, and \u201cRespect\u201d. There is a saying goes as\u2026\u2026 \u201cIf money is lost nothing is lost, If peace is lost something is lost, But, If Respect n Character is lost everything is lost\u201d True is the saying above, having emmense of money without having earned by good means, Is the money similar to garbage Now a days, In India, We have politicians who are illiterates but have emmense of money. They also have criminal records charged on them but no one points it out because they cease everyone\u2019s mouth by giving huge amount of money. Do you think having soo much of money with them. Can bring happiness and satisfactions in their life?? No, Never, and Can never!! Bring happiness. All the politicians, criminals smuggler, people who run after money, people who assasinate other jst for the sake of money are always in a mentally distrubed condition. There condition is even worse than the beggar on the Pavements. For example :- LALU PRASAD YADAV a very famous politician. He has been charged for \u201cChara Ghotala\u201d. 95% of his incomes property, is there in Swiss Bank.SONIA GANDHI a very famous refugee politician and she is wife of Lt. Mr. Rajeev Gandhi. She has been charged for \u201c2G Spectrum Ghotala\u201d, \u201c Comman wealth Ghotala\u201d and many more to list it.ROBERT VADRA he is son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi and Husband of Priyanka Gandhi. He has been charged for \u201cLand Ghotala\u201dThere are many more politicians and assasinators but i list only few. So now you may have understood what I have been trying to say all these while. So now Infact, Beggars are much more happier than those business tycoons, self-proclaimed politicians and all the person who are money freaks. Because, Though beggars dont have enough money to buy expensive luxury items, dont have huts to get sheltered but the thing which they have is something very precious and that is peace of mind, mentally calm conditions. Its jst because they know they haven\u2019t done anything wrong to anyone. So why will they be hampered by any stranger!! Why will the police investigate them!! They are totally in a peacefull condition. Because they are earning there honest wages and are not currupt. Today, India\u2019s population has reached to 125 crores+ and 75% of people are the ones who are very rich but aren\u2019t living a peacfull life. 10% are the people who are common peoples who are educated but are unemployed and those who are employed, are earning there honest wages and are happy with there families. And remaining 15% are the people who are very poor but are happy with there family and are living in peace with only those things which God has betowed upon them. They don\u2019t have much dreams and desires. They main and much important thing in life is Love, Affection, Respect, Dignity, Love for ones Family. These are things which people must be carefull off\u2026instead of running for more money than is sufficient for all the needs in life. Because,one day we all will die and all the money would become papers again Hope it would help you all. ",

            "answer_text": "That is one of the easiest questions to answer: Think about two possible lives, one in which you are rich but depressed, and one in which you are poor but incredibly happy with your life. Which life would you rather have?  If you have suffered from Depression before, you will pick that second one without a second thought! But even if you haven\u2019t, just based on the fact that you would be happy in that second life, what do you really have to lose? Let\u2019s expand that thought just a little bit more and look at two different possible lives: Life #1: You are incredibly rich AND happy, but you do not feel fulfilled. You are doing a lot of enjoyable things but you do not feel like your life has much meaning as it brought no value to the world. Life #2: You are incredibly broke but you have given value to the world. You feel as though your passion/mission that you set yourself has brought some lasting change with it. Which life would you rather have? Understand that it\u2019s not that easy to say what life is all about, as it\u2019s not that black and white. Life is a huge mess of things, and of course money is in there somewhere too.  Money does play a big role, but if you look at rich people you will find the same things you find with poor people. You will find people who are happy, depressed, excited, and people who are bored out of their minds. You will find those that care for others and those that abuse others. And you will find people that think their life is worthless and people that work harder than any poorer person because they have a mission, passion or obsession they work towards. In this way, I would say life is definitely not all about money. Life is about whatever you make it about! For some people life is all about their family, for others about their achievement, and for others still about the experiences they make. Money is only a means to an end, nothing more.  It will not fulfill you, will not bring you happiness, and will not do anything at all on its own. But, depending on how you use it, it can make everything a lot easier. With money you can have a bigger impact on the world, support your family easier and create more options to be happy; however, whether or not you use it for that still depends on you! ",

            "answer_text": "No. Life is not all about money. Life cannot be all about a certain \u2018thing\u2019. This is because life is essentially empty and meaningless. We all fill it with meanings. We have no choice. Again these meanings are not absolute. They are arbitrary. Each one of us interprets it in ways unique to him or her. And this interpretation comes from Mankind\u2019s greatest invention-language. Interpretations, by definition, can never match the reality. In a way they are a story - a concoction, a creation weaved out of words. Each story sounds real and true to his/her author! My life would have been this and that had I had enough money at this or that phase of my life\u2026..and conversations like these are just stories, albeit real for their authors. Since childhood we are subjected to many events. They impact us in varying degrees. Stories get created around these events and they make us who we are. \u2018Only if I had gone to an English medium school, I would have gone places in my career\u2019 , \u2018 If I had a rich father, I wouldn\u2019t have languished in this rotten job-I would have been a businessman\u2019 \u2026\u2026 are all stories. We have stories about money also - stories inexorably intertwined with the events from our past. Lack of money, impoverishment, stagnation, crime etc is a story at one end of the gamut and too much money, profligacy, moral corruption, alienation is the story at the other end. All these stories are dis-empowering. The more empowering story would be: money is a tool invented by mankind to facilitate economic affairs. You need money for a lot of things. But good to remember to not lose things money can\u2019t buy. All precious (non-material) things in life are above money - things such as time, love, peace of mind, loyalty, dedication, caring children, willingness to die for the country, wisdom etc . We are very naive to believe having bought, say \u2018A\u2019 by buying that within which \u2018A\u2019 resides. We buy mansions for earning a place among the elites. We buy vacation to a serene island in order to \u2018experience\u2019 peace of mind. We buy expensive Art in order to become someone who understands art. We buy our kids admissions to elite schools and colleges in order to buy wisdom. Why do we run after these things if life is empty and meaningless ? Ultimately what gets us immense sense of fulfillment? Is it money? No. It\u2019s appreciation. We all want appreciation. And lots of it. Money, power, fame all are gateways to appreciation, for most of us. Therefore, we chase them until our lives are spent and become what they are in the first place - empty and meaningless ! ",

            "answer_text": "That differs from person to person. For me relations and having fun( in a good way) is important. So think!!! What will make you happy??? Let me tell you a story. There was a tribe in africa. People of that tribe was happy with what they have and never complained. They valued relations and even didn\u2019t know the existence of money. They possessed many riches like natural gold, diamonds, spices etc.They are happy with what they have and was leading a peaceful life. One day a civilized man ( a scientist ) encountered them while carrying on some research. He find them amusing, illiterate. He pitied and decided to educate them for their better growth. He approached them and said that he will help them. He educated them about various aspects like economy, management and so on. He took leave from them for continuing his research work and promised that he will revisit them after a year. Time passed and to fulfil his promise, the scientist returned to village. He was depressed to find the people in sorrow and dismay, who once were filled with extreme joy. He asked them to explain the reason for their sorrow. They used to live happily when once they didn\u2019t even know the existence of money. They used to share whatever they have and spent the remaining time with their loved ones. When the scientist taught them about money , knowledge and other things , they became greedy. They forgot the essence of the life and wasted their time in acquiring useless things . Moral: Its not about money , power or anything!!! The point is \u201cARE YOU HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU HAVE?\u201d If your happiness lies in money, then go after it. If it lies in the luxuries , relations , travelling\u2026.. It may be anything. Go after it. \u201cYou\u2019ll be the happiest man if YOU DON\u2019T HAVE ANY REGRETS AT THE END OF THE DAY\u201d.

Ask yourself this, \u201cDoes your 20 billion dollars matter to you now?\u201d Why would money be everything in this case? You will be dead in hours. Everyone will go through this at some point in their lives whether you are broke or worth billions. Money is not everything. Your health comes first. Health also includes happiness. Without this money is actually worthless. People want things that only make them happy. Everyone who wants money thinks it will make them happier. Guess what? Money doesn\u2019t guarantee happiness. It might seem as it does but you will be surprised how quickly it can wear off and backfire. What if you have severe health issues and can\u2019t utilize that money? Then at this point, money becomes worthless. And money cannot totally buy health. It can buy a healthy lifestyle, but can never buy health completely because we all die someday. So no, money is not everything or even close to being everything. ",

            "answer_text": "YES! MONEY MEANS EVERYTHING!. A NOTE OF LIBERTY FOR THE AFRICAN BROKE MENTALITY These two popular phrases (LIFE ISN'T ALL ABOUT MONEY and MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING ) Are the two greatest phrases used in controlling the minds of the ordinary black man (Africans), these same phrase has contributed a lot to the underdevelopment of Africa, and Nigeria in retrospect, these phrases have limited almost 70% of black Africans from leveraging the natural features of nature. am writing this article feeling extremely upset, I don't know why, but I think something isn't right with the way we think, I guess we have been living with lots of lies, said to us by our ancestors because that was same lies passed to them by the colonial masters. These lies have created a dark workspace in our minds and look like it can never be changed nor upgraded since its now part of our belief. Growing up as a little boy in the streets of Nigeria with this very same mentality of money isn't everything and life isn't all about money, was one he situation that I was in and felt very comfortable with because that was much of the limited information I could really gather about reality and being it an inborn knowledge I wasn't much worried about it. Throughout my life of research for positive knowledge and success, nothing has made me felt so used, ignorant and disappointed, like me knowing that these phrases weren't what they really meant, felt much stupid knowing life was actually more about money and money truly means everything. Let me start by putting it clear to you that am no longer an ordinary black African, am a weapon for greatness and liberty, liberty am success in mankind's expression, I am a reason why someone wants to be successful and I see beyond the ordinary, you would really want to know my reasons of writing this article with a title that looks like it's against our beliefs. I have discovered more than 100,000 Reasons why money is the ultimate tool that controls humanity and the whole universe, (Now you just asked \"what about God?\" in your mind) No doubt, YES God exists his the creator of the universe, he owns the universe that money controls, because he uses the money to regulate his universe too. Let's start from the Bible since am using Nigeria in retrospect, Religion ( Christianity ) are the highest users of these phrases, but there is something funny about it, poor people don't like using it as much as rich people use it to advise poor people, do you know why? Hate! That is the hatred that lies in the heart of the black man, because of our ignorance, nobody wants the next person to be more successful, So they keep using these words to regulate your mind, in other to make you find comfort with your present situation, that you will get a lesser burning desire for success and greater comfort with your present state. In as much as the Bible states it that Money Is the roots of all evil, it equally made it clear in Ecclesiastes that Money Means Everything, So I keep asking myself why would the Bible make two different sentences about one thing, it seems there's something am not getting right here, so I look deeper, guess what? I found my answers In the Bible there was no one that saved God genuinely that was poor, the phrase ( stinky Rich ) was first used in the Bible to describe Abraham's wealth, even Jesus Christ that the bible state that he was poor in other for us to be rich, had twelve rich men, that followed him till the end, the twelve disciples were well to do, financially, they stood firm for the financing of Jesus ministry while he was sharing the word of salvation, all over the world. Now let's go back to the statements from the Bible (Money is the root of all evil) by understanding if money answers all things, then it's not the root of all evil, but the man who has the money, Money is powerful, and it original fragrance comes with pride and dominion, when you are not well prepared for it, and it comes to you, it takes control over you, it amplifiers you and brings out your ignorance and negative thoughts, since you are not well-disciplined and lack the capacity to convey its power, it automatically makes you evil. People who lack morals and discipline are the sets of individuals the Bible was talking about when you asked for things you are not prepared for and they finally come, you are 100% likely to miss use its abilities. NOW let's WAKE UP FROM OUR SLEEP, LETS FACE REALITY Some time ago I saw a post on Instagram with J-cole's pictures on it, crop in two sides, one he was dressing more of hip-hop style with gold chains and good looking shoes, while the other he was dressing like an everyday Nigerian, that's in search of his daily 3 square meal, The caption of the post dragged my attention to it, the headline was written, THE MOMENT YOU REALIZED LIFE ISN'T ALL ABOUT MONEY. And they went further to say, Money Can Buy a Bed but not sleep Money Can Buy a Clock but not time Money Can Buy a Book but not knowledge Money Can Buy a position but not Respect Money Can Buy Medicine but not good health Money Can Buy You Blood but not Life. And ended it with what do you think? Now let me tell you what I think! I am saying this with a very high level of understanding. Do you know that as an African (Nigerian) who aspires to be great, is not every advice you need to take, this equals to motivational quotes and Disciplinary stories, or words captions you see on the internet, market, signposts, etc They might be useful and good but they might not be for you, this is where a lot of people suffering from misplaced priority and lack of success discipline fall victims of the long time hustle called Rate Race struggle to greatness, that never leads you to the top. In life basically, we have three types of people, the higher class, the middle class, and the lower class, that's the real-life, but in Africa and Nigeria to be precise, we only have the higher class and the lower class, is either you are rich or you are poor. 95% of the motivational quotes and success books, we see and read today in Africa are written by people from other parts of the world, (America, Asia, and the UK) Not even people that have been to your village before to see the life you are living or our you were raised and limitations around your physical environments, (though limitations start from the mind to those we think they a limited for greatness because of there environment or upbringing, well this belief is for ordinary people only) Some Financial advice and motivational quotes are meant for the middle class and the higher class, not the lower class because some times you don't even have the money that will stir up the will to apply those principles. So don't go kill yourself trying to become what you are not yet, you can not apply Dangotes financial strategies to your small income, because the strategy will swallow you and your finances, and you might drown to death slowly. We keep comparing ourselves to the Western world forgotten where not looking for the very same things that life has to offer, even though we are created by one God What the 80% individuals in America and another part of the world are looking for in life is way far from what we are looking for as African (Nigerians) Because the 80% already have what we are looking for, why some confused ignorant Nigeria are wasting their time looking for what those white folks are looking for, without having the necessary things, that would have spurred you to even think of looking for what they are looking for in life. So what are they looking for? Fine! I will tell you, In Africa,(Nigeria) we lack the basic amenities of life like Shelter, Good water, Cooking Gass, Private means of Mobility, Electricity, Internet access, Cable TV access, good food, etc So we live all our life trying to get all these things, we go to school for them, we take extra jobs for them, we pray and fast for them, we even kill each other just to have them, we see them as being successful, having access to all these things in a private home in Nigeria, is what defines one's wealth and success, so you live all your life struggle through school just to be able to afford the basic amenities of life. While in other parts of the world people grow up having this thing already existing, they don't really mean much, because they are part of the America and UK freedom plan, for more than 100 years. So what are they now looking for, The Higher class are looking for, True Love, Peace of Mind, Happiness, and Fulfillment, while the middle class are looking for, the next step to take in other to be in the position of the higher class, While the poor or lower class instead of them to look for a way to move a step further, they are busy looking for what the higher class is looking for. The example i made earlier with J-Cole is for the higher class, not the lower class, that is why you do really need to understand and know your priorities and where you are going, so you don't get mislead by positive vibes that might turn negative to you because of your limited vacuum of knowledge. Now let's break the JColes post down, MONEY IS EVERYTHING It can't buy sleep but it can afford a good bed that will give you a better sleep It can't buy time but it can regulate the time It can't buy knowledge but it can afford all the basic resources you need to develop your knowledge It can't buy respect but it can afford you a position of respect It can't buy good health, but It can afford the perfect medication that will give you good health, only the knowledge of you having genuine money, gives you good health. Money can't buy life so they said but money makes life alive Money gives you a form of freedom that poverty will never give to you, it brings out the greatness in your ability and stimulate your sense of reasoning, money exposes you to the real face of life, while pervert hides you from it, it makes you loyal for no reasons. YES!!!! Money Can Buy Life because without money life is noting, stinky and useless, the only thing money can't buy to an extent is death but it still has the ability to bid for it, it all depends on our you used it, money can buy your life back after been sentenced, if God regulates the world with money, then money means everything after God, here on earth. JCole had to dress low now because he had made lots of money, he's living his life and has no one to impress, his not looking for favor at this point of his life you dont need to see gold chains and expensive shoes on him, to know who he is or if he's rich and successful or not. When you are looking for money you dress high and good, in other to look attractive, because money attracts only Good things, cause that's what it is in nature ( Money is Good) When you have made money you dress low, because your level and name in society add with your bank account would maintain and create all the attractions you need, you dont have to impress no one, If you dont have money, and you also don't look good, believe me, you are already on the stream where opportunities find it hard to flow down always remember this when you are looking for money you dress high when you have made money you dress low, i said MADE money, Not MAKE money, understand the differences so you don't go settle for less, If you want to be rich and successful then you have to think and act like one, and don't forget to do it with understanding. If you think money isn't everything and life isn't all about money, are phrases not made to keep the black ordinary low-level man in darkness, and modern slavery then why do they always add it up with this statement, (the patient Dog eats the fattest bones) for how long would you be patient just to eat bones, funny enough only African species eat bones, while dogs from another part of the world eats flesh from fast foods and grocery stores, You can't look good or filled up by just eaten bones, even the wild animals in the jungle eat flesh, I don't know about you but am tired of the bones, I want to eat the flesh too, Money is Good and You need it, watch any society that is lacking money the next thing you will see is crime and evil, the heart of a poor man is never a happy one, poverty is the original Root of all evils, In as much as the bible made it clear that money is good and bad, it also made it known that both, Riches, Success, Poverty, pains and tribulations are meaningless to him, this means both money and poverty are vanities, when you die, none If them is going with you, life is a choice so choose your Vanity well. As long as you have made money with your Brain and not your heart, you will forever enjoy the riches of the earth, God said to go into the world and multiply. The brain is not emotional, it was created for creativity and multiplication, the heart is stupid and emotional to lead you wrongly, build capacity and self-discipline dont stop learning and don't forget life is all about money.

            "answer_text": "This will be the start of a bunch of dark answers about money, value, and power. None of these will be particularly ethical or idealistic, despite my \u2018PhD in Idealism.\u2019 So, no. Life is not about money. Life is about POWER. The glorious rush you experience when you overpower an opponent. The satisfaction of victory. The relief that comes when you know that you are safe. In my mind, there are several aspects of power, first and foremost being money. Money, however, is not the meaning of life. If it were, we would see savage competition, war, and greed on a scale that would be scarcely imaginable to us today. People would work only for profit, becoming at first investment bankers and CEO\u2019s, and then becoming cult leaders, murderers, and dealers. That would be a terrible society, with terrible people.  What a lot of people don\u2019t understand is that power is not intrinsically evil. What makes powerful people evil is the process they go through in pursuit of that power. If you have to \u201cshoot your girlfriend\u2019s or boyfriend\u2019s toe for 100 million dollars\u201d then you\u2019re already prepared to shoot them in the arm, in the chest, and after enough desensitization, in the head. That is what makes people evil. Not all power is evil, but it is pretty evident that power is the goal. Look at Quora, even. People here (including me) write for the accumulation of upvotes, views, and followers, which are all essentially pieces of power. People still write on Quora even though it isn\u2019t monetized. They write for the accumulation of power, and to share their own power in a display of generosity across this platform. Life is about power, as strange and dark as that sounds. In the end, it is you who decide how to use that power. And so, ironically enough, Quora itself is the piece of evidence that drives the point home: Life isn\u2019t all about money. It\u2019s about power. ",

            "answer_text": " LIFE How do you define life? Everybody has different way of defining life. There are many schools of thought about life. Lets not get into what are the different opinions about life. Lets directly get to the point that Why MONEY IS LIFE for most of us? How many of u agree with this? Share your views Why money has gained so much importance? What are the reasons that money has become everything for most of us? What money has that others do not have? Similar to many opinions about defining life there are many answers to all the above questions. Money minded will say in favour of it. People like us have many views against the thought that MONEY IS LIFE. Can money buy peace of mind?Can money buy faithful relationships?Can money buy everything we desire? ORCan money buy LIFE itself?The answer is NO. No money can't buy you peace of mind. It can give you happiness for a short period but not peace of mind. Money minded experience happiness till they have money not afterwards.No money can't buy you faithful relationships. Such relationships have faith till there is money in the relationship.No money can't buy you life. If money had such power than rich people would have the longest life span.We are competing in a race that is all about depositing maximum money. We always want to get one step ahead in spending money from our friends,neighbours and relatives but we are always at the end in line when somebody need help from us in terms of money. Don't you think its all about showing off? THE HARSH REALITY How many of us have guts to give 10 rs to a beggar? Frankly speaking, very few of us have that much courage. We are ready to give 50 rs to a waiter who is already employed but not to a beggar who does not have any other source of earning.What is the benefit of earning so much if it not helping the needy. It does not matter who the needy is, your friend, your parents or a beggar. MONEY is need of life but not life itself. Today students are going away from their homes in greed of huge salary packages. What about their parents who gave up whole of their life for them? Did they made sacrifices to stay alone in their old age?Do you think parents want your money? NO they don't want your money, they want you. They want to see your face at least once a day. They want to have food with you. Can your money give all this? Parents are not able to sleep because their child is sitting far away from them for money, A wife is not happy because her husband is working in an MNC abroad. SELF EXPERIENCE Frankly sharing self experienced incident. During my graduation, in my college there was construction work going on. I went to a group of labourers and asked one of them for a bidi. He picked up his bundle and said have it. Then in the evening i went to a bar and randomly asked a smoker to give me a cigarette ant the reply i got was who are you? There is a big difference in cost of cigarette and a bidi but Value of cigarette to a rich is equal to value of bidi to a poor. And one thing more i don't smoke. THE TRUTH Today a labourer is living a much beautiful life than the rich people. Spend a day with them, you will experience it. They don't have much money, they don't have soft mattresses, air conditioners, cars but they SLEEP PEACEFULLY. Rich community is fully dependent on sleeping pills. You can't even sleep peacefully so what is the benefit of such money???? We leave you with this question. Do think about it and share your views. Thank You ",

If you have loads of it - your life gets better. And if you do not have it - your life is absolutely useless. So is life all about money? 100%. Better believe it.

Money figures \u201call over the place\u201d in life, or \u201call about\u201d it - but it is not the main point - which is more a matter of love, and sex, and food, and shelter. But we have developed means of filling our bellies, building our houses, looking after children in organisations we call families, wherein money is a useful tool to organise the transfer of necessary goods and services - like food, like rental payments, like savings and loans - which is just a cunning plan to move constant efforts backwards or forwards in time so as to save a little over many days/weeks/years and then buy a house, or put down a deposit on a house, and simultaneously take on a debt, and then pay it off over many more years. In this way even a poor man can buy a house. You can look upon money as a catalyst for economic activity, or as a lubricant, where strong metal parts move against each other in a machine and the oil eases minute imperfections and departures from perfect circularity of rotating parts - the economy has to balance the differing times of supply with the mismatched demand - \u201cfrom each according to his ability\u201d - well, the kulak can only supply corn at the end of the summer, when it has ripened and been harvested - and then this corn has to be transferred to grain stores, whence it can be milled into flour on a 52 week timetable, and then baked into bread daily, before becoming something that can be sold/given/provided/allocated \u201cto each according to his need\u201d - and this progress of energy from grass roots to feeding the hungry is much better co-ordinated by a monetary market than by a series of commissars, telling the farmers how much they have to grow - as though plentiful or poor harvests were the result of loyalty to or betrayal of the Red Tsar ! The love of money is the root of all evil - but the proper use of money is one of the essentials of an efficient market economy: which means NO \u201cQuantitative easing\u201d or similar governmentally arranged theft of the value of money - we need good stable money - alas, we have not got anything better than US Dollars, or Petrodollars - Euros - Pounds Sterling, and similar trashy frauds. This second class (third class ?) money is what we have to make do with - makes life needlesly difficult. But that is the politics we get - presumably it is the politics we deserve. Ooooh dearie me, what a mess we have made. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes,because you live in a materialistic world.Nowadays,you don't care about leading a happy life or doing things that really give you happiness and self satisfaction.Things that most of the people care about is counts of followers and likes and offcourse money.You want a status in society more than happiness,it doesn't matter whether you are happy or not you just want to earn tons of money to maintain your status. You tend to kept aside your morals for money. Once I asked my friend ,why do you want to be a doctor. \u201cBecause I can earn lots of money\u201dhe replied. Doctors are considered to be second after god,but nowadays our second gods have become greedy(not everyone)they grant you with huge piles of bills(yeah same money for which you didn't care about your health) in return of your prayers.That\u2019s the mentallity of today's generation.  You ignore people around you, you don't savour your bonds with people because you are in run for money.And one day when you earn a lot of money and left alone ,you turn to god for reason even though you know the reason . At the end, the pile of money that you gathered is inherited by your children.You never get to enjoy the prize of the race you finished.Your children always saw you running.You never teach them not to run for their own pile ,but to live a happy life . At the end your next generation start running the same race that you just ended with nothing more than regrets ,unsatisfied dreams and desires as prize. ",

I look at it this way; I would rather be healthy with a happy family like, a woman that loves and respects me, kids and grandchildren that are healthy, happy and doing well in their lives and be broke than to be a multimillionaire alone because my family hates me, stuck in a wheelchair or hospital bed with a debilitating disease there is no cure for and could die any day. *But I would enjoy a healthy and happy life even more if I had a house paid off and a monthly income (from retirement income, investments, etc) that allowed me to not only live a normal day to day life without the worry of \u201cCan I afford to buy enough food this month\u201d and enough left over to allow me to do some extras, like take my family on vacation occasionally or help them financially (like when they need buy a house but are a little short). I have a friend that is very opinionated on how \u201ceveryone is so materialistic and in to owning big houses and cars, smartphones and video games. I could be happy living in a tent in the woods and growing my own food\u201d That may sound romantic to some but I\u2019ll tell you what, that tent is going to get awfully cold in the winter and hot in the summer. And that food isn\u2019t going to grow well when it is zero degrees out. And with no electricity it\u2019s going to be pretty tough to run a computer to write (her passion) and with no internet access, share those beautiful writings with her network of readers from around the world. People say money is the root of all evil. Well guess what, it takes money to live. No one is going to give you shelter, food, electricity, heat, etc. (the basic essentials of living) for free; you need to pay for those things. Where it is evil is when getting money is the number one driving force in your life and are willing to lie, cheat and steal to get not just what you need to live but to keep getting more and more and more\u2026far more than you would ever need or spend. That is when it is evil. ",

FoodSleepSocial recognitionLoveSpiritual fulfilmentFood: you need money for this, more money more access to food and more fulfilment of this desire. Food is all abou money. Agreed. Sleep: Do we have to have money for sleeping many times no but sometimes yes. More money better sleep right? But people with less money also sleep so there is not much of a difference. Social Recognition: Money is directly or indirectly related to your social recognition. But this desire also depends on people's ability. Sometimes in a class smarter person is more recognized that a rich person. Same happens in other aspects of life as well. Sometimes money is important sometimes other things are more important. Love: Do we need money for being loved. Some might say yes because the more money you have the more you are eligible to present gifts or fill monetary needs of others. But is love about this? This is the way of channelising love but actually love means your eager want to be considerate and forgiving and rewarding. You can possess all these qualities even if you have less money. Spiritual fulfilment: How many times you had to pay to worship? Probably not a single time. But you can get more spiritual fulfilment by feeding the poor or donating money to the needy ones. Even for these purposes you don't have to have much money. Life is about money if you assume it that way. Money can make your access to things and services. But in life you go through very diverse kind of needs. Most of which do not require money at all. If you assume money is life then you will surely have to manage a lot of money, on contrary if you assume otherwise you can live absolutely happy life without much money. ",

            "answer_text": "Recently I have been pondering about this question for an irregular amount of time. As I have grown older, money has become a necessity and it is hard to live without. Nothing in the world comes free and money is something used to quantify or measure your work. Ideally, money should keep people honest and working towards a healthier and bright future. We work hard to achieve a higher standard of living and independence. That is admirable; however, reality is not this way. Those who work the hardest do not get the most profit because those who work the hardest are focused only the task. Those who are focused on making money make the most money because they exploit the hard workers and try to market themselves. These exploiters hire the best workers because that is how or society is structured. In short, I like how money gives structure and measures our contributions in a tangible way. What I do not like about money is how it corrupts and changes people. Money can\u2019t buy genuine friendship and respect; however, it can buy fake friendship and fake respect. Maybe those with greed confuse the facade of respect with genuine respect and believe the only way is to make money. Who knows what other people\u2019s intentions are but I think we all strive for the same common values. While I want to believe in the kindness of humans. I find it hard because history proves otherwise. The stronger party always tries to coerce the weaker party until a tipping point where revolutions and war happen. The dominant part does not share part of his authority for the greater good, he just continues to exploit and make things beneficial for him. That is how modern society came to be. Sadly few of us realize this and just live in an ignorant bubble where all the customs were created to favor the one with power. ",

            "answer_text": "Most people do not understand, but money is only a tool, just like a hammer is a tool for the carpenter and a kitchenknife is a tool for the cook. But if the carpenter does not use his hammer, he does not build anything. The tool is useless. And if the cook does not use his kitchenknife to cut the vegetables in the right peaces, he does not cook anything eatable. The tool is useless. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- The answers have been written for other topics. You have to \u201ctranslate\u201d it to your question. Not everything is meant for your question. Do yourself a favor, read until the end. \u201cHow do I start?\u201d 1. Take care of your physical and psychological health in the first place!! This remark has nothing to do with your question, but is inspired by the fact that health is more important than money. 2. First things first. When your money arrives in your account, you FIRST save money (10%), SECOND reduce debt (10%) and THIRD spend money. Otherwise you will find out that there will be almost never money left to save. Then \u201cforget\u201d (as a matter of speaking) that you have saved. 3. What one have to learn about money is that it is just a tool that need to be used in the proper way. A key is a tool to open the lock that keeps the door shut. Throw it through the window and you will not be able to open the right door, take the right care for it and you will be able to. Money is like the crop of a farmer. 10% of the crop is the basis of the crop of the next year. The rest is to make a living off. The farmer lives for his crop, because his crop gives life to so many people, not for the crop itself, but for what it does to himself and many people. The same with money. A scrooge goes for the money for no other reason than the money. A hard working person goes for the money, because it means a living. 4. Another piece of advice I always give is to buy 1 ounce of PHYSICAL silver each month and keep it until the day you retire. In the long run you will have profits. You will not easily sell the silver for other purposes (very important), so you will have your own retirement capital, even if it is a relatively small sum of money. If you are 20 years of age, you have lived for 240 months and you should have 240 ounces of physical silver. One ounce of silver costs now more or less $20, so you should not feel the buy in your budget, even if you have to buy two ounces for the next 240 months, because you started too late with that idea. 5. Choose also one note or coin, that you never spend when it comes into your hands by accident and in an honest way. \u201cMy coins\u201d are pieces of \u20ac1 and \u20ac2. Put them in a jar and \u201cforget\u201d them for a long period of time. 6. Debt and alcohol works in the same way. Use both with moderation and you have pleasure. Enjoy too much and you have problems. Get addicted and you are in real trouble.. 7. Cut up your credit card and use a debit card instead. As far as I can know it is not that simple in the USA because of the laws about improper charges and fraud. 8. Avoid advertising. What ever they told you, the only purpose of advertising is to seduce you to spend your money on their stuff that you nine out of ten do not need anyway. I have a television that can stop and delay the broadcast. I stop at the beginning of the advertising and 7 minutes later I wind fast forward. Window shopping is also a form of advertising 9. 80% of all problems are caused by 20% of reasons. So if you can find out those 20% reasons that make you spend 80% of all your money, it makes easier for you to reduce your expenses. 10. Avoid bars, restaurants and paid entertainment. 11. A penny saved is a penny earned. Many, if not most spending vs. saving decisions occur in the small moments of life, at the pennies level. 12. Create a mantra in the sense of: \u201cFinancial succesful people save 10% of there income, are debt poor and enjoy live with the rest of there income.\u201d Say this a thousend times to yourself every day and after many months your unconscious will believe this mantra and start help you to make come true that mantra. Do say \u201cSuccesful people do \u2026\u201d, not \u201cI have to do \u2026\u201d because the latter give to much resistance of your unconscious. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- If you think only in terms of saving money, this could happen to your money. In the 1970\u2019s there was a soap that was called \u201cthe six million dollar man\u201d. It was a astronaut that had a terrible accident, but with the help of advanced technology and loads of money, he was rebuild and changed in a superstrong man that worked for the government. What I want to say is that six million dollar was in those days an astronomic high number, a bit like six billion is today. Now it is \u201cjust\u201d a big number. Inflation can \u201ceat\u201d away your purchasing power. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 My way of paying of debt is the 1%-method. I advise you to use 10% of your income for debt repayment. However one want to feel a result almost directly after pay off a sum of money. This is the way one can do it. month 1: $1000 debt. Pay off 1% or $10. month 2 : $990 debt. Pay off 1% or $9.90. month 3: $980.10 debt. Pay off 1% or 9.80 month 4: $970.3 debt. Pay off 1% or 9.7 and your new debt amount is $960.6 Now you will \u201cfeel\u201d your effort of paying off debt two ways. You pay back every month a little less and you pay less interest every month. You can play with that 1%-roule. You can make it 5% every month or 0.5%. I gave you an example of what is possible. But make sure that every month the debt is smaller than the month before with at least the percentage you have chosen. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- \u201cHow to invest?\u201d There are two ways. Rental real estate and a combination from precious metals and stocks.Real Estate: Buy a small house or a garage with morgage. Rent it to someone (a garage ask less maintenance) Pay off the morgage with the rent and sell it. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 When playing the game Monopoly there is almost always a player who chooses to stay on his money in the beginning. At first it seems like a nice strategy. Every time when 'Start' is passed, this player sees his capital grow. This strategy goes well until others start buying houses and hotels. All of a sudden, rent must be paid everywhere. For the player who stayed on his money, the inevitable bankruptcy does not follow much later. In real life it is not entirely true that a person ultimately owns everything, and all others do nothing at all. But in real life too it is true that those who invest their money in assets that raise money themselves (shares for example) are ultimately far better off than those who stay on their money and do not invest. How do you win? How do you win with Monopoly? Buy as many properties as possible. And preferably the orange and red streets because they have the highest expected return. Well considered are the value shares of the Monopoly game! And nice to know: the very most expensive streets - Kalverstraat and Leidschestraat - do not turn out to be such attractive streets to buy. Compare them with the most beloved shares of the moment, the expected return is actually not good at all. The game Monopoly can not be compared completely to real life, of course. But in real life there is certainly a strategy to become rich: 1) Always live below your means, so that there is money to invest; 2) Invest the saved money in assets that raise money yourself. As with Monopoly, it is virtually impossible in real life to save yourself richly. In contrary, it is virtually impossible not to become rich when, for a few decades, both items are held above. A significant shorter period is often sufficient to become 'just' financially independent ... \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Read the books \u201cFail-Safe Investing, lifelong Financial Safety in 30 Minutes\u201d by Harry Browne and \"The Permanent Portfolio\u201d Harry Browne's Long-Term Investment Strategy\". Basic principle is 25% of your savings goes to stock 25% of your savings goes to Commodity (precious metals) 25% of your savings goes to bonds 25% of your savings goes to cash Every year you have to rebalance, so that your principle stays at 25% each. Let us say that your stock-portfolio is only 20% of your portfolio and cash is 30% you take cash and buy stocks, so you have again 25% - 25% For stocks I use always the same system: The rest of the answer I have written for other topics and is \u201ccopy-paste\u201d. So you have to \u201ctranslate\u201d it to your question. The most important lesson you will have to learn is that time will be your only friend in the stock market. Do not turn your back to your only friend by getting impatient. Stay away from pennystocks or, if you buy a pennystock, act as if you buy a lot from the lottery. Your money is lost in 99.9% of the cases. You will have to learn many lessons and that could hurt you a lot. Over the years I have developed a technique of investing that makes that pain small enough to stay in the stock market for the rest of your live. I will tell you that technique. For everything that can lose all its value, I invest no more than $500. I bought recently a stock for $150 including all costs. When the price go down, I will never sell. I do not take losses, until that stock goes to zero. If the price goes up, 10% or 15%, I will sell 90% of my stocks and keep 10% of the stocks as free stocks. Example : I bought 450 Lightwave Logic for \u20ac473 (I live in Belgium and I give you examples of what I actual did, so the price is in euro) after transaction costs. I did that in October 2012. I did not receive dividend. Until 2017 the price stayed under my buying price. In May 2017 I sold 340 stocks and received \u20ac435 on my bank account. So I have 115 stocks left for \u20ac38 or close to zero. For precious methals I have two methods. First of all I buy the stock CEF. That is the only stock I know that represent PHYSICAL gold and silver Secondly: Another advice I always give is to buy each month 1 ounce of PHYSICAL silver and keep it until the day you retire. In the long run you will have profits. You will not easily sell the silver for other purposes (very important), so you will have your own retirement capital, even if it is a relatively small sum of money. If you are 20 years of age, you have lived for 240 month and you should have 240 ounces of physical silver. One ounce of silver cost now more or less $20, so you should not feel the buy in your budget, even if you have to buy two ounces for the next 240 month, because you start to late with that idea. Make it for my part 10 ounces of silver per month you have lived or 1 or more ounce gold. I give you the principle technique I use myself. For bonds I would prefer funding circles or an other crowd LENDING firm. I invest every month \u20ac100 in one loan of the category A and B. I never go for category C and higher because they are too risky. You should make it a priority not to lose money on those loans, so you should choose for the safe category as well. Go for many loans, so your risk will be less. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 About the price of silver I can say, that I made a study that anybody can make for oneself and I can asure you that in the long run the changes on profit are bigger than the changes on loss. I pretend to buy every year 12 onces of silver at the end of the year (to make it more visual understandable). I pretend to start in 1979, because silver hit a price of $50 to drop with 90% a few years later and to never hit the price of $50 again for the next 30 years or so. Will there be profit, yes or no? From 1979 until 1999 I use USD ($). Later on I use EUR (\u20ac) Up to you to use your currency or to pretend that \u20ac1 equals $1. This will not infuence the overall result of the study.   Even in this exceptionally bad situation one hits finally profits. One should not be too worried about the value of ones silver investment in the long run if one buy every month 1 or more ounce(s) of silver. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- This is an investment idea. It came up very recently. In Europe governments are convinced everything has to go electric in the future. No more gas to burn, no more cars on gasoline and so long. That means a lot of copper for electricity wire. However, the worldwide production capacity is way to low and it takes years to increase that capacity to fulfill future demands of copper. That means that the price of copper should soar. However, nobody can predict the future, so nobody can say for sure that the prediction is right and that the price of copper will rise huge. If you have hands on your body and a place to store copper, keep your eyes open for every opportunity to collect for free and in an honest way copper. Store it and wait. I have collected just half an hour before writing some old copper wire in an honest way. If you do not pay for it, and you can store without costs, you can not make loses on your investment. You can make some profit or huge profit. I do not give financial advice. You have to act on your own responsibility. ",

You can say that it is everything, but do remember the legends like Michael Joseph Jackson who recieved 23 Guinness World records and 13 Grammys, he had so many servants to take care and look after him but still \u201cDeath\u201d shook hand with him. Steve Jobs who died at 56 and here is his words when he was going through it. \u201c I reached the pinnacle of success in the business world. In others\u2019 eyes, my life is an epitome of success. However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to. At this moment, lying on the sick bed and recalling my whole life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in, have paled and become meaningless in the face of impending death. In the darkness, I look at the green lights from the life supporting machines and hear the humming mechanical sounds, I can feel the breath of god of death drawing closer\u2026 Now I know, when we have accumulated sufficient wealth to last our lifetime, we should pursue other matters that are unrelated to wealth\u2026 Should be something that is more important: Perhaps relationships, perhaps art, perhaps a dream from younger days \u2026 Non-stop pursuing of wealth will only turn a person into a twisted being, just like me. God gave us the senses to let us feel the love in everyone\u2019s heart, not the illusions brought about by wealth. The wealth I have won in my life I cannot bring with me. What I can bring is only the memories precipitated by love. That\u2019s the true riches which will follow you, accompany you, giving you strength and light to go on. Love can travel a thousand miles. Life has no limit. Go where you want to go. Reach the height you want to reach. It is all in your heart and in your hands. What is the most expensive bed in the world? \u2013 \u201cSick bed\u201d \u2026 You can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you but you cannot have someone to bear the sickness for you. Material things lost can be found. But there is one thing that can never be found when it is lost \u2013 \u201cLife\u201d. When a person goes into the operating room, he will realize that there is one book that he has yet to finish reading \u2013 \u201cBook of Healthy Life\u201d. This is worth reading. And you touching your parents feet can give them something which money can't. ",

            "answer_text": "The school used to end at 5 PM, and most of the parents used to come directly from office to pick their children up. But as you are never sure about the office hours, many parents used to get late. Some would show up at 5:30 while some might get late by an hour too. The school staff was getting tired of this as they were getting late because of such late parents. They had to find a solution. Well, they thought that it is all about money. Let\u2019s charge those parents for being late. So they came up with this notice and sent it to all parents: The school rates punctuality the most. And the same should be followed by parents too. If any parent reaches late to pick up their children, they will have to pay for the delay. The charges would be 100 INR per thirty minutes. The school was happy about this proposition. Now, they were sure that no parent will reach late as all love their money a lot. Next day, they saw a decrease in number of parents coming late. They got happy that it was working. For a week, they could see the change. But, after a week, everything backfired. More and more parents started coming late. Those who used to come by 6 were now coming as late as 6:30 PM. And that idea that they had brought in to make parents come early was now making those parents reach late. When asked why they were coming late now, a parent replied: \u201cInitially, when I used to get late, I felt embarrassed. So somehow I was trying to reach with the least delay. But now since the school came up with the policy of 100 INR per half hour of delay, I got free of that embarrassment. So whenever I have more work, I just try to finish it and then reach school and pay the extra charge.\u201d Is it all about money? You got the answer. Those school staff who tried to enforce fine, the parents were actually happy paying the same. Initially, they were coming on time for saving themselves from embarrassment, but now they had money to spare them from it. -Arjuna@War ",

I think that there is so much more to life than a job you don\u2019t like, trying to get ends meet or worrying about riches (or lack thereof). Money in itself is vain, and working to acquiring it without any other consideration is unfulfilling and dull. What\u2019s everything? Time. Time spent to do things you love, helping people you care about, being with your family and working on meaningful projects. And hopefully maxing out on health and longevity to keep doing the above as much as you can before the Universe shuts it all down. That\u2019s why money is so important. Money equals time. Time equals freedom. Money enables you not to care about it anymore so you can focus on what matters most. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me ask you a question and you will find out the answer to yours! \u201cWhat are the five most important things in your life?\u201d (Okay, tell me in the order of their importance) So, anyone like you and me would not take even a second to respond to this question and would present a list which looks something like this:  Yes! And many of us would alter this list and add things like love, happiness, travel etc etc to this. Okay, one more question? \u201cWhy are these five things important in your life?\u201d Again, we have figured out what are the five things most important in our lives and yes, money is a part of it. But, to what extent? So, if we were to answer this question, the answer would be something like this:  Okay, true enough. So, if I were to sum it up, I can say that if you have these five things in life, you have 99% of what you want from your life. If these five elements are present in your life, you do not need anything else (all major needs get fulfilled here). Now coming back to your question \u201cIs money the main thing in life?\u201d If you analyze the above five things, you would find that money is not the main thing in life. It will always be a step behind family, friends or maybe it can be ahead all of them in case of a few people. Even if it becomes the main thing in your life, can it help you fulfill all the needs which are important for you? Can it buy you love? Or happiness? It cannot. So, even if money rules the bottom layer of this pyramid of your life, it can never take you to the next level alone, all by itself, because it lacks the power to buy love and happiness. Money, surely is a part of our life, but it is not the soul of our life. Let me extend my answer. You have everything that is depicted in the bottom layer and those elements have taken you to the next level in your life wherein you have love, happiness, a sense of security etc. etc. But, still there must be something, there must be a reason why you are bothered a lot, why you need to ask on quora whether money is the main thing in life or whether true love exists or not, or any other thing which bothers us and makes us question life. There exists a reason behind this. There is one more level in the pyramid where we haven\u2019t reached yet. Once we reach there, we can travel across the two layers easily without being affected emotionally or mentally. It will enable you to travel down your memory lane, will make you strong enough to face severe financial crisis, it will enable you to face heartbreaks, all because you would know it is the main thing in your life, it is the thing you need to achieve before your death, and not after it.

            "answer_text": "When I was a school going toddler, my mum brought me a compass box. All the things in that compass box insanely fascinated me. But there laid an eraser in one corner of the box; looking at me with its intent gaze; imploring me with an unshakable attention. I fell for the pleasant smell of the new, young, soft eraser. I didn\u2019t want to lose it at any cost. So, I used it in a careful and thrifty manner. If someone would ask me to lend my eraser, instead of the new one, I would lend him/her an older one. As time sped by, the eraser dwindled in its size - slightly bigger than the size of my nostril. And one fine day, while playing with that eraser over my face, I took a deep inhaling breath, powerful enough to capture the same eraser. It blocked my little passage of breath. I was writhing in agony; trying hard to get that fucking little ball off my nose. But all my efforts in vain. Finally, a nearby doctor removed the eraser with the help of a forceps.  Money holds the same place in life like an eraser holds in a compass box. It\u2019s required to erase discomforts but doesn\u2019t justify our existence. It\u2019s required to make a living, but its overwhelming obsession will lead to suffering. Money is supposed to give us dignity, but with that money, we should be able to give dignity to others too.

Ask an entrepreneur who is at the verge of scaling and investors banging on him for returns. If money isn\u2019t everything the investors should have been silent respecting entrepreneur's failure right? Ask a son or daughter who is struggling to keep his father\u2019s respect high by trying to repay the debts. The creditors, in this case, should have forgiven the guy as money isn\u2019t everything! Ask a son or daughter who is paving ways to pool money to save one\u2019s parent from a life-threatening disease. Right from doctors to the person who manufactures the medicines has to do it for free right when money isn\u2019t everything. Ask a man or woman who pooled up all there resources to save one\u2019s kid from a life-threatening disease. Ask a struggling dad or mom who is making ends meet to give his family what they need. The generous people should offer him the opportunity to scale and grow in life to ensure he or she be able to give what the family needs. In the core, everyone above in the list knows that money is damn everything and the world around is not as good as angels and gods roaming trying to help selflessly. Always remember the world is a brutal war zone you have landed on and don\u2019t expect mercy or forgiveness. You are gonna pay or suffer! ",

            "answer_text": "Everyone will tell you about importance of friends, family, parents , marriage, religious beliefs etc\u2026.but I am going to pick up an issue, on which no one wants to talk \u2026..even for some persons it will be quite surprising and shocking \u2026.. I am talking about importance of sex in married life \u2026  I surely know that it doesn't happen in all the cases but in some minor ones it happens man!! \u2026yes it happens \u2026.. Just have a look ( sorry I had to energy left to write it on my own) \u2026.   The query : what did the man ask the lady? The answer: \u201cis there anything else around here that your husband doesn't use?\u201d Ha ha ha\u2026. Sorry \u2026. But it is important to realise that sex plays a crucial role in making married life happy. A man with torn clothes had no money but his goodness in sex lead the lady to sleep with him . So I must say \u2026.. Man, money doesn't mean everything . One more \u2026..   The query : what did the merchant say to his wife? The answer: \u201c The young man proved his sincerity and honesty\u201d, said the old man and narrated to his wife what had happened. Sorry but can we have a great applouse for our wise merchant . I will say \u2026. \u201cMoney can buy marriage but not affection\u201d . A merchant with fine money couldn't satisfy his wife , while as a middle class man with fine dick could. Hmmmm\u2026.. have a nice time . #Jaanu obba*** ",

            "answer_text": "Money isn't everything. But, yeah\u2026 To do everything, you DO NEED MONEY! I, personally, don't believe in \u201cMoney can't buy happiness\u201d. It's NOT true from all perspectives. Do you know why? Try these\u2026 Go outside with your credit card and buy tons of baby clothes. Visit orphanage and distribute all those! Now wait and watch. Are they happy? Do you see smile on their little cute face? Do you feel that inner happiness comes right from the bottom your heart?? Could you do it without money? NO!Grab few money and explore new places this weekend. At the end of month, what would you remember? THAT WEEKEND! It will keep giving you positive energy!Buy foods and feed poor people on streets, feed innocent animals. Enough to be happy? Yes!When any of your family members would get sick and you go outside and buy medicine with YOUR money and take your loving person back to health\u2026 Isn't it the greatest feeling ever???I won't say anything like \u201chave you ever seen people cry in Lamborghini?\u201d Well.. its stupid! Neither Lamborghini passes through the road in front of my house daily and the owner says \u201chi\u201d to me\u2026 Nor all Lambo\u2019s Window shields are transparent. So, it's a lame excuse! Probably money isn't the main thing in every topic.. but, yeah\u2026 When you are in this world.. you have to earn money, have money, spend money wisely! Subham Kundu ",

You need to have to earn enough so that you can make your father say in front of others that that's my boy. (In the Fifth Harmony style). #MoneyMost importantly if you are a teen girls are definitely looking for a good looking and richie rich kind of boy. So they could show off that he is my boyf*****. # MoneyMoney can't buy happiness. This statement is only valid for those people who are lost and completely accepted that the can't get love in their life. This is not true. You wanna find love it can be found anytime. Its you who should be willing to give the max of your part and you dont have to wait for the otherside. If you read physics and chemistry you must know that most of the laws have their limitations and almost all of them have Condition under which they can be applied. #MoneyYou want to live a good life. Not too luxurious not too poor. You need a lot of money. Not kidding. What do you prefer live on rent( assuming you are away from your home and married only because you got a job in Bangalore ( anywhere away from home) ) or to life like independent. You definitely need money at once buy a flat. #MoneyNowadays you cannot have a nokia ( keypad ones ) kind of phones. It has completely become necessary to have a smartphone. Even if you are thinking of saving money you would definitely want to cross you budget to have an awesome phone. #MoneyA whole lot of this new fucking generation want to have all the new gadgets like android gear, smartwatch, google glasses (don't know the exact name), ring watch, drone cameras. #MoneyAnd you definitely can't be happy leading a miserable life. Where your all the income goes to  house rent, electricity bills and also can't be able fullfill the demands of you family. And before you started earning you dreamed of having 1000 iphones. Kidding but you have to admit you dreamed a lot of luxurious stuff. You are not alone. #Money",

            "answer_text": "Well, what is money? Is money the paper? Is money the ink? Is money the fragrance of money? Money is not what it is but what it does. What does money do? A little bit of honest thinking, reveals the true answer\u2026 Money amplifies personal freedom. The more money you have, the more things you can do that you wouldn\u2019t be able to do without money. Here are a few examples, just for fun: You can travel to a new country and experience a different culture.You can enroll in an expensive university and work towards a Masters Degree on a topic you want to become an expert in, so that you can then teach it.You can spend a year in a luxurious cruise ship. You can explore the Mediterranean, Carribean or some other cruisable (new word) part of the world.You can hire the best trainers to help you undo the effects of the sedentary lifestyle, and improve your body and health.You can hire the best psychologists to help you unblock those blockages that drain your energy and prevent you from living life to the fullest, and from reaching your full potential.You can donate a big chuck of it to a cause that you feel strongly about and leave your legacy in that cause. It can be cleaning up plastic in the ocean, saving trees in Borneo, securing the future of an endangered species or feeding hungry children.So the moral of the story is this. Life without money may be better than money without life. But having them both, and having them in abundance, is best. So life is all about money as much as money is all about life. And that\u2019s the Yin and Yang of it. Dictated using SpeechToText Pro. ",

Money is not at all important for one who had earned much. Yes money is important\u2026but it cant make you happy. I know many millionaires who are not happy with their lives. On the other hand there are many who are just able to fulfil their basic needs but are still happy. We consider a person if he have a million dollar of bank balance\u2026a mercedes and a house.. But is it necessary for happiness? Not at all..you will be happy only if: 1.You are enjoying what you are doing 2.You are turning your dreams into reality 3.You are working for the society If you are living for own..then you are not more than an animal\u2026but should find your happiness into others. Bill gates,Steve jobs etc donated their much of income into charity\u2026just because they understood that earning money is not the purpose of life\u2026you wont be respected if you are living for yourself\u2026your should do something for the society..then only you will be able to earn happiness. Money is like \u2018Fuel\u2019 in a car. You need it to run your life smoothly\u2026its not more or less important than Fuel in a car. Enjoy your life and your work\u2026follow your passion\u2026be the one you can proud off Humans always find the ways to be unhappy no matter how much good thing are there in their life\u2026i dont know why this is so!

Which means that you will do anything you can to be happy, that\u2019s why dopamine inducing substances are so addictive. For example, you like drinking alcohol because it helps the brain release dopamine, you can easily get addicted to Nicotine because of dopamine, so on and so on. But what role does money play in all this? You see, Money is the enabler, it is the gateway to our happiness as some may think. It will just allow you to get the things you want or think you want. So, in this case, I am saying No, it\u2019s not about money, it\u2019s about looking past it and seeing what you truly want. Now I\u2019m going to say that Yes, it is about money. You see just as Epicures says in his book. In order to pursue our happiness, we need to conquer our fears. Now in the ancient times, the fear was of gods, death and many other unrelated things. But today, fears have become more financial. You\u2019re always afraid to buy something when you\u2019re being sold to, even if you want it, you're always afraid to treat yourself to a nice dinner because rent is due to be paid next week. All of these fears combine in each other and tell you that, in order to be truly happy, you need more money. And it is true. Tell me, how easy would it be for you to pursue your dreams, hobbies and things you like if you never had to worry about money ever again? What state would your mind be in when you don\u2019t look at the price tag anymore? When you can just get what you want? It would be a lot more relaxed right? You\u2019ll be able to defeat your materialistic needs and move to more important, spiritualistic ones. This is where people find the largest problems. They can\u2019t figure out what they truly want, now that they have the means to get it. This is the part where they get lost and fall into depression. However, if you have your priorities set straight Money can be your means to happiness, but not happiness itself. Hope you got something out of my answer and sorry if I made it too philosophical. ",

            "answer_text": "Once upon a time, the so called Money never existed but still human beings were existing on this earth. This clearly shows that, people could live their life without money. Over the years, the money came into existence replacing the old barter system. I still remember that may be some 30 years back, people in villages used barter system and they never used money. I myself had bought ice cream by giving jawar and wheat during my child hood days in village. Money became much more significant all across this world due to westernization and urbanization. When people started getting more money, they started becoming more greedy to earn more money and money started ruling this world. The problem with money is,\u201d the more you earn, the more you want to earn\u201d Even though every one of us know that, we may need X amount of money to live our life, we always want to accumulate 10X or 100X amount of money. The more money we have, the more happy and secure we feel. Even though money is not everything, but we have created a world which runs only with a fuel called money. We created a system of monthly bills which have to be paid every month irrespective of whether you have money or not. We need money to sneeze and cough. We need money for everything, because this is how we created our living revolving around money. Money is not everything if We invest in Good health than Health InsuranceDon\u2019t get into heavy loans (Housing and Car loan etc)Don\u2019t need luxury lifeDon\u2019t have too many monthly commitmentsDon\u2019t send our kids to expensive schoolsDon\u2019t have too many dependents in family andlast but not the least, we believe in simple living.

            "answer_text": "Money\u2019s Just a Tool  Similar to a hammer, pencil or axe, money is just a tool that enables you to build what you want. For some people they use it as a tool to build a business, for others its a tool that allows them to build a life of luxury. At the end of the day it inherently has no value or morality attached to it; in most cases its probably just a number in a computer somewhere. It\u2019s how you use it that determines what it\u2019s worth. Freedom isn\u2019t Free With that out of the way I will say that money is a large part of what life is about. Try explaining to a homeless person or a single mother with a ton of bills to pay that money isn\u2019t important; odds are they\u2019ll curse up a storm. Money is important because it gives you freedom. It allows you to live the life you want to live in the way you want to live it. The reason most people go to jobs is so that they can have money to do what they want. If there was an unlimited amount of cash available to people you best believe that we would see quite a surge in the number of people choosing maybe to be a artist or farmer or musician vs sitting in an office all day. When your finances are secure you don\u2019t have to worry about being told to be at a certain place at a certain time, you buy back your freedom and the ability to live how you want. You can spend time with your kids watching them grow up without being away 8 hours a day, travel with your family all over the world, rest in peace knowing that their needs and health are secure in the event of an emergency. Money is the tool that offers these opportunities. Summary: No, it\u2019s not what life\u2019s about, but if you don\u2019t have it don\u2019t expect it to be easy to build the life you want ",

            "answer_text": "Ok so let me clear you, Having Money and being Happy in life are two different ways. Soo in this cruel world where we face poverty , crime, Rape, Murder, Robbery, terrorism you will absolutely find money useful in many ways. You can just not ignore the fact and say \u201cMoney is not necessary\u201d because everyone wants here to look attractive , protect their Families Help their dreams fulfil , help them to grow etc .     But there are some drawback s of having more money too Money can make you Egoistic2. You can sleep with anybody but u won't easily find true love  3. You will always remain in Fear of getting robbed. 4. In short you will have more Tension and stress which will overshadow Happiness in your life The thing is you should not chase money but your Happiness but this . If you're happiness is in having only money in life then you're totally wrong Let's take two scenarios. A son has got selected in his dream Medical college and he shares this news with his parents and they will get happy hearing this news.A millionaire has got his own jet in which he has more space and can go wherever he wants to, he is too happy.But in which scenarios the level of happiness is more . For me it's definitely first and yeah some might find second more happier . So you have money or you don't have money You must know how to be happy in life and that's what matters at the end of the day. Regards, Special thanks to Neeta Ambani , Virat Kohli, and Cristiano Ronaldo. Lol:) Edit : some of you are saying once you buy jet and then say money is not important and other stuff. I have clearly mentioned 2 scenarios in first a middle class family and in second a richest family. Though I didn't mention the poor family but the moral is clear with respect to the question asked. Money is not everything but Happiness is and irrespective to you have money or not you can be happy. Hope you Got it now \ud83d\ude0a :) ",

            "answer_text": "I will start my answer with Few questions. Is life only about breathing or eating or studying or making career or doing nothing? Is life only about helping yourself and family or others too? Answer may vary from person to person. For an infant life is nothing but to be cuddled pampered by his/her known ones. When we grow up as a kid and then to adult our priority and interest may differ.One likes studying then someone may like Sports .some other kid may like Just reading other stuffs. Again when you grow further you may choose some carrier which may earn you some money or might not money then something else might be peace of mind. Growing further some get married some people opted not to get married. The whole idea of writing all the things above is its who you decide what your life should be and what do you want to do with it?Again It will differ for every individual. For me Life becomes beautiful when you start enjoying all little things around you. Is life only making money? Answer is definitely no for me.even the one who might be the reachest person you know and has earned a lot during his young age and now he has grown old.Just go and ask him you will get the answers. You make money so that you can take care of your past,current and future expenses.It\u2019s your expenditures which is going to decide how much money you want to earn and again it varies from person to person. I will give you an example: While going to office under a footbridge daily i see some homeless people and i see their kids laughing,playing with football made by wrapping some clothes together.Even i earn a handsome salary but sometimes i think that can i get a day where i can enjoy life with that carelessness and as a free soul how their kids are enjoying but till this date from where i started making money i am still waiting for that day.

Had I been a poor peasant who barely earns enough to feed himself and I needed money for the operation of my sick child, then money would be very close to everything for me. My primary lookout would be for money. If I were a person who earns enough to meet his family's daily requirements and also saves some extra money then I would value other things more than money but still it would be very important. As a rich businessman, money would be of less importance to me. I would realise that life can be troublesome even after having lots of money. Other aspects of life would haunt me more in this situation. In short, money is not everything but very close to it for someone who has less of it. With more money, you realise that money can buy happiness only upto a certain extent. ",

This, they believe, keeps the chances of being bogged down (hunted) too soon, in life! Another way to talk about it!?Things that change the course of our lives:Attitude - can be tuned, fine-tuned, completely changed, all by self and those we choose to be in influenced by!Fate - Incidents that bring in good or bad changes to what one took for granted. Not something that we can influence at all. (Even if we did, fate immediately takes over again!)Wealth - This is one factor that could provide a head start in any aspiration/project/goal, etc. of life. A person who is born into financially sound or risky environments has a very different start to life in terms of attitude, fate and even further opportunities of improving their financial situation. So, in times of peace, financial growth is aggressively pursued. But good attitude can make things go right in the worst of situations. Even wealth is a crutch for attitude. But, that is a statement best used for inspiration. Practically, a minimum amount of money backed up by good attitude to life is what I feel makes a difference to our life satisfaction. Over dependence on either is an eccentricity that only some pull off with elan! Meaning, sustainably so! ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks Kamal Kishore Pandey for A2A. I will give you few stats: Some 795 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life. That's about one in nine people on earth.Today there is no food which is free.The vast majority of the world's hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished.There are more than 1 million books written on Wealth creation.One out of six children -- roughly 100 million -- in developing countries is underweight.In India the no. of Private websites working for Wealth Management for individual or business - 1400(approximately)WFP calculates that US$3.2 billion is needed per year to reach all 66 million hungry school-age children.Now you decide whether money is everything or not. I have seen people doing unnecessary things, making hell number of shortcuts, cheating others, hacking accounts to get as much money as possible. These days when I see people not having cash in hand or in account, they kind of dependent on someone. And such dependency is a killing feeling. Some people do not have life at all and life to them is more or less surrounded with resource crunch. Resources does not mean material possession. In practical way, I term resources as proper health facility, quality education, sanitation, clean air, quality food etc. No material possession. when we have more money we can utilize it to overcome health problems, spend on education etc. So in one line, No money => no food, no education => no knowledge = > no self - belief => no life. If you don\u2019t believe in yourself , you are already dead. Therefore, Money is life. Best of luck. ",

My personal opinion on the topic is that money, fully, completely, undoubtedly, definitely, surely, unquestionably, certainly, truly is not everything. To think something is \u2018\u2019everything\u2019\u2019 it has to do everything with every aspect of your life. What does the love have to do with the money? I guess you are getting my point by now. Stop making excuses for not having money. Stop blaming the lack of money for the failures in your life. Being money-oriented is only a matter of choice. You don\u2019t need a fortune to start a business. You need a real desire, a dream, and a willpower. You don\u2019t need money to get lost. Make your own private isle in the bedroom and shut your brain off for a few moments. Love is not related to money in any way. It never was and will never be. Stop believing otherwise. You don\u2019t need money to save your company. What you need is resourcefulness, consistency and most important \u2013 an idea. You don\u2019t need money to have fun. You can have fun while playing twister with your loved ones. You don\u2019t need money to help someone \u2013 share your warm meal with them. You certainly don\u2019t have to buy them a new one. You don\u2019t need money to enjoy life. You can do it in your backyard while watching the night sky. You don\u2019t need money to gain respect. It can be done by always being your true self and not giving a damn what other people think. You will soon realize how much people actually appreciate authenticity. All of the things I mentioned don\u2019t require money yet all of them are essential to life. And life itself is our \u2018\u2019everything\u2019\u2019. Equation solved. ",

            "answer_text": "It is to those who make money their God or idol. Those enlightened by the Holy Spirit listen to what God has to say about it: 1 Timothy 6:10 For the LOVE of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.Hebrews 13:5 Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, \u201cNever will I leave you; never will I forsake you.\u201dMatthew 6:21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.Ecclesiastes 5:10 Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with their income. This too is meaningless.Psalm 37:16-17 Better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked; 17 for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the LORD upholds the righteous.Proverbs 13:11 Dishonest money dwindles away, but whoever gathers money little by little makes it grow.Matthew 6:24 \u201cNo one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.Exodus 22:25 \u201cIf you lend money to one of my people among you who is needy, do not treat it like a business deal; charge no interest.1 Timothy 6:10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.1 Timothy 6:17-19 Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. 18 Command them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. 19 In this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life.Revelation 3:17 You say, \u2018I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.\u2019 But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked.Luke 16:13-15 \u201cNo one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.\u201d 14 The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. 15 He said to them, \u201cYou are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God\u2019s sight.2 Chronicles 1:11-12 God said to Solomon, \u201cSince this is your heart\u2019s desire and you have not asked for wealth, possessions or honor, nor for the death of your enemies, and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom I have made you king, 12 therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you. And I will also give you wealth, possessions and honor, such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have.\u201d1 Peter 5:2-3 Be shepherds of God\u2019s flock that is under your care, watching over them\u2014not because you must, but because you are willing, as God wants you to be; not pursuing dishonest gain, but eager to serve; 3 not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock.1 Samuel 2:7 The LORD sends poverty and wealth; he humbles and he exalts.Proverbs 3:9 Honor the LORD with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops;James 5:1-6 Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you. 2 Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. 3 Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. 4 Look! The wages you failed to pay the workers who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. 5 You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter. 6 You have condemned and murdered the innocent one, who was not opposing you.",

            "answer_text": "It is true that money is everything? Yes and no. Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs postulates that there are basic and advanced needs. The two most basic levels, Physiological and Safety, depend heavily on having enough money to purchase them. Anyone who doesn\u2019t feel like those two levels of needs are met will say that money means everything \u2014 because for them, it does. Once a person is secure in having those needs met, money is less of a determining value. For the next two levels, Love/Belonging and Esteem, money can play a factor. But not necessarily a determining factor, as this article may explain: How much money you need to be happy varies wildly depending on where in America you live For the top of Masolw\u2019s pyramid, Self-actualization (or Self-transcendence), money may not be an issue at all. But to be sure, anyone who isn\u2019t having their more basic needs met won\u2019t have the energy to work on this level for long. ",

            "answer_text": "One revolutionary Saint whom I have read a lot, Swami Sharnanand Ji, who left physical form in 1970s, created priority order. That is really very thoughtful and helpful. If we take decision and action in that priority then money is not a problem otherwise it is one of the biggest hurdle in human growth and cause of many inhuman acts in this world. Pay more importance to things than money. Do not hoard money for the sake of it. Feel free to spend for things for good of self and others. Things are of some importance and hoarded money is not only useless but harmful too. In essence be not miserly for yourself or people around yourself.Pay more importance to persons than things/possessions. Do not fight for things or possessions with family, relatives, society. Relation is more important than any materiel things.Wisdom is more important than people. It simply means of all the people around you, pay more importance to wise people and seek their guidance or learn from life and be one. Invest time to learn deeply from life experiences rather than wasting time in seeking and enjoying pleasures. Human form is important because of opportunity to learn and grow into divinity, wisdom.Pay more importance to Truth than wisdom and intelligence. All intelligence is to know truth and live it. We should not just invest all our intelligence in boosting ego, earning good name, making scientific inventions which are limited to adding lazy comforts to life. Rather we should invest time, wisdom, intelligence in knowing the Truth / Reality/ God. And intelligence should not be misused in proving worth, arguments, potential realization, ego gratification or otherwise at one point in life we live a meaningless life with inner lack pinching us. Knowing HIM and being with HIM is ultimate stopover and limitless joy.If we arrange our life around this priority order then we will see ourselves clear and sorted. ",

To say \u201cmoney is not everything all the time\u201d you should have enough money to support yourself.It is said \u201c It's better to cry in a Ferrari(basically a car) rather on the footpath\". \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026,\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. Now let me try to answer your question, \u2018NO\u2019, money is not everything all the time but in times it's important. You know one thing, some people on this planet are so poor, so poor, so poor that the only thing they have is money. You must be surrounded by things which money has bought you but see the things you have which money can't buy. Then you will be reach at a point to accept money is not important all the time. There should be a flow of money to support the whole system but it's not important all the time. Love, Passion, enthusiasm, spirit, wisdom,honesty and so many other things will not become your belongings only with the money.",

            "answer_text": "Obviously NOT. If money was everything in life, the rich would have been the happiest people in the world. That\u2019s not the case. Money is only a means of satisfying your material needs. Many people equate money and wealth as the most important achievement in life. But the satisfaction that you achieve after earning money and accumulating wealth is temporary and not long lasting. People sometimes equate money with power and position in society. This feeling also is always short-lived. With passage of time they want to achieve more wealth, power and position to compete with others. They get into a cycle of setting targets, achieving them and setting yet higher targets. In pursuit of getting more and more, you tend to lose sight of the real purpose of life. There is a lot more in life than satisfaction of your material needs. For your life to be worthy and meaningful, you need to: -Have a good Work Life Balance. Engage in activities which you love and do it to the best of your ability. -Build Strong relationships. Have a good social life and a feeling of being wanted. -Achieve positivity, emotional balance, contentment and peace of mind in life. -Make your life fruitful by doing something which contributes to society.

If you live in the USA you can't possibly say no to this question unless you've lost every thing you own and any possibility of getting it back. Then maybe even become homeless a while. That's when a strong devastating shadow hangs over your life telling you that you've failed, are worthless. You beg everyone for rides, jobs, toilet paper but you become isolated, rejected and even suicidal watching everyone else driving around in their new cars, shopping for stupid shit, eatting expensive meals, and complain in a concerned tone of voice about the guy digging in the trash for cans, and calling the police because someone is sleeping in the heated parkade stairwell near their office. Love is everything. Without it there is no reason to hold on, to push forward, to care or give. ",

Money is not everything, yes. But its most of the things. I mean the reason for most of the things. In today\u2019s world, people are judged and selected on the basis of the money they have, or better say the money they earn. You earn good, you have a good position\u2026\u2026it increases your value, your demand. The definition of success now includes a considerable part of money a gicen person has. Or earns. The basic source of happiness is said to be family, people to lean upon. Again, today\u2019s floor level scenario is that you\u2019ll have people only when you can practically afford them. Not one person in today\u2019s time will be with you if you\u2019re not financially sound. There may be some blessed souls, but they\u2019ll be exceptions. The more you earn, the more you get respect, the respect you\u2026\u2026directly relates to success. With the coming times, definitions of love, happiness, contentment etc have been altered. For most it has been induced with monetary factors\u2026..the cars they have, they bunglow they reside in etc. What you long for in life also plays a crucial role in answering this question. What are your notions for happiness, contentment and other such vital thing, what drives you etc. As of a strict personal opinion, its not everything, but a reason for most of the things. Even the philosophical ones. ",

Those who don't have resources (here count Money for instance) in the social system almost, all the time try to be either Complex or Simple.  Beings, who don't have good exposure, will turn to be complex. Politicians to Beggars to any Teacher, who may have seen only one dimension, would tend to live complexity.  Belief system, moral codes, expressions, needs and then Liveliness, Jubilant, Moments of life. Perhaps, every aspect of human culture seem a bit tweaked to them.  Same goes well with the people who have seen simplicity of social system. Again, politicians, beggars to any teacher, who may have seen only one dimension, here the simple one, would tend to live simplicity. Liveliness, Jubilant, Moments of life and then belief system, morals, expressions and needs would come to psychology to them. So it's like both the parties, who sees Complex and who sees Simple, are on the same track but at the opposite and. Now, what resources do to their part of life system is, it will pump in the transformation from one side to the opposite. So, if you're into A, you would try to be more simpler in life orientation and if you are in B, you would try to be more complex in the life orientation. Why and How, are different parcels which I don't want to open here. And then there is C. These are the ones, who can be A or B at the time, when needed. They see the real utility of resources. So, money or any other resource per-se, is the instrument to be in the system and be effective to your selection towards A or B. And if you ask to A or B that money is everything, they'll say yes and if to C, they'll say yes/no but only when transformation is needed for their survival. Hope you get it ! ThanksTake care ! ",

May be money is not absolutely everything but it is surprising most of it. You would be surprised how differently your friends, family, community and other people in general approach you if you have money vs you got none. To really know the value of money you have to be penniless and know the richest people on this planet. How you earn it or how you use it is ultimately on you. All in all it\u2019s better to have money and say \u201cMoney is not everything \u201c , than be poor and able to say that. Money let\u2019s you meet your (& family\u2019s) basic needs ,lets you lead a respectable life, let\u2019s you help others effectively, gets you education any basically every thing in this world.

Extrinsic, focuses on money/material wealth, image and status. Happiness derived from these external sources result in a short-lived dopamine spurt and a never-ending state of wanting more. Intrinsic happiness on the other hand is derived from following a passion, personal growth, making the world a better place or loving relationships with family and friends. These are things that money can\u2019t buy, and result in a long lasting joy from within. Yup, it\u2019s true that money is really the thing that matters the most for all of us, however money isn\u2019t ALL that matters in life. Everything else that exists in this world has a purpose too.

            "answer_text": "The short answer is No, money isn\u2019t everything. Even the making of money isn\u2019t everything in this lifetime. The everything every person seeks is character. The Bible speaks of this tremendously about the love of money is the root of all evil. The reason for this is, loving an object that doesn\u2019t bring contentment and satisfaction will take away from the joys we have in this this life. The everything that everyone is looking for is Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Gentleness, and Self Control. These things bring true contentment in our lives. When we love God, who builds our faith, and people then we find there is a bigger purpose than just making money, and this gives us satisfaction. If you are questioning this then I would suggest finding a way to volunteer in your community and see what a difference it makes in how you feel, when you choose to help someone. ",

If there is nothing buy or sell then all the money in the world won\u2019t keep you alive. Som paper/plastic money might keep you warm for a while if you can burn it, but there again, the fumes from the plastic might kill you. Unfortunately, in today\u2019s world, \u201cmoney\u201d has become an essential tool for the survival of virtually everyone, but it is only as useful for the things it can buy. There are a lot of other things in life that people need besides \u201cmoney\u201d - things that \u201cmoney\u201d can\u2019t buy. Things like genuine friendship, companionship, integrity, honesty and helping other people when they need help. The catch is, to enjoy the things money can\u2019t buy one must be able to stay alive and to do that one must have access to money. Sad but true. ",

People would do what they are good at. They would then exchange what they need with what they have done/created. Now we have money.  You and me get paid for works that we do. Many of us can no longer do, what we might have enjoyed doing, to make our living. Money is the new motivation (there are exceptions though). It works like the key to every kind of material pleasures/desires/wishes. Many people have already changed their passion/interest/hobby to money making systems. While some people are ready to do anything to make money. And almost every living person today needs money to fulfil their pleasures/desires/wishes. I am not trying to judge monetary system, neither am I trying to show that barter system was better or whatever. I am trying to point out that there are many financially backward people on this planet who sacrificed their passion/interest/hobby to make living, and to fulfil their pleasures/desires/wishes. Our priorities have shifted. ",

In other words, the more money you have, the more important you are. Of course this is a bunch of BS. We have all hear it before as people are trying to keep up with the Jones. Money is definitely not everything in life, but a person should never feel guilty about working hard and becoming successful. You need money to take care of yourself and your family. Some lazy people with no drive in life will sit around and talk about how money is not everything in life and put down those who work hard and achieve financial success. Likewise, there are those with lots of money who will put down those who do not earn much money. To sum it up, people are people and money is not everything. It does not buy happiness, but a person should always have an ambition to work hard and take care of themselves and their family. A strong ambition will almost always bring in the money which gives a person more opportunities to travel, buy things they like and to do other things that they enjoy in life. I grew up in a family with not much money in a very bad neighborhood and I now make over $200,000 per year. I will tell you this, I really enjoy providing my family with the things that my parents could not afford when I was a kid. It is nice not having to worry about if my paycheck is going to go on the rent, food or light bill. That is a feeling I will never want to experience again. ",

Because you could have a Billion dollars and if money were the ultimate goal, you would never spend that you would just look at it and revel in it and it would serve you. But it is a tool that is lame if it is not used. My recent life experiences have led me to believe that health is the foundation for any sort of satisfying life. For you can be rich and cell with any variety of diseases or illnesses that you are in capable of enjoying the money, you cannot enjoy a big screen TV even for sitting out by the pool with certain sicknesses. But again, except for in cases of rare genetic disease is, even money can aid you your health. However, for most people is not even possible to earn money without a basic level of health ",

            "answer_text": "As mentioned in the question \u201csmall world\u201d ,I will try my level best to justify my answer below. There are few stages of life which everyone has to cross: Stage 1: CHILDHOOD (5\u201312 yrs)phase where in most of us are fortunate enough to have a family where dad(90% of the times) takes the responsibility of paying our bills (school fees,tuition fees and many more ). That time we are supposed to only study and play/music/dance etc.There we cannot tell that life runs just on money but it is a period to get ready to discover the real self. Stage 2: Teenage (13\u201319 yrs) phase where in one gets exposed to a different set of emotions ,society and mates.This is where one thinks that life is colorful and have guts to face anything but in most cases we do something to please somebody else and dream of future (thinking money is the only solution for every problem or happiness). Stage 3: YOUTH(20\u201328 yrs) phase where in everything comes in live and every moment striving to reach peaks in career.Constantly working to get lots of money.This is the moment where you are in the bar with your friends and ready to pay the bill(nobody wants to miss this chance in life right!!!). In this phase TIME = MONEY. Stage 4: MIDDLE AGE(29\u201340 yrs) phase where we try to settle down and take up responsibilities where again money is involved in everything.Here we plan for future #of the family. Here MONEY =SAVINGS. Stage 5: SECOND INNINGS (sweet 16 & 30+ yrs experience) This is the phase where we have our dream retirement and have nothing to do much#not really ,sitting in the lawn having a cup of tea reading the newspaper and rewinding life (at this stage we just need memories with loved ones not bank balance #that\u2019s true). SO GIVE IMPORTANCE TO MONEY WHEN IT NEEDS AND DEFINITELY MAKE YOUR SECOND INNINGS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FEELING. ",

It will help him to live peaceful life. 8 years back there was very cold day of winter session. My son is suffering from cough and cold. I have an Activa at that time. I took him to the doctor in my Activa. In the way he cried because of coldness. That is the first time I thought I need a car. At that time my need is a vehicle which can carry 4 person and save  my children from cold,rain or sunburn. So I bought I Alto car LX model. Now I am using the same from 8 years. A fews day back i heard about car accident in which Alto car was damaged completely. Then I studied and found most of low price cars are not safe. Cars in India is not following safety standard. Now my  need is a car which have good  safety features like ABS , Air Bags etc. That is fulfill by any mid segment car like i20, Honda jazz etc. I am not interested in powerful engine because speed is not my need. I am not traveling long distance in a year. So here a safe car is my need but a luxury car like Audi , BMW etc is my greed. I just want to make a request to every person that whenever to purchase a house or car or any other things  which required a lot of money. Think deeply about your need. It will reduce stress in your life. If you are not thinking bout money you can enjoy very good time with your family. It will reduce crime rate in the society. Actually what I understand most of the people required money to make status in  society. They brought house or car to impress people. They are very happy when people told like \" Choudary ji apaka Ghar to bhoot bada hai\" or \"Choudary ji apke pass to Audi car hai\". Even you are not using 70% part of that house or you are Audi car is not come out from garage in a month or 2 month. Warren Buffett is still living in a 3 bedroom house. 2nd richest person in the earth can leave in a 3 bedroom house then I think every one can live. ",

            "answer_text": "Well\u2026. the answer to this will be very subjective. As for each and every individual on this earth will have a different perception about the meaning of life. For example, for some it would be via making a lot of money or for some it might come from serving others. But it is very important for an individual to know what he/she wants from his life. Now a days we can't ignore the fact that on order to enjoy some certain things in life money surely plays a very important role to get the experience. But in my opinion there is definitely more to life rather than just making money. Because there will be a point of time in your life when you will have the money , the time but you won't have the energy to do what you always wanted to do because you were too busy earning. So earn money to enjoy life but also keep in touch with your heart in order to know what you want the most in you life and what is that makes you truly happy and provide you with a sense of belongingness. All the best!!!\u2026You got this!:-) ",

When my lover rejected me, I joined the navy. The year was 1968. It was a tough 21 months, but I qualified for full Veterans Benefits, which paid for 6 1/2 years of college. As a psychologist, I worked 17 years at a private psychiatric hospital. I made some good investments, and retired in 1995, at age 44. Since then, my life is very, very dull, and I love the hell out of it. I do seek my next meaningful purpose. That's what I'm waiting for. ",

Falling in love is great and that is basically why any animal is here living on earth - to make love and reproduce. But how about money? Do we need it? Yes. Does it make us happy? Yes. Can we live without it? Of course not. At least in the American society, money is the face of life. We don\u2019t get jobs just because we like them or because it seems fun. We have jobs to make money and provide for our family. If life isn\u2019t all about money for you, well then that great just let me know how being homeless works out for you. So when you ask if money is really what life is all about, I say no and yes. Never be afraid to think otherwise. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, we can say that money is really a very important part of the world, though money is not everything. Have you ever seen someone how's has just holded his new born baby in his hand, the smile the glow on his face which is something money can't buy. Yes money can fetch you better facilities but not emotionals, friend. Once I remember i was even having a same question with my father that in today's world money is everything then he just qouted me a sentence that I can't forget in my life is \u201c Henry Ford the owner of Ford Automobile industry had everything but he was the person who use to feel pity when he use to see his workers going for Lunch because he couldn't eat , he was on liquid always\u201d so that was something made me realise that yes money is not everything. Similarly i had a one more incident in my life, once upon a time my one friend came over to my place, i was having lunch my mother asked him for the same and he said yes, after the lunch when we went out to see our another friend he said me \u201c i really miss all this, the way aunty was serving or asking me for more of chapatis and her gesture made me felt like i wish i to had my mom with him, may my parents didn't had got divorced\u201d at that i realised how much value thes things have, we don't value them when they are with us but once they are gone then emotionals, relationship, feeling and the things we don't care about even matters to us and gets more valuable to us then the value of money! I hope you would have got my point. Thank you. ",

Even if you don\u2019t have the money and if you have a lack of a kind mentality, then earning and not earning is the same thing. A mentality changes everything. There are many examples of this, Bill Gates: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation[1] Based in Seattle, Washington, it was launched in 2000 and is reported to be the largest private foundation in the world, holding $46.8 billion in assets. Warren Buffet:For Honouring, his wife, Warren Buffet, renamed his charitable organization as Susan Thompson Buffett. Warren Buffet has the intention of living 99% of his assets for the Buffett foundation.[2]  I just mentioned two examples, But there are many. So, I hope Now you can relate this.

            "answer_text": "Literally everything? Hard to imagine a black hole or planet made of money. Figuratively everything? Still no, but damned near close. Let me put it this way, if we didn\u2019t have money, we\u2019d need to invent it. Money doesn\u2019t have value. Human labor (time) and property have value. Fact is, you value a great many things. You wouldn\u2019t want to just give those away. When you have a thing (time and/or property), you deserve to have an equitable exchange of those things for the time and/or property of other people. Money allows that to happen by acting as a metaphorical capacitor to store that value until you can find the thing you want to exchange that value for. ",

It is a part of an equation (for a lot of people) You can have all the money in the world and still be lonely You can buy love and buy friends but soon enough you will realize it is not genuine. You cannot buy love. You cannot buy health. Money is useless when you have a life threatening disease or had a life altering accident. You can\u2019t get certain things back. You can\u2019t get time back. Imagine working countless hours for a million dollars a year , only thing is that you have to do it until your newborn child becomes a young adult. You are now disconnected from your child, which would suck. I recently read a story about a person who was pretty much raised by maids because his parents were never home. Although money is important it is not everything. -Brian Grimaldo ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Is money everything in life? Answer: Money is a means to an end. Money is a claim toward the society\u2019s goods and services. So money only has value if the society you live in are producing the goods and services that you need and want.Otherwise, it is just a worthless piece of paper / metal / bits in a computer. Assuming you are living in a society that is producing the goods and services that you want, then yes, money is everything. It keeps the roof over your head on rainy and hot daysIt keeps food in the fridge for you and your familyIt gives you freedom to the degree of the safety net (savings and investments) that you can accumulate, so you are not stuck doing something you don\u2019t like just to keep roof over your head and food in your belly.It gives you peace of mindIt pays for your hospital bills when you or your loved ones have accidentIt allows you to go on holiday from time to time and see the worldIt allows you and your children to have good education which helps the society as well in producing more goods and servicesOn microeconomics and personal level, Money makes the world go around. (it is a different point of view from Macroeconomics, but my view on that is unorthodox and controversial, so I\u2019ll skip it for now). ",

Think of a person who has only enough money to afford his monthly rent, food, utilities and a person who is a billionaire. In the former person\u2019s reality, the person is not satisfied due to the lack of money. So he cusses the lack of money for the unhappiness in his life. In the latter person\u2019s life, he has a fuck ton of money but it doesn\u2019t bring him the peace of mind that is necessary to achieve a state of happiness. In the end, it all comes down to accepting your current position, and working towards a goal larger than yourself. Humans, especially men, are creatures who thrive on a sense of purpose or mission. Money comes as a consequence of pursuing your mission. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes , money is a big part of life but the answer to this question differs for everyone since every person wants different things in life. If you are the kind of person, who values the gift more than the person who gifted it to you , then yes , I'm assuming money means everything to you. If you are the kind of person who values company by your side rather than a silent dinner in a posh restaurant, then no money is everything to you when you find that one person and the time to spend it with. If you are anything like me, and don't quite fall into neither of the above categories then like me, you do enjoy having money in your purse but you also enjoy spending time by the beach all alone. Speaking for me, I'd rather have a life of experiences then a life of riches but yes money is necessary for those experiences to come in handy. So the final conclusion is , Money is not everything but it can be a good something to achieve everything in life. ",

I think money is necessary for me but not all of my purpose in my live. I think that money is very important thing in our lives. \"With money you can buy a house but not a home; With money you can buy a clock but not time; With money you can buy a bed but not sleep; With money you can buy a book but not knowledge; With money you can buy a doctor but not health; With money you can buy a position but not respect; With money you can buy blood but not life; With money you can buy sex but not love.\" Spending money that way is only a temporary happiness.Even help someone who really need your help !! Money can surely fulfils desires. Fulfilling desires at time won't make you happy. Always give importance to your health.. Even if one ends up with only one person as a real friend. Take care.. ",

There is certainly no one to blame this. If you had missed an important event coz you're out of cash, you couldn't do anything for a friend, coz you're out of money, that crazy mind thinks of money first and responsibilities later.Real Life : While theoritically everyone says \u201cNo money isn't important than knowledge\u201d or \u201cNo money isn't gonna buy Love\u201d, it maybe true . But at certain point in life you will he thinking of earning a little more to live a good life , to do buy a friend a great gift for a b day, to ride a good bike when you're a teenager, to put your children in a good school.We often confuse the necessity of money with moral responsibilities. Once india was poor , it hadn't got primary schools ( am talking about 60 years before ) , so did money mattered at that time? We think of others, how they spend less money on their children to an average school and he/she was one of the top ranked students, so what? So what he/she would have topped the rank if they were in any school. Moralities are always compared, Some other friend gifted a Nice watch on your friends Birthday, but you could afford a card as a gift. So what? What's the guarantee you can provide that the one who gave the watch will support him and take mkre care than you. Yes money's important if moralities are added, but money's always a necessity When you're in trouble. ",

You can never buy Intelligence and maturity with your money. 5. You cannot buy PEACE with money. But without money there is no life. You need money to buy food.You need money to buy shelter.You need money to buy Luxuries. (For those people who disagree with my point, kindly stop using you Mobile Phones, Internet, Washing Machines etc. )You need money to Travel and Explore. (You cannot do it without money. Still disagree with my point ? GO ahead and give it a try. )You need money to buy medicines.You need money so that you can send you child to school.You need money to have access to Internet.The list goes on. So stop pretending that money doesn't matter at all. It does matter. But never allow money to control you. ",

So what is money? - it's a medium which gets you 'Something/s' and that something is different for each person. Example - 1\u00a3 can buy a meal for a person who's is hungry since a while and all that Matters to that person is to get fed at that time. That 1\u00a3 is the entire world for him/her. Whereas 1\u00a3 is just a coin for a rich guy who will not even bother to lift it if he/she drops that by accident. Whereas 1\u00a3 savings is a big deal for an average Joe and average Joe tries to find all the ways that he save that 1\u00a3 everyday to be able to save for future. Money is that entity in the world where everyone has a need for it , it's just that extent of need depends on one's situation in life. The one who earns more Money gets greedy and wants to earn more. The one who doesn't have it is satisfied with a little of it. And the one who is neither rich or poor is struggling hard to keep upto it. It's a vicious cycle around Money from you birth to death where your everyday is defined by the amount it money you have! ",

But there is a similarity between the celebrities I mentioned below,    They committed suicide due to depression. What is the use of money when there is no one around you during your worst time? Nope. The life is not all about money. I'm not saying, you don't need money in your life. But I say, money is not everything. Some people can buy a costlier bed but not able to sleep. Someone in the Hut can sleep peacefully. Some people have a table full of foods but they don\u2019t have any appetite. Someone is happy with the piece of bread. So life is not about how much money you saved? But it is all about how much good deeds you did? ",

Their combined wealth was supposedly more than U.S Govt at that time. They knew how to make wealth. But do you know what happened to them 25 years later?Here it is. 1) Prez of Bank of International Settlement, Leon Fraser, committed suicide.2) One of the best commodity trader, Arthur Cutten, died insolvent3) President of NYSE, Richard Whitney, was sent to jail.4) President of largest gas company, Howard Hubson, went insane.5) President of Largest steel company, Charles Schwab lived on borrowed capital and died bankrupt6) Member of President's Cabinet, Albert Fall was pardoned from jail to go home and die peacefully.7) The greatest bear on Wall street, Jesse Livermore committed suicide8) President of World's greatest monopoly Ivar Kruger committed suicide. Money is only a medium of exchange, pursuit of money should not be only goal. Make healthy relations in life, help others. Live life in peace and die in peace. ",

To survive in the present world , you need money. \u201cMoney can\u2019t give you happiness.\u201d It is just a tool to survive just as you use the chair to sit. Just like that , you use money to survive. Money can buy you non living things but do you think you get happiness from non living things ? Do you get happiness from bed , chair or any other thing ? Surely , money brings comfort. But money has no relation with happiness. Happiness is desirelessness. You can be happy even if you don\u2019t have anything. Money has it\u2019s importance but not as much as people think. People think that if they get money their all problems will be solved. This is wrong thinking. Problems are solved with right understanding , not with money. Use money only as a tool for survival not as a source of happiness !!! Once you understand it\u2019s importance , you will now not run for money all the time because you will know use it as a tool. Then you will become more happy. ",

On the other hand, there are times when you have money even then you can\u2019t save a life. Money is required to support livelihood and all of us need money to survive but there are other things in life which we should give more importance then money; like Family & Friends. If we have supporting and loving family members, we can enjoy life even with less money. If we have true & affectionate friends, we never feel lonely and can enjoy life with less resources. If we have plenty of money without family and friends, we can live but can\u2019t enjoy life fully. Now choice is your\u2019s\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. ",

Their children are living abroad n occasionaly visit.Now they are shifting/shifted to old aged homes, Where at least they can talk with some one.I m quoting one example of my client who was retired from army in senior rank.He was living is posh locality,His son was Top most official in State Administration and was living about 110 km from house and his daughters were living in Canada. During his last time he fall ill and servants were also on leave. Nobody was to look after him despite having big house n all material facilities,When he took last breath nobody knows .Just before his death one of his friend ITO retired who used to visit him and before one day his death he saw that whole of body of my client was in dirt and even servants refused to clean. Then ITO himself cleaned his body being friend.Tell where money stands?Big house, Bank balance, Senior rank ,official designation of his son and servants could not provide any thing .No doubt it is part of life and without it one can not live but today my thinking is differ.",

Ironically the example given for that meaning is \u201c money isn\u2019t everything\u201d but because we are assuming that I believe money is everything let\u2019s not try and justify why. Why is money the most important thing etc.. Well to start off, the world works on money, it\u2019s a neccisty such as food, shelter, money. The more money you have, the more successful u are . Although success is subjective. Money is the key to reaching goals, achieving dreams and finally money helps us be happy. ",

If you think about that a little, you know that when you haven't health in your live what will happen? Without money we are not able to live... If we would be able to live without the money - why do we work, what for? I don\u2019t believe that some people work for their pleasure only... We work, we spent 8 hours or more in a work, we don't like our bosses, our boring offices - but we go there every day to earn money! Of course money is not a thing that can make us happy, but we feel secure, safe and calm when we know that our bank account isn't empty... Money can\u2019t buy you happiness or satisfaction but sure it can buy calm state of mind and security. ",

In this case, life is about procreation. All living things are but vessel for propagating genetic materials. That is the single common thread that unites all living things. It can\u2019t be about money because that concept is completely foreign to all living things except humans. Tragically however, humans are endowed with consciousness and intelligence. To exist only as a vessel to procreate defiles humanity\u2019s existence. Thus, humans insist on denying such base existence. Towards that end, humans created religion (with them having a special place of course), chases glory and power. Anything to separate them from other living things. Anything to feel special. In the modern world, glory and power is measured by money. Thus knowingly or unknowingly, everyone started chasing money and life became all about money. If you have two rooms, one with you in it and one stocked with gold and you asked a dog to choose, the dog will probably choose the room with you in it. Ask a human to choose, I reckon it would be the room full of gold. So yeah life is all about money. And dogs are just so dumb, aren\u2019t they? ",

If not then the very identity of the question is wrong, as Yes you do need money to survive and thrive but how much is too much and where does one draw the line. Let me give you an example. Story of a business family and working class family. One manufactures and exports while the other works in a bank. One has a work force of 100, the other is among a lac employees. One rides a high end car, the other rides a simple car, one is always seen travelling abroad, passports filled and attached, well dressed, suave and sophisticated, the other wears simple but clean clothes, has never been abroad, raises three children. Wife is a teacher as well so they have some savings as well. In both their lives - needs are met. All things were going fine until one day this business man lands up at this mans office, may be for a loan. A businessman that he is, he charmed this man away and made it to his home. Once when home, he sometimes offered the kids chocolates they have never seen, on one occasion or the other a bottle of perfume. Something was already happening in this house. The children started to adore this man, who was he, how come we do not have the luxury he has. He was treated like a man of importance and money became the central point in the house. Something that should not have happened. If the central conversation in your house is about money, without being judgemental at all, you know where you are headed. So COMING BACK TO THE STORY, The son graduates, gets a job and wants to start a business. He knows because, \u201cuncle\u201d would help him. He quits his job and gets into business. His life started revolving around money, he day in and day out spoke money, thought money, dreamt money, loved money and nothing else money. The initial days are full of struggle and the very money he was after made him distant from every thing he ever loved, be it parents, friends, music and life overall. Mind you he was not poor but the central theme in life now was money. He became a very boring person who only talks about money and nothing else. I will stop the story here and may be will continue later if you want to know what eventually happened. But I hope u get the idea, ask yourself If you are the kinds who values people by their bank balance - by all means mate, go for it and build one. If you are the kinds who understands the necessity of it and values other qualities of humans as well then just might have the answer. Its not always about the money. ",

I have seen, time and time again, people\u2019s Gollum-like character come out when a substantial sum of money comes into the equation.  If you do as much business as I do, with so many different people, and so many people share their personal situation with you for advice, your world view changes. From my varied experience, the vast majority of people will hide assets from their spouses if they go through a divorce, will cheat their friends without hesitation or dump their religious or moral codes when the amounts become big enough, will evade taxes if there is no risk of them getting caught. For most, life is one big money chase\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "Of course yes\u2026!!! Sorry this is very painful truth, but certainly yes..!!! Don\u2019t you see, money has been everything and everywhere, don\u2019t you see people work day and night, just to earn money, don\u2019t you see right from the beggar on the road to the richest person travelling in the car, everyone is behind the money, money money. Why people are happy? because they have jobs, cars, they can spend the weekends with family, friends in the bars/pubs/restaurants, do you see? Everything can be purchased by money In-fact there are high chances that, you we are the product of money, there are high chances that, parents had married just because of money, if my dad had no job, no money, I would not had born on this planet, there was money before i was born, there was money involved to get out of my mothers womb, there was money, when i was brought up, there was money, when I was on the death bed there was money, when I was burned after death, there was money, my children fought after my death, just for the money. You see in Bollywood film, we spread the messages, apana sapna, money, money!!! (our dream is money money). You see greatest wars have been fought for the money and woman. Yesterday, I was standing in the queue to withdraw money from ATM, one good looking girl came to me and started talking, she was working for NGO, they were trying to raise funds from the people telling they work against woman harassment, I was listening carefully to every word of her. At the end of the conversation she asked to fill the form and give them a feedback, while I started to fill the form, she said, you can also donate the money. She asked, Sir, \u201cDo you think Rs. 1. Rs. 16 is big amount?\u201d, I got hunch, why would she took the odd figure of the money. Then her next sentence was, \u201c16 rupees me to cigarette milti hai sir, do you this this is a big amount?\u201d, I was shocked, First, I don\u2019t smoke cigarette ( I am not fair looking person and even though I don\u2019t smoke, my face looks like as if I am chain smoker and drinker ). Second, She was trying to collect the money for the purpose of donating it to women suffered from harassment, third, all that she was talking with me was a big lie. I said, \u201cYes, this is huge amount\u201d. She was confused. To give you a background, \u201cDay before that, just for some urgent purpose, I collected Rs. 2000 from 2 of my friends. So I knew how difficult it is to earn money whether it is Rs.1 or Rs.16 or Rs. 2000\u201d. For many people, money is everything. but but but \u2026. There is parallel path, the path of love, humanity. We all at our core are good human beings filled with love and compassion. You see this path is so beautiful, full with the pain and satisfaction, this is not an easy path, so very few people walk over this path. If you want to find meaning in life, do something which is priceless, such as meaningful work, empathy, selflessness. But there will be a pain, but remember you will win at the end you will win. And you will see money is so lower to this kind of success, you just can\u2019t compare this with money. You won\u2019t ever get purchased with money. \u201cMoney is not everything, but we need money for everything\u201d ",

If you have money, it doesn't mean you are happy because you could have made some very painful life decisions. However, if you don't have money, you almost always are miserable, spending all of your time searching for money. There are individuals who are exceptions to this rule of course, but usually it corresponds to lower IQs meaning more happiness no matter what. There are also cultural trends too:    The bottom line is that when you're new or poor, one should always choose more money over other things that pay less... But if you've got enough that you find yourself being satisfied often, then you should look to other things like family and hobbies to find happiness. ",

            "answer_text": "Money has a bad reputation with people who don't have it. It has been blamed for everything from wars to infidelity, from destroying friendships to wrecking families. In the minds of the masses, the more ways they can demonize money, the more validated they feel for not seeking their own fortunes. Instead of seeing the positive ways that money can enhance the most important things in life like our health, family relationships, and friendships, most people would rather scorn money and tell you how it can destroy the things we hold closest to our hearts. Don't listen to negative people who don't know any better. The truth is money is not the most important thing in life, but it will make the most important things in life so much better. Health A pervasive belief of the masses is that building a fortune requires seven-day workweeks, losing sleep and constant stress. If I believe I have to choose between being rich and being healthy, why would I want to get rich? The truth is wealth gives you far better access to world-class healthcare, preventive medicine, and alternative treatments. If you need a specific cutting-edge procedure that's not available where you live, you simply fly to a place that offers it. Another reason being rich makes you healthier is the elimination of the biggest stressor of the masses: money. The wealthy don't have sleepless nights worrying about paying their bills. Imagine how much healthier you would be if you didn't have to worry about money? How much healthier would you be if you never had to wake up to another alarm clock and could sleep as long as you wanted every day? What would be the impact on your stress level if you could afford to fire your boss? Being rich can positively impact your health. Wealthy people can choose to spend more time with your family.Sean Gallup / Getty Images Family The most common middle-class belief I have encountered is the mistaken idea that you have to choose between world-class success and a happy family life. The masses have been brainwashed to believe it's an either/or equation. This is rooted in a fear and scarcity mentality that says you must choose, because there is only so much time in a day. If you love your family, get rich and give them more of your time, plus opportunities only money can buy. Figure out a way to be more efficient with your time because money can help your family live its dreams. Instead of using your family as an excuse, use them as your primary motivation to start earning more. Don't listen to people who say money leads to dysfunctional families. Dysfunctional families were dysfunctional before money entered the scene; it's just that money magnifies whatever it touches. Money provides the opportunity to make new friends.Dan Kitwood / Getty Images Friends Another common belief that keeps people from getting rich is the idea that they'll lose their best friends if they move into the biggest house on the block. After all, this belief assumes, what good is all the money in the world if you have no friends? It rarely happens. Will you lose a few friends due to jealousy and envy? Maybe. But a better question is: Were they really your friends in the first place? I'm sure you have friends you've known for years, and you could care less about how much money they have. You gain far more friends than you lose when you get wealthy, and I'm not taking about people who befriend you because you're rich. I'm talking about how money opens up the world to you. You'll have the time and resources to travel, meet almost anyone you want, and gain access to the inner circle of some of the most successful, interesting people in the world. Wealth will bring you more opportunity to make friends than anything else in the world. The takeaway It's true, money doesn't buy happiness. But it will make you more comfortable, open doors, create opportunities, and make the good things in your life even better. It may even save your life or the life of a loved one. Decide today to make money a bigger priority in your life.

Synthesizing insights across several domains of knowledge, there are three broad types of people on Earth: 1. Success oriented: Hawkins Level of Consciousness 0-199; react to life events; philosophy mastering: Aristotle\u2019s virtue ethics. E.g. Donald Trump. 2. Success + happiness oriented: Hawkins Level of Consciousness 199-349; anticipate life events; philosophy mastering: Aristotle\u2019s virtue ethics + Bentham\u2019s consequentialism. E.g. Barack Obama. 3. Success + happiness + peace oriented: Hawkins Level of Consciousness 350-499; shape life events; philosophy mastering: Aristotle\u2019s virtue ethics + Bentham\u2019s consequentialism + Kant\u2019s deontology. E.g. Abraham Lincoln. So if you happen to think that money - and it\u2019s close partner success - are the be all and end all, then: a) You are most likely in current possession of a Hawkins Level of Consciousness from 0-199. b) You are going to get an almighty shcok once you hit Hawkins Level of Consciousness 200 and realise that your journey of life is only just beginning.

            "answer_text": "Let's invoke Mathematics for this answer. Assume:  Money is everything in life. Let A = Set of Everything in Life, or the Universal SetA' = Nothing or Null Set Now, by the assumption, Money = A. Then No Money =  A', or nothing. Since there exists at least one thing that you got without money (the most universal example: oxygen), it means that A' is not a null set. This implies that A cannot be a Universal Set.This contradicts our initial assumption. Hence proved. Money is not everything in life. Simple, isn't it? ",

From clothing to food to shelter, an adequate possession of basic necessities requires money. On top of this, individuals must pay for insurance, taxes, education, and other copious expenses. Without it, it would be extremely difficult to survive. While many fail to realize that money simply cannot buy happiness or health, they are blinded by their thirst for power and wealth. Nevertheless, this desire is what motivates people to work and has ultimately lead to the growth of human civilization. With money, people feel a sense of authority and are able to satisfy their materialistic needs. Many equate money to success and will stop at nothing to get it, even if it means doing so at the expense of others. As it is extremely valuable, in the eyes of modern society, money determines an individual\u2019s social status and future success. ",

            "answer_text": "Honestly, in the long run, I would say yes. Some people may disagree. I grew up fairly poor, but my mum sent me to a very expensive private school (we got a huge discount since she was a single mother), and even though she did put food on the table, and provide me with everything I needed, she did struggle a lot. She often skipped meals for herself just so she could feed me, and never bought things for herself. She worked 3 jobs just to pay my school fees. She started slowly saving up more and getting back on her feet financially. In 2 years time, she was back on track, and when I went to university (about 5 years after she was quite poor) she payed my university fees all by herself, with money to spare. All I\u2019m trying to say is, money does NOT define who you are as a person, or how happy you will be, but if you work hard, and earn your money honestly, it is one less stress off your shoulders.

            "answer_text": "Is money everything or no? No, money is not everything. However, money is a universally recognized tool that is used to trade your time, skills, and knowledge for another person\u2019s. (What???) You sell your time to your employer, and then use the money they give you to purchase items that were made by other companies. And, what does that have to do with the question? Well, think about life in general. You need to eat, so you could grow your own food, and harvest your own meat. Or, you could pay someone to do it for you, most likely a lot more efficiently. And, you have a family of some kind, and you want to support the ones you love. Hugs and time together are great, but they also need to eat, a place to live, medical care, and an occasional luxury is not too much to ask for. Right? Easiest way to provide those things are through the use of money. It is true that money cannot buy you happiness, but if you want the luxury of spending time with your family and doing the things you enjoy, you have to sell your time to your employer to afford those things.

Just like a movie, but here nothing is predictable except your will to live. Money is be considered as the lubricant/engineering that is required in a machine. That machine represent you as an entity. You are the main part of machine. Your families can be represented as other parts, friends as fixtures. The bigger the machine and the more complicated it is, the more efforts it will consume. Similerly you yourself need less to live, but carrying responsibility of your family needs more money. This is the simple analogy of money and life. Again, the more specialised, sofisticated and branded the machine will be, more is required to maintain it. But the purpose that the machine serves seperates it from others. Similarly what & how we serve is our identity (or say life) not how much we earn.  Not everyone is driven by money, but understand we eat to live, similerly we earn money to live. We should analyse our goals, what kind of life we want, what resonsibilities we want to carry and then earn money. Because it is not the money that makes us happy but the things we do with money that decides a share of our happiness be it short term or long term. ",

So as a human whatever we do is to empower ourselves. and finally leading to fight competition in the race to survive. you may take any example of activities you do, the ultimate purpose is the same. And as we all know money is the thing which helps you to empower the most in the current scenario. you can eliminate many possible risks of your extinction if you have enough money!! Finally it can be said that till the time money continues to empower you it will be a very essential part of life, but it can not be the aim of life, Its just a major factor contributing in fulfilling the aim of life.

But not caring about money is impractical, irresponsible and hypocritical. The truth is we should care a lot about money as it plays a very important role in our lives. Money helps us cover our basic needs. Money allows us to live well when we age. Money is an enabler for experiences. Money allows people to give children a good and healthy life. Time is infinitely more important than money. However, to enjoy time in your own terms we need money (some of us more, some of us less). Otherwise you will drain your arcs and need to work again to - guess what - building your money reserves. It is important to build wealth, invest it wisely, and have a diversified and passive income. Having said all this, it is important to know how much is enough. Building wealth for the sake of building wealth will not add much value to someone\u2019s life. Build wealth to live, do not live to build wealth. ",

            "answer_text": " Sri Sukadeva Goswami said, \"Money does not stay in one place. It passes from one hand to another. Ultimately no one can enjoy money, and it remains the property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\" (Srimad-Bhagavatam 5.14.24) Money is God's energy. He created it, He owns it, and He controls it: \"Everything animate or inanimate that is within the universe is controlled and owned by the Lord.\" (Ishopanishad 1). Krishna determines how much money each of us receives. It may appear accidental that one person is born into wealth and another into poverty, or that one person goes from rags to riches and another doesn't, but Krishna's law of karma destines these things. Srila Prabhupada says, \"Everyone is thinking, 'If I become greedy, I shall get more.' That is not possible. You cannot get a farthing more than what you are destined.\" (Lecture, October 3, 1973) And he writes, \"It is not possible that simply by endeavors to accumulate more money a person will be able to do so, otherwise almost everyone would be on the same level of wealth. In reality everyone is earning and acquiring according to his predestined karma.\" (Srimad-Bhagavatam 3.27.8, Purport) Modern civilization runs on the mistaken concept that if we work harder we will get more money and since money enables us to buy things that please us, with more money we will be happier. Happiness, however, is different from the sensual pleasures money buys. That is why almost all of us are restless and dissatisfied, despite earning and spending vast amounts of money and despite using and owning any number of things. Money does not necessarily produce happiness. Failing to notice this stark truth, many of us pursue happiness by pursuing money. Most people are not satisfied with just enough money to maintain their families but want more and more of it. Srimad-Bhagavatam (4.22.33) tells us, \"For human society, constantly thinking of how to earn money and apply it for sense gratification brings about the destruction of everyone's interests.\" In our mixed-up age, wealth alone is the sign of success and the harbinger of prestige and influence, regardless of one's behavior and qualities. Money and Our Dark Side When we think that happiness would come if we could just afford to make certain material arrangements and adjustments, greed overtakes us. Krishna says that greed is one of the three gates to hell, the other two being lust and anger. We think, \"So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future, more and more.\" (Bhagavad-gita 16.13) The lure of money even induces us to forsake our friends and relatives. Srila Prabhupada writes, \"Sometimes, being in need of money, the conditioned soul steals and cheats, although he may apparently be associated with devotees for spiritual advancement\" (Srimad-Bhagavatam 5.14, Summary) and, \"if one person cheats another by a farthing or less, they become enemies.\" (Srimad-Bhagavatam 5.14.26) Slaves of the pushes of our senses and the quest for money, we burn in an unquenchable fire of our own desires; thus the quality of our life diminishes, and we suffer. Srila Prabhupada writes: \"Unlawfully accumulated money is now being snatched from miserly citizens by various methods of state taxation for the future civil and international war fund, which is spending money in a wasteful and destructive manner. The citizens are no longer satisfied with just enough money to maintain a family nicely and cultivate spiritual knowledge, both of which are essential in human life. Now everyone wants money unlimitedly to satisfy insatiable desires. In proportion to the people's unlawful desires, their accumulated money is taken away by the agents of illusory energy in the shape of medical practitioners, lawyers, tax collectors, societies, constitutions, so-called holy men, famines, earthquakes, and many similar calamities. . . . Indeed, that is the law of nature; if money is not devoted to the service of the Lord, it must be spent as spoiled energy in the form of legal problems or diseases. Foolish people do not have the eyes to see such facts; therefore the laws of the Supreme Lord befool them.\" (Elevation to Krishna Consciousness, Chapter 2) But mundane greed is not intrinsic to us, nor do we naturally exist for the sake of our business and bank balance or to identify with our material accomplishments. Our obsession with money and acquisition is a misplaced religious quest, a religious energy used perversely. The Bright Side Deep inside, we want to complete our term in this world of birth and death, of society and responsibility, of making and doing. We also want to fulfill the incalculably higher and greater possibility offered us as human beings. Each of us senses that we are meant to receive an invaluable gift and to respond with full commitment and service. Lives centered on getting money miss this opportunity and are therefore miserable. But we can use money properly, for the service of its creator, making it a true asset rather than a disguised deficit. Srila Prabhupada writes, \"Everything created by the material energy can be dovetailed with the Absolute by an attitude of service, which is the essential part of living energy. The pure devotee of the Lord knows the art of converting everything into its spiritual existence by this service attitude. . . .\" (Srimad-Bhagavatam 2.1.20, Purport). The crux of the issue is this: Will I serve the Lord with whatever money He has allotted to me, or will I use it to try to please myself. My consciousness, and not on the amount of money I have, determines my decision. Prabhupada explains: \"Materialism does not mean that one has to possess so many things. The actual fact is one may be a perfect transcendentalist or spiritual man by possessing the whole world, and one may be a gross materialist without possessing a farthing. So this distinction can be made on the basis of consciousness. When one is Krishna conscious while possessing everything in the world, he is a perfect spiritualist, and one may have renounced everything in the world, but lacking in Krishna consciousness, he is a gross materialist.\" (Letter, April 23, 1970) Money and Our Work Vedic society classifies people into four broad groups: brahmanas (teachers), kshatriyas (rulers), vaishyas (farmers and merchants), and shudras (laborers and artisans). Each group relates to money differently. In traditional society the brahmanas accept contributions from their students, but since their material desires are minimal, they keep only as much as they need and give the rest in charity. Brahmanas never hoard money for a luxurious life, as kshatriyas or vaishyas might, but always live austerely, knowing that money easily diverts the mind to materialism. Since kshatriyas rule, they need prestige and money. But their duty-and that of all possessors of wealth-is to give liberally in charity. Vaishyas earn money through agriculture, cow protection, and some trade. By growing food grains and other necessities, vaishyas support themselves and their families without depending on others. Traditionally, shudras are not paid but receive food, shelter, and clothing from the other three classes in exchange for their services. They are well provided for and happy. The term shudra also refers to anyone without spiritual training and knowledge. By that definition, almost everyone today is a shudra, and we see what happens when such people get money: They spend lavishly on sinful activities or accumulate it for no purpose. And they will do almost anything to get more. Money and Life's Stages Srila Prabhupada explains that according to our scriptures, brahmacharis (celibate students), vanaprasthas (retirees), and sannyasis (renounced men) \"are allowed to collect alms and are considered as the children of the society, which is composed of householders. In other words, our Vedic civilization is the most perfect community project. Only the grihasthas [householders] are supposed to earn money, especially the kshatriyas and the vaishyas, and the money is distributed community-wide.\" (Letter, February 11, 1970) In other words, by ruling the citizens or by their business or profession, householders are to earn money honestly and use it to maintain their family and to give in charity to spread Krishna consciousness. In a letter to several householders, Srila Prabhupada wrote, \"Krishna will give you intelligence how to engage in honest, brilliant, glorious work on His behalf. There is no need to engage in anything dishonest. Krishna has given enough money, now earn by honest means.\" (Letter, January 24, 1977) Grihasthas should not slave to accumulate money and unnecessarily increase their material comforts. And if extra money comes, they should use it for Krishna consciousness. To this end, grihasthas may keep their money confidentially so that in time they can spend it for good purposes. There is no fault in this, or in keeping a deposit in the bank for an emergency. Srila Prabhupada once explained how men in Indian villages would live in the city, earn money, and send it back to their family in the village. Their intelligent wives would save that money and eventually invest in land. When they had enough land, the husbands would return to the village and be self-sufficient by producing their necessities from the land. \"That's a good idea,\" Srila Prabhupada said. \"Remain in the village with family.\" (Conversation, January 4, 1977) And he also explained, \"The principle is the husband honestly tries to earn livelihood, and at home the wife should be so intelligent that whatever money the husband has earned, she'll manage. She'll not demand, 'Bring money, bring money, bring money . . .' Then the home will be happy.\" (Conversation, June 14, 1976) The main point is that everyone must learn to spend money only for good causes. Money and Krishna's Service Householder devotees are obliged to earn money because without money it is not possible to exist in the material world. In Chaitanya-charitamrita (Madhya-lila 16.238), Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu tells Raghunatha, \"You should not make yourself a showbottle devotee and become a false renunciant. For the time being, enjoy the material world in a befitting way and do not become attached to it.\" In other words, householders do not give up earning money, but while earning, they think of Krishna constantly and consider themselves humble servants of society. Householders who know that the Lord owns and controls all money are not diverted by excessively thinking about how to accumulate it. And they use what they have for Him. Srila Prabhupada writes, \"If one engages for the service of the Lord whatever money one has honestly earned, that is spiritual service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the spiritual master, and the Vaishnavas.\" (Chaitanya-charitamrita, Antya-lila 6.275, Purport) Devotees live according to their means: \"Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing.\" (Bhagavad-gita 1.32-35, Purport) Frugality is perfectly acceptable to devotees because they know that their spiritual advancement, and not a large income or showy opulence, pleases their spiritual master. \"Why should one be anxious about the necessities of life? The principle should be that one should not want more than what is absolutely necessary. . . . The devotee should always be alert to consume only those things that he absolutely requires and not create unnecessary needs.\" (Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya-lila 24.262, Purport) At the same time, devotees balance their obligations so that they and their relatives are secure: \"Srila Rupa Goswami taught us by his own example by using fifty percent of his accumulated wealth for Krishna, twenty-five percent for his own self, and twenty-five percent for the members of his family.\" (Srimad-Bhagavatam 8.19.37, Purport) But whether one has a lot of money or just a little, inevitably one will be separated from it, through spending or death. As Srila Prabhupada said: \"You have to change your body. So you have earned so much millions and billions of money. That's all right. But you have to go empty-handed. The money will remain here. You cannot take that money within the tomb. That is not possible. Then it is zero. You are going empty-handed. You came empty-handed and going empty-handed. You came with zero and you are going with zero. So whatever you have earned, that is zero. But if you have attempted to serve Krishna with all these zeros, then you have taken some value.\" (Conversation, July 31, 1975) Money Wasted \"Whatever money we are getting it is from Krishna,\" Srila Prabhupada wrote, \"so nothing should be misspent.\" (Letter, October 24, 1974) Earning an income is not difficult because Krishna provides for His sincere devotees. But not misspending the money is difficult and takes intelligence. Krishna provides, and improper spending can be a problem even among exalted devotees. For example, once Chaitanya Mahaprabhu \"respectfully told Shivananda Sena, 'Take care of Vasudeva Datta very nicely. Vasudeva Datta is very liberal. Every day, whatever income he receives, he spends. He does not keep any balance. Being a householder, Vasudeva Datta needs to save some money. Because he is not doing so, it is very difficult for him to maintain his family. Please take care of Vasudeva Datta's family affairs. Become his manager and make the proper adjustments.'\" (Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya-lila 15.93-96) Like Vasudeva Datta, those who lack wisdom in spending should put themselves under the care of a wise, trustworthy devotee. The Favor of the Goddess of Fortune \"Everyone is seeking the favor of the goddess of fortune,\" Srila Prabhupada writes, \"but people do not know that Lord Sri Krishna is the beloved husband of all goddesses of fortune.\" (Srimad-Bhagavatam 2.4.20, Purport) When we try to engage the goddess of fortune in Krishna's service, we gradually realize Him in every sphere of life. By this culture of Krishna consciousness, our happiness will no longer depend on how much money we have. We will be content even without money. \"If there is no culture,\" Srila Prabhupada said, \"simply by money you cannot maintain a standard of civilization. That is not possible. Now the American leaders, they are thinking, 'Let us have money, then everything . . .' Of course, by money you are covering all the defects of the social culture. But this will not endure. The day will come when everything will be exposed. Therefore culture is required.\" (Conversation, June 14, 1976) One who has culture has faith in Krishna, and therefore has everything. Srila Prabhupada writes, \"A pure devotee who has firm faith in the words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is to be considered a most learned scholar, the topmost aristocrat, and the richest man in the whole world.\" (Chaitanya-charitamrita, Madhya-lila 5.76, Purport) Finally, in Srila Prabhupada's words again: \"Guru Maharaja said that 'You do the right work, money will come. Money will fall down on your feet.' There is no question of flattering. Do. Work sincerely. Everything will come, whatever you want.\" (Conversation June 30, 1977) ",

How do you produce a multi-million dollar facility and staff if by trading chickens and goats? It doesn\u2019t work. You need a store of value, i.e. money. Everything awesome on this earth is due to the specialization that money provides. But without love, who cares? So no, money isn\u2019t everything, but having a lot of it sure makes life easier. ",

Money, by itself, can bring short term happiness, but what good is money, if it isn\u2019t used to better yourself, or others, throughout your life? If money was everything, or rather, meant everything, we would not see celebrities and rock stars killing themselves, suffering from addictions to reality escaping drugs, constantly appearing in rehab, and seeking psychological help for massive breakdowns. Family, love, and personal accomplishment trump money by far. At the end of your life, will the most important thing you reflect on is the pieces of green paper you have stored up in a brick institution?

You can buy anything with money. Money will provide you all the comforts and luxuries which the life requires. How ever, all these things will eventually bore you someday. It's very easy for humans to get bored. Because humans are the only creatures who if want to then get extremely happy and on the other hand extremely sad. Only animals don't get bored or the enlighted ones. So if you want happiness you will eventually have to go towards spirituality. That is in simple words going beyond the mind.

On one hand we need money to fulfill our basic needs ,seek admissions in good colleges , good medical facility ,branded clothes etc ( talent has its own importance that could open all the ways out there , MONEY would be like making few things simpler ) .On other hand we fail to buy small things which has no cost such as time, happiness that comes from being together.

And and after sometime same thing don't give us that same happiness and sometimes we dislike. For example, if you bought a very expensive sofa at your home and you enjoy sitting over there and have great comfort. But do you think same so far will give you same comfort when when some downtime is there in your life?no it will not . It's all about individuals understanding, If someone believes money can give anything in this world then for them money will be everything. someone feels social work gives them satisfaction then for them that will be measured priority. As far as my experience money can give only temporary comfort and happiness. But not the real peace and satisfaction of life. We can find that when will look inside of us not outside. ",

Collector commited suicide because of stress.These three incidents show that money,materialistic pursuits and honour are not worth givers,If we don\u2019t have happiness,satisfaction and near dear ones in our lives. Happiness is achieved by our near dear ones not merely by money.Money matters to some extent but it is not everything.         For earning money,if values of life are sacrificed,real happiness is lost somewhere.Please be honest,do smart work for the goal of life.God help those who help themselves.Always remember:  \u200bHope it helps you to understand this important question of life.:) (Copy paste of my same type of answer.)

So this answer is not coming from experience, it's coming from my view. IS LIFE ALL ABOUT MONEY ? It entirely depends on how you see your life, and how you want your life to be. If all you care about is luxury without even considering family, friends, health etc then yes life is all about money If you want many other things including luxury then money will be one of the most important aspects of your life, but it won't be all about money. If all you want is to lead a peaceful life with your family, friends and have a good health then money will be one of the important aspects in your life, but again life won't be all about money. Life is far beyond just earning money, great people use it to serve others, the normal ones use is to enjoy and the cruel ones use it to ruin other's life. As I've already told it completely depends on your view about life. ",

The importance of money in human life is similar to the inportance of food for the body.Just like you can\u2019t live without food for some days similarly you can\u2019t survive for long without money. You can definetly solve most of the problems of life if you have unlimited supply of money.iF you have lots of money you can do many things at a time like you won\u2019t face the problem of food,water and shelter.You can buy all things for your comfort like television,fridge,ac and other lavish things.You can also engage many servants to work for you and live like a KING. My thought about money is: It is greatness,it is power,it is beauty.Money is about love and relationships. It has a wonderful power to bring people together as well as tear them apart. You can\u2019t escape money.If you run from it,it will chase you and catch you. ",

But for the people who are below the poverty line for them seriously money is everything bcz they dint have anything till now, to be frank they just living the life gave by the god with no ray of hope, no satisfaction in living, just driving their lives with pain, sorrows, and emotions. Really how bad it is can't even imagine anyone who's living that sorrowful life. Gods are really heartless just show some mercy on them and try to do something for them. ",

It is very hard to find genuine people in here who are ready to accept the poor (even your relatives). If you just wanna know why money is everything in life\u2026just sit back observe you family friends & relatives activities in the normal days as well as when you get rich.. Even helps which are done regardless of money doesn\u2019t make any sense to them. Once you get richer, your relatives would respect you..as well as the society around you\u2026.It\u2019s all common thing\u2026 But Money is not everything when don\u2019t care about anyone except your parents & loved ones. People just don\u2019t try to be themselves on their real life\u2026they just follow the other\u2026So do what makes you happier even if it is a simple one.. In this case\u2026 money is not everything at all rather happiness is\u2026:) ",

Humans , with their brain which produces shitty emotions like selfishness, greed, made the entire world depend on money. If You think a lot of people doesn't care about money.. Then once leave your current comfort environment and sit on the temple steps. Then you'll understand your life without money in this present world. Even while selecting their life partner, most people prefer partner who's more rich and who have more lands. You can understand how selfish the world is. Will the bus conductor accept if you give him a rupee less? .. You'll ignore taking the change at restaurants even if it is 100 rupees out of embarrassment. Irrespective of these type of questions on money from people like us, the world Runs automatically. Billionaires emerge everyday, enjoying their life with world tours, 5 star hotels, babe pools and happiness. Get the motivation to earn money. Know how the world is running. Go to a 5 star Hotel, tell them you're waiting for your friend, and observe. There are a lot of successful people like ELON MUSK, who aren't afraid of failures. [0\u20130] Thank you!! ",

When Adam Smith wrote his book Wealth of Nations, world was unaware of the fact that how important the money and wealth are to individuals. Wealth is so important that Hindus have deities like Lakshmi, Kuber and Dhanvantri who are god of wealth and prosperity. But the point is it is as important as to sustain life as there is no limit when a person is satisfied. The accumulation of wealth is extremely harmful as more you inherit resources you are killing other\u2019s right to claim it. Have you ever read John D. Rockefeller story as why he became world\u2019s largest philanthropist after being world\u2019s richest man? (read here The Rockefeller Legacy | Excellence in Philanthropy | The Philanthropy Roundtable ) its simple, restoring wealth generates more enemies than friends, so you get more curse than boons. However if you follow the share principle you maintain the balance. Money is for having a temporary claim on this earth\u2019s limited resources and to enjoy life we need love and that can easily be gathered if we share that claim. So money is not only thing which matters, character is too important to use that material wisely. ",

Certainly having options can make your life easier - but easier may not necessarily equate to happier - and it certainly does not give you everything. Think of it like this - If you are hanging for a Pizza - and you can get one, you have satisfied the most pressing desire you had. The Pizza only cost you a couple of dollars. There are plenty of other better, more nutricious and tasty cuisine available and you probably could have afforded them - but Pizza was on your mind. So too, money is like that. I have had virtually no money for 14 months but the priorities in my life have not changed from when I had money. For that matter, nor has access to money directly changed the priorities. When comfortable, the \u201ceverythings\u201d to me were the care and respect of my daughter, the love and happiness of my girlfriend, the well-being of my family and friends, my own sanity, courage and self-belief. I only have a certain degree of control and influence over all of these things - and money certainly will not determine these things on its own. ",

Desire gives us a reason to live and money can fulfill a lot of desires. Then again, that happiness is temporary. True happiness is something only money can't buy. You need to be confident with yourself to be happy. You also can't buy love and love (not just he romantic kind) is very important no matter how much you deny it. No matter how much you dislike the company of people, you wish there was someone you could talk to, have fun with, be yourself with, who could understand you. ",

If anyone says love is important and nothing going else matters, just look around you. If you want to be happy, you need money. If you want to have a girlfriend, you need money. If you need to marry, you need money. If want to eat, you need money. Make no mistake, people will acknowledge how important you are based on how much money you have. ",

            "answer_text": "You ask whether or not money is everything in this world. Well, the phrase sounds familiar, since the larger percentage of folks seem to adhere to that dictum. But we already \u2018know\u2019 for instance that \u2018 money cannot buy love\u2019 so we have an idea that only objects per se and service etc, per se, can be obtained with money. Yet, even love\u2019 so to speak can be bought viz. prostution et al. - as everyone knows! But what is the difference between buying or obtaining something in exchange for money, and achievimg something through \u2018love\u2019 which we may translate into devotion, worship, caring, compassion and indeed acts of self-sacrifice for the benefit of the world. Money does not \u2018buy\u2019 these latter rubrics, yet they may be fuelled by so called money. I need to drive to the lecture hall where folks are gathered to hear kathaa\u2026hence gas is needed. You need to buy books for your illiterate students so they may benefit from the medium supplied . Hence money used in the service of the divine becomes Laxmi! And that Laxmi is but the spiritual Partner so to speak, of the Supreme One in Charge. Hence everything dedicated in the service of the Supreme, takes on the hue of Sublimity! Thus money can serve in the matter of acts of charity and love, indeed acts of self-sacrifice for the purpose of anugraha , blessings for the entire world! Om Tat Sat: peace for all! ",

Now look within yourself , how many of the problems you have would be solved using that million pounds ? Not all, right ? Sometimes they're supposed to be as such.

When you consider the fact that no matter what you have gained in your life time that is the result of wealth, these are things that hold no real or true value and are not things you take with you when you pass on I've never seen a hearse with a U-haul! These things are superficial have no real determination on the value of your life. We take with us our thoughts, our experiences and the love of those around us. These things are what is everything and what truly matters. ",

There is a O'Henry story, \"Mammon and the archer\", a must read for this question. Money is like God, in the sense that it is what you make of it. You create it, vest in it and look to it for answers.  So like knowledge, like strength, like any other attribute - money is defined by  - how you earn it, how much you are vested in it and how you apply it. If you get the trifecta, then money can indeed be the greatest blessings. But if you don't, then it is a burden, curse and a mirage. ",

Animals today survive without it. So it is possible to survive without money. For me, recognizing that I choose for my lifestyle to include money helps me realize that money is not a need. It's a desire. It's a resource I choose to incorporate into my life. It's a resource that supports me in living in a way that resonates with me beyond just my bare essential needs as a human being.This is my perspective on how I explore my personal relationship with money.

            "answer_text": "To know the answer read the whole story below carefully. I live in a small town in U.P and belongs to a middle class family. There is a broken old building near our house. The owner of this building lives in foreign (may be in Canada , don't know exactly). In this old building, every summer an old aged man in his 60s setup his swing boat (like shown in below image) and a trampoline there and charges Rs. 5( may be more now but when I was a kid he charged Rs.2 for 10 min of ride. So I'm assuming to be Rs.5 now. )  [Image source: GOOGLE] Few kids go there for ride and he manages to afford his two square meal only with his earning. I usually see him from my window and he seems happy all the time singing classic bollywood songs on top of his voice while giving children rides . He has no advance gadgets and facilities, He has a basic keypad phone and a radio which he listen to till 12 in the night. Me too cheers his song in the night and nobody in my house has problem with it because these old songs work as lullabies for us and we sleep peacefully. He lives in a tent as this old building has no roof. He cooks for himself on a fireplace made by him with bricks and I can bet he is an amazing cook as the smell of his cooked gravy makes me go crazy !! He has left this place 2 days before and I am missing his presence, his lulliabies and delicious smell of his cooked gravy :( I will see him in next summer. This is the image of the old building without him  [Image source: Phone gallery] I have learn a great lesson of my life just because of him . I have seen many people (including us) richer than him but no one looks more satisfied and happy than him with their life. Everyone has their own goal and after achieving that they aim for another goal and this goes on and on unending and in this process we forget to be happy and satisfied with our life. We don't cheer little things around us , we focus more on things which we don't have instead of focusing on what we have and how we can enjoy them to the fullest. We are strongly manipulated by our surrounding, social media, t.v serials, online advertisements every second in believing that the one with branded clothes, expensive phone and cars are happy with their life and that is the point where we get trap and start struggling to be happy. \u201cYou\u2019re not your job, you\u2019re not the car you drive, you\u2019re not the contents of your wallet\u201d - Tyler Durden So, is money everything for life ?

You fight together with the world not amongst yourselves.Now next thing its a breakup. Fine you both broke up because suddenly his priorities changed. People change respect that and forget about it. If there is a possibility of getting back. Analyze the situation.Right now you are angry so you are deeming him all wrong. Calm down first. No guy is a hero, no guy is a villain.You are a woman not a vase, so you can have a bad time going but it can't break you darling. It never can. You feel lost because a long term relationship just got over. You thought you'll make it far, it didn't work out n now you are losing your sleep over it. Its all justified.Cry. Cry as much as you want. Talk to friends. But yes never say that you were used. That is a wrong term to say even for your self. No one on this world should e capable enough to use you. Never say that again.You were loyal, you will remain that. Its a great trait. This life is a long race. Right now some people are ahead of you and some are behind, in the end th race is long and you are competing only with yourself.

Both are literate enough to interpret the situation and deduce from it the good and bad\u2026 The situation is as follows:- Both studied together and during their education make some mind altering market loopholes that could either make them a billionaire or get them locked up for a time that's enough to make them forget their education. Also at the same time both are denied any job in placements. Now as a reactive and in the moment person, Anil CHOOSES to play with Lady Luck and follow the loophole Sunil being proactive and thoughtful about his actions makes a wiser decision to take the loophole concept and go to a body that would profit both Sunil and the honest people\u2026thus finding respect in the eyes of the market resulting in a big job opportunity\u2026. Now as humans the biggest thing we have is the RIGHT TO CHOOSE\u2026. No one can take away that right from us but us\u2026. As for your question; it is up to you if you choose to think money is everything or you choose to say there are more important things than money\u2026 But remember one thing\u2026. You have the freedom to choose your path not the obstacles that come with it. ",

Additionally, the answer to this question, I assure you, will change over the span of your life. In my opinion, it is hard to argue that money is not important. Money (in America at least) does determine certain quality of life. It is important to note that if a person is clearly committed to a cause and willing to achieve it, by any means necessary, and confines and compels the wealthiest man in America to make a choice between dying in a horrific, torturous fashion or having a truly loved one die in front of his eyes in a gruesome, unforgettable manner or to surrender all of his wealth, most people would become immediate paupers. That is just reality. ",

Of course when you start to go for a \u201cgoal\u201d will be hard because you don\u2019t have nothing to rely on but as the time passes by you\u2019ll learn and you\u2019ll want more and more because it will become your drug. (My opinion) Idk whats wrong or right but it\u2019s working for me. And of course i couldn\u2019t give the full context,but just an idea. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a comfortable idea,but it\u2019s the best one you have as a human being. The results of course will not come immediately. It\u2019s really a very relative thing,but money will not solve your problems. The way you see things,will. You can see good in everything or bad in everything. But it\u2019s for sure that the first choice will take you more farther than 99% percent of the people. Sorry for my english,i hope you understand thissss ",

Those were obvious. Now coming to the points that everyone mentions- love, happiness, peace and wisdom. Love- first of all, love is overrated. The only form of love that is true is the one between the parents and the children. All other forms are temporary and biased and imaginary. And that true form of love comes to you for free as soon as you are born. No need of money for that.Happiness- if travelling the world, eating in a Michelin star restaurant, living in a huge mansion, having every luxury you can think of, isn't happiness then yeah money can't buy it.Peace- get a house built in the middle of nowhere and voila! You have bought peace.Wisdom- I guess that books, teachers, movies, theatre, courses, college degrees aren't free.TL;DR Those who say that money can't buy everything are hypocrites. ",

With Free flow of money, Life sad moments can be changed /diverted in various ways. the bitter truth is making and having free flow of money is the foremost aim of human life.  But, after that one should spend his/her life times in spiritual ways and help others without expect anything.This is my personal opinion. ",

I usually find the type of people who bemoan capitalism or manufacturing mostly live at home with their parents and are yet to contribute much through things like endeavour or tax. My other observation is that people who insist that money doesn\u2019t matter LOVE to spend it, they never have any and can never do anything meaningful. Funny that. The opposite of living with money would of course be trying to cheerfully find a way to survive comfortably by growing your own food, living outside of the comforts of civilisation etc. That would be a whole lot more grinding and desperate than trying to earn money and enjoying the comforts of civilisation. While there are few easy answers on this planet I would suggest one key to happiness is to learn what money can do for you and your family. The cliches about being the root of all evil are pretty wooly and immature. Money is a language that translates goods and services, learn to speak it.

The problem which has become serious today is people of every age are staunchly following the society's laws(in every part of the world). A few examples to share - Alexander is not known by the coffers he possessed.Lincoln is not recognized by the wealth he amassed.Steve Jobs is lesser known as being a billionaire.Hitchcock, Scorsese or Nolan all are primarily admired by their lucid imaginations on the silver screen.Saying that, money is essential. It's as neccessary as oxygen and as important as the locomotion of our limbs. But it is definitely NOT the \u201cmost\u201d important part of life. ",

If you use it for a good cause and that gives you a sustainable sense of fulfillment, money will be an asset. However if you use money meaninglessly and worst, it generates negative outcomes and results, money becomes a liability. Other than money, there are other important and perhaps even more important values such as love, gratefulness, family, friendship, and giving back to society. Make money your servant for worthwhile causes and not your master and you\u2019ll be on the way to a greater sense of happiness and fulfillment. ",

Money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver. \u2013Ayn Rand 2. Happiness is not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. \u2013Franklin D. Roosevelt 3. Empty pockets never held anyone back. Only empty heads and empty hearts can do that. \u2013Norman Vincent Peale 4. If money is your hope for independence you will never have it. The only real security that a man will have in this world is a reserve of knowledge, experience, and ability. \u2013Henry Ford 5. If you live for having it all, what you have is never enough. \u2013Vicki Robin 6. We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give. \u2013Winston Churchill 7. Wealth is like sea-water; the more we drink, the thirstier we become-Arthur Schopenhauer 8. If we command our wealth, we shall be rich and free. If our wealth commands us, we are poor indeed. \u2013Edmund Burke 9. You can only become truly accomplished at something you love. Don\u2019t make money your goal. Instead, pursue the things you love doing, and then do them so well that people can\u2019t take their eyes off you. \u2013Maya Angelou 10. Money often costs too much. \u2013Ralph Waldo Emerson ",

Money cannot buy friendships and relationships (the genuine ones); money cannot buy peace of mind, money cannot buy real happiness and money cannot buy principles.  There are very rich people who are often miserable, and there are many poor people who are happy and contented.  When used for material satisfaction and selfish purposes, the 'joy' money brings is superficial and temporary but if used for the good of all, money can bring real joy to both giver and receipient.  So, money is good and money is useful but money is not everything. ",

Money is so powerful because everybody else wants money, because they think everyone else want money, because they also in believe that others also believe that others also believe \u2026\u2026.the same thing. Money would be powerless if someone refused to exchange the stuff of your desire for money. Money would also lose power if the stuff you desire is not in anyone\u2019s possession who wants money. Foe example if you desire your dead ancestors to become alive and young, you wouldn\u2019t think money to be that powerful. The point is that the power of money depends on the nature of your desire. If you desire things that can be purchased with money and you think about nothing other than fulfilling those desires money will be everything to you. ",

However, I can only answer for myself: Live your life in selfless pursuit of the happiness and welfare of your friends, family, and loved ones. Do this without expectation of a return in kind, and happiness for you comes. Forget this rule and you eventually come to regret it. By the way, both Plato and Aristotle pointed out that \u201chappiness\u201d (meaning in their language eudaemonia, which is \u201ccontentment\u201d or \u201cinner peace\u201d) is the only thing we do in life that is not done for the sake of something else, and is therefore the ultimate goal of life. Money is important in the same way air, food, and water, is important. You need it to live comfortably according to your standard of living. Beyond that, it has no value. ",

In one of the translations of Srimad Bhagavad Geeta the author has said that out of the four ashramas the gruhastha asaraam is the most important. because it supports the other three. A gruhastha supports the bramcharyashrama by way of granting scholarships to the students. the gruhastha gives alms to the vanprastha and finally takes care to the sannyasins. Hence accordingly if we do our duties well fully absorbed in ethical values we need money to fulfill our social responsibilities. ",

So to do few things u may not need money like I have this mad personality of making friends and talking to people ,playing with kids. These don\u2019t require money but am sure there are always those things you require money for and your conscious doesn\u2019t approve of earning in a wrong way so u have to put in effort and earn. but as you earn u still can live life in your own way. And if you are a person like me and u go somewhere and want to buy something wouldn\u2019t want to think about buying or not because of money .This is called financial freedom or stability. When u achieve this it means u need not put any effort extra to this. So point is money is a matter unless you are heir of a bigshot.. ",

One thing i have also observed people who are rich they get respect even if they don't deserve and poor never gets the same. You are judged by this society on how much money you earn or make per month/annum they are not at all bothered about the kind of work you do. My feeling is one should be earning a decent amount so that he/she can take care of his family and friends or someone who needs the support . A peaceful happy life is what i feel is the most important thing rather than just money ",

Of course your journey depends on your expectations, and you need some way to go forward , either with a responsibility of whatever it takes to succeed in what goal you want . Raising a family or just being single , both have to be a goal and without money it would be impossible sometimes. Even the best barterer needs money once in awhile. ",

The most precious thing is \u201cKNOWLEDGE\u201d. if we say TIME, but who will acknowledge it? then again you need knowledge to admit it, after getting knowledge one can utilize the time, money , family, resources, Company , Country, so on and so forth. and this is the only thing that a person can carry forward with his SANSKAAR\u009d to next birth, otherwise everything he has to left behind after death. So what can be more precious than a thing that travels with our SOUL? If we respect Knowledge or knowledgeable ppl then only we can enhance our intelligence. We see that some of kids born with super intelligence or special IQ and we say that they are GOD GIFTED, but this was their non-stopping efforts to gain the KNOWLEDGE in their past lives , and they get it as brought forward in their Karmic Account. So , we should always strive for knowledge and the Right knowledge is: That serves your SOULThat serves the NationThat serves your religionThat serves the SocietyA good seeker always gets the \u201cTRUE KNOWLEDGE\u201d and gets the MOKSHA after synchronization of his own conduct with True knowledge.
