They wanted to go onto graduate school, I wanted a job right out of undergraduate school. You have to ask yourself what your goals are, and then you can decide what degree is best for you. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s the difference between mind expanding and brainwashing.

Modern neoclassical economics is not a science but an ideology, a series of a priori deductions based on acknowledgedly false premises. It will take a rich and complex area of study and reduces it to thin and mostly unenlightening formulae. ",
