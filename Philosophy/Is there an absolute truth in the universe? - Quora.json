            "answer_text": "No it does not exist - but the reason is not that \u201ceverything is subjective\u201d or \u201csubjective perception\u201d. All truth is relative - with the exception (not much more than a humerous exception) that this truth is perhaps the only absolute truth. This has already been stated by Auguste Comte in mid-19th century.  All truth has to be confirmed in individual statements. In order to confirm a statement you need do understand it. You need to know what exactly has to be true if that statement should be confirmed; and that brings the relativity into the game. What kind of statements am I speaking of? Any. It is true that the grammatical plural of \u201ctable\u201d is \u201ctables\u201d. To understand this you need to define all these things - plural, table, the additional -s. You determine that this statement is true with a look at language as it is spoken or written - and only now you will get your proof. It is just as true that an Earth year is 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes and 9.54 seconds. You define what it means and you can make the test. All that truth remains relative. The statements depend on the definitions of its units and relationships between things involved. They depends on the tests which we have to define - and we know that this creates a margin of error and misconception. Science progresses. New questions are being asked, new experiments are designed to test new statements and this is why we will define the process as open. Our statements deal with a fraction of things out there just as our maps deal with a fraction of reality on Earth and elsewhere.  The interesting question is: Why do many people insist on the idea that all truth is subjective. On a strictly systematic perspective this should be a Platonic, Kantian premise but reading Plato and Kant with students I felt that these philosophers were as far from their views as imaginable. 20th-century Marxists or Dialectical Materialsts would have claimed that their Philosophy of Dialectical Materialism is totally \u201cobjective\u201d and that any escape into subjectivism is inherently bourgeois. In a way this is closer to the mentality I get in Quora statements on this question - and this question is constantly asked here in many versions. But the Marxist analysis of a \u201cbourgeois\u201d mindset is again not satisfying. There is a Western modernist point in the claim that all our views are unique and personal. In a way this is both a secular and a religious view. It is secular since religion is about an absolute truth (which is rejected here) and it is religious at the same moment since at least US-Evangelical Christians will claim that you need a direct personal perspective linking you to God in Order to see his truth. My students who claimed that they had a unique view were neither Platonists, nor had they studied Kant nor were they decidedly bourgeois or able to consider religious roots of their notion. They would refer to experiences and to works of art and explain here that not two people can have the same view.  Let me first state that the entire idea of truth being subjective is utterly erroneous. If you see the world as only you can see it - since you are looking through your eyes without knowing how things appear in the eyes of others\u2026 if that is really your view you will go to the next optician who offers you glasses so that you can see things again as everybody around you. The camera you buy will take pictures like you see them - under the premise that there is an objective way in which a lens does its job. The contrary is true: these machines are made to see the world much like you, and you return them if they do not show the world objectively. Our tools from our cameras to the scales in our kitchens are designed to be objective. They return the same measurements of light and weight on each test under the same conditions. These tools are not stating \u201cthe absolute truth\u201d but an \u201cobjective relative truth\u201d since we can define the parameters under which the create views. We love the idea that we personally see the world as no one else does and this love needs to be understood in the middle of a life we organised around the objectivity of machines and scientific learning. I would say that this this love of \u201csubjectivity\u201d is basically the Western political premise. We are taught to subscribe to this view during long school years in countless personal interpretations of Shakespeare poems, of impressionist paintings, of cultural artefacts at school until we believe it. You have to produce these personal views or you lose in these tests - while you will swallow objectivity in your other classes from chemistry to physics.  It is in a way the essence of the democratic system that we have personal views to maintain - and that we have a right to maintain them. Our right as citizens depend on this premise. We get the democratic citizenship as a personal right since - so the claim - we will not agree otherwise. Modern societies whether communist or democratic or or Chinese offer their citizens the right to hold personal views. Western societies add that anyone can state his or her view without consequence. \u201cWithout consequence\u201d that is without the risk of of state persecution and without consequence for others. Others have to tolerate your statements but you cannot force them to adopt your views. All you will get is elections in which you can choose according to your views - and then you have to accept that you were majority or minority with all the ensuing consequences of the unique view. (This has not always been the case. Earlier political systems were built on the idea of a hard truth everyone has to swallow without any right to pass a vote on anything.) My students claimed they had personal if not totally unique views. I was skeptical. We have circulating views and these can be quantified.  Back to the questions: Does absolute truth exist? If so, list. If not why do you say so? The radical answer will be that an absolute truth will be inherently worthless, because it will come without the parameters which I need to make sense of the statement. The absolute truth of this kind is the number 42 of the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. Once you state the parameters you will begin to state truths that are relative to these parameters. ",

            "answer_text": "In logic and the philosophy of logic, questions need to be very very simple, so that they are clear enough to look for a rational answer. So, this question starts with the expression \u201cabsolute truth\u201d. What does that mean? How can someone answer a question about something without a clear simple meaning? So, what is special about this expression is the \u2018absolute\u2019 part. Everybody actually knows what truth is, even if they say they don\u2019t. For we all use the concept all the time. If my dog Sadie is sitting on a mat, then it is true that my dog Sadie is sitting on a mat. A garden variety truth. Simple. Of course, sometimes people confuse a sentence taken out of its context with the statement that is made by the sentence in a given context. For example, the sentence is said at a certain time, so the statement implicitly references the time. The statement does not change its truth value over time. Instead, in different contexts, the same sentence will be used to make a different statement. Similarly,\u2019my\u2019 is going to refer to the speaker, so a different statement will be being made if spoken by a different speaker. Sentences are never true or false, only the statements made with them. All this just mixes up what is obvious common sense, for some kind of phony profundity. Sometimes, though, people mix up what is true, namely statements that correspond to the way things are, with how we can know what is true, That is a harder question, but mixing up what we can know with what there is to know (things that are true) doesn\u2019t make it any easier. Sometimes they mix up what people believe to be true and what IS true. This is silly one. If believing something made it \u2018true\u2019 for the believer, then we would not have any reason to disagree with each other, ever. No need for juries to deliberate, or listen to evidence, etc. Given this, what is the different between a garden variety truth and an \u2018absolute\u2019 truth? Plain old truth is true enough for me. Then, there is the issue of perception. I might look at the sky and see it as blue, and you might see it as green. This means there are two true statements - I see the sky as blue, and you see it as green. And at least one false statement lurking around, the sky is blue, or the sky is green. It is unecessary to confuse the straightforward \u2018what I experience\u2019 with \u2018what is \u2018\u2019true for me\u2019\u2019. Once we have decided what \u2018the sky\u2019 and \u2018is blue\u2019 means in this context, then that will determine whether \u2018the sky is blue\u2019 is true or false, or indeterminate. If the sky is blue means \u2018the sky looks blue to me\u2019, then the sky is blue and you are out of luck believing it to be green. If it meant how the sky looked to you, then I would be out of luck. But it can\u2019t mean *both* because if it did, then we would be speaking different languages, where the word \u2018is blue\u2019 meant different things, so we would have no basis for discussion. Next, leaving the \u2018absolute\u2019 part aside, how about \u2018a truth about everything\u2019? What might this mean? That given a thing, there exists at least one a statement about that thing which is true? There sure is. Exactly as many true statements as false ones, since if S is true, then not S is false. There is of course the fact that measurements of the world and the meanings of words are both vague, so that there will be many edge cases where the measurements and the meanings don\u2019t resolve whether the statement is true or not. If an \u2018absolute\u2019 truth is simply one where there is no grey area, then this is also not very profound. In sum, if we did not believe that some statements were true, and others false, there would be no reason for anyone to make any statements. When we make a statement, because it says that things are a certain way and not another, it is either true or false, or too imprecise or otherwise faulty so as to be neither true nor false, even though we might not know which, even though we might not believe either . If this is not a question about logic and the philosophy of logic, then what is it a question about? ",
