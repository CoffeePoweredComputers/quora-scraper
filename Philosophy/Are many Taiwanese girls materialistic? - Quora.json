            "answer_text": "They are both practical and materialistic, though much less than Hong Kong women. By practical, I mean that they won\u2019t just fall in love with you and keep a romantic relationship for a few years and finally contemplate marriage. They are very likely considering you as a potential future husband right on your first date. So, your bank account, social class, car, housing, and your family will be seriously studied. Any of these fall short of their standard, then \u201cyou are fired\u201d. And by matierialistic, I mean that they would define who you are by your clothing, appearance, and most importantly, money. So if you are Taiwanese guy or just any other Asian (probably except Japanese), you have big chances that the women will judge you with these parameters. However if you are a white guy then they won\u2019t be so strict. Go figure. ",

Sure, everybody loves to go out shopping and splurge from time to time. Taiwanese girls are no exception, but neither am I, a grouchy old American guy. So if you wanted me to generalize, I would say they are practical, but not too materialistic. ",
