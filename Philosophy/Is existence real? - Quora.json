            "answer_text": "Is existence real? Maybe! *Rubs hands in glee* The first time you read it, it sounds like a very stupid question with an obvious answer but on it\u2019s own, the question captures the semantic beauty of existence and consciousness in a way better that anything has ever done and we need to know about it. You see, the world is an interaction between unconscious and conscious systems. You, your pet dog, your favorite snack, the time that\u2019s passing, your feelings of perennial sadness and happiness and everything else in between makes every part of your reality right now, This reality evolves at a constant speed of 1 second per second. Let\u2019s break it down. Right now, you\u2019re probably sitting down in your home, reading this sentence, trying to comprehend a lot of information through your brain which is able to make sense of all of this only because you know the rules of the language it is written in and the meanings of the words that are mentioned. You\u2019re able to do this because your eyes are in the right place in your human body, the gravity is exerting the right amount of force, the electrons are flowing in a particular fashion through domains of a particular kind of Silicon molecule in the device you are using, the satellite outside this magnificent pale blue dot of earth is transmitting and receiving messages at a particular speed in a particular line of sight in order to serve you this exact content. All these things are a part of this reality. Your reality. Your friend sitting in the other room reading a book is a part of her own reality which may be drastically different from the reality that you are experiencing. All of us experience different realities. That is what gives us different world views. Also do realize that the present is an outcome of the past and the present will eventually become a part of the past. The passing of time is but the recursive phenomena of the present going back to the past and the future coming home to the present. If that sounds a little complicated to you, think of it like eating food. The process of eating food is but the systematic set of steps of food no longer staying in the plate and getting into your gut. In the famous TV series, Pitchers, The protagonist Navin rightly point out that the water bottle he\u2019s holding in his hand is an outcome of a series of planned and revolutionary inventions and evolutions in design and structure of a portable water storage tool. There are millions of people who are working on improving the current design simply because the current design exists.   Snap Snap! Back to reality! So how at all does this discussion relate to assessing the reality of existence? Let\u2019s consider a basic mathematical problem. Prove that odd numbers exist, given that the numbers not divisible by 2 are all odd. Let W be the set of all numbers 0,1,2,3,\u2026 and so on. We know that there exists at least one number which is not divisible by 2, let 1 be the number. So there do exist numbers not divisible by 2. Hence, odd numbers exist. Let\u2019s call it statement 1.  But how do we know that odd numbers are real. Or for the matter, any number is real? According to Wikipedia- In mathematics, a real number is a value of a continuous quantity that can represent a distance along a line. So any number that represents a distance along a line is real. We know that all numbers that are mathematically real are mathematical analogies to real world distances. So they are indeed real. Note that this includes odd, even, negative, positive and every kind of number. So odd numbers are real. Let\u2019s call it statement 2.  Now that from statement 1 and 2 we concluded that odd numbers do exist and they are real, we can hypothesize that existence is real for odd numbers and similarly for even numbers and broadly all real number. But what about Imaginary numbers? We know that imaginary numbers do exist. We can even come with a well defined definition of imaginary numbers. as numbers which do not measure real world distances. We can even denote them with well accepted symbols. But the problem is that they aren\u2019t real. We run into a paradox here. In the universe of numbers, existence may or not mean reality. Existence can be real. Existence can also not be real. Is existence real?  Can you cite an example of a number that doesn\u2019t exist? Is it real? The only constraint is that you can\u2019t put a constraint on the Numerical Universe. The number has to be a point in the entire Numerical Universe, not a point in a small part of it. There doesn\u2019t exist such a number. You\u2019ll tell me. WAIT a Minute!!!! There does not exist a number that doesn\u2019t exist and is real. So a number does exist that doesn\u2019t exist. We run into another paradox here.  Numbers are but a very small part of our reality. They are one dimensional and easy to operate on. What about everything else. Imagine for example watching a movie. A movie does exist but is it real? It does feel like it\u2019s real, for some time. Like, you are immersed in a story and you are a part of it and it\u2019s a part of your reality. Isn\u2019t it? So it should be real. Right? Imagine that while watching a movie the sound and the videos are not in sync and there is more than 100ms difference between the signals. Your brain battles between which signal to interpret and what to make of it. It is the same movie. It is the same video and they are the same sounds. But it is no more real. And movies are (let\u2019s say) only 2 dimensional. The reality that you exist in, or your consciousness exists in is n-dimensional  Consciousness is the feeling that you\u2019re human. The sheer realization that you exist and you are a human being is your consciousness. A cow has a different consciousness from you. I don;t know if a cow does realize that it is a cow but it surely doesn\u2019t operate in the way we humans do. The pivotal element of human consciousness is the ability to realize that we are indeed conscious. Note it down. Remember it. Now that we know consciousness does exist, is consciousness real? Or to simplify it, is our consciousness real? How do you say that a person is alive? He grows conscious of his state of being. How do you say that a person is no more? He ceases to exist. His consciousness is no more. Scientific metaphysics has a lot of explanation into what goes behind death but let it be there. So is our this state of being and not being based on our consciousness, a representation of a real fact.  Reality is subjective. If the whole world is inclined to believe that red is green and not red, that is the new reality. You see, I could ask you to say if a white elephant with blue lips exists and you\u2019d tell me that it doesn\u2019t because in your reality that it doesn\u2019t. But let\u2019s say the elephant does exist but for you it is not real yet. But for those who have seen it, it is indeed real. A good analogy that comes to my mind is the \u201cghosts are real. I have seen one\u201d debate. The reality of existence is subjective to the person who\u2019s reality we\u2019re seeing it from. And this is our answer. Maybe existence is real depending on who\u2019s conscious reality the existence is interacting with  See you soon stud Ankit Jha ",

            "answer_text": "Try and think of something that you know exists. Apples, oranges, and pears. Easy. Now try and think of something you don\u2019t know exists. Dragons, unicorns, and her possible love for me. Just thinking about it is still easy. Now try and think of something you can\u2019t know, period. This is a dead end. Existence is the product of the mind, and they are called abstractions. If you\u2019re a programmer then creating them is part of your job. But there is a shorter, less technical name which we are all familiar with. They are words. Words are the names we give abstractions. If we can circle a pattern we wish to recall, we can give that something a name. We can give it a word or a description. From then on, our words become that thing. Our entire collection of words then make up our language. Language is the interface to all that exists within that reality. Some existences are obvious enough to warrant one word. But for the rest, we articulate with sentences and metaphors and stories and answers. To your question exists answers. This is one such answer. You might think there are things with no words. Except, such an existence is expressed with words precisely by the class of existences that fall under \u201cthat which cannot be described with words\u201d (we just described them with words). So there is no escaping existence, and there is no access to non-existence unless we have it already. Our capacity to abstract is a physical capability provided by our brain. The patterns we extract are also dependent on our physical senses and our experiences. That is what makes everything real and also physical. Words may seem superficial, arbitrary, and symbolic, but they are real associations to real existences. And that is also what makes philosophy real. You\u2019d think we\u2019d get nowhere just shuffling words in our head from our armchairs, but as it turns out, that is all we need to do to think and philosophize about all that exists \u2014 for it is all in our head. Our brains don\u2019t go anywhere, so neither must we. Language holds all of what is real to us already, and by handing a philosopher this work, they have all they need. New existences emerge from new experiences and new technology. They also emerge from new patters we create with words. I can combine \u201cpink\u201d with \u201clemonade\u201d and create the phrase before creating the drink. This works, because words too form patterns. Just as words can generate more words, abstractions can generate more abstractions. And words too are things. We can type them, share them, stare at them. They are things that refer to other things, but they too exist and have consequences, such as consuming ink, or consuming our breath. This is all an ongoing, progressive, adaptive process, and it is happening as we speak. Because language is shared, this entire process is happening in parallel through a group effort. As those of us who are pretty much physically identical share our relatively identical experiences, our words can be identical also. ",
