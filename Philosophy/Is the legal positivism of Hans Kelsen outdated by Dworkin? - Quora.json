            "answer_text": "Legal positivism is certainly Dworkin\u2019s target - one he tackled head-on when he took over at Oxford. But the term \u2018outdated\u2019 presumes that the argument is over. Many jurists, as far as I know, are still positivists in principle, if only because that is the pragmatic choice; if you see the last resort as the written word, then that is a certain-sure fall-back position (or appears to be). Dworkin, in the last resort, has more faith in humanity - in all its fuzzy, warm, feelgood capacity for humane understanding. Positivism is also conservative, as the US Supreme Court may now demonstrate. ",
