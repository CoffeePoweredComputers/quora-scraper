            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. I have read many stories where a person has traveled back in time to interact with younger self. Usually the older version presents as a \"friend\" or \"relative\" remembering that's how it was originally experienced by the younger self. Therefore, if I were to bring the younger version of myself forward to 2016, I would already remember having visited 2016 (even if I thought it to be a dream). Casting aside this paradox, I don't think I could cope with a single day of the 12yo version of myself existing in 2016. The incessant questions from him would drive me nuts. Edit: I'm very sure that when I originally answered this question, the word forever was not present. You could bring your past self to the present without returning the younger self to the original time line, otherwise there would be no continuity for the 2016 person to be able to go back and visit the junior self.

            "answer_text": "Depends on the time travel model. If you have some form of branching time line, you end up on a branch where your past self was brought forward in time, and you are from a separate branch. If you have a singular timeline, then this sequence of events simply never occurs. If you were never brought forward in time, you csnt go back to that moment and bring yourself forward, because that isn't what happens at that time. If you go back to a moment, it's not happening again, it's happening for the one and only time it happens, so anything that will ever happen at that point in time is already happening there. This isn't to say you can't go back in time and influence the past, just that any influence you exert must be consistent with what already happened. ",
