            "answer_text": "If you read Christoph Waltz of 'Inglourious Basterds': The Austrian-born Waltz speaks three languages fluently -- German, French and English -- and can fake Italian pretty well, as \"Inglourious Basterds\" (Aug. 21) proves. That said: after listening a few times at his (undubbed) line in Inglorious Bastards, I\u2019d say he exercised quite a lot in saying it properly with the voice tone, stress and pauses that are appropriate for the role he\u2019s playing, especially the last part \u2014 while in the first part of his line \u201cSignori, \u00e8 un piacere! Gli amici della vedetta ammirata da tutti noi, questa gemma propria della nostra cultura\u201d he almost omits the \u00e8 un between Signori and piacere, and also does not pause between noi and questa. Nonetheless, he\u2019s still quite good in faking it, because I can\u2019t hear any German or French inflexion in it. By comparison, Brad Pitt sounds absolutely ridiculous saying his Buongiorno! (he sounds as if he was some rude herdsman who just came down from his horse\u2026). ",
