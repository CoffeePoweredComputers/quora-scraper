The concept of distinguishing between stable and unstable geniuses was first introduced in 2018 by stable genius Donald Trump on modern day social media. Many questioned this, but at least we\u2019re free to do so. He won\u2019t send you to Dachau. He could if wanted to, but tours there cost money.

He replaced most of the Generals and Staff on the Russian Front, so much so that he could have a meeting of the whole of eh Russian Front Staff by looking in a Mirror. He wasted Germany\u2019s resources on Building the V1, V2 and unfinished V3 weapon system which were all designed to attack London. Quite how attacking London would defeat the Russians and Allie is a mystery. ",
