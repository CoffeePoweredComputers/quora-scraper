            "answer_text": "Not at all. I\u2019ve yet to encounter a millennial doing anything that approached philosophy. Whinging is not being philosophical. Accepting the world as it is and then deciding to relate to that via a particular world view that is helpful and life affirming is philosophy. Some millennials like to consume philosophy to look cool but I rarely see much evidence that they are actually putting it into practice. I don\u2019t know of a generation more obsessed with positive psychology memes and yet they keep missing the point of it. It\u2019s as if those memes are just chosen for stylistic effect on their social media feeds. There are plenty of millennial made Way Of the Dao and similar vids that are incredibly lengthy but I\u2019ve yet to meet an actual Daoist of that generation. They talk about meditation and living their best life endlessly but still seem obsessed with wealth creation, 4 bedroom 5 bathroom homes, getting ripped and how many followers they have on social media. The irony of that is massive, so is the cognitive dissonance. I think the millennials are one of the most lost and confused generations to ever grace the planet. Permissive parenting has create millions of rudderless ships with no skills for navigating life. ",

            "answer_text": "Just going from my time in college and my circle of friends, it does appear millennials have more of an interest in Philosophy. I think that should hardly be a surprise if it is to anybody. More millennials are non-religious, but that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t interested in the same existential questions that enter the minds of most humans. A lot of us still feel like we\u2019ve got to find some reason, sense, or purpose for it all somehow. Philosophy is the main way people have tried to do that throughout time, often without religious dogma. I can\u2019t say always without because some philosophical schools are religious. I don\u2019t think most people find nihilism to be per se appetizing or pleasing, so without religion people may be more likely to turn to Philosophy to seek some understanding about life. Because let us face it - science can\u2019t answer the deep existential questions that most people have. ",

They have no idea what \u201cphilosophical\u201d means, and they have had no exposure to a way of thinking that does not flatter them and therefore form their world view. ",
