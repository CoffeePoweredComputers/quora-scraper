            "answer_text": "Where does the idea of moral right and wrong come from? From getting your teeth kicked in, and then comparing notes. And what you find out is, there are hundreds of you who hate getting your teeth kicked in, and only a handful of punks going around doing it! So you get pissed. \u201cThere are hundreds of us! Why do we allow this in-kicking of teeth? Let\u2019s make it not allowed!\u201d And you all go see them together, and make them to understand that kicking teeth in is no longer allowed. Typically by kicking their teeth in, and threatening worse. In the old days, it was a lot of that tooth-for-tooth stuff. Anyway, big success, until somebody mentioned getting their eye poked out. Hey! Your eye was poked out too, years ago. You still remember how hateful that was. Next thing you know: no poking out eyes. A new resolution, and another posse to track down that dang eye-poker. At some point, once people get used to the idea of prohibitions, and you\u2019ve got a pretty good body of them aimed at most of the most obvious harmful acts, somebody points out that it\u2019s not cricket to prohibit something, then punish someone who did it before it was prohibited. And everyone nods and agrees. They see the potential for harm and abuse. That had been a favorite trick of theirs, seeing someone no one likes doing something harmless, passing a new resolution and then punishing them for it! Nodding and grunting, they can see and agree how unfair that is. Of course, excusing themselves for priors. It wasn\u2019t wrong then. And it grows and adds on from there. But where did it come from? Getting your teeth kicked out, and comparing notes. Or even if not teeth: some injury. Some act of harm. An injury that can be prevented, or at least discouraged, for all of us. If we proclaim and make it known that We All Say it is wrong, and that furthermore, We All Say we\u2019ll kick your damn teeth out if you do it. And then if someone does it, make a big to-do about following through on the warning. Turn it into a party, half the time. Big cultural ceremony! Eventually, most of morality was knighted as law. Government had begun to form, chieftains with their thugs increasingly ordering and running things, popular notions of right and wrong adopted and proclaimed as enforced by king\u2019s will and rule. All the important, obviously morally-wrong acts that we all could see were punishable were swept up and included. Prohibited. And punished, ever more ceremoniously than in the old days, back when morality was a more personal matter - and so too was justice. From experience, we\u2019d found we\u2019d rather have such things as official and officious as we could. Impersonal. Impartial. Seems like it might be fairer then. Anyway yeah, that\u2019s where it came from originally: similarity of organism times population concentration. The same injuries hurt us all as pretty well as bad. When there came to be enough of us together in one place and we all got to talking, we found that we all (pretty much) hated being injured. And as we groused and commiserated, we realized that we could in fact do something about it. Seeing as there were so many of us, all hating the same basic slate of acts - of course we could! And we made it a rule, for our own good and protection. And we bound ourselves to enforce it upon each and all. Doing so, we accepted that we ourselves were prohibited from such acts as prohibited all. We accepted that it was wrong to do them. ",

            "answer_text": "Ask yourself this very simple question. What is it that all morally right actions have in common? What about morally wrong actions? We\u2019ll get back to that. Let\u2019s define what morality is, then we\u2019ll see if we can find an answer to the question. Morality does not and cannot exist independent of the experience of conscious beings with the capacity to understand and care about the consequences of its/ their actions. Could morality exist in a universe without creatures capable of awareness and empathy? I don\u2019t see how. If you were the only being in the universe, what might an immoral act be? Without someone else that is affected by your actions, the word morality ceases to have any meaning. Morality is a social framework in which groups determine the rightness or wrongness of actions based on the collective values of the group. If a group adopts a particular morality, it is not \u201cgood\" by default. Moralities \u201cgoodness\u201d is relative to the values that people hold. Someone will inevitably point out that a rapist might value rape. Desire and value are not the same. One need only ask the rapist if they would like to be raped or, in case they might enjoy it, ask if they would want the people they care about it to be raped, I think you will find the overwhelming consensus is no. Lending evidence to the fact that even rapists know that rape causes harm even if they cannot control their desire or care about the experience of others. Inevitably people ask me, what about individuals will designate their own individual morality? Again, that is a non-sequitur because morality is, by definition social, not individualistic. It\u2019s like asking if there\u2019s such a thing as a married bachelor. Only groups can have morals, individuals have values upon which they will try to convince others they should adopt. Only once there is agreement can a moral framework exist. In other words, if a person values their lives, then they would have to convince others to value the same. Because humans have the capacity to understand how their actions affect others and the capacity to care about those actions, then wanting to be free from harm is something we have to negotiate with others around us. In other words, people have to agree to value freedom from harm and then create rules that make harming others punishable. Once the group agrees that a particular action is wrong, they have established a moral framework based on shared values. Healthy humans have the biological imperative to avoid unnecessary and unwanted pain sickness and suffering. As a result, human values tend toward states that avoid pain, sickness and suffering and human values tend to be a reflection of this fact. However, humans possess the capacity to contemplate and make decisions contrary to their biological imperatives. Free will is simultaneously what makes morality possible but also makes it possible for people to act contrary to their imperative. The confusing part for most people is how morality, the rules that define right and wrong are chosen. Can we value harm? Sure, we can and have. One need only think about something from the past that we now know causes harm. But what changed? Our understanding of that thing (whatever it is). But what about a person who says they have their own morality? Again, not possible. Along with consciousness, awareness and the capacity to understand how our actions affect others comes the capacity to make choices that go against our own best interests and the interests of the group. Free will it seems is a side effect of awareness. Morality is simply a choice that people make based on shared values. However, it is extremely important to remember that if the shared values of a group are based on a flawed understanding, then the morality adopted by that group is likely to fail to achieve the goals it sets for itself. I\u2019ll give an extreme example here for clarities sake, but it need not be so extreme. Let\u2019s say there is an isolated group of people somewhere in the world. And let\u2019s say that they believe that they should pluck the eyeballs out of their firstborn to please the gods so it will rain and they won\u2019t starve. We know that taking the eyes from children does not affect the rain, therefore their moral system has been corrupted by a lack of information. Correct the information, values will change and the moral system will change as a result. In other words, when the group defines something like \u201cmoral\u201d the only test that one can perform is to ask if the moral in question achieves the goal of the underlying values that it seeks to enforce? What about religion. Do morals come from God? First, morality comes AFTER values, not before. Thus most religions have it backward. It would be like creating the rules for a game without knowing what the object of the game is. I would suggest to you that religion has, though thousands of years of trial and error defined morality based on the values that the religion and its followers hold, and there is nothing wrong with that. The problem with (most) religious morality is that it wants us to believe that right and wrong exist independent of values. Ok, so back to the beginning. What do all morally right actions have in common? If the underlying values are based on reasoned principles, then morally right actions should promote both possible and actual health, well-being, and happiness. Morally wrong actions cause both possible and actual harm and suffering and sickness. We value things that promote the former and avoid the latter. It\u2019s just that in most of our history we\u2019ve lacked the ability to understand how our actions achieve the goals of the values we claim for ourselves. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: Where does the idea of moral right and wrong come from? Most likely from our own survival instincts. Human beings are a social species. Behavioural scientists have traced empathies origins to infants as young as only a few months old. There have also been studies that show toddlers need to help starts even before they\u2019ve developed language skills (a good indication that co-operation is not a learned concept but an instinctual behaviour). Toddlers have also been observed to show a sense of justice - taking pleasure in seeing anti-social behaviours punished but being upset when witnessing the punishment of someone who is pro-social. (Study Shows Chimps and Infants Want to Punish Antisocial Behavior). We need community in order to survive. A single human being alone doesn\u2019t live long in the wilderness. And community functions better when there is a clear list of rules that everyone knows and understands. That said, morality can become toxic when the list of rules stops being about keeping the peace and becomes a tool for the already-powerful to amass even more power. ",

            "answer_text": "Beliefs about right and wrong are essential to everybody as they bestow meaning hence reveal purpose. And as recognising right from wrong needs beliefs about right and wrong, no understanding can exist without existing beliefs about right and wrong that become the parents of all subsequent beliefs about right and wrong. Hence morality is never a choice but is set by the experiences of infancy, which is why character is set by three years of age. (See Character is set by 3 years, see Media articles (1999,2003) ",
