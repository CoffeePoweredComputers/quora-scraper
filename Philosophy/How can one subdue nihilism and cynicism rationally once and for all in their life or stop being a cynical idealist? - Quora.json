            "answer_text": "This question cannot be answered without asking a series of other questions. What is certain in life? What are the uncertainties in life? Death is the only certainty in life. Death gives meaning to life. Apart from death, nothing else in this life is certain. So cynics and nihilists are people who are not emotionally prepared to embrace death. So having established the ultimate certainty, let's look at the uncertainity, it is \u201clife\u201d. Nobody knows when we are going to die. Some could predict based on habits, environment etc.. but no one knows. But you do know for certain that you are going to die someday. So what do you? Take a moment, feel the air that goes on through your nostrils filling your lungs. Do you feel it? Then congratulations! you're alive. But what is the meaning of life? What am I to do with this gift I've been given? Well smell yourself. Do you smell good? If not clean yourself. Look at your room. Does it look/smell clean? If not, work on it. Complete your tasks. One by one, but make sure you engage your senses in everything that you do. Try to make things better. One task at a time. Engage all of your senses while you're alive. In everything that you do, every second of your life. Trust me, you will come out with a different perspective. One that does not lean towards nihilism or cynicism. ",
