            "answer_text": "Depends on what you are doing. When you are doing many things you should also be able to not get confused and loose your way. As long as your mind can function independently on each of these threads you can do multiple things at a time. I strongly believe human DNA is programmed for this. You should read books on how the mind really works and how fascinating our neural system is( Books - User Illusion, Incognito). You would be surprised to know that we are limiting ourselves in so many ways, again a trick played by our own mind telling you that you can only do this much. But obviously there are things which cannot be done in parallel. Use your judgement and take a call on what best suits you. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, It Depends. If you have less time and more tasks in your queue then you must do many things at a time to finish at the timeline where as if you have a good time to spend then you could take single task at a time. I prefer to Plan my timeline and do one thing at a time mostly, because it gives me self satisfaction that I concentrate more on what I do and give my maximum effort and do the best ( if I Do what I love); Sometimes I must Do what I Should do though my heart doesn't really into it that times, Honestly I don't care about the perfection for it, I would focus only on completion and the time that time i might do many task at same time. I suggest you to do what best suits you, Cheers :) ",
