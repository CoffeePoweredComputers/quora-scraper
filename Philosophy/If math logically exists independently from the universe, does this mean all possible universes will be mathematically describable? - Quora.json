            "answer_text": "Science, math, religion, philosophy - are all but tools used by humans to describe what they think are describable given certain assumptions (AXIOMS). there is a fundamental, scientific FAULT with this question -A. nothing exists INDEPENDENTLY from the universe.B. humans for simplification of analysis, simplified the process of understanding the nature by drawing boundaries between subjects viz. - mathematics, physics, chemistry, philosophy, metaphysics etc. MIND IT - the goal is singular viz.- a sound description of reality subject to certain AXIOMS (that have been never been found to be untrue as far the understanding of natural phenomenon by Homo Sapiens is concerned.) i.e. as long as we are convinced about a popular belief - whether by so called intuition (faith i.e. religion) or by so called popular agreement (called - science), we accept it as OUR UNDERSTANDING of REALITY. consider, alternately - Heisenberg's uncertainty priniciple (a mathematical tool used in quantum mechanics).                                                  It states in simple words - because the wavelength dimension of any light is almost of comparable order with the dimension of electron, it is impossible to correctly determine the exact location  and momentum of the electron being viewed at the same space-time. and why is it impossible ? because we are limited by our IDEA of measurement i.e. using light. However, this never means that the idea the word 'electron' represents is absolutely non-existent.  Mathematics is just another great tool of description used by humans. If say cockroaches were to evolve to more than humane intelligence level say some billion years from now on , and come up with another instrument (of their so called evolved logic) which does so good to convince other cockroaches about their waidely accepted understanding of universe, that could be another tool and EQUALLY VALID. but mind you, coming to yet answering your doubt as to would it still be describable , say another universe? -  Answer - YES and NO :P  YES - given, if some sort of intelligent species develops in those universe, they would still find some method to convince their understanding. They would still come up with some tool to quantify and qualitatively measure tangible and non-tangible aspects of their universe. NO - complete description of universe philosophically means arriving at a complete Mathematical desription of universe. To describe a universe would mean an insect that lives inside an apple , trying to understand How the apple looks from outside . Since its only reality is inside, there is no outside . Therefore it possibly cant ever arrive at a description of an apple , that is exactly similar to that by a person who holds the apple in his hand and eats it. So like our universe- there would never really be a complete mathematical model to completely describe those universes . All there would be - logical models to convince themselves with always a potential to make it more accurate. ",

            "answer_text": "In mathematics, there is no universe. In science, mathematics is just a language we use to represent what we understand. So yes, any universe will be mathematically describable, but only if it\u2019s understandable, and only if scientists and mathematics are part of that universe. But at this point, we\u2019re only speculating about something that is technically unfalsifiable. Meaning, we can imagine whatever we want, but we cannot devise experiments that test any part of what we\u2019re saying. Questions like these are not really about mathematics or physics, and do not make practical sense. We use physical situations to practice math, and we use math to solve physics, so they instinctively are intertwined which will get us curious. But any unfalsifiable hypothesis falls exactly outside the interest of scientists, and any non-logical structure cannot randomly be introduced into mathematics. So though the word combinations may inspire our imagination, that does not mean they are problems worth solving, or can be solved. It really takes some effort to get something meaningful out of technically flawed questions, and so most professionals simply do not have time for them. The only thing that can be done is attempt to identify with what is causing the questioner to ask in the first place, and explain how things actually are in the hopes of satisfying that curiosity. ",

            "answer_text": "What do we mean when we say that mathematics 'describes' something? Maths itself is the process of reasoning rigorously about certain kinds of abstract entities. If you can find correspondences between these abstract entities and real objects, then, by analogy, you can start to reason, in this particularly rigorous way, about the real objects. You can develop your reasoning into predictions and test them. But if those predictions fail, it doesn't mean that maths has failed. If the phenomenon is predictable at all, that is equivalent to saying that you just have to find the right maths to describe it, and then you will be able to predict it. So now, turning to the question, the answer must be that any imaginable universe that behaves in a way that is at all regular or predictable is describable by mathematics. That may leave some that are not so describable -- for instance, a universe with an omnipotent deity, such that everything in the universe is directly caused by an arbitrary act of that deity's will. I have read that some orthodox strains of Islam hold that our own universe is of this type, and for that reason disparage science (with its dependence on mathematically reasoned prediction). Let us just say that observation has not yet borne them out. ",

You could try to fix this argument by adding some additional premises that would complete this argument. Here is one candidate set of two premises: Premise 2: Math is a set of consistent rulesPremise 3:  Any possible universe will be describable by a consistent set of rules that exist independently from it. Now the argument is complete, in the sense that the conclusion follows from the three premises, but since we added additional premises, that also opens it up to disagreement by people who do not necessarily accept the additional assumptions (although I would say that even your original premise is by no means universally accepted) ",

            "answer_text": "Let's make some assumptions before we proceed: 1: Mathematics is independent of our physics. In other words, if you reasoned about the same questions with the same axioms and methods of inference, you will come to the same results despite your physical reality. 2: A physical model in the sense that you are talking about is the optimal system of reasoning used to predict and explain (less necessary) phenomenological patterns presented to an observer.  From 2, one quickly realizes that our traditional mathematics is not going to necessarily explain things adequately. Our physical understandings currently rely on the ideas of symmetry exposed in Group Theory and other various modes, as well as decades of experimentation. One could imagine instead of a world derived from symmetry, a world which is mainly computational: a discrete world wherein the laws of physics are based on procedures followed by each entity within it. This type of a world would likely be logically hard to analyze, as often the only way to discover what a program will do is to run it: see the halting problem and Wolfram's concept of irreducible complexity. That being said, we can certainly think of this sort of a universe in a very formal, mathematical framework, though it may end up being far less useful than it is here.  ",

It's a property of this universe that the human brain expresses in symbols and numbers. Even logic, is an evolved cognitive function of the human brain which expresses features of the universe at the scale of dimensions we, humans live in.All of logic breaks down at smaller scales and smaller time scales, for example, when we talk of something like Quantum Physics. In Quantum Physics, a single unique thing can exist at multiple place simultaneously. That defies all logic in the world yet it is true. So our senses of mathematics and logic are just evolved features of the brain that help us navigate the world around us better. They represent features of the universe and the world at the scales we live in. Beyond that, logic and mathematics may both fail. ",

Anything which is provable from a given set of axioms, however, is true in all possible universes (whatever that phrase may happen to describe\u2026). Why is this so? Because, to quote someone very wise whose name escapes me: \u201cAll theorems of logic state the same thing: to wit, nothing.\u201d Any logical theorem is a tautology. That means it is true because of its form, not because of any meaning that can be attributed to any of its components, or the interpretation thereof. This doesn\u2019t make mathematics or logic useless (we already know very well that they\u2019re useful!), but it does mean that we must be careful about what we mean when we ask or answer questions like this. I\u2019m not sure that we know enough to say anything substantial about what is a \u201cpossible universe\u201d, and I\u2019m not sure \u201cmathematically describable\u201d is a well defined term either. I guess it\u2019s possible to claim, and not be claiming too much, that it\u2019s possible to use mathematics to describe the physics of universes other than the one we live in, even if those universes are entirely fictional. After all, the use of mathematics to model the physics of our own universe is a convenient fiction anyway. To quote George Box: \u201cAll models are wrong, but some are useful.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Math logically may exist independently from universe(s), but it may even not exist in the present universe. Math is a human construction based on some assumptions. The assumptions may however be incorrect (or some approximations) for this universe. For example the set of irrationals or the set of the reals may or may not not exist in reality. They exists in math because of our assumption that in-between every two distinct points another one always fits! God knows if this happens in reality, but the evidence at hand shows that it may not! As a result we describe this universe on a corpuscular theory and waveform basis - the two give good descriptions (as in approximates) but they are more or less incompatible\u2026 ",

The language of Math thst we develooed to describe this universe, may or may not be useful in another universe. Probably so, for us, because we made the math, and communicate everything scientific that we understand, by using it.   Imagine Captain Cook discovering Hawaii. They spoke another language but he used English to describe it. ",

            "answer_text": "Mathematically it is in fact structurally foundational. All possible universes are in fact mechanisms that can be modeled using modelling frameworks. The downside is that it cannot model universes extrapolative of mathematics that are non existent within this world or ones that do not extend into the order of the scale of dimensional complexity - ones that are not visible within this dimensional construct or reality - it can model to very high degrees no doubt - but is that the roof? Nope. Abstraction is only a extrapolative design within a confined framework and order - there are very much more higher order mechanisms that are not existent within this dimensional scale. ",

Schrodinger's wave model was rejected as incomplete; not being able to account for quantum-jumps.   Consider this; given that the building blocks of all matter can only be described mathematically, what does that say about the nature of reality? ",

It might not be describable definitely, but there should be a convergent description (much like a convergent series approaching a limit). Any universe should be describable with a complete set of properties and corresponding set of rules/laws. ",
