You see the news that some little girl was assaulted. How can you say that there is no \"evil\"? - -The following passages are from the thoughts of contemporary leaders from Gotama Buddha's time in India more than 2500 years ago. There may be modern philosophy similar to those thoughts. - (............ \"When this was said, Purana Kassapa said to me, 'Great king, in acting or getting others to act, in mutilating or getting others to mutilate, in torturing or getting others to torture, in inflicting sorrow or in getting others to inflict sorrow, in tormenting or getting others to torment, in intimidating or getting others to intimidate, in taking life, taking what is not given, breaking into houses, plundering wealth, committing burglary, ambushing highways, committing adultery, speaking falsehood \u2014 one does no evil. If with a razor-edged disk one were to turn all the living beings on this earth to a single heap of flesh, a single pile of flesh, there would be no evil from that cause, no coming of evil. Even if one were to go along the right bank of the Ganges, killing and getting others to kill, mutilating and getting others to mutilate, torturing and getting others to torture, there would be no evil from that cause, no coming of evil. Even if one were to go along the left bank of the Ganges, giving and getting others to give, making sacrifices and getting others to make sacrifices, there would be no merit from that cause, no coming of merit. Through generosity, self-control, restraint, and truthful speech there is no merit from that cause, no coming of merit.'............ \"'Though one might think, \"Through this morality, this practice, this austerity, or this holy life I will ripen unripened kamma and eliminate ripened kamma whenever touched by it\" \u2014 that is impossible. Pleasure and pain are measured out, the wandering-on is fixed in its limits. There is no shortening or lengthening, no accelerating or decelerating. Just as a ball of string, when thrown, comes to its end simply by unwinding, in the same way, having transmigrated and wandered on, the wise and the foolish alike will put an end to pain.'................ 'Great king, there is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed. There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions. There is no this world, no next world, no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; no priests or contemplatives who, faring rightly and practicing rightly, proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves. A person is a composite of four primary elements. At death, the earth (in the body) returns to and merges with the (external) earth-substance. The fire returns to and merges with the external fire-substance. The liquid returns to and merges with the external liquid-substance. The wind returns to and merges with the external wind-substance. The sense-faculties scatter into space. Four men, with the bier as the fifth, carry the corpse. Its eulogies are sounded only as far as the charnel ground. The bones turn pigeon-colored. The offerings end in ashes. Generosity is taught by idiots. The words of those who speak of existence after death are false, empty chatter. With the break-up of the body, the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated, destroyed. They do not exist after death.'.................. \"'And among them there is no killer nor one who causes killing, no hearer nor one who causes hearing, no cognizer nor one who causes cognition. When one cuts off [another person's] head, there is no one taking anyone's life. It is simply between the seven substances that the sword passes.'from http://tipitaka.wikia.com/wiki/S... - -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, there are good and bad (actions, physically, mentally and verbally) in the world.

An estimated one in five Australians has convict ancestry. In Tasmania, the figure is even higher. In 2009, 74% of Tasmania\u2019s population was estimated to be descended from convicts. A 2001 Victorian parliamentary report on crime in Australia found that Tasmania had the second-lowest crime rate in the nation. - (From Companion to Tasmanian history Between 1803 and 1853 approximately 75,000 convicts served time in Van Diemen's Land. Of these 67,000 were shipped from British and Irish ports and the remainder were either locally convicted, or transported from other British colonies. This represents about 45 percent of all convicts landed in Australia and 15\u201320 percent of all those transported within the British Empire in the period 1615\u20131920.From http://www.utas.edu.au/library/c... ) - (From The story of Australia\u2019s last convicts January 9, 2018The Hougoumont, the last ship to take convicts from the UK to Australia, docked in Fremantle, Western Australia, on January 9, 1868 \u2013 150 years ago. It brought an end to a process which deposited about 168,000 convicted prisoners in Australia after it began in 1788.Convicts had ceased to be sent to New South Wales and Van Diemen\u2019s Land (Tasmania) decades earlier, but Western Australia still wanted convict labour to help with building projects. By the time the Hougoumont landed its shipment of 281 convicts, the Swan River penal colony in Western Australia had been reliant on convict labour for 18 years, and received almost 10,000 male prisoners from Britain.From http://theconversation.com/the-s... ) - (From Stain or badge of honour? Convict heritage inspires mixed feelings June 8, 2015A recent report in Molecular Psychiatry identified a \u201cwarrior gene\u201d connected to criminal behaviour. This inspired renewed speculation that a convict ancestry might make Australians more predisposed to violent crime.This fear of genetic contamination from convict ancestors has existed in Australia since early settlement. Between 1788 and the end of transportation in 1868, around 162,000 convicts were sent to the colonies of New South Wales, Van Diemen\u2019s Land and Western Australia.An estimated one in five Australians has convict ancestry. In Tasmania, the figure is even higher. In 2009, 74% of Tasmania\u2019s population was estimated to be descended from convicts.In 1856, Van Diemen\u2019s Land was renamed Tasmania in an attempt to purge its convict past.And the fear that we might be cursed with a genetic predisposition towards criminal behaviour? A 2001 Victorian parliamentary report on crime in Australia found that, adjusted for population, Tasmania \u2013 with the highest proportion of convict descendants \u2013 had the second-lowest crime rate in the nation.From https://theconversation.com/stai... ) - -So from where do those so-called good and bad behaviors come?? -If all human beings are inherently good, there is no question for inherently good or inherently bad because everyone will observe all human beings as inherently good since young. -If all human beings are inherently bad, there is no question for inherently good or inherently bad because everyone will observe all human beings as inherently bad since young. -So some human beings are inherently good and some human beings are inherently bad because people observe as such. -So what's the cause of inherently good or bad? -It is not genetic because if it is genetic, science will have discovered by now. -It is not genetic because one can observe that both inherently good parents can have inherently bad children. Likewise, both inherently bad parents can have inherently good children. -It is not environment because even the extremely poor parents with extremely bad environment can have inherently good children. Likewise, even the extremely rich family with extremely good environment can have inherently bad children. -But during the individual growth process (after birth), inherently good children are easier to become bad if they meet bad environment and bad influence. Inherently bad children are not easy to become good even if they meet good environment and good influence. -It is easier to become bad during the growth of children because it does not need much effort to do bad things and it needs much effort to do good. -It is harder to become good during the growth of children because it needs much effort to restrain from doing bad. -According to this philosophy, more and more bad people should appear in the world. Nature favors to appear the bad behaviors. If inherently good and inherently bad behaviors appear randomly, people would see inherently good and bad children in one to one ratio (half and half in population) in their childhood before the influence of environment. Or one should see more inherently bad children than good children in their childhood because nature appears to favor bad behaviors. -According to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism (If one accepts Buddhism as truth, not as a religion), human life is hard to get. Those with good behaviors in past life can return to human life if they are not released from cycles of life because human life is one of good destination and one can work hard to release from cycle of life in human life. Those with bad behaviors in past life rarely come back to human life because human life is one of good destination. So if one who has previous life with good behaviors and the other who has previous life with bad behaviors competes for one human life, one who has previous life with good behaviors has more chance to come back to human life again. If he comes back to human life again, he will be inherently good because of previous habits. So according to philosophy of Theravada Buddhism, people will see more inherently good children than inherently bad ones because human life is one of the good destinations. - \u2026\u2026. \"Suppose a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water, and a great crowd of people, gathering & congregating, would pray, praise, & circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart (saying,) 'Rise up, O boulder!
