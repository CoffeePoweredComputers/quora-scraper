            "answer_text": "Plato's ideas sound spooky and odd and unscientific, but, because of the huge influence he has had on the western world view, the theory of forms is basically already in layman's terms for us today. Here is an example: where do right angle triangles come from? You could say we empirically discover them in the world, and there is a certain truth to this, but every \"right-angle triangle\" we find in the world is different, some are made of paper, some are made of empty space between other objects, some are made of concrete, so on an so forth. And, whatsmore, all of these \"real\" right angle triangles aren't \"perfect\" geometric objects, the edge of a building is not a pure 1 dimensional line, it's jagged, a little askew. These triangles are not so perfectly fit to the work of physics and geometry, and measuring them all perfectly will take a life-time.  (lemill.net) But that's no problem, you think, after seeing many triangles we can \"abstract\" a pure right angle triangle from what is essential to all of them, and discard what is idiosyncratic to each. In the end we have a \"pure\" right angle triangle composed of: three zero dimensional points, linked by three one dimensional lines representing the shortest distances between these points, two of which intersect at a perpendicular, to create an angle that is exactly the quarter of the total interior angle of a circle (*edit: Haha, I meant \u201cSquare\u201d). Now, finally, we can do geometry.  (astarmathaandphysics.com) Everything we say in geometry (ie, a^2 = b^2 + c^2) about a right angle triangle applies to all right angle triangles (one's made of paper, or empty space, huge ones and little ones, etc) so in this way there is only one right-angle triangle for the geometrist, and for Plato, of which every instance that can be found in the world is not perfectly representative of, but close enough for us to glimpse this \"perfect geometrist's triangle\" within each one as the form it approximates. Why Plato thinks this \"form\" is the real deal, with the actual triangles in front of us being shadows or copies or phantasms, is simply the observation that in dealing with these triangles in front of us we will be more successful most of the time if we deal with them as though they are that one perfect geometrist's right-angle triangle, rather than studying each individual triangle and its properties in front of us, one by one. We can land (actual) robots on Mars using mathematics. Plato drew from this that mathematics (and it's mode of thinking; forms and so on) is realer than the world itself.  (Andreas Gursky, 99 Cent, 1999) What's funny is the world we live in today where we are completely surrounded by mass produced objects and brands, is far more \"Platonic\" than Plato's Greece. I like Coca-Cola, not this one or that one per se, for, indeed, in my gut I actually believe every drop of Coca-Cola I have consumed over the last 30 years is identical. Where is the Coca-Cola I love? In a recipe or a factory process that everywhere in the world is made the same in order for customers to not \"think\" about the fact it is produced. And, just so the Platonic edge is not lost on us, Coca-Cola goes and calls itself \"The Real Thing\".  (Andy Warhol, Green Coca-Cola Bottles, 1962) In our way of being consumers we are fundamentally Platonists, we purchase forms, not objects. We don't deal with the crap that we buy as though it is all a jumble of individual, idiosyncratic, objects (even though it obviously is) but we deal with them as though they are some spooky, perfect forms; we're horrified when our Iphones do something crazy of which there are no reports on the internet, it suddenly breaks our fantasy that the phone was a perfect, ghostly form, not a real gritty object... (I knew a guy once that had a list of IKEA furniture. Whenever he moved to a new country he would just order the exact same 17 or so pieces of furniture, as it was cheaper than transporting the \"actual\" items from country to country, but he liked the furniture so wanted to keep it, so he just rebought it, all exactly the same.) The (Nietzschean) critique of Platonism affirms difference against this singularity of the form that turns all of the individual idiosyncrasies into \"aberrations\". It acknowledges the incredible success of physics, but finds an issue with how easily we ignore (deny) difference in our thinking in all things, and treat the world as though it already is the world of forms, discounting the overwhelming diversity and multiplicity as \"inessential\".  (Emil Danielsen, Blogspot)  (Andreas Gursky, Chicago Board of Trade II, 1999) Think of how standardized testing in Schools creates the singular form of the \"ideal student\" against which any deviations are seen as \"unwanted aberration\" by the logic of the test, for example. Our fascination with standardized testing, and quality assurance for that matter (so neat, so clean, so convenient, so efficient) and our inability to think of an alternative (everything else would be so chaotic and messy, idiosyncratic and unfair) speaks to the little iddy-biddy Platonists in us... For Nietzsche, the denial of difference in favor of the singular, the same, amounts to a denial of life itself, which he diagnoses as coming from a place of vengeance and spite, in particular Socrates' vengeance and spite. -EditBut, keep in mind that Plato was a philosopher, not a dogmatist. The critique of this mode of thinking (about the doctrine of forms) is already present in Plato himself, most notably in the Parmenides. Tom McFarlane has already given a nice overview of this aspect of self-critique by Plato present in this text in his answer to this question: What is a form in Plato's metaphysical theory? So Ill just direct you there. ",

            "answer_text": "In the conventional presentation of Plato's theory of forms, a form is a pattern that is common to various specific objects of the same kind. For example, basket balls, base balls, soccer balls, and golf balls all share in the common property of being balls. Or, to put it in Plato's terms, these specific objects all participate in the abstract form of a ball. Or, consider the example of a carpenter who assembles several wooden beams to form a triangle. This wooden triangle is not a perfect mathematical triangle. But it imperfectly resembles the perfect form of a triangle. And it is by virtue of this resemblance that we recognize the wooden triangle as a triangle. So, we can only experience such concrete triangles as such by virtue of there being an abstract form of a triangle. In this sense, the form is more fundamental than its concrete instances. Or, consider a particular carbon atom. We recognize it as a carbon atom because it shares in the abstract definition, or form, of a carbon atom: an arrangement of 6 protons and a number of neutrons (6, 7 or 8) in a nucleus, surrounded by 6 electrons.  That's the basic idea of Plato's theory of forms. Because the forms are more fundamental than their instances, they are considered more real by Plato. The abstract forms are perfect and ideal, whereas their sensible instances are imperfect. As a result of this distinction, Plato's theory is commonly understood as a dualistic theory that sets the world of abstract forms apart from the sensible world of experience.  But it is important to note that Plato himself criticizes this naive understanding of the theory of forms in his Parmenides dialog. For more on that, see my answer to Are ideal objects/Platonic realism real? ",

            "answer_text": "Enough people have mentioned the analogy of the cave (though without actually explaining the point- that those who have seen the light must come back and free the rest) that I will let it be. Instead, let's explore what a form is. Imagine an object, any object. Let's take a stool. Does it have three legs or four legs? How tall is it? Is it round or square?  These are all questions about that stool. But despite the option between a short, four-legged, wooden stool and a very tall three-legged metal one, they are both still stools. Why? This is what Plato was trying to answer. His idea of forms was that somewhere, there must be a \"guidebook\" for what a \"stool\" is. He put it in the mind of what he called \"the demiurge.\" The demiurge was the being that created the universe. Everything that exists exsists in its purest, most complete form in the mind of the demiurge. What we can imagine are mere shadows of the form, and what we create are shadows of our imagination. So there are three levels of being in Platonic thought.1. Form2. Imagination3. Created Plato's theory of forms is actually incredibly interesting and a useful (if not necessarily true, that's up for debate) answer to a fundamental question of humanity. ",

            "answer_text": "It is not clear that Plato has a single \u201ctheory of forms.\u201d In fact, I think it is fairly clear that he did not have such a theory, or at least that no such theory is set forth in the dialogues he left. Some scholars think that Plato had \u201cesoteric\u201d teachings that were not put into writing but were taught in his school, the Academy. There are various approaches to a metaphysical account of the world that are proposed by different characters in the Platonic dialogues. Most people replying to a question like this one extract proposed theories from dialogues and present them as Platonic doctrines, or teachings. This procedure misunderstands the dialogue form. My way of reading Plato corresponds, generally speaking, to a school of Platonic interpretation called \u201cStraussian,\u201d named after Leo Strauss, who taught a version or versions of this method. One has to view an argument in its dramatic context and try to evaluate what the purpose of a given argument is, within that dramatic context. One has to be aware at all times that Plato does not speak in his own voice in the dialogues and that even arguments propounded by the Platonic Socrates may have been regarded by Plato himself as unconvincing or specious. If Plato had a \u201ctheory of forms,\u201d it is likely to have been very abstract. The general idea is that there must be principles of some kind that are prior to the world as we perceive it and that make it possible for our perceived world to be intelligible, to the extent that it is intelligible. I don\u2019t put much stock in particular versions of the theory, such as that there is an ideal form of a bed, as in Book X of \u201cThe Republic.\u201d This is a simple example used for didactic purposes. Put very generally, the idea is that the world we inhabit conforms to logical principles that are prior to and beyond the material universe. If there were to be true and stable knowledge, it would consist in being able to see these logical principles. I would like readers to view my music video, \u201cPhilosopher\u2019s Funk,\u201d in which I make a playful reference to the general theory of Platonic interpretation that I am propounding here. The particular lyric is a reference to dialogues like \u201cThe Sophist\u201d and \u201cPhilebus.\u201d Plato himself wrote very playfully at times, it is important to understand that. I hasten to add that what I am saying here is not widely accepted in Platonic scholarship. I tried to illustrate how this interpretive method works in my dissertation, \u201cDiaeresis and Myth in Plato\u2019s Statesman,\u201d Vandenhoeek and Ruprecht, 1987, and have not worked seriously on Plato since that dissertation was published. Although I have been told over the years that more scholars were being converted to a way of reading Plato that is closer to my own, I\u2019m not sure how true that is.  ",

And they classified some thing-a-ma-jigs the same as some other things as the \u201csame kind of thing: good for making sparks for making a fire. That is, pragmatically, according to our intents and usages. But a hitch appeared: some things that we called \u201csame\u201d were merely similar as we found out in practice. We wanted a system of classification of individual items which, at first seemed to be \u201cthe same KIND of thing but pragmatics eventually showed they weren\u2019t. So\u2026skipping some years\u2026we made(for example) a chart and called it the Periodic Table of Elements. And individual entries were carefully distinguished into kinds/types of things. E.G. This is lithium, that is sodium. Such things had the same Form had the same \u201cstructure/ essence even if there were always differences from one instance of a similar to another instance. (But slow down here\u2026!) We extrapolated this kind of classifying generally and even, in many cases, universally. We weren\u2019t (usually) too silly or stupid about this. And we knew any particular thing-a-ma-jig wouldn\u2019t be precisely like other items that (even on repeated examinations) were slightly different one from another. We weren\u2019t stupid and said there must be some deeper cause that produces realities that had similarities to others but no two items were in every detail similar. So we postulated one kind of causal agent for each of the similars which itself was NOT just another similar but the abiding Cause transcending the whole heap of similars but not a member of that heap itself. So for instance, we insisted (to cut this short) that Humanness made human babies with the participating causes of Woman and Man. ",

Everything in our world is a copy or attempt to represent a form.  The forms are archetypes and characteristics:  blackness, roundness, softness, goodness, hardness, greenness, triangle-ness, chair-ness etc. So, for example, the perfect form of a sphere is in this other reality.  In our world we have but copies that don't quite hit perfection - a ball or a planet. Plato used an example of people in a cave, watching shadows that are being cast by a puppet show that they can't see.  The people look at the shadows and interpret them to be the objects the puppeteer is manipulating.  So, in our world, we look at an orange and see a sphere.  But the true sphere only exists in the other realm. Our realm is subjective.  The other realm is objective. It is believed that this Greek concept of another realm of perfection, above our own, eternal, and unchanging was the inspiration for the Christian concept of Heaven. ",

            "answer_text": "Layman\u2019s terms here you are: Plato believes that human being lives in a computer simulation. But he hasn\u2019t seen any computer simulation, so his description of the concept sounds a little bit weird to us. But if you compare his language to computer terminology, almost everything can find a nice analogue. For instance, he believes that our real world is merely a reflection of the Forms (computer programs); the forms exist in a parallel world (hard drive) that we (NPC in a computer game) can never get access to and can never understand.

            "answer_text": "Plato was in search of right knowledge but he found that all the thing in this world are continuously changing. A contingent thing can't be the source of our knowledge. So he postulated that there is another world over and above this world where the true idea ( also called as form) exist. These ideas/forms are real source of knowledge. In this world the idea exist in its pure form. Eg Cowness is the idea in cow, it's the central idea responsible for a thing to become a cow. Similar manliness, horseness, etc which are the central idea for making a thing into a particular thing is called idea or forms and they all exist in another world called the world of ideas. So by theory of idea he mean that the central concept of all empirical things in this world are the ideas and we should try to strive for them. ",

            "answer_text": "So much of science makes use of Platonic Forms, although many scientists would have an initial objection to that statement. But consider: why don\u2019t, say hens sometimes give birth to, say, dogs (even if raped by a dog\u2014or, if you like, impregnated in a lab with dog sperm)? The answer the scientist might give is in terms of the 2 KINDS of DNA involved and these in terms of the molecular structures (aka \u201cforms\u201d). In fact, Plato tries on a sequence of forms (note lower case) constituting a human being (or at least human body\u2014let\u2019s be cautious here): starting with triangle to which supervene pentagons \u2026. Of course, Plato would not preference reductionism over supervenience as we find in so much thinking these days, but the so-called Platonic Theory of Forms is really not totally alien to contemporary intellection \u2014 at least as a starting point toward wrestling with what Plato was suggesting.

The same principle applies to perfect Truth, Beauty, Justice and Goodness: we have innate standards of perfection for these against which we may judge (and find falling short) any actual instance in the material world. The most important conclusions for Plato are moral: we have in innate and infallible sense of Goodness, by which we can judge moral value in all circumstances. That is a hugely important conclusion!
