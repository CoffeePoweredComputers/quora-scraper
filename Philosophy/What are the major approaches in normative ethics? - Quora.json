            "answer_text": "Moral realism is the only valid and rational approach in considering normative ethics. On what is this rightness or wrongness founded? Nothing? Is it just a matter of the biggest mob or the loudest voice, where it All depends on how you\u2019re raised It all depends on what is praised What\u2019s right today is wrong tomorrow Joy in France is England\u2019s sorrow It all depends on point of view Australia or Timbuktu In Rome do as Romans do If taste just happen to agree Then you have morality When there are conflicting trends It all depends, it all depends If you say everyone has a right to their opinion, I must ask: why? Even that is a moral rule. As the father of two boys, I also see them display an inherent sense of justice and to the point where if there is a piece of cake left, I have one kid cut the cake and the other pick the first piece, and there\u2019s barely a crumb of difference between the two pieces. Evidence that true moral statements exist can be even seen from those who argue for moral relativism on one hand and then on the other make normative claims\u2014 that abortion on demand is right or wrong, that the war in Iraq is right or wrong, that capital punishment is right or wrong, and so on. Shakespeare\u2019s Shylock in The Merchant of Venice gives a proof that moral universality resides in our common physical constitution: \u201cIf you prick me, do I not bleed? If you tickle me, do I not laugh? If you poison me, do I not die?\" It is this shared physicality and emotionality that is my reply in the negative to the question: how can you have moral law without a lawgiver? That the human condition in every land and clime is made up of people that are essentially the same mix of people you find everywhere suggests to me that there might be a universality of moral values, once we strip away the layers of culture. I understand normative ethics to be the study of what makes an action right or wrong. Thus, the motivation behind that action\u2014 selflessness or selfishness\u2014 is irrelevant. What is relevant is that the behavior\u2014 not the thought that animates that behavior\u2014 is ethical. Also, any such action must be rational, so long as it is predicated with thought, or, to use a philosophical expression, an a priori. That principle might be \"does it pay\" (pragmatism) or \"the greatest good for the greatest number\" (utilitarianism) or \"do your duty for the Dear Leader\" (the leadership principle). So long as actions coherently derive from such principles, such an action would be both ethical and rational by definition. Is it possible to construct a meta-ethics that transcends such deductions? I find the deontological ethics of Kant the most persuasive, as it attempts to cast actions as inherently good or bad, based on a realistic picture of humans as autonomous, freedom-seeking, and intentional. This is it. You are there. It doesn't really matter what you like or don't like. Kantian ethics just treats morality as brutally and cold-hearted as reality treats the law of gravity. It doesn't matter if it is Mother Teresa or Charles Manson that is dying from falling off a cliff. Physics speaks the truth about the matter, either way. So, too, it doesn't matter if it is Mother Teresa or Charles Manson that is evil, ethics tells us the truth, either way. Reason holds no particular sentiment in favor of Mother Teresa or Charles Manson. It doesn't matter how much \"it pays.\" It doesn't matter how many \"people benefit from it.\" Your FEELINGS do not matter. YOU do not matter. There is ONE cold-hearted REALITY that is the sum-total of the TRUTH of morality. It is cold, and it is hard, and if you cannot handle it, then go off and study anthropology. There is plenty in the world that will never ask you to confront this. Do something else. ",

            "answer_text": "\u2018Normative ethics\u2019 really means \u2018ethics that define what is morally right and wrong\u2019, or \u2018applied ethics\u2019, in other words \u2018ethics\u2019. The term \u2018normative ethics\u2019 only exists to distinguish ethics from metaethical theories - theories about moral/ethical statements and systems - what makes actions right or wrong. So, the major approaches in normative ethics are the major approaches in real-world ethics. The two main approaches are deontological and consequentialist. ",
