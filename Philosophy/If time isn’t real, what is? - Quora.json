            "answer_text": "It is not the only thing that is not real. Time proves nothing but the quantum world is real. Everything else is an illusion. Think about it. The future is not here yet and the past no longer exists. We only exist in the present which is a one dimensional line. If the past still existed then why do we need memory? Why do we need to record what was in the past if it still existed. Since we exist in a one dimensional time space then we don\u2019t exist at all so we are an illusion . ",

            "answer_text": "Oh time is definitely real, it just doesn't exist. This might sound like a contradiction, but it's not. Let me use an analogy. How much does motion weigh? How much motion fits in a coffee cup? You can't touch motion. It has no tangible existence, yet, things move. We can measure how far things move. Motion is real. Time, is temporal motion. As Einstein said, \u201cTime is what clocks measure.\u201d. We use clocks to measure how far things time through the temporal dimension, exactly the same way we use rulers to measure how far things move through the spatial dimension. Everything in the universe is constantly in temporal motion. Timing from one moment to the next. As we time, we change our physical location and we get older/decay. As our consciousness progresses from one moment to the next, we perceive changes occurring around us and to us. This is how we subjectively experience time passing. It's not time that is flowing because time doesn't exist. We experience time flowing because we are flowing through the temporal dimension. Not flowing through time! Time doesn't exist, but it is real. ",
