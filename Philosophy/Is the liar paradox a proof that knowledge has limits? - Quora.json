            "answer_text": "No. It\u2019s an indication of the problems of language and that not all statements are true or false (even if it appears that they should be). There are a bunch of variations of the liar paradox. Perhaps the \u201ctightest\u201d is This statement is false. But if it\u2019s false, it\u2019s true and if it\u2019s true, it\u2019s false. Is this really a \u201cparadox\u201d? No. It\u2019s just that the statement is meaningless. Another version is All Cretans always lie. I am a Cretan. Is this true or false? I\u2019d say the two are just incompatible. But that \u201cknowledge has limits\u201d is clear from other things. Every time we learn something new, we learn more things that we don\u2019t know. For example, before we knew light had a speed, we didn\u2019t wonder about what its slowest possible speed was (yes, I know, it is constant in a vacuum, but it is not constant outside of a vacuum). No one, 100 years ago, wondered about how quantum computing could work, or about how to best encrypt e-mail. ",

Just as arithmetic has operations like dividing by zero that make no sense, logic also has operations that make no sense. \u201cThis statement is false\u201d is a prohibited statement just as 3/0 is a prohibited expression. Self-referential statements like \u201cthis statement is true\u201d and \u201cthis statement is false\u201d should be avoided. The first is meaningless and the second is impossible.
