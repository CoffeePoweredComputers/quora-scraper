            "answer_text": "The universe is, topologically, an N-dimensional hypersphere. To an observer in N dimensions, the universe does have a centre. To an observer of fewer dimensions, a centre is theoretically provable but you cannot point in that direction. Ok, I'm going to have to take a few posters to task here. I really don't like doing this, but it's important people understand the science correctly. The Big Bang. It existed but there was no T=0 in the regular sense. As you go further back in time, space is bent by increasing gravity but so is time. As a result, if you draw a spacetime cone (a traditional form of diagram), you will find that it does not start at a point but a parabola. If you continued the sides of the cone, they'd actually continue into imaginary spacetime. There is therefore no singularity, which is a good thing as singularities are a major headache. Because the gradient at the origin is zero, with respect to time, there is no moment of creation. Here's the thing, though. Had time not bent, you would have a singularity. It would be a region of space measuring one Planck length on a side. It cannot strictly be zero size because nothing can be smaller than a Planck length. It is not an infinite number of overlapping points (you're not allowed infinities and it violates the maximum permissible information density to have anything other than a single point of space there). Can you create space, then? Yes, no and no. Yes, you create 3-space as the region expands, in the sense that there are more locations an object can be. No, in that you cannot create or destroy information, that is the only real conservation law. All others are manifestations under specific conditions. Creating space would involve creating information. The second no is for topological reasons, a point in N-space can be stretched, folded and contorted (but not cut) into whatever shape you like of whatever size you like, but it is still homologous to the original point. You haven't really changed it. However, to an observer in 4-space, none of that is relevant. The universe is a static object of finite size and to talk of it beginning or ending would seem nuts. If mathematical reality (the idea that information is all that exists) is true then both space and time are properties and have no independent existence. The universe as a balloon. Technically, it has to be regarded as a bubble, not standalone but in a foam. However, this isn't optional. Whether examining inflation theory, very large scale structures, the question of whether expansion will result in a \"big rip\" or oblivion, string theory and supergravity, or any other such questions, a foam multiverse is the only recognized solution that avoids impossible results. By treating the universe as a bubble in foam, you can simultaneously explain why the cosmological principle does not hold up at large scales, why the universe is expanding (there is no such thing as dark matter, it's a placeholder for forces that violate the standard model) and why things can move on the surface with motion independent of the surface itself (films are interesting things). However, at the large scale of superclusters, voids and great walls, the relative motion of stars and galaxies is insignificant and can be treated as zero. This reduces the bubble to the balloon model. ",

            "answer_text": "Case 1: The Observable Universe We are, by definition, at the very center of our observable universe. However, an alien species on a planet one billion light years away from us is at the center of their observable universe, which is very different from ours. Wherever you go, you will be at the center of your observable universe, because the observable universe is the part of the universe that you can see, and the light from all the stars and galaxies on the edge of the observable universe takes the same time to get to you, no matter which direction it came from. So you can imagine the observable universe as a sphere (or ball) that is centered on you and follows you wherever you go. However, there is nothing special about you specifically; anyone else in the universe experiences the same thing. Case 2: The Entire Universe It should be stressed that in contrast to the observable universe, the entire universe - all of it, including the parts that lie far beyond our observable universe - does not have a center. Here are two very common misconceptions that lead people to believe that the universe has a center. I hope that correcting these misconceptions will make it clearer why the universe does not have a center. The \"Singularity = Single Point\" Misconception It is a common misconception that the universe was originally a single point. It is crucial to correct that misconception. There is an infinite number of points in space at any given time. As the universe expands, we measure the distances between any two points to be larger than they were before. If we extrapolate this back in time, we find that the distances between any two points shrink. If we continue this process naively, we eventually find that far enough in the past, the distance between any two points is exactly zero. This is the infamous \"singularity\" of the big bang. Now, it's important to understand that in this process, points are not created or destroyed. Only the distances between them change. So even if there really was a singularity (which is a matter of debate), it's incorrect to say that \"the universe started as a single point and then expanded\". The correct statement is: \"The universe started in a state where the distance between any two points was zero, but there was still an infinite number of points. Then the distance between any two points started to increase.\" This means that there is no \"special\" point where the singularity happened. All of the points in our universe today were once part of the singularity. If no point is special, then no point can be the \"center\" of the universe. The source of this misconception is probably the description of the big bang in popular science publications as \"an explosion\". This seems appropriate, because it's called the big bang, right? Well, the name is unfortunate, but we're stuck with it. When most people imagine the big bang, they imagine a single point \"exploding\" and expanding. But wait a minute... Expanding into what? There's nothing \"outside\" of the universe for the universe to expand \"into\". This is a source of confusion for many people, and in fact many questions on Quora reflect this confusion. Misunderstanding The \"Balloon Analogy\" Another \"crime\" of popular science is the infamous \"balloon analogy\". If the expanding universe is like an inflating balloon then the center of the universe is at the center of the balloon, right..?  No! It's common to misunderstand the balloon analogy and imagine that the universe is the entire balloon (including the air inside). This balloon does have a center, obviously, but it is not the appropriate analogy. Instead, the correct analogy is to imagine that the universe is only the surface of the balloon. You completely ignore the air inside or outside the balloon. Now mark points on the surface of a deflated balloon and start inflating the balloon. The distance between any two points on the surface of the balloon will increase. However, the surface of the balloon does not have a center. If you look at a particular point on the surface while the balloon is being inflated, it seems like all other points are moving away from it. Is this point the center? No - since this is also true for any other point! So either all points are the center, or none of them. The same goes for the expanding universe: the surface of the balloon represents all of space, and points on the surface represent galaxies. See also: Was the universe infinite in space and time at the moment of the Big Bang? If not, when did it become infinite?Since all galaxies are moving away from us, is it possible to construct a cosmological model that puts us at the center of the universe, or the original point of the Big Bang?",

It has a center, but that center lies 13.58 Billion light years away (perpendicularly to our 3D space). That said, we are very close to ONE of the centers of the acoustic waves that seeded our Universe. SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) Orange Pie plot gives you a hint of that.  In the top part of the figure above, one can see what seems to be waves. This is a flattened and unflattering (the Universe backside looks way too big) view of the Universe.

AT THIS TIME, THE CONCLUSIONS CANNOT BE SUPPORTED BY THE DATA! THE ANALYSIS WILL BE KEPT HERE BECAUSE IT IS THE CORRECT ANALYSIS JUST WITH THE WRONG DATA. SDSS had this data for 10 years, but their analysis have been constrained by Ideology. The Ideology that we live in a 4D Spacetime and that Copernicus was always right..:) Copernicus enunciated the Copernican Hypothesis, which is the recognition of our \u201cEarth\u201d ordinary nature. That was a reaction against Religion. Religion preys on our Narcissism and Vanity, so it always place us in a special place. It seems that neither one of them were correct. In a 4D Spacetime where we don\u2019t live in a special place, the Universe is Uniform - translationally invariant. Inflation Theory has no mechanism to make our corner of the woods, Special..:) It turned out that our Corner of the Woods is special. The reason is because, our region is likely to be either more stable (less dense and so less prone to galactic collisions) or less stable (more dense and so with higher probability of having planets). Which one depends on precise modeling of galactic collisions and we don\u2019t know yet how that models would work, nor do we have a very precise view of our Universe (despite of the efforts of SDSS). Our Corner of the Woods is Special Our place is special\u2026 We are close to the center of the footprint of an Neutronium Acoustic Oscillation! At the beginning of the Universe Cycle, as soon as the Universe started expanding, Neutrons became free and released the energy of 1E21 Supernovae explosions. That release of energy wasn\u2019t Uniform and drove acoustic oscillations (density oscillations). It just happened that we are close to ONE of the centers of those oscillations! These oscillations undermine General Relativity and its 4D Spacetime and takes the air of the Copernican Hypothesis. Unfortunately, our special place is not because we are special..:) ################################################ The Evidence in the SDSS BOSS datasets Below is the video showing not only the Hypergeometrical Universe Theory Cosmogenesis theory but also the 3D Map of the Current Universe (Universe at the current Absolute Time).

In fact, not only do we not know the answers to many of these questiuons, but we haven\u2019t even thought of many of the possible answer choices or even the questions themselves. Just a sliver . . . Let\u2019s start with what a \u201ccenter\u201d is. In three dimensional space, a center is pretty straightforward. Even if you assume there are more dimensions or fewer, you can still kindof extrapolate and find some kind of midpoint along every axis. But what happens if the universe is curved, or doughnut shaped? What happens if the universe consists of a series of parallel universes? What happens if the universe is one of a series of parallel universes that is separate somehow from a bunch of other clusters of parallel universes? What happens if the universe is a bunch of polka-dots strewn throughout an infinite continuum, each of which has a random and differing number of dimensions and physical properties? We literally don\u2019t know. We can observe this tiny sliver of a space-time continuum, and we make an insane number of assumtions, and we still yield hypotheses as varied as an arbitrary collection of Mezozoic-era fossils. Let\u2019s move on to some open questions. What are the laws of physics that we don\u2019t know yet? What are the smallest particles \u2014 really \u2014 and how do they work? How do the different forces work? Why does space-time follow rules to begin with? Do things actually follow rules? How much of what we perceive represents actual attributes of reality? What\u2019s going on outside of the observable universe? What\u2019s going on on other inhabitable planets that could theoretically bear life? Do the rules change over time? Are the rules consistent across all of existence? Is all of existence even connected? Why is there existence in the first place? What are the overarching rules that govern reality that are more fundamental than the operational rules that we can observe? Are there any such overarching rules? Do we even exist? Is sentience illusory? Even if \u201cI\u201d am actually sentient, does that really mean that other \u201capparently\u201d sentient creatures are actually sentient? I\u2019m sorry to get so off-topic with the existential questions, but you really can\u2019t ask an absolute question about the nature of the universe that depends on knowledge of the big picture without implicitly soliciting a reminder of the extent to which we lack even the pretense of actual knowledge about the big picture.

            "answer_text": "Assume big bang theory is true and that it took place about 20 billion years ago. Let's look with our very strong radio telescope at some point in the sky, about 20 billion light years far away. We receive radio signals that are 20 billion years of age, thus hearing at some kind of big bang overtone. In other words, looking too far away we are facing the big bang phenomenon itself, or we could say that we are looking at the \"center\" of the universe, if so said that the \"center\" of the universe is where and when the big bang took place. Now, let's turn our telescope to a different direction in the sky and focus on another far distant point. We, again, receive signals from the big bang, that is, we are facing the big bang once again; that's true for every direction in the sky, so we could say that the \"center\" of the universe may be spread all around us (\"us\" means the observer), actually a \"center\" point being \"stretched\" allover a sphere of 20 billion light years radius. If we could depict this \"center\" notion as a football ball, imagine turning the ball's exterior skin inside out through the tiny valve hole, encapsulating all the \"outside\" universe inside the ball, having each point still facing the polygons of the ball's former external surface, but now from an \"internal\" point of view. In other words, the \"center\" of the universe may somehow encapsulate the universe itself. Putting gravity in the game, we may further assume that everything is pulled towards that \"center\", which may be an explanation for the galaxies seem to travel away from us and from one another, as anything affected by gravitational fields -from the smallest particles through stars, galaxies, galaxy clusters and superclusters- is pulled towards that \"center\", thus towards the very \"edge\" of the sky dome in all directions. The same must be true for any point of view, for every observer in the universe, leading to a trully weird situation.

            "answer_text": "I would say that the center of the universe is everywhere and all times and all dimensions without any exceptions. I think everything is one point only. A point with no time or space or dimensions of any kind. So in other words everything and nothing. So if I wonder what is the real the everything or the nothing I think I would say that they are both different ways of looking at the same thing. Now I see that physicists are saying something that seems similar to me. I had never heard the official version. I just saw it intuitively and based on the ancient belief that nothing becomes everything before time or space exists. So since it is before time or space it can\u2019t come or go; it must be the same as it always was; just a point with no dimensions. So therefore everything is still that same, the only point. All points in time and space and any other dimension are that same one point. So they seem to be incongruous but they must be just two different ways of looking at the same thing. One view is to see one point that is before time and space and the other view is to look at everything that has ever or will ever exist. Both the same thing. You could argue about whether one point is real or unreal but since everything is that point maybe you could argue whether anything is real or unreal but what difference does it make? It is certainly real enough for me. The ancient belief I read is that what was unreal becomes real before time or space or any other dimension. So it is not in the past present or future and it isn\u2019t here or somewhere else. There is only one point and it doesn\u2019t have a location in time or space or anything. But that means it doesn\u2019t have a not location either. Location is a term that doesn\u2019t apply to it. So the universe was not created in the past. The moment of creation is only one moment. We are in that moment. The only moment that ever was or ever will be. Another way of looking at it is that if one point has no time or space or dimension neither do any of the others. That is to say that points don\u2019t actually exist in time and space or in the universe in other words. They exist as words in our mouths but not as part of the universe. So we can talk about infinite points moving apart from each other but they don\u2019t really exist. All points are only one point and it is not part of the universe. Since the point is nothing it can\u2019t exist in the universe. So what ever you are doing now or at any time past or future this is the creation we are now experiencing. It is happening at this point that never begins or ends. I don\u2019t know what the big bang is but it sounds like it is not the creation specifically because the creation is everything. ",

            "answer_text": "Bear strongly in mind that people who are answering this question are most commonly *projecting* the current consensus for the correct cosmological model rather than anything that has been definitively established empirically or via a final theory. For all anyone really *knows*\u2026 the universe is finite and there is a central point, the infinite universe model is just that\u2026 a model, albeit a reflection of the consensus assumption. There actually is direct observational evidence *for* an Earth centered universe but scientists don\u2019t often admit this for fear of creationist organizations like the ones who made the video, \u201cThe Principle\u201d, (look them up and you will see that they are using the same observation first discovered by WMAP and later confirmed by two subsequent experiments including the Planck mission). Scientists typically only discuss this physics when they think that they have something that refutes or dilutes the significance of the observation that was first discussed in a public forum at CERN, and even then they speak in obscure terms that don\u2019t directly address the observation itself. In fact, there are many relevant scientists who are completely unaware of the observation because nobody talks about it unless they are forced into a position where they only attempt to refute it, rather than to investigate the potential significance. For example, we already have other evidence for a cosmological scale connection between the structure of the universe and our \u201cposition\u201d in the universe in the form of a bio-oriented cosmological principle that is known as the anthropic principle, so this should have set off alarm bells as independently derived supporting evidence for a life-centered cosmological principle and a flurry of papers should have followed. But it\u2019s a scientific observation that is doomed and disdained thanks to the unscientific bias or Copernicanism that defines the ideology of the vast majority of physicists\u2026 so this will likely never happen unless somebody can write down a complete and testable theory of everything that requires the observed model.

            "answer_text": "There is no centre of the universe! According to the standard theories of cosmology, the universe started with a \"Big Bang\" about 14 thousand million years ago and has been expanding ever since. Yet there is no centre to the expansion; it is the same everywhere. The Big Bang should not be visualised as an ordinary explosion. The universe is not expanding out from a centre into space; rather, the whole universe is expanding and it is doing so equally at all places, as far as we can tell. In 1929 Edwin Hubble announced that he had measured the speed of galaxies at different distances from us, and had discovered that the farther they were, the faster they were receding. This might suggest that we are at the centre of the expanding universe, but in fact if the universe is expanding uniformly according to Hubble's law, then it will appear to do so from any vantage point. If we see a galaxy B receding from us at 10,000 km/s, an alien in galaxy B will see our galaxy A receding from it at 10,000 km/s in the opposite direction. Another galaxy C twice as far away in the same direction as B will be seen by us as receding at 20,000 km/s. The alien will see it receding at 10,000 km/s:               A              B             C\u00a0From A         0 km/s    10,000 km/s   20,000 km/s\u00a0From B   -10,000 km/s         0 km/s   10,000 km/s\u00a0So from the point of view of the alien at B, everything is expanding away from it, whichever direction it looks in, just the same as it does for us. The Famous Balloon Analogy A good way to help visualise the expanding universe is to compare space with the surface of an expanding balloon. This analogy was used by Arthur Eddington as early as 1933 in his book The Expanding Universe. It was also used by Fred Hoyle in the 1960 edition of his popular book The Nature of the Universe. Hoyle wrote \"My non-mathematical friends often tell me that they find it difficult to picture this expansion. Short of using a lot of mathematics I cannot do better than use the analogy of a balloon with a large number of dots marked on its surface. If the balloon is blown up the distances between the dots increase in the same way as the distances between the galaxies.\" The balloon analogy is very good but needs to be understood properly\u2014otherwise it can cause more confusion. As Hoyle said, \"There are several important respects in which it is definitely misleading.\" It is important to appreciate that three-dimensional space is to be compared with the two-dimensional surface of the balloon. The surface is homogeneous with no point that should be picked out as the centre. The centre of the balloon itself is not on the surface, and should not be thought of as the centre of the universe. If it helps, you can think of the radial direction in the balloon as time. This was what Hoyle suggested, but it can also be confusing. It is better to regard points off the surface as not being part of the universe at all. As Gauss discovered at the beginning of the 19 th century, properties of space such as curvature can be described in terms of intrinsic quantities that can be measured without needing to think about what it is curving in. So space can be curved without there being any other dimensions \"outside\". Gauss even tried to determine the curvature of space by measuring the angles of a large triangle between three hill tops. When thinking about the balloon analogy you must remember that. . . The 2-dimensional surface of the balloon is analogous to the 3 dimensions of space.The 3-dimensional space in which the balloon is embedded is not analogous to any higher dimensional physical space.The centre of the balloon does not correspond to anything physical.The universe may be finite in size and growing like the surface of an expanding balloon, but it could also be infinite.Galaxies move apart like points on the expanding balloon, but the galaxies themselves do not expand because they are gravitationally bound.... but if the Big Bang was an explosion In a conventional explosion, material expands out from a central point. A short moment after the explosion starts, the centre will be the hottest point. Later there will be a spherical shell of material expanding away from the centre until gravity brings it back down to Earth. The Big Bang\u2014as far as we understand it\u2014was not an explosion like that at all. It was an explosion of space, not an explosion in space. According to the standard models there was no space and time before the Big Bang. There was not even a \"before\" to speak of. So, the Big Bang was very different from any explosion we are accustomed to and it does not need to have a central point. If the Big Bang were an ordinary explosion in an already existing space, we would be able to look out and see the expanding edge of the explosion with empty space beyond. Instead, we see back towards the Big Bang itself and detect a faint background glow from the hot primordial gases of the early universe. This \"cosmic microwave background radiation\" is uniform in all directions. This tells us that it is not matter that is expanding outwards from a point, but rather it is space itself that expands evenly. It is important to stress that other observations support the view that there is no centre to the universe, at least insofar as observations can reach. The fact that the universe is expanding uniformly would not rule out the possibility that there is some denser, hotter place that might be called the centre, but careful studies of the distribution and motion of galaxies confirm that it is homogeneous on the largest scales we can see, with no sign of a special point to call the centre. The cosmological principle The idea that the universe should be uniform (homogeneous and isotropic) over very large scales was introduced as the \"cosmological principle\" by Arthur Milne in 1933. Not long before that, it had been argued by some astronomers that the universe consisted of just our galaxy, and the centre of the Milky Way would have been the centre of the universe. Hubble put an end to that debate in 1924 when he showed that other galaxies exist outside our own. Despite the discovery of a great deal of structure in the distribution of the galaxies, most cosmologists still hold to the cosmological principle either for philosophical reasons or because it is a useful working hypothesis that no observation has yet contradicted. Nevertheless, our view of the universe is limited by the speed of light and the finite time since the Big Bang. The observable part is very large, but it is probably very small compared to the whole universe, which may even be infinite. We have no way of knowing what the shape of the universe is beyond the observable horizon, and no way of knowing whether the cosmological principle has any validity on the largest distance scales possible. In 1927 Georges Lema\ufffdtre found solutions of Einstein's equations of general relativity in which space expands. He went on to propose the Big Bang theory with those solutions as a model of the expanding universe. The best known class of solutions that Lema\ufffdtre looked at were the homogeneous solutions now known as the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) models. (Friedmann found the solutions first but did not think of them as reasonable physical models). It is less well known that Lema\ufffdtre found a more general class of solutions that describe a spherically symmetric expanding universe. These solutions, now known as Lema\ufffdtre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) models, describe possible forms for a universe that could have a centre. Since the FLWR models are actually a special limiting case of the LTB models, we have no sure way of knowing that the LTB models are not correct. The FLWR models may just be good approximations that work well within the limits of the observable universe but not beyond. Of course there are many other even less uniform shapes the universe could have, with or without an identifiable centre. If it turned out to have a centre on some scale beyond the observable universe, such a centre might turn out to be just one of many \"centres\" on much larger scales, just as the centre of our galaxy did before. In other words, although the standard Big Bang models describe an expanding universe with no centre, and this is consistent with all observations, there is still a possibility that these models are not accurate on scales larger than we can observe. We still have no real answer to the question \"Where is the centre of the universe ",

            "answer_text": "Where is the centre of the universe? There is no centre of the universe! According to the standard theories of cosmology, the universe started with a \"Big Bang\" about 14 thousand million years ago and has been expanding ever since. Yet there is no centre to the expansion; it is the same everywhere. The Big Bang should not be visualised as an ordinary explosion. The universe is not expanding out from a centre into space; rather, the whole universe is expanding and it is doing so equally at all places, as far as we can tell. In 1929 Edwin Hubble announced that he had measured the speed of galaxies at different distances from us, and had discovered that the farther they were, the faster they were receding. This might suggest that we are at the centre of the expanding universe, but in fact if the universe is expanding uniformly according to Hubble's law, then it will appear to do so from any vantage point. If we see a galaxy B receding from us at 10,000 km/s, an alien in galaxy B will see our galaxy A receding from it at 10,000 km/s in the opposite direction. Another galaxy C twice as far away in the same direction as B will be seen by us as receding at 20,000 km/s. The alien will see it receding at 10,000 km/s:               A              B             C\u00a0From A         0 km/s    10,000 km/s   20,000 km/s\u00a0From B   -10,000 km/s         0 km/s   10,000 km/s\u00a0So from the point of view of the alien at B, everything is expanding away from it, whichever direction it looks in, just the same as it does for us. The Famous Balloon Analogy A good way to help visualise the expanding universe is to compare space with the surface of an expanding balloon. This analogy was used by Arthur Eddington as early as 1933 in his book The Expanding Universe. It was also used by Fred Hoyle in the 1960 edition of his popular book The Nature of the Universe. Hoyle wrote \"My non-mathematical friends often tell me that they find it difficult to picture this expansion. Short of using a lot of mathematics I cannot do better than use the analogy of a balloon with a large number of dots marked on its surface. If the balloon is blown up the distances between the dots increase in the same way as the distances between the galaxies.\" The balloon analogy is very good but needs to be understood properly\u2014otherwise it can cause more confusion. As Hoyle said, \"There are several important respects in which it is definitely misleading.\" It is important to appreciate that three-dimensional space is to be compared with the two-dimensional surface of the balloon. The surface is homogeneous with no point that should be picked out as the centre. The centre of the balloon itself is not on the surface, and should not be thought of as the centre of the universe. If it helps, you can think of the radial direction in the balloon as time. This was what Hoyle suggested, but it can also be confusing. It is better to regard points off the surface as not being part of the universe at all. As Gauss discovered at the beginning of the 19 th century, properties of space such as curvature can be described in terms of intrinsic quantities that can be measured without needing to think about what it is curving in. So space can be curved without there being any other dimensions \"outside\". Gauss even tried to determine the curvature of space by measuring the angles of a large triangle between three hill tops. When thinking about the balloon analogy you must remember that. . . The 2-dimensional surface of the balloon is analogous to the 3 dimensions of space.The 3-dimensional space in which the balloon is embedded is not analogous to any higher dimensional physical space.The centre of the balloon does not correspond to anything physical.The universe may be finite in size and growing like the surface of an expanding balloon, but it could also be infinite.Galaxies move apart like points on the expanding balloon, but the galaxies themselves do not expand because they are gravitationally bound.... but if the Big Bang was an explosion In a conventional explosion, material expands out from a central point.

In the beginning the surface of the balloon is tiny (0 at the Big Bang accordingly to my understanding). After the Big Bang the balloon expands and the entire surface of the balloon expands more or less uniformly. Remember we should only consider the surface of the balloon, not the entire volume of the balloon, as the surface is the entire known 3D universe. If we keep that in mind then there is no point on the surface of the balloon that could be considered the single \u201ccenter\u201d of the universe. Another way to look at it is every single point on the surface of the balloon (after it was expanded) was originally at the tiny point 0 when the balloon started expanding (i.e. when Big Bang started)!

This was his response to a different question I had. Thank You Tim!!!! I have intuitively always known that pretty much what ever we thought we knew about how our Universe works was wrong. The universe is too perfect, extreme engineering, and that it had to be totally regenerative to even exist. The HIGGS field is too weak to maintain anything, and the explanation of gravity as mass forming a dimple in space time whereby smaller mass rolls towards the largest mass was absurd. About ten years ago I met Dr. Tom VanFlandern, I was fortunate enough to have long conversations with him about the Graviton. Tom believed in the Big Bang theory, and that the Graviton was the atmosphere of a Mega Object that was far larger then our universe and operated at 20 billion times the speed of light. His idea was that this atmosphere bounced around like ping pong balls and caused gravity. Well, I felt that there was still something missing and a refinement was needed in his explanation as to where Graviton\u2019s came from, as to how they actually maintained mass in motion and caused gravity. I totally disagreed with Einstein that gravity operated at the speed of light, that was impossible given that 100,000 light year across galaxies operating in perfect unison with their rotations around a vortex. So, I solved the missing antimatter problem by looking at a DUAL TIME UNIVERSE model that formed forward time matter rotations in juxtaposition with a mirror reverse time antimatter paired motion, that traveled at faster then light around a toroid exchanging energy causing inward induction nodes towards a return mechanism that sent the energy back towards the other side. At that point of discovery, I knew that I had figured out how the basics to the Universe worked, and went on to look at the actual processes that created gravity, mass, and cores of galaxies. The mystery had been solved, and after looking at every scientist out there that had alternative theories I found Halton Arp, and Ruggero Santilli. Mainstream science was a mess, the structure of the atom was a mess, showed zero energy dynamics, and the standard model of particle physics based everything on broken parts that was created by scattering an FTL energy exchange that caused half of the radiation\u2019s to disappear as antiphoton\u2019s that are repulsed by matter back towards their side of the large scale energy pool (The Universe cannot be destroyed it always recombines back into a dual time energy exchange). So, it was Ruggero\u2019s ISODUAL ANTIMATTER THEORY that provided the positive and negative time iso-duality that showed how matter and antimatter were in fact CPT symmetric. Scientists incorrectly combined antimatter as a subjugation to forward time matter, it is not a secondary but primary component in a dual time universe. Here is something interesting: ",

            "answer_text": "I'll poke my two cents in here, not by answering your question, but by questioning it.What is a center?  The core of the earth is the center of a sphere, however, it really can't be designated as a single point, because the motion of the earth would make that point wobble out of its place as the \"center\".  Can there be only one center?  Was center ever defined as such, or did we forget to make this designation.  If so, then the entire universe is filled with points which are at the \"center\" of the whole of an infinite expansion (assuming of course that the universe is infinite). I mean assuming that you define \"center\" as merely a point that is equidistant from all outer boundaries.  Well, all points in an infinite universe would be equally distant from all outer boundaries, since there would be no outer boundaries, and so that distance would be infinity.  Same thing if it is defined as a center of mass:  infinite mass in all directions from any point in an infinite universe.  Uh oh. If it sounds like I'm babbling, it's because that is exactly the point.  This idea of a \"center\" is nothing but a human construct to be used as a tool to understand, predict and calculate within our perceived physical universe.  It is not the universe, it is merely an overlay, a filter, nothing more. As Bruce Lee said in Enter the Dragon: \"...It's like a finger pointing away to the moon. Do not concentrate on the finger or you will miss all of the heavenly glory!\" While this may be a philosophical/belief oriented sentiment, I think it applies in science in that we must be careful not to confuse reality with the math that describes it.

            "answer_text": "It  is not the most widely held theory, but some theoretical physicists  have suggested that there are really 11 dimensions (some say, \"fold up  inside\") in our apparently 3 (or 4 if you count time separately)  dimensional universe. Based on the observation that mathematically  fractals appear to be patterns that recur at infinitely varying scales  (and with imperfections in the \"real world\" implementations of them) it  makes sense that what is true in the sub-atomic field of string theory  (a theory of what \"matter\" really \"is\") should also be true on the scale  of galaxies too. So my hypothesis at this time (and it does change from  time to time) is that we probably live in a universe of which we are  only now able to see 3 (or 4) dimensions but that we have no way of  knowing how many dimensions actually exist in what we would call a  \"physical\" way.So now the question becomes, not \"Does the universe have a center?\" but \"Which universes could have centers?\"Although  it is also widely believed that the universe is expanding at ever  increasing speeds (the \"red shift\" phenomenon becomes more pronounced  the further away from Earth we are looking), there is no evidence that  says that beyond those 13 or 14 billions of light years that we can see  that the universe is expanding in any uniform way or shape.  As Jeff  Kay points out in his answer, we are at the center of the universe that  we are able to see, because we have a limit to how far we can see, no  matter what direction we look. But we really have no convincing evidence  that the universe is curved, or torroidal, or any other particular  shape at all. It could just as easily be an amorphous blob, with no  center of any kind.

            "answer_text": "I believe it does have a center. I believe that space is deeply curved and inherently curved not \u201cbent\u201d into curvature by some putative outside force. The center of the universe would appear to us as a super massive black hole. It reality (this is my opinion) it is a grand central convergence / divergence point and that space is in motion but not inflationary, it follows kinetic Riemannian geometry:  I don\u2019t think our universe is expanding. That notion was derived from the observation of red shift of light issuing from distant galaxies. It seems that observation was attributed to the Doppler effect owing to galaxies receding from us. Red shift is uniform in all directions, implying that we are at the center of that inflationary motion. Obviously that can\u2019t be the case. Another cause of red shift, chromatic aberration, is a better explanation. Space is so deeply curved that it acts like a fish eye lens, distorting our Euclidean way of regarding space. Photons traveling long distances through deeply curved space will undergo red shift and the further the distance the redder the shift. This version for the cause of red shift puts us merely at the center of observation, not at the center of any inflationary action, and accounts for the uniformity of red shift in all directions. We would see the same red shift from any position. ",

            "answer_text": "Where is the centre of the universe? There is no centre of the universe!  According to the standard theories of cosmology, the universe started with a \"Big Bang\" about 14 thousand million years ago and has been expanding ever since.  Yet there is no centre to the expansion; it is the same everywhere.  The Big Bang should not be visualised as an ordinary explosion.  The universe is not expanding out from a centre into space; rather, the whole universe is expanding and it is doing so equally at all places, as far as we can tell.In 1929 Edwin Hubble announced that he had measured the speed of galaxies at different distances from us, and had discovered that the farther they were, the faster they were receding.  This might suggest that we are at the centre of the expanding universe, but in fact if the universe is expanding uniformly according to Hubble's law, then it will appear to do so from any vantage point.If we see a galaxy B receding from us at 10,000 km/s, an alien in galaxy B will see our galaxy A receding from it at 10,000 km/s in the opposite direction.  Another galaxy C twice as far away in the same direction as B will be seen by us as receding at 20,000 km/s.  The alien will see it receding at 10,000 km/s:              A              B             C From A         0 km/s    10,000 km/s   20,000 km/s From B   -10,000 km/s         0 km/s   10,000 km/sSo from the point of view of the alien at B, everything is expanding away from it, whichever direction it looks in, just the same as it does for us.The Famous Balloon AnalogyA good way to help visualise the expanding universe is to compare space with the surface of an expanding balloon.  This analogy was used by Arthur Eddington as early as 1933 in his book The Expanding Universe.  It was also used by Fred Hoyle in the 1960 edition of his popular book The Nature of the Universe.  Hoyle wrote \"My non-mathematical friends often tell me that they find it difficult to picture this expansion.  Short of using a lot of mathematics I cannot do better than use the analogy of a balloon with a large number of dots marked on its surface.  If the balloon is blown up the distances between the dots increase in the same way as the distances between the galaxies.\"The balloon analogy is very good but needs to be understood properly\u2014otherwise it can cause more confusion.  As Hoyle said, \"There are several important respects in which it is definitely misleading.\"  It is important to appreciate that three-dimensional space is to be compared with the two-dimensional surface of the balloon.  The surface is homogeneous with no point that should be picked out as the centre.  The centre of the balloon itself is not on the surface, and should not be thought of as the centre of the universe.  If it helps, you can think of the radial direction in the balloon as time.  This was what Hoyle suggested, but it can also be confusing.  It is better to regard points off the surface as not being part of the universe at all.  As Gauss discovered at the beginning of the 19th century, properties of space such as curvature can be described in terms of intrinsic quantities that can be measured without needing to think about what it is curving in.  So space can be curved without there being any other dimensions \"outside\".  Gauss even tried to determine the curvature of space by measuring the angles of a large triangle between three hill tops.When thinking about the balloon analogy you must remember that. . . The 2-dimensional surface of the balloon is analogous to the 3 dimensions of space.The 3-dimensional space in which the balloon is embedded is not analogous to any higher dimensional physical space.The centre of the balloon does not correspond to anything physical.The universe may be finite in size and growing like the surface of an expanding balloon, but it could also be infinite.Galaxies move apart like points on the expanding balloon, but the galaxies themselves do not expand because they are gravitationally bound.... but if the Big Bang was an explosionIn a conventional explosion, material expands out from a central point.  A short moment after the explosion starts, the centre will be the hottest point.  Later there will be a spherical shell of material expanding away from the centre until gravity brings it back down to Earth.  The Big Bang\u2014as far as we understand it\u2014was not an explosion like that at all.  It was an explosion of space, not an explosion in space.  According to the standard models there was no space and time before the Big Bang.  There was not even a \"before\" to speak of.  So, the Big Bang was very different from any explosion we are accustomed to and it does not need to have a central point.If the Big Bang were an ordinary explosion in an already existing space, we would be able to look out and see the expanding edge of the explosion with empty space beyond.  Instead, we see back towards the Big Bang itself and detect a faint background glow from the hot primordial gases of the early universe.  This \"cosmic microwave background radiation\" is uniform in all directions.  This tells us that it is not matter that is expanding outwards from a point, but rather it is space itself that expands evenly.It is important to stress that other observations support the view that there is no centre to the universe, at least insofar as observations can reach.  The fact that the universe is expanding uniformly would not rule out the possibility that there is some denser, hotter place that might be called the centre, but careful studies of the distribution and motion of galaxies confirm that it is homogeneous on the largest scales we can see, with no sign of a special point to call the centre.The cosmological principleThe idea that the universe should be uniform (homogeneous and isotropic) over very large scales was introduced as the \"cosmological principle\" by Arthur Milne in 1933.  Not long before that, it had been argued by some astronomers that the universe consisted of just our galaxy, and the centre of the Milky Way would have been the centre of the universe.  Hubble put an end to that debate in 1924 when he showed that other galaxies exist outside our own.  Despite the discovery of a great deal of structure in the distribution of the galaxies, most cosmologists still hold to the cosmological principle either for philosophical reasons or because it is a useful working hypothesis that no observation has yet contradicted.  Nevertheless, our view of the universe is limited by the speed of light and the finite time since the Big Bang.  The observable part is very large, but it is probably very small compared to the whole universe, which may even be infinite.  We have no way of knowing what the shape of the universe is beyond the observable horizon, and no way of knowing whether the cosmological principle has any validity on the largest distance scales possible.In 1927 Georges Lema\u00eetre found solutions of Einstein's equations of general relativity in which space expands.  He went on to propose the Big Bang theory with those solutions as a model of the expanding universe.  The best known class of solutions that Lema\u00eetre looked at were the homogeneous solutions now known as the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) models.  (Friedmann found the solutions first but did not think of them as reasonable physical models).  It is less well known that Lema\u00eetre found a more general class of solutions that describe a spherically symmetric expanding universe.  These solutions, now known as Lema\u00eetre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) models, describe possible forms for a universe that could have a centre.  Since the FLWR models are actually a special limiting case of the LTB models, we have no sure way of knowing that the LTB models are not correct.  The FLWR models may just be good approximations that work well within the limits of the observable universe but not beyond.Of course there are many other even less uniform shapes the universe could have, with or without an identifiable centre.  If it turned out to have a centre on some scale beyond the observable universe, such a centre might turn out to be just one of many \"centres\" on much larger scales, just as the centre of our galaxy did before.In other words, although the standard Big Bang models describe an expanding universe with no centre, and this is consistent with all observations, there is still a possibility that these models are not accurate on scales larger than we can observe.  We still have no real answer to the question \"Where is the centre of the universe?\". ",

According to the standard theories of cosmology, the universe started with a \"Big Bang\" about 14 thousand million years ago and has been expanding ever since.

The universe is not expanding out from a centre into space; rather, the whole universe is expanding and it is doing so equally at all places, as far as we can tell\u201d. For thousands of years, astronomers wrestled with basic questions about the size and age of the universe. Does the universe go on forever, or does it have an edge somewhere? Has it always existed, or did it come to being sometime in the past? A static universe is a cosmological model in which the universe is both spatially infinite and temporally infinite, and space is neither expanding nor contracting. Such a universe does not have spatial curvature; that is to say that it is 'flat'. A static infinite universe was first proposed by Giordano Bruno. When Isaac Newton discovered the law of gravity, he realized that gravity is always attractive. Every object in the universe attracts every other object. If the universe truly were finite, the attractive forces of all the objects in the universe should have caused the entire universe to collapse on itself. This clearly had not happened, and so astronomers were presented with a paradox. \u201cTherefore, if the Universe were infinite, the whole surface of the night sky should be as bright as a star. Obviously, there are dark areas in the sky, so the universe must be finite.\u201d Olbers Said. In contrast to Bruno's model, Albert Einstein proposed a temporally infinite but spatially finite model as his preferred cosmology in 1917, in his paper Cosmological Considerations in the General Theory of Relativity. Einstein wrote in his 1931 paper; \u201cIn my original investigation, I proceeded from the following assumptions: 1. All locations in the universe are equivalent; in particular the locally averaged density of stellar matter should therefore be the same everywhere. 2. Spatial structure and density should be constant over time. In 1922\u201324 Friedmann6 used Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity to formulate the mathematics of a dynamic (time-dependent) universe. In the Friedmann models, the average mass density is constant over all space but may change with time as the universe expands. His models, which included all three cases of positive, negative, and zero curvature, were crucial in the development of modern cosmology. But measuring the evolution of the density variations in the universe still does not answer. \u201cIf we define \"universe\" as \"all there is\" or \"all that exists,\" then obviously, by definition, there can be only one universe. \u201c  \u201cBut if we define \"universe\" as \"all we can ever see\" (no matter how large our telescopes) or \"space-time regions that expand together,\" then many universes may indeed exist. There is nothing in science more awesome, more majestic. To discern the nature of ultimate reality, one must begin with the challenge of multiple universes.\u201d \u201cNearly all cosmologists today accept this type of multiverse, which Max Tegmark calls \u201clevel 1.\u201d Yet some go further. They suggest completely different kinds of universes, with different physics, different histories, maybe different numbers of spatial dimensions.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "No, it does not. Reality, or, to say it more clearly, the physical universe, has no single physical center. This is understood in several ways. First, the theory of General Relativity shows that we can take any point in the universe and consider it to be a still point with everything else in motion, and resolve all the motions of all objects throughout the universe mathematically. We can then mathematically convert from that frame of reference (still point) to any other frame of reference. The philosophical implication of this mathematical model is that no one point is the center or in any way special. There is no spatial or inertial frame of reference. This is confirmed by the Michaelson-Morley experiment and numerous observations validating relativity. Second, from all versions of the theory of the Big Bang and the expanding universe, there was an original singularity some 13.8 billion years ago, and the universe has expanded since then. But since space itself is expanding, this expansion is not like blowing up a balloon, where you can say, \u201cthe empty balloon was here, and now the balloon is larger, with this as the original center. Rather, it is more like the surface of the balloon. Each point that exists today was, 13.8 billion years ago, in the location of the singularity, just as each point on a balloon full of air, now, can be found on the original balloon before it was filled with air. Thus, by both General Relativity and our model of the Big Bang and the expanding universe, there is no center point, no still point, and no spatial frame of reference for the physical universe. ",

            "answer_text": "In a word, no. The universe began as a singularity (an infinitely tiny point with infinite density) that started expanding at the moment of the Big Bang. However, the Big Bang wasn\u2019t a normal explosion starting from a single point in space. Rather, space itself was expanding, with everything in the universe moving away from everything else. Today we observe a universe that appears fairly isotropic; that is to say, it looks basically the same in every direction. In general, the galaxies along any line of sight from Earth are distributed in the same way. There is no \u201cpreferred\u201d direction in the universe, which indicates that there is no inherent center of the universe. The observable universe is a somewhat different story. The observable universe is the region of the universe we can observe, defined by how far light has traveled since the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. But this does not mean that Earth is the center of the universe. If you were to move to another star 10 billion light years away, you would still be the center of your own, significantly different observable universe. ",

            "answer_text": "No. The expansion of the universe is often likened to the surface (key word) of a an inflating (spherical) balloon. The analogy can be a extended a bit. Asking about the center of the universe is like asking how to find the center of the surface of an inflating balloon; every point on the surface is identical and has no more 'right' to be called the center, and regardless of where you are on the surface of balloon the expansion is outward  in all directions. Note that this is just an analogy to make the concepts intuitive. Do not try to extend the analogy beyond the 2-D space it is constructed in. The expansion of the universe is not dependent on being embedded in a higher dimensional space (the 2-D surface of the balloon existing in a 3-D space). The balloon analogy is just helpful for gaining a notion of what is meant by various concepts. We actually describe the expansion of the universe by the metric: ds2=\u2212c2dt2+a2(t)d\u03a32 ds2 is the same regardless of your frame of reference (coordinate system), and a(t) is described by the Friedmann equations. d\u03a32 represents the spatial distance between two infinitesimal close points.

            "answer_text": "Here's what Stephen Hawking has to say-    Newton realized that, according to his theory of gravity, the stars should attract each other, so it seemed they could not remain essentially motionless. Would they not all fall together at some point? In a letter in 1691 to Richard Bentley, another leading thinker of his day, Newton argued that this would indeed happen if there were only a finite number of stars distributed over a finite region of space. But he reasoned that if, on the other hand, there were an infinite number of stars, distributed more or less uniformly over infinite space, this would not happen, because there would not be any central point for them to fall to. This argument is an instance of the pitfalls that you can encounter in talking about infinity. In an infinite universe, every point can be regarded as the center, because every point has an infinite number of stars on each side of it. The correct approach, it was realized only much later, is to consider the finite situation, in which the stars all fall in on each other, and then to ask how things change if one adds more stars roughly uniformly distributed outside this region. According to Newton\u2019s law, the extra stars would make no difference at all to the original ones on average, so the stars would fall in just as fast. We can add as many stars as we like, but they will still always collapse in on themselves. We now know it is impossible to have an infinite static model of the universe in which gravity is always attractive.  Source: Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time ",

            "answer_text": "It is said there is no center of the universe because every point can be said to be a center. A first approximation to the geometry of the universe is a 4 dimensional hypersphere where each point on the surface is in a center of a 3 dimensional sphere.  It is difficult to visualize four dimensions but we can understand it if we can abandon the classical notion of independent 3D space and absolute time. We might consider the center of the universe to be the single point of the apparent big bang 13.8 billion years ago. We can consider the universe as the holographic 2D surface of a sphere expanding from the big bang at light speed with a radius of 13.8 billion light years.  However that singular point is 13.8 billion light years away in every direction from any point in the universe defining a 13.8 light year 3D sphere with that position as the center. The spheres defined by all the points in space haken together construct a hypersphere. Just as there is no center on the 2D spherical surface of the earth there can be no center of the 3D surface we perceive as our universe from our perspective which is part of the 4D hyperspherical approximation to our universe that includes all perspectives.

            "answer_text": "Our own galaxies are moving away from us, and those far away are running at the fastest speed. This means that no galaxy is going to happen to you anymore, all other galaxies are going away from you. However, galaxies are not going through space, they are moving in space, because the space is also going on. In other words, there is no center in the universe; Everything is moving away from everything else if you imagine a grid spacecraft with galaxies every million light years or more, after passing this grid it will spread so that the galaxies can spread every two million light years, and so probably in infinity. The universe exists everywhere, from the smallest atom to the largest galaxy; Since some 13.7 billion years ago the Big Bang gave birth, it expanded and its scope could be infinite. The part of the universe which we have in knowledge, the area around which we see the Earth is called the optical universe, from which light was the time for us to reach. A famous parable for explanation of the expanded universe is to imagine the space as the bread of roasted crocodile bread. As the bread increases and grows, they move far away from each other, but they still stick to half a kilo. In the case of the universe, there may be night born that we can not see because they have gone so fast that their light never reached the Earth. Fortunately, there are gravitational controls at the local level and keep our raisins together. Who figured this out? American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed in 1925 and it first proved that the universe is expanding. He has proved that there is a direct connection between the speed of the distant galaxy and the distance of the earth. This is now known as Hubble's Law. The Hubble Space Telescope was named after it, and the single number that describes the cosmic expansion, which relates to the distance of the outer galaxies in relation to their distance, the Hubble Constant. So, Universe is infinite? It can be easy to explain the beginning of the universe and the big bang theory, how to talk about how it will end. It is possible that the universe will end forever, or its existence on the opposite side of the Big Bang can be broken, but in future it may be so that it can be infinite. Until recently, cosmic (scientists studying in the universe) thought that the rate of expansion in the universe was reduced due to the effects of gravity. However, the current study shows that the universe could stretch for eternity. But the research continues, and the new study of supernovae and a strong force in remote galaxies is called the potential debris of the universe. ",

It happened 13.7 billion years ago. The universe before the big bang was a point with infinite density and temperature. After the big bang, it started to expand and kept on expanding ever since. The universe is thought to be at about 93 billion light years across. So according to the big bang theory, light could not have started before 13.7 billion light years. So where ever you are, you could only see for 13.7 billion light years in any direction. That essentially makes you be at the centre of your observable universe. And another question might come into the picture now. What if I were at the edge of the whole universe? Then what? Well, the universe is not to be understood as a sphere that has a defnite border separating the \"our universe\" from the nothingness outside of it. Everything and absolutely everything that is out there is actually to be considered as a part of the universe i.e \"our universe\". Current theories, some of them suppose that the universe is infinte and limitless. I personally belive in the same concept too. So there is no way you could be at the edge of the universe. cheers ",

Quite suddenly, as it happens. 4/ so, since every 'point' in this (early), universe, occurred at the same moment, every point was then, at the centre of the universe. 5/ since expansion has not only continued, but continues to accelerate, still, today, every point remains in the 'centre of the universe'. I know it's not a 'perfect' explanation, but under the circumstances of a whole new entity (universe of space and time), it's probably the best way to accept it.

Isotropic means that it doesn't matter which way you look, the large-scale properties of the universe are the same. Having a physical center would violate both assumptions: the universe would no longer be homogeneous (the place containing the center would be decidedly different from other places) and it would no longer be isotropic either (wherever you are, the direction towards the center would be special and different from other directions.) In short, a conceptual universe with a center contradicts known observational data about the actual, physical universe in which we live. ",

Add a few issues from Mach and it gets daft (and may well make everyone dizzy). Besides \u201cevery celestial body rotates about something\u201d seems like an assumption with no basis. \u201cThe point where the Big Bang took place\u201d is also a loose idea. Maybe it happened \u201ceverywhere\u201d at once, if only because at the time \u201ceverywhere\u201d was in the same place and \u201celsewhere\u201d had no meaning. I\u2019m no Cosmologist, but if the center of the Universe existed and was a black hole, it could hardly have expanded (cos, according to Jim Morrison, nothing gets out). Best guess - there is no center - or as Marlowe says \u201cHell is equally distant from everywhere\u201d (OK he is an Elizabethan poet and not an astrophysics person). But the question is more like asking where does a circle begin and end, rather than where is its center. We\u2019d like a place it all started - the \u201cstill center of the turning worlds\u201d - but that place is perhaps everywhere, and everyone is there, and will be forever. Can\u2019t get more magic than that. ",

            "answer_text": "First, to know a center of anything, we need to know the entire size of that thing. I know the center of my house, my country, sydney cricket ground etc because i know the size of it. Do we exactly know how big is the universe? NO! This is limited due to the oservable extent of the universe that mankind has been able to study since the dawn of astronomy and also due to speed of light. For example, if the speed of light was 10 times than it is, then we would have observed 10 times the distance further out into the observable universe. In other words, the observable universe would have been 10 times the distance from earth as what it is now. The reason is because the light from the further most part of the universe that we cant see is still travelling towards us. This illustrates the sheer size of \u2018The Universe'. Now coming back to the point, the center of thr universe. The center of the universe, when you started reading this answer, is a loooong looong way from the center of the universe now. Yes ! In a few seconds the universe has expanded so much and is still expanding that the center keeps changing. And the expansion is only getting faster and not slower, but that\u2019s a different topic called dark energy. Now you may ask a question. If we are expanding in all directions, then why will the center change? Yeah good question. For that assumption to hold, we also need to assume that we are at the actual center of the universe now and it is expanding exactly equal in all directions and dimensions. The probability that we are at the center now is almost zero, again due to the sheer size of the universe. So basically that's it. Hope you got the point. But apart from that, everything that can be observed fully and has a mass, has a center. ",

We don't know if it's infinite, we don't know if it's permanent (I don't believe it is, but others aren't so sure), and we don't know what it's for. Basically, though, we think that the universe is existence. Other than this, there's not anything. Not space. Not emptiness. Just. Plain. Nothing. There is also speculation that the universe is a donut shape. This explains a few anomalies of space-time, but not everything, and so we don't know. But you want more than that. You want to know where the center of the universe is. As far as I understand, there is no center. Or rather, everywhere is the center. The universe is, at least in theory, of such a shape that it has no center. But we just don't know. One might ask: where did the Big Bang occur? I'm not sure I believe in the Big Bang, but if it did occur, it occurred everywhere. All of space was the Big Bang. Not was in, but was. The Big Bang was a result of space as much as a cause of it. Once again, we just don't know. Here's a final theory. Some scientists say the universe is converging on a point near the constellation Vergo. Could this be the central point of the original expansion? ",

As described at Sean Carroll's website at http://preposterousuniverse.com/writings/cosmologyprimer/faq.html#center We're also not sure if every celestial body rotates around something. If we take the \"balloon analogy of the universe\", we can have every body rotating around something different, but nothing in common.   Does the universe have a center?No. Our observable universe looks basically the same from the point of view of any observer. We see galaxies moving away from us in all directions, but an astronomer living in any one of those galaxies would also see all the galaxies (including our own) moving away from them. In particular, the Big Bang is not an explosion that happened at some particular point in space; according to the Big Bang model, the entire universe came into existence expanding at every point all at once.

Spatial expansion is a big one in which the speculation here gave rise to even further speculation into dark energy and dark matter that is widely mistaken as fact in academia with no more grounds then Kyrie Irving's \"flat Earth\" comments. If i were to speculate, i would use the obvious examples of gravitation and celestial forge structure to base my analysis and say the the big bang remnant would likely be the largest gravitational black hole in existence most likely dwarfing whole galaxies in size whos gravitational reach would define the boundaries of the universe.

This is becuase the known universe is defined by what we can observe. We can see light coming at us from millions and billions of light years in every direction. The point by which we can no longer see the light is the extent of the known universe and it spreads in all directions around us. The universe itself however has no center and no end. Current models predict that the universe was once a great singularity. That is to say that all the mass all over the universe was bound up in one place and time. Before this singularity there was no space, no time and no mass as we know it. Even empty space and time came out of this singularity. The matter that makes up Earth, Mars Alpha Centauri and the Andromeda galaxy were all at the same spot together. When the universe suddenly expanded we started to get empty space between the hot particles. As the expansion increased particles got further and further apart and some clumped together to form stars and well the universe we know today. In short the best way to imagine it is this way. If you were somehow able to sit on a photon from Earth and one from a planet in the Andromeda Galaxy and watch as the universe developed but played backwards they would both eventually end up in the exact same spot. The singularity. This is why the universe is said to have no center and no end.  Everything was in the center but then empty space filled in between everything.. Take away all of that space and we are still in the center of the universe again and so is everything else. ",

Imagine the galaxies painted on the surface of that expanding sphere. All the galaxies move away from each other, the universe is getting bigger (the area of the surface of the sphere is increasing), but the universe is and remains finite (in area in the analogy) and in cubic volume in the actuality. Now ask the posed question of the surface of the sphere and the answer pops right out. There is no center of the surface of a sphere. New Yorkers, bless them, or Londoners for that matter, might claim to be the center of the map, but my modest home in the countryside of Thailand has an equal claim. ",

The boundary of the universe separates awareness from non-awareness. This boundary may not be sharp. Awareness may simply slip into non-awareness on a gradient. We may never be able to perceive the whole universe in a glance, so we have to start with some assumption. It is reasonable to assume that beyond the universe of awareness, there is non-awareness. Therefore, this universe of awareness is bounded by non-awareness.  The universe of awareness consists of space-time, energy and matter. Energy seems to have the dimensions of space-time; and as these dimensions condense energy seems to transition into mass. From this initial assumption it follows that the universe of awareness must have a center of mass. ",

This Central core resembles an immense and continually loading accumulator block, which exhibits a magnetic energy that is immeasurable to us up to now, which binds the existing Universe to itself and prevents too great of an expansion. 31. This power guarantees that with the start of approximately 47 trillion years of expansion, the expansion speed starts to decrease from 147 times the speed of light and slowly drops until the expansion comes to a halt after 155,520 trillion years and, thus, begins the fall-back, the contraction. 32. Thus, the Central core forms the real power and life center, while the Ur-Core can be seen as a real energy storage. 33. But this Central core, the Ur-Core and the Ur-Space, are only an infinitesimally small fraction of the size of the whole Universe. ",

Perhaps a better way to answer is there is no center of the universe. Or if there is, it's a long time ago. Imagine the surface of a sphere. That's a 2D approximation of the universe. No matter how far or how fast you go, you will never somehow 'escape' the universe. There's no edge. Pick a point anywhere on the surface. Is your point in the center? Can it be? Not really; to have a center, it would need edges. But if you wish you can use whatever location you want as the center of your coordinate system to make measurements. ",

The alternative of course is that it could be infinite in all directions. If everything is actually rotating around a central point, then there is also a good chance it contains a massive source of gravity. The third even weirder option, is that all directions could loop back around on themselves. In other words if you traveled long enough in any direction (up, down, left, right, forward, backward) you would eventually end up where you started, regardless of which direction you went. It is impossible to visualize using our 3D understanding of things and therefore, in my opinion, probably not likely. ",

So say I'm at the north pole, and you are at the south pole. I say that I am at the center of the earth, as if I travel in any direction, measuring the distance as I go, I will arrive at the north pole with the same distance in any direction. But even you may make this argument and prove that the south pole is the center of the earth. (I have considered that we are measuring in only 2 dimensions. Sorry for not mentioning that before). In fact, any point on the earth satisfies this property. Hence in two dimensions, every point on the surface of the earth is its center. However, if we consider a third dimension, (i.E. depth) we find a special point that is equidistant from all the points on the surface. Hence we have found the center of the earth. Simply extending my argument to 4D space, such that the 4th co-ordinate is a constant all over space, every point in spacr will be the center of the universe. However, if we allow freedom for the 4th dimension to change, we may find the specific point which will be equidistant from all space at this instant.

            "answer_text": "That is an insightful and extremely interesting question. The short answer, is that the universe does not have a geometric center. It seems odd, because when we look through our telescopes at distant galaxies, they are all moving away from us. This would imply that we are at the center of an expanding bubble of reality. But what we actually know is this: every place in the universe experiences the same exact view. In other words, everything is moving away from everything else. This is on a universal scale, and is not yet true at more local scales, such as a galaxy cluster. There are two ways of picturing how this is possible. The first way is an analogy, which is not very satisfactory, but here it is: You have a balloon that is partially inflated. Now draw lots of galaxies all over the surface of it. Then inflate the balloon. What you observe is that every galaxy is moving away from every other galaxy, and from the point of view from each galaxy, they all see themselves as center of the galaxy. A much better way to understand this is to consider the following fact: all of the universe was born at a very tiny point called the singularity. From that tiny point the universe burst forth into existence and has been expanding ever since. So when you ask yourself where did this take place, the answer is everywhere. Since every point in space was co-located at the singularity, everywhere in the universe was present at the big bang . This is a good explanation as to why there is no center of the universe. The universe may even be expanding into a fourth dimension, in other words the universe may be curved. We do not know that as of yet, but I happen to support that theory. If that is true, then theoretically you could make a long distance trip in what appears to you to be an exact straight line, but you eventually come back to your departure point from the opposite direction. So even though we live in a three dimensional universe, you moved around the curve in the fourth dimension. Obviously in that set up, there is also no center. I hope this answer helps you to see this, and you deserve it, because that is a great question. ",

Going backwards from this time can only be done using theory and our theory are incomplete.   There is no theory for a singularity and the idea that that there even was a singularity - that is that the current universe was not just extremely compressed but actually had zero extent is completely speculative.  There is no evidence that such a condition is even possible and there is no physics that explains it.   Believing in the singularity is exactly like believing in God.  It pushes the explanation back to something mysterious which we have invented to solve a psychological problem.  We have a word and some fluffy ideas but but really don't understand it at all.  It sounds like an explanation but it more a way of avoiding say that we don't know. Hopefully one day there will be some physics that gives a cause for the BB but we certainly aren't there yet. ",

I pose this question because in order for us to judge the center of something then we must know all of it. Even in the \"balloon analogy\" there isn't a center but there is a SOURCE of the air moving into the balloon. Along those lines it can be supposed that the universe is confined in a balloon and there exist a blackhole (an entrance) from which the other side is the source of gravity that expands space within the universe. Other than that, if we do not know the whole of the universe then who is to say we are only in one quadrant of the eight that make up a cube? There exists a 0,0,0 point in any 3D cube. To say the universe has no center is to say there was no beginning and I can equally say we are inside the belly of an animal. ",

            "answer_text": "According to Wikipedia, \u201cThe surface of last scattering refers to the set of points in space at the right distance from us so that we are now receiving photons originally emitted from those points at the time of photon decoupling. Precise measurements of the CMB are critical to cosmology, since any proposed model of the universe must explain this radiation. The CMB has a thermal black body spectrum at a temperature of 2.72548\u00b10.00057 K\u201d and \u201cThe [CMB] glow is very nearly uniform in all directions\u201d  (bold added) Well educated physicists (presumably also well experienced in experimentally based cosmology) keep telling me that I\u2019m wrong, but to my thinking, this astonishingly precise temperature measurement can be interpreted in two ways: 1) The measurement instruments used must have been located dead center of the \u201cvirtual sphere\u201d defined by the \u201csurface of last scattering,\u201d otherwise we would see significant measurement deviations caused by surface distance differences in different measurement directions, as longer distances = higher redshift (see Cosmological Redshift). 2) The temperature measured is not that of some residual big bang \u201cfirst free light,\u201d but the average temperature of the intergalactic medium. Already in a 1940 paper, Canadian astronomer astronomer Andrew McKellar,  in his paper Evidence For the Molecular Origin of Some Hitherto Unidentified Interstellar Lines (1940), based on data obtained by spectral analysis wrote: \u201cthe maximum effective temperature of interstellar space would be 2.7\u00b0K.\u201d \u2014 75 years ago, with no references to some \u201cghost radiation\u201d relic from the \u201cbirth of the Universe.\u201d In a nature.com article, written (1977) by Nobel Laureate (Physics) Hannes Alfv\u00e9n and Asoka Mendis, Interpretation of Observed Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, professor Alfv\u00e9n concludes (bold emphasis added):  \u201cThe claim that this radiation lends strong support to hot big bang cosmologies is without foundation.\u201d And in the 2005 paper The Case Against Primordial Nucleosynthesis, astronomer and astrophysicist Geoffrey Burbidge writes:  \u201cPutting in observed values for the space density of galaxies and a range of values of M/L, and a Hubble constant of 60 km/sec/Mpc and supposing that the 4He/H ratio is 0.24, we obtain an energy density of the radiation 4.5\u00d710^13 erg/cm^3. This energy will initially be released in hard photons (UV radiation) but ultimately, according to thermodynamic arguments, it will be degraded to black body radiation with T \u2248 2.75 K. This is remarkably close to the measured value of 2.726 K. This is either a pure coincidence, as it must be for those who believe in the big bang, or else it tells us that hydrogen burning was originally responsible for the CMB\u201d  (bold emphasis added).  Image source: www.mpia.de/sdssiv/eboss In the \u201csphere cutout\u201d image above, Earth is located (roughly) smack at the center. The \u201couter rim\u201d of the universal sphere depicted here is made up by the aforementioned \u201csurface of last scattering,\u201d about 378 ky post-bang (per the concordance model), i.e., the hypothetical \"CMB origin.\" The bang itself is represented by the outer surface. During the big bang era of universal atomic \u201crecombination\u201d \u2014 a misnomer, since atoms were supposedly never before \u201ccombined\u201d \u2014 the expanding sphere had advanced \u2248 378 000 years from its origin \u2014 uniformly, in all directions: wherever measured, an \u201calmost perfect blackbody\u201d temperature \u2245 2.726 K is found!  \u201cArtist\u2019s logarithmic scale conception of the observable universe with the Solar System at the center, inner and outer planets, Kuiper belt, Oort cloud, Alpha Centauri, Perseus Arm, Milky Way galaxy, Andromeda galaxy, nearby galaxies, Cosmic Web, Cosmic microwave radiation and Big Bang\u2019s invisible plasma on the edge.\u201d (Image (text added by me) and caption from Wikimedia Commons, user Unmismoobjetivo). The actual distance to that surface is debated (\u2248 13.8 Gly, or \u2248 46.5 Gly?), but regardless of the \u201ctrue distance,\u201d if Earth is not located dead center, then how can the radiation possibly be so remarkably uniform, in all directions? In his 1988 article, The New Physics - Physical or Mathematical Science?, Robert L. Oldershaw presents a nice overview of what science should be. Recommended read! As I find it rather unlikely that Earth is located at the center of the Universe, until I learn enough to know better, I\u2019m placing my bets on alternative #2, above! ",

The universe has no centre in exactly the same way that the Real number line does not have a centre. Consider the doubling function f:x\u21a62x which \"expands\" the (infinite) number line taking every point to double its value. You might think this has a centre at zero, but if you were standing at, say, 100 and looking at points 97 and 103 which are three units away before the expansion, they would both end up six units away after the expansion:  97\u2212100\u2212103\u27fc194\u2212200\u2212206 From where you are standing, it looks like you are the centre: every point could be translated to be \"the centre\", and so there is no actual centre. The Big Bang is like the function f:x\u21a6a(t)x applied to our three-dimensional universe where the metric expansion factor, a(t), is itself a function of time. By convention a(now)=1, and observations extrapolate backwards to show that there is a singularity at a specific time, t=0, about 13.8 billion years ago where a(0)=0. The equations break down at the singularity and we don't actually know what happens for t<10\u221232 seconds. It is absolutely astounding, however, that the Big Bang makes as much sense as it does of the rest of those 13,800,000,000\u00d7365\u00d724\u00d760\u00d760 or so seconds! ",

It just happens to be what most think of as a starting point. The visible universe then inflates and expands from that point in time. But the visible universe might have existed for a period of time before that initial inflation. You could consider any point in spacetime as the spatial centre but it is no more valid than any other point as the whole concept is meaningless if the universe is either infinite in spatial dimensions, open and unbounded, or is finite but wrapped on itself like the surface of a ball, closed and unbounded. The point become kind of arbitrary from a global perspective. So the answer is \u201cNo\u201d unless you justify why you are picking a \u201ccentre\u201d and even then it is still arbitrary from a global point of view. ",

In section 'C' we take a dot as a reference point to see the expansion of the Universe. Immediately that dot becomes the center of the Universe. We can do this with any other dot also, as in section 'D'. So the center of the Universe is the reference point you are using to observe the Universe. The same phenomenon is explained by Michael Stevens of Vsauce in the following video :  ",

The Sun; the largest body in our Solar system is at the center that\u2019s why we see it clearly in the Sky. Probably big things are at the center of a solar system or galaxy is because its Gravitational attraction prevents the smaller bodies from hurtling out into space. If the Universe had a Center; it Should be Extremely Massive to hold all the Galaxies together into Orbit. We WOULD definitely see such massive object in the sky. How come then that the Universe seems to be Expanding? If there was a center to the Universe; all galaxies would remain in place and not move away from each other. Something would hold all of them into place. ",

To overcome this and actually find the center of the universe requires that you leave the universe and view the universe from outside. Keep in mind that most of this universe is dark matter and dark energy so if you were outside this greater universe, the visible universe would be the center and would look like a white hole. A white hole is the opposite of a black hole in that it disgorges matter and energy rather than consuming them. ",

But since our visible universe exists on the surface area of this balloon analagy we can not know where that center is except to say that it is 13.8 billion light years away from our position in the Universe. Using the balloon analogy the center part of the balloon is filled with the Cosmic Background Radiation and the 5% that makes up the visible Universe is on the surface of the expanding balloon. The center of this Universe remains constant and unchanging, we are the ones that are moving away from that center as are all points on the balloon surface. ",

            "answer_text": "Endless expansion from the center of our universe of our sphere of galaxies? Not so fast. Quantum physicists have calculated that if the universe were to collapse into a monster size black hole that there would not be enough mass when the crunch got to the quark level to collapse the quarks and that there would then be an explosion outwards. That explains what made the white hole \"big bang\". One physicist came up with a mathematical calculation theory of how the increasing rate of universal expansion could slow down and eventually reverse into a collapse into the \"Big Crunch\" at that center point. Buddha taught the oscillating version of the Big Bang and that the beginning of the expanding period was a natural event. Thus there is no  eternal supreme creator. He did talk about the 5th level of the 6 levels of the lower gods of \"the shining ones who delight in creating\". But that would be local scale creating. It would be no fun for a higher being to create say a type of early mammal and then set its whole course of evolution. It would be more fun to make a tweak here and there in a line of evolution but leave 99% of it to natural selection. ",

For instance; If the universe has positive curvature (it wraps);Where is the middle point of the line which forms a circle?Where is the middle point on the surface of a sphere?The same would hold true for a wrapping 3 dimensional \"surface\" If the universe has flat or negative curvature (infinite);Where is the middle point of a line which extends infinitely in both directions?Where is the middle point of a plane which extends infinitely in all directions?The same would hold true for an infinitely extending 3 dimensional \"surface\" Since we know that the matter/mass distribution in the observable universe is homogenous and isotropic, we can extrapolate that the entire universe is much more of the same.  When all mass is smeared out evenly across a \"surface\" (for the sake if this discussion, the universe is a 3 dimensional surface), then locating the center of mass is the same as finding the center of the surface.  However as I've shown in the above analogies, there is no center of this 3 dimensional surface. ",

Then like I said earlier the universe is flat at the largest scale we can measure so we would have to move far enough away to make a second measurement so we could plot two diverging lines so that would be several times further than the observable universe so never going to be able to detect the center.

Use pen dots all over it. Then blow it up. Now, the surface of the baloon is the universe. Not the inside of the baloon, nor the outside, just the surface. If the baloon were a sheet of paper, there would be edges that would be reached. But the surface of the baloon has no edges. Yet it is finite. This is an old 2D model of the 3D, even 4D, Universes. It still approaches the reality we experience very well. Now, if you want to look back in time to the beginning of the universe, you just look out in space. The further out, the further back. We can look all the way back to the end of the Big Bang. Doesn\u2019t matter what direction you look, it all points to the same starting point. How is this possible? Again, try it on the baloon. It works. But not on the flat sheet of paper. We are 13.8 billion light years from the beginning. So halfway around the baloon is 13.8 billion light years, but actually, in the time it took the Universe til now, its much bigger than that. Some estimates make it 93 billion light year across. So half of that would be how far we now are from the original point. Confused? Keep studying. It will become clear. ",

By this argument we come to a conclusion very similar to the one of Ray Mathew, who said that every point of universe has equal claim to be the center, which makes the exact location of center indeterminable. It`s not to say that we are not, but our claim has a sort of less force as every other point of universe has equal chance for this position. ",

But after sometime, the waves disappear. If somebody asks you what was the centre of those waves after they have disappeared, you wouldn't be able to tell. This is because the surface of water returns to its undisturbed state after sometime. Similarly, the space-time created from Big Bang is smooth and undisturbed today, and hence you cannot tell exactly where it originated from. ",

Also if we talk about of our galaxy there might be centre of mass but, since we and all planets, stars, galaxies, matter, anti-matter etc., are evolved from infinite nothing and it is now \"ever-expanding\" so one may not decide or calculate the centre of mass of our whole universe system.

Though be careful not to reify \"nothing\"; you should read it as \"there is no X such that X is outside the universe.\" Now it could well be that there are things outside our observable universe - that is, the patch of spacetime we can observe, and it's plausible that what's beyond what we can observe (in spatial extent) is much like what we can observe, though this is speculative. Some ideas about string theory hypothesise that there are regions outside our local patch where the properties of spacetime and/or the fundamental differ may vary from what we observe, but there's a lot of work to do before we can say much with any great confidence. As for where the big bang occurred: it was everywhere (in at least our local patch)! That is, if you imagine our (observable) universe as in some way analogous to the skin of an inflating balloon and you ask where did the inflation of the balloon begin? the answer should be clear: everywhere, as the whole surface is expanding and lengths all over it are increasing more or less uniformly on a large scale. At one point in time the distances were very small, but then they grew - everywhere. ",
