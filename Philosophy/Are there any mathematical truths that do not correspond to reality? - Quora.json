            "answer_text": "Mathematics does not correspond with reality without a correspondence. What is a correspondence? It is something that links the objects in your mathematical theory with reality and vice-versa. Mathematicians would call it an isomorphism, and there is one at the heart of every application of mathematics. Even simple mathematics such as addition of Natural numbers requires a correspondence between those numbers and things in reality in order for two apples plus three apples to equal five apples. The correspondence may be so \"natural\" that you are not even aware of it, but if you examine it closely you will see that we also have some correspondence (or meaning) for \"plus\" and for \"equal\". And you will note that something goes wrong with the theory if we add one \"drop of water\" to one \"drop of water\" \u2014 we get one larger \"drop of water\" rather than two of something. We did once think that things like Euclidean Geometry described truths about reality. The sum of the angles of a triangle is always 180\u2218180\u2218 was thought to be a fact about reality. But it isn't. Our current best model of space and time, General Relativity, uses non-Euclidean Geometry in which the measured angles of triangles can sum to more than (or less than) 180\u2218180\u2218. Whether an isomorphism to reality is \"true\" is a matter of empirical science, not a matter of mathematics. Indeed \"truth\" in mathematics is a tautology: an inevitable consequence of the assumptions (axioms) and method of reasoning (logic). Different axioms and different logic leads to different (equally valid) \"truths\". Formally mathematics is a \"game\" of symbol manipulation devoid of any necessary connection with reality. For example it is a \"mathematical truth\" that there is no solution to Douglas H\u00f6fstadter's MU Puzzle, a string manipulation axiomatic theory, but, as far as I am aware, there is no connection between this theory and reality (and nor is there intended to be any connection).

In the mathematical world, there are the same amount of the followings: Even numbersPositive numbersIntegersRational numbersIn reality/practical applications, even numbers should be less than positive numbers, but that logic fails when dealing with infinity in math. There are also some really abstract maths dealing with tesseracts, which cannot exist in our reality 3D world. In topology a bottle is the same as a sphere while a donut is the same as an empty cup. And many more. ",

Or, putting it another way, no mathematical results have anything to do with reality. Everything in mathematics is the result of applying logic to objects that only exist in our minds. It is a curious fact that an awful lot of mathematics ends up being useful in modelling what we perceive to be reality in what we call \u201capplied mathematics\". But, to take an example, the movements of a projectile may be modelled by an equation, but the equation isn't the projectile and it isn't reality. ",
