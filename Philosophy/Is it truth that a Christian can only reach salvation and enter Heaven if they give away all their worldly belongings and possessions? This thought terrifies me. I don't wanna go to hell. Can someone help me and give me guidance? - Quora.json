I don't wanna go to hell. Can someone help me and give me guidance? Your first guideline is \u201cDon\u2019t let anybody tell you what the bible says.\u201d Read it for yourself. It is not reliable to let people tell you what the bible says. Many people will make up stuff because they don't know what it says, and many will make up stuff because they wish it would not say what it says. You just have to read it for yourself. Read a chapter of Proverbs every day. Proverbs has 31 chapters so you can keep your place by just looking at a calendar. There is no religion or nothing in Proverbs and you don't have to believe anything. Just read to find wisdom. When you are comfortable with that, then read the bible from Romans to 2 Thessalonians over and over until you start to remember passages. That is the part that applies to Christians. That part about giving away your possessions is in the gospels, spoken by Jesus. Jesus did not know about the Christian church. He was a Jew speaking to Jews about Jewish concerns. Romans 10:9-10 King James Version (KJV) 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. 10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. That is the definition of a Christian. You don\u2019t give anything away. You don\u2019t get dunked in water. You don\u2019t confess your sins, you confess the savior from sin. ",

            "answer_text": "Quit worrying!! No this is not so and it is highly unlikely that you will be going to heaven, but you will likely go to \u201chell\u201d at some point. Here is why: Based on the Bible the majority of mankind do not go to heaven, they have a different future. The heavenly calling is only for the ones Jesus called His \u201clittle flock\u201d. This would be a relatively small group of human beings. (See Luke 12:32). So the question is who makes up this \u201clittle flock\u201d, how many are there, what is the \u201ckingdom\u201d and what do they do once in heaven? Who are they?? These are one who have received God's Holy Spirit having been chosen by God for this calling. They are aware of this as HIS Spirit testifies with their spirit that they are HIS adopted sons. (See Galatians 4:6-7, Romans 8:14\u201317). How many of these are there? The Book of Revelation states the number to be exactly 144,000 men and women redeemed from the earth for this calling: (See Revelation 14:1-3). What is the \u201ckingdom\u201d and what do they do in heaven? They will rule as kings and priests over the earth and mankind. (See Revelation 5:9-10). From these scriptures it is plain that 144,000 comprising the \u201clittle flock\u201d have a heavenly calling and inheritance. Once there they will rule with Jesus Christ over the earth. That's great but what about the rest of mankind? All those who are preserved alive and \u201ccome through the Tribulation\u201d and and Armageddon (See Revelation 7:9,13-14) along with the billions resurrected that obey God\u2019s will and rule in the new world will gain everlasting life HERE on the restored paradise new earth (See 2 Peter 3:13, Revelation 21:1-5) as God originally purposed for mankind. The earth will once more be restored to a paradise condition and all righteous men and women will have the opportunity for everlasting life on an earth free from all the war, crime, poverty, corruption, sickness, old age, death and evils we have today, under the rule of Jesus Christ and the 144,000. As for \u201cHell\u201d: The word \u201chell\u201d is an archaic English substitution for the Hebrew word (sheol) and the Greek word (Hades) that appear in the earliest bible writings we have today. These words rendered into modern English would read, \u201cthe grave or under the ground\u201d (sheol), \u201cthe place or location of the dead\u201d (Hades). Nothing about a place of eternal punishment. The English word \u201chell\u201d itself was derived from the Latin \u201cinferna\u201d which is defined as: \u201cof or relating to a nether world or place of the dead, hell\u201d. This may have later been confused with the English \u201cinferno\u201d which has a very different meaning. The early church leaders \u2013 Clement, Ignatius, Hermas, Polycarp, and others who believed that death is a sleep followed by a resurrection, as taught by Jesus and the Apostles, taught that the resurrected deliberate and unrepentant wicked are destroyed forever as if being totally consumed in a fire \u2013 their punishment was to be annihilation. These leaders did not teach of an immortal soul to be tortured by fire for eternity. It was Athenagorus (133 -190 AD), a professed Christian and a church leader but whose teachings, according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, were heavily influenced by Plato's philosophies, who introduced Plato's teaching of an immortal soul into Christianity. In doing so he opened the way for the adoption of Plato\u2019s argument of eternal punishment for immortal sinful souls. This was a hundred years after the apostle's and came straight from Plato's philosophy. There are no such words in the bible. Hell is the grave, nothing else. When one dies they go to the grave to await a resurrection. Ecclesiastes 9:5 NKJB 5 For the living know that they will die; But the dead know nothing,And they have no more reward, For the memory of them is forgotten. Ecclesiastes 9:10 New King James Bible 10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going. John 5:28\u201329 NKJB 8 Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice 29 and come forth I have cited scripture as well as verifiable historical and translation information to support this comment as objectively as possible. My comments provide information for consideration and are not intended as a challenge to anyone's personal beliefs. I tell no one what to believe. ",
