            "answer_text": "When I was a kid, I used to play a game called Tekken 3. It is a fighting game and used to look somewhat like this.    The player on the left (Jin) is me, and I am battling with CPU, whose player is Hwoarang (right, of course). This used to be a 10 round game, and CPU would change its player in every round. And of course, difficulty increased with number of rounds crossed. But most of the times I used to win. And screen looked somewhat like this   However, there were few unfortunate moments, when I used to loose the game. And it showed a screen like this.   In order to continue the game, I needed a life (Ha! Now you see where it is going). And I used to get a life by inserting a coin in a machine looking somewhat like this. :P      Ah! Let us be serious, now. Honestly, it is very simple. Do whatever you wished to do ever in your life. You wished to travel, find time to travel. You wished to learn Guitar, Kung Fu, Dance, Swimming, or anything. Go for it. Follow your passion. Passion! Not something you enjoy to do, something you love to do. You will automatically get a life. Just don't do something trivial and time consuming. Don't browse random posts on Facebook, and like them or don't browse 9GAG, and keep laughing. Don't play games all the day. Do something that makes a difference. Something that will make you feel happy, even when you are not doing it. Something that won't make you regret. ",

            "answer_text": "There's a lot of direct advice from others that're really insightful. In my humble experience it depends on you to find out first of all what you consider \"a life\" to be.  If for example you are working all hours, with no spare time, to make just enough money to pay for your apartment, then the answer might be to build up some career capital and unique skills to get a better job that would give you more free time and allow you to plan in more social activity.  Or perhaps you are working a 9-5 job but find your social life is lacking and meeting people hard, the solution might be to try and find some like minded people on Meetup .  Another example is that you have all the above but you feel that your work doesn't excite you anymore, or you feel you are in a job that doesn't excite your passion or have a higher purpose. Then you need to take some time thinking, reading and planning whether you should change your life track or how to incorporate these things into either your work or personal life.  A good read for work happiness; although contentious is :  So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love.  If you find yourself socially awkward, or can't find friends then How to Win Friends and Influence People in the Digital Age:  Whatever your requirements are to \"get a life\" keep persevering, life is always changing and you need to just keep moving in the right direction, eventually you'll make it :) ",

            "answer_text": "Shorten your workday by 30 minutes: I promise you'll get more done than if you put in your usual nine to  ten hours. That's because committing to leaving earlier gives you a  deadline and forces you to eliminate the little time wasters (silly  interruptions, procrastination, perfectionism) that eat up your day.Avoid multitasking. Recent studies  show that it can take the brain twice as long to process each thing  it's working on when switching back and forth between activities. By  learning to focus fully on one project at a time, you can regain the  extra hour or two you crave. Just don't squander it on mundane chores!Break the habit of total self-reliance. Insisting on doing everything yourself burdens you and prevents others  from feeling valuable and needed. Delegate more at home and at work, and  free your time for things you love and excel at.Capture all your to-dos in one place. People who haphazardly write lists on stray notepads, Post-its, and  backs of envelopes waste time wondering what to do next and worrying  that they're forgetting something. Choose only one tool (planner, Palm,  notebook) to track everything you need to do, and prioritize from the  top down. Start every morning with the most important item, not the many  small, easy tasks. You can always squeeze the little things into the  gaps. Conquering the big to-dos gives meaning to your day.Schedule one purely joyful activity each week. Think of an activity\u2014dancing, reading, playing guitar\u2014that you haven't  done for a long time and that brings you instant happiness. Put it in  your datebook as a nonnegotiable appointment with yourself, and watch  the quality of your life transform.Thanks for A2A",

            "answer_text": "Firstly, you should begin by thinking for yourself! This acts as a starting point for discovering who you are as an individual -- which is the second step. How can you have your own life if you don't know who you are? Knowing and understanding the nature of yourself/who you are is a foundation for knowing and understanding what you want. How can you get your own life if you don't know what you want? This step, along with the preceding one, requires relentless exploration and experimentation. Thirdly, now that you know what you want, how are you going to do it?This requires vigorous thinking and meticulous planning (to some extent); it also requires trial and error.In addition to that point, most importantly, why do you want to do it? This will serve as the fuel to your motivations.  So overall: Start thinking for yourself.Understand who you are.Understand what you want to do -- via exploration and experimentation.Understand how you're going to it.Understand why you want to do it.A journey to complete independence (in how you live your life) also requires certain personal attributes: Perseverance -- Maintaining determination.Persistence and tenacity.Positively reinforced self-belief.And most importantly, Courage! Note: this is a highly simplistic model. But you should get the idea. ",

            "answer_text": "Life is about living for a higher purpose. The greatest poverty in life is a poverty of meaningful dreams. A dearth of vision to make the world a better home. The worst failure happens when you do not work with our Creator and leave the world in a better state than when you first came to it. To live for a higher calling, there is a need to constantly examine your values in life. Evaluate them to see if they are platforms or pitfalls to achieve success. 1. Are you a master or slave of material wealth? Throughout life, many have become overly focused on materialistic pursuits. They are more interested in what they have than what they gave, the quantity of possession rather than the quality of contribution. Material possessions are good slaves but bad masters. If you allow your pursuit and desire for possessions to exceed your desire to use and leverage on them to do good, they will control and enslave you. Please stay away from the slippery road of material and emotional bondages. They can only lead to destruction. 2. Is your career a platform for or a pitfall of success? On the journey of life, other than sleeping, you will spend more time developing your career than on many other preoccupations. It is sad that for many, instead of treating their career as a calling, they see it as just a way to earn an income or to climb a ladder in search of promotion and personal achievement. Many go to work and never seek to love their job and excel in it. They choose to drift through time. While their bodies may be at the workplaces, their minds can be somewhere else. They dream of greener pastures and look out for a better employer. All these while, they did not realize that the best workplace is what they made out of it. Slowly but surely, they are draining their energies, and wasting their lives. They fail to see the meaning, purpose and significance of their careers. Fail to realise how much good they can achieve for their loved ones, colleagues, customers, communities, and countries. 3. Do you love people and use things or love things and use people? As you journey through life, the people you can always count on are your loved ones and friends. They are the ones that will stick with you through the ups and downs of life. In your darkest hour, they are there for you. They will struggle with and help you overcome challenges and make something good out of your life. Sadly, you pursue many of your dreams but you fail to help them pursue their dreams. At the end of your life, one of the greatest regrets that you will have is that you did not give them more of your love. You did not repay them with more love, kindness, and care and concern. 4. Is your soul reaching out or numb to the beauty of life? From the beginning to the end of your journey, one of the most important parts of your being is your soul. As Teilhard de Chardin, French Geologist, Priest, Philosopher and Mystic, once wisely said: \u201cWe are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.\u201d You can have everything in the world but if you lose your soul, you will lose everything. If you value your soul and allow our Creator to direct it, you can enjoy an overflowing abundance of life. You can live for a higher calling and serve a worthier cause. In doing so, you can achieve greatness and make something great out of everything within and outside of you. As you journey through life, you need to constantly examine and re-examine your values. Adopt and apply the right values at different phases in life. Each of the values has a proper place and you should prioritise and use them accordingly. As you make sense of the melody and lyrics that our Creator has put in your heart, I pray that you will create the most beautiful symphony for the people around you. In doing so, may you enjoy its poetic rhythm and dance with life. May you become a masterpiece that will exemplify the best of life and one that will inspire others to greatness. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, you could try this: turn off your phone and your screens, pull your head out of your own armpit, and look around you. I mean, use your eyes to look *outside* of your own skull, not inward toward whatever sort of a self you\u2019ve built in there so far, and write down what you see; or draw it; or rap it, or sit and talk with it. Solipsism doesn\u2019t make \u201ca life\u201d. Interaction does; observation does; response does. Once you start to get a sense of what draws you, outside of yourself, start making plans to go that way, even if you\u2019re just delivering take-out to the stage door of the theater you want to play in. Making plans, and acting on them (whatever the outcome), and then doing it some more, is making a life. Some people have very challenging conditions in their lives, and they have to push and drive a lot harder than others. It\u2019s still worth the effort. Good luck \u2014 I feel for you, as someone starting out again on my own for the first time in fifty years. I\u2019ve got a list of decisions to make . . . I hope you\u2019ll make one too. ",

Read Read Read !!!! believe it or not intelligence is the new sexy . If you want to be wanted gain knowledge .  5)Earn money . It gives self worth to people and helps them to calculate where there are in a materialistic way.  6) Try to know how people work rather than trying to know how things work .

Begin each day by listing down one thing that you're grateful for. Spend some quality time with yourself and find out what you love. Get to know yourself. Start doing the things that you love and make you happy. Cut out all negativity from life: people and things. Read, read and read. Learn new things and keep on upgrading yourself. And remember no matter what you do you'll never please every person. Focus on making yourself happy and content. Find the pleasure in small things. It takes time but happiness is a habit and you have to work on it. You can't expect any external force to make you constantly happy. They can help but not be the sole reason. The sole reason for your happiness is you. For that you need to keep on becoming the better version of yourself. Compare yourself only to you. Leave others be. The only person you can have an effect on is yourself and likewise don't let anyone affect you or bring you down. If you want I'll link some podcasts or books to begin with :) Keep upgrading! ",

Then write down short and long term goals and the very specific steps needed to attain these goals. It is very important that you write this down on paper.

For example, if getting in shape is part of the plan, but you've never trained, then hire a trainer for a short while to get you on track. Do not under any circumstance hire a life coach or pay for self help books/seminars. These will be a waste of time, money, and energy and they do not deliver what they claim they will.

You will need persistence. You will need consistency. Learn along the way.

To please others no one can have any actual life, it can be a showcase not a life. How to find your purpose? Finding purpose can start from within you, within your home, within your own family, within your immediate environment. Purpose becomes meaningful even if it makes little difference in other's life or a society as a whole. For example. Purpose can be as simple as looking after your aging parents, learning a musical instrument and playing Infront of some people, petting and feeding stray animals once a month, planting trees, it can be anything. What you can chose to do? If your environment is suffering from lack of Oxygen, you can plant trees around your home, or chose to plant trees across your nation, you can take care of water bodies, etc. In the process you can be part of creating pollution free Nation, a smallest purpose have a mightyest capacity to change the whole world. So to get a life, find a purpose or motivation not an approval. ",

Being a graduate you will have a much better chance of being independent. You can find a job, which you may not like, but it will give you independence and freedom. You will have 2 days every week for yourself. In that time you can sing dance and do whatever you want to. But If you victimize yourself, and fail to make yourself independent before being married off then you will be dependent on someone for the rest of your life. You will probably not even get one day in a week for yourself. On the top of it, you will always need someone's permission. Today your parents are not allowing you to pursue your dreams, tomorrow someone else will do the same. I'm not sure what your parents think, but probably they want you to choose a secure future for yourself and are probably not happy with your dropout decision. They might be right. You are at a very critical stage in your life. Any decision you take will probably affect you for the rest of you life. Choose wisely. Being dependent on someone is the worst gift you can give to yourself. Be an independent women and don't victimize yourself. ",

If this is the question, then totally disregard the person who says this to you. They are being insulting - separate yourself from them until they prove they have changed their behaviour. If you are asking because you would like life to be more interesting and happy, then there are a huge number of things you can do - depending on your age and/or experience. The most important is to invest heavily in yourself - find out what you love doing, would like to do better, and invest in these. One thing no one can ever take from you is the fruit of your experience, and the skills you develop. As you develop yourself, you will become more expressive, and then avenues will open up for you to express yourself, and you will beautify your life with many wonderful experiences. I hope this helps. ",

I connect with the people around me a lot and as much as I can. My bike mechanic guy, he's from UP and is only dreaming to leave Delhi to open up his own shop in UP and never came back. He's a talented boy and I trust him on his dream. Every time I travel in cabs, I speak to the cab drivers. They share interesting stuff. Stuff that I've never heard before. In case any of you want to hear any, can connect with me personally as most of it can't go on my quora account. My barber, he's from bihar and is cutting my hair for past 15 years. From Rs. 3 to now Rs. 35. To some the rates may feel cheap, but to me its just a haircut, and moreover I've been a regular customer to this person. Don't plan trips. Just go and travel. Start with small ones, go for a picnic to a nearby location. You'll find yourself gradually shifting to bigger trips in no time. Meet your friends in person, not on video chats or instant messengers. Enjoy a couple of beer with them. Cherish your old memories. Only memories of naughty stuff remain which you can cherish in future. So try and make some more when you're with your friends again. Get out of your phone, I'm telling it to you one more time. Gift something special to your loved. Thank them for being with you always. Your loved one could be your mother, father, girlfriend, grandmother, grandfather\u2026anyone. Hug your father, mother, sister, brother. Go for bike rides. Random bike rides without any destination. Just go out and don't use your phone. Learn something unusual on YouTube. Try learning farming or bike cleaning, car cleaning, DIY makeup tips. Get yourself away from excessive consumption of any sort of drugs. I hope this will recharge your soul once again. ",
