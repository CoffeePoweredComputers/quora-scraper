            "answer_text": "What are some examples of Utilitarianism vs deontology problem? The trolley problem. This is an ethical dilemma where people are shown a simple graphic:  If you do nothing, five people die. If you pull the lever, on person dies. Kantians ans utilitarians have opposing views to the solution. Kantians wouldn't pull the lever. Deontology is based on ethical duties. You have a negative duty surrounding killing. Kantians wouldn't pull the lever because they feel that you should never kill people. Utilitarians would pull the lever. Utilitarianism is based on finding the greatest good for the greatest number. By killing the on person, you are saving five. Critiques to the beliefs is that deontology can be inherently heartless towards the innocent people dying whereas utilitarianism forces you to kill someone. ",
