            "answer_text": "It is not easy. Kurt Godel\u2019s Incompleteness Theorem is available in an a book that was not terribly expensive at least 40 yeas ago. It is not easy to understand, in part because the logic of Godel\u2019s theorem is conceptually not simple, but also because the book is not pedagogical. I tried it and failed. Maybe there is a more instructive presentation somewhere. But a summary or such is in my opinion not of much value except to give one the idea that any Computer \u201cScience\u201d dude who imagines he or she can do everything is missing the point and needs to submit his or her ideation to scrutiny by persons who re not just clever but also empathic and wise. On the other hand, I once had a manager who said: We the unwilling, led by the unknowing, have done so much with so little for so long that now we are qualified to do everything with nothing. He was a very good manager and such a master computer programmer that he told the manufacturer\u2019s (Burroughs mid-range computers) representatives what the problems were with their operating software and how to fix them.

            "answer_text": "I know I'm not much of a mathematical mind rather a logical mind and logic states when faced with a most difficult problem bring the most learned man to solve it ,The Famouse Mulla Nasraldin whom I've told a few,stories to good applause had once,faced an adversary of extreme wisdom and knowledge and so its,worth checking out this,story . Our Mulla was sitting peacefully enjoying his lunch when a messanger of the Amir , ruler of the,town came in and yelled drop your lunch and come immediately for an urgent order of the Amir! Mulla said , by the life of me I won't budge till you say what's up ! The guy fearing the wrath of Amir decided it's better to tell so he said the famouse wise Sheikh of al Suria has come and won't say s single word but has put a round Suria bread before the Amir and is just waiting Amir has sent for you to solve this puzzle !!! Mulla said is that it? Let go it's nothing, and to the,messenger\u2019s delight they go and find the court in silence and the,Amir sweating and the Sheikh waiting with a look on his face that said what fools Amir looked at the Mulla who confidently shook his head meaning no worries it's nothing!! He then walked to the center picked up the bread tore it in half and threw it back on the,floor! All eyes turned to the,Sheikh who looked surprised and proceeded to produce an egg and placed it down by the two pieces of the bread! All eyes turned to Mulla having themselves no idea of this weird play Mulla ever so confidently whispered something to the Amir\u2019s attendant who left like lightening and return ed with an onion which Mulla placed next to the egg , bewildered eyes returned to the Sheikh who was now in deep thought shaking his head in approval he took a fistful of grains and threw them all over the breads eyes returning to Mulla saw him whispering to the attendant who left and returned with a chicken which Mulla put down by the bread and the bird made short work of the grains ,the wondering eyes saw the Sheikh bowing to Mulla and then said to the Amir so you do have a wise man left you yet ,I would take good care of him,Amir now smiling nodded and was just elated and Mulla returned the Sheikh\u2019s bow with one alike and the Sheikh turned around and left . A companion of his asked Sheikh would you explain we understood nothing Sheikh replied because you are idiots ! I put out the,round bread implying the world is round but Mulla replied that it's split in two be it hemisphere or day and night! I put the egg sayingk it has a thin crust and a thick middle and a burning core , Mulla replied by implying even so it's all layered then I put the grain indicating the populance but the chicken showed that death soon takes them all,! The companions were awed ! The Amir handed Mulla a bag of gold coins saying well done Mulla well done I was sure the Sheikh would have us as idiots but be a pal and explain. Mulla putting the gold in his belt said I thought the Sheikh could do better why it was so simple he put the bread saying that's what they eat, so I tore it and said half is suffice for we are poor and not like Suria so he then said they it egg with it but I said us poor content with an onion he then threw the grain saying we are so rich we throw grain away and I said well if you have grain to throw away we have the chicken who eats it!! Amir bewildered since he was sure there must be more but couldn't say what and seeing it turned out well said mmmmm excellent ,the Mulla bowed and left and would be treated to many dinner parties by the people who were elated of the sheiks defeat. Sometimes to answer the impossible all you need is the Mulla!,\ud83d\ude06 ",

He then prayed about the Problem moving the two stones about in the breastplate after coming to a Decision He removed one Stone. If the stone was white it represented Yes so he went ahead with the Decision. If Black it represented No He left things as they were. Place all your trust in God and it will work every time ",
