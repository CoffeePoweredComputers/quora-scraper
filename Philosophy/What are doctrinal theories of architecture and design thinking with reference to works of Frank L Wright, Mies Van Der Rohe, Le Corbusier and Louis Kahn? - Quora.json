            "answer_text": "A2A: I'm hesitant to lump them all together. Yes they are all part of the modern movement in architecture, but the difference between the earliest, Wright, and latest, Kahn, is too great. In fact, there are some aspects of Kahn's work which some consider postmodernist. There is also considerable difference between early and late Corb; among Wright's various periods; between Mies's European and American phases. At most, one might be able to argue that there is an interest in a certain kind of space - continuous, abstract, flowing - and an interest in relating the interior and exterior as part of the same world. And maybe, just maybe, there is a shared attitude about honesty of materials, but their approach to this is very different. Mies wouldn't give a toss about the notion of organic ism or natural materials (Wright), and early on Corb's approach to material honesty was technologically motivated as opposed to Kahn's more conceptual and philosophical approach. Modern architecture has suffered because of caricatures and reductive descriptions of what it was. There was much less coherent than labels like 'modern movement' and 'international style' suggest. Look at the variety of work produced by Aalto, Mendelsohn, Terragni, Coderch, Lubetkin, Scharoun, Loos, Perret, and etc. the philosophical differences are more significant than the similarities. There were different cultural contexts, different economies, difference technological possibilities that contributed to the meaning of their work and the development of their theories. That reminds me, for example, Pier Luigi Nervi's amazing thin concrete structures were largely due to the shortage of concrete in Italy at the time. So I would argue that there is no such thing as a single and unified theory of modern architecture. What there is, is a shared global, or at least, Western European/developed nations context, with regard to changing social, political and economic conditions. But these developed unevenly and so architecture's response at different time and in different places is very specific, if not unique. ",
