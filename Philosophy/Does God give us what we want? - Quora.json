            "answer_text": "Yes, 100% no matter how far fetched it may be, there are certain things you must know in order to receive ,However its not what you think, If you are waiting on his will to take place or his will to come to pass.. Your going to be waiting forever. God is a god who is moving from glory to glory and same as you in your journey to follow God as you must move from glory to glory Meaning as you go ,where ever you go,God has to be the one upgrading you from Glory to Glory, and because of this God does not desire for anyone to be stagnate on him for anything, but to depend on him on our time of need or want (if the want is out of Good motive)that's why we ask in faith for what we desire that is out of good motive, if we have decided to go a certain way.. That means we are serious of where we are going, but it is God who guides us along the way and builds us up as we go. If God always chose the \u201cperfect path\u201d for us of where to go where it'll be the perfect path for you.. There wouldn't be any mistakes to make where God can show you what you did wrong, where you go, there must always be an impossible situation for God to Come throu of what you ask on him for because there is nothing more that God loves is to make himself known by doing the impossible in your life ,when you believe in him. By knowing that HE IS your solution of when you feel like there is no solution, When you feel like there is no breakthrough in life ,HE IS Your breakthrough, even when you are alone in wilderness, HE IS THE HELPER BEYOND THE MOUNTAIN , where you go, there has to be a mistake in order for God to correct you. 1 John chpt 5:14-15 And this is the confidence we have in him, if we ask (Anything) according to his will, he hears us And if we know he hears us of (whatsoever) we ask, we know we have the petition that we desire of him, Notice that in the Verses, its not saying to ask for his will, but rather it is stating that there is a certain way or step by step process in order for him to hear of what we ask And here is how to ask accordingly to his will 1 John chpt 3:21 - 22 21Beloved, if our condemn us not, then we have confidence toward God. 22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. Do what is right and ask with a Heart this is not condemn by its own lustful desires, but out of goodness importance and of how much it means to you of what your asking im for And as you are doing so Give God complete permission to intervene in your situation,because God cannot come into a situation un-invited, that is why people to pray for others, so that God can intervene in their lives because of our prayer And when you pray and ask, never doubt for those who come to him must believe that he is, And he is a rewarder of those who come to him in faith knowing that there will be a reward, IM HERE TO TELL SOMEBODY WHO IS PRAYING FOR MORE THAN JUST STRENGTH AND HEALING, BUT COUNTING ON GOD FOR A MIRACLE WITHER IT BE SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO US FROM OUR HEART - HE IS NOT THE GOD WHO JUST GIVES HEALING AND WISDOM HE IS THE GOD THAT IS ABLE TO OUT DO FAR MORE THAN WE CAN EVER THINK OR ASK OF HIM - Ephsians 3:20 Dont let anyone tell you otherwise of those who dont know God and Christ, Mark 11:24 whatsoever you ask in prayer believe that you received it, and you shall have Matthew 21:22 and all things whatsoever you asking in prayer believing you receive John 16:23 - 24 God wants to answer our prayer more than we do Isaiah 65:24 Before they call , i will answer, and while they are still yet speaking i will hear ",

            "answer_text": "Yes. Always.  How? There is famous saying which is true also: \"Bhagvan ke ghar der hai andher nahi\" (In God's home is delay but not disappointment) So is it possible that whatever we are asking is on the way. Only problem is our preference changes so dynamically that by the time our desired things come to us we no longer need that :)  For example, cell phone which I eagerly desired last year is not much desired at present. And today whichever cell phone I desire would not be case after a year Now if that is the case then question arises why would I ask for misery which I am experiencing?To answer that let us read below story this eventually is fact of life. A girl loves one boy and marries him. She is so happy. Boy is billionaire, big flat, big cars and everything. Only problem is time. He is so busy in his business that he hardly used to give time to his wife. She got all the facilities around her but husband used to go early and come late night &  she has to eat lunch and dinner alone  as only both of them were living in the house. Gradually she became unhappy with her current lifestyle despite for years she wanted such things around her.  One afternoon she was standing in her balcony and she saw that one worker has just finished his task, he sat beside road and started waiting for someone. After sometime his wife comes and both of them start having lunch together, they were teasing each other and having nice time together. She was watching all these and started thinking that \"This is true happiness, they don\u2019t have money and food is also not that much great but still they are together and having nice time with each other I wish I had such a life.\" There comes God who grants all our wishes and so her wish is noted down. After considering her good conducting in this birth, she destined to get such life in her next birth where she would enjoy the company of her husband as she desired. Meanwhile wife of the worker saw her standing in balcony and felt cool breeze which was flowing and was thinking that \"How happy she must be. We are here with such an old clothes, not much money, not so good food and she is right on top, with superb flat, big cars!! wow how happy she must be I wish I had such a life\" Once again God comes to picture and thanks to her good conducting in this birth she is destined to get her next life of what she desired at present. Now then on next birth their position got interchanged and the same play goes on and on. Perhaps same thing is going with us as well?We always say 'Grass is green on other side' but then once we go there we have our new preferences. If that is the case then why to blame God? He is simply giving us what we are desiring and asking. Then question comes why he delays things as being God he should grant at that moment only. Isn\u2019t it ? Naah that would ruin our life. Imagine if you get whatever you want within a second will it be fun? It could be for few minutes but then there is no spark in life, there is sense of achievement in life and without which life would be like food without salt. We would feel that everything is there but something is missing. So we must truth God, the way he has designed this beautiful world which is working in a perfect and precise way. Beauty of life is that we can decide what we want; only thing is we must find right path, right way to live the life, stabiles our intellect, get control over our dynamic and changing desire and with the help of that increase the will power to win over any situation.  The controlled mind is a great treasure, the philosopher's stone, which yields whatever you want. \u2013 Swami Vivekananda ",

            "answer_text": "No. God gives us what *he* wants us to have, but only when we are willing to accept it (that pesky free will thing again: God cannot give what we refuse to accept). Now, if our \u201cwant\u201d corresponds with God\u2019s design and will, then sure, we\u2019ll get it. Even Jesus did not get what he wanted from God: Matthew 6:29 - Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, \"My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.\" Two things of note in this passage: Jesus says what he wants, but places his wants as secondary to God\u2019s will. This is the pattern for Christian prayer, and it is in this passage that we can see clearly one of the three logical fallacies embedded in Dick Hartfield\u2019s answer. In short, prayer is not a tool we use to control God. It is a way of communicating our willingness to submit to God\u2019s perfect and absolute authority, accept his gift of grace, and to open ourselves up to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. ",

When people say God gives you what you want, its nevwr that simple. God will give you what you want when you want what God has in plan for you. Othwrwise, even if you want to be a better christian, you might not get it. And that one he s been praying for, but he keeps being a selfish lazy rude perv. He cant help it and he feels really bad for it. Hes even been depressed to the point where he just wants to die, and every day he s alive, he suffers. Yet, God has used him to help others a lot, has given him answers to very hard questions. But he suffers everyday. I guess thats why Jesus said to not start what you cant finish. Maybe he shouldnt try so hard, I mean, God has mercy. ",

But that is good - those difficulties tried and tested my trust in God. Will I act like a spoiled brat or will I continue to trust God in everything in my life? Will I be childish in following God, or grow in maturity to fully entrust my life, my plans, and my decision to Jesus my Lord? But even if I don\u2019t get my way all or even most of the time, life is good.
