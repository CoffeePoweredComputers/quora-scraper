            "answer_text": "Are the two proof systems written in the same language? Let\u2019s momentarily assume they are. The main thing to show is that they prove the same theorems, i.e., that proof system 1 entails theorem t if, and only if, proof system 2 entails theorem t. Note that inconsistent systems in which every well-formed statement is true (as is its negation, if the language is equipped with negation), any two of them are trivially equivalent. If the two proof systems are not written in the same language, then one will have to map all symbols and their \u201cmeaning\u201d (constant, relation, function) by some function W. Then if we denote W(t) to be the translation from the language of the first system to the language of the second system, we would need to show that system 1 entails t if, and only if, proof system 2 entails W(t).
