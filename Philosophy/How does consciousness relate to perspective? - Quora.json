            "answer_text": "The first question should be: \"what is consciousness?\"  There a many opinions about it and many ways to describe it and I think they are all correct!  Consciousness is everything except undefined awareness. All the other things are defined and influences by our mind (way of thinking)  This is why, that what we define as our Consciousness is a Perspective that is part of the same Consciousness. Every Perspective that we have is basically a product of our Consciousness.  When we look at the world, we see things trough our Consciousness. Everything is filtered by our own Consciousness. (earlier thoughts)  Our Perspectives are based on our Consciousness. We see what we have thought before.  But because awareness is undefined  and we are self-aware our Conciseness can grow to another Perspective. ",
