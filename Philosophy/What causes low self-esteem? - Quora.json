            "answer_text": "There are many different things that can cause a person to have low self-esteem and make them feel bad about themselves, thus misjudging their own worth. For example: Failing at various tasks in lifeNot living up to your own expectationsCaring too much about the opinions of others and what people think of youNot being able to cope with various problems and events in your life in the right wayDisapproving authority figuresUninvolved and preoccupied caregiversBeing a victim of bullyingSystematic punishment, neglect or abuseFailing to meet parental or peer-group standardsTrauma and uncontrollable bad things happening to you - horrific accidents.Bad belief systemsNot living up to society\u2019s standardsBeing on the receiving end of other people's stress or distress.Belonging to a family or social group that other people are prejudiced towardsAn absence of praise, warmth, affection or interestBeing the odd one out, at home or at school.And so on and so forth - the list can go on and on. But the main cause of low self-esteem that people tend to forget - IS YOU! It\u2019s all up to you how you interpret the various events in your life, how you deal with them, and how you COPE with them. So I\u2019m going to talk about one of the less-known but very important aspects of self-esteem - how you CHOOSE to deal and cope with various problems.  When I was a teenager, I used to have an abysmal sense of self-esteem that negatively affected my whole life. But now I don\u2019t. Self-esteem is an abstract psychological concept made up to describe part of a person's human nature. It is confidence in one's own worth or abilities; self-respect. You develop it simply by living your life and dealing with various problems that come your way. If you can cope with your problems in the right way - you develop a healthy self-esteem. If you can\u2019t cope with your problems, or cope with them in the wrong way - you develop a low and unhealthy self-esteem. The better you deal and cope with your problems, the more confident you become in your own worth and abilities, and the more self-respect you develop as a result. I\u2019ll explain further:  Let\u2019s get this straight - Life isn\u2019t fair. A lot of it depends on the circumstances that you were born under; whether you had rich or poor parents, good or bad genes, were born in a peaceful or war-torn location and in a 1st or 3rd world country, and what race card you randomly drew, etc. Luck of the draw, in other words. And as everyone goes through life, they want to succeed at various things. Everyone wants stuff for themselves - whether that stuff is money, love, fame, things, friendships, property, prosperity, enlightenment, and whatever else you can think of. So, through life, you go and interact with other people, and you make your wants and needs known to them. But here\u2019s the kicker - you don\u2019t always get what you want! In fact, you rarely do. And guess what that does to people? It knocks them down a peg, and makes them realize that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around them, and that there are other people in this world who want all of the same stuff that YOU want - to happen to them, too. Other people also want stuff like love, friendships, money, and other important things. And there are more than 7.5 BILLION of them running around this planet. So when people don\u2019t get what they want - they have to somehow cope with it. And the way they cope with not getting what they want is what determines their eventual level of self-esteem. This is felt the most profoundly at certain stages of a person\u2019s life and for people between certain ages where they experience radical shifts in their thinking. For example, when a child enters the stage of early adolescence and starts going to primary school. He starts interacting with other people and learns about life, and how unfair it is. How he interacts with other people and then deals and copes with the problems that come his way will determine what kind of self-esteem he\u2019ll have. There are other stages - for example when someone starts going to high-school. High-School is pretty brutal, it\u2019s kind of survival of the smartest and the fittest for most. And a LOT of people who go to school don\u2019t get what they want - they get denied friendships, dating opportunities, sex, money, being accepted by others, adoration, various opportunities, and other important things. And if they don\u2019t know how to cope with all of that, they will also develop an abysmal self-esteem, just like I did once. For example, say you\u2019re an average guy, and you want to date around, have sex with various girls that you\u2019re interested in, and eventually start a relationship. So you go up to some girls that you\u2019re interested in and BOOM - you get rejected. How well will you cope with that rejection? If you cope with it in a healthy way, understanding the fact that you can\u2019t always get what you want, and that rejection is actually good for you because it allows you to learn and improve yourself - and stop wasting your time on the people who reject you because they obviously want nothing to do with you - you\u2019ll have no self-esteem issues when it comes to this particular problem. However, if you cope with it in a bad way or a wrong way - your self-esteem levels will take a massive dip. For example, if you get rejected, but you think that you somehow DESERVE to have this girl, or that something must be wrong with HER because why wouldn\u2019t she like you? Or maybe you think that something must be wrong with YOU. Or maybe you got rejected and you started becoming AFRAID of asking other girls out. Or maybe you got so affected by this rejection that you started feeling nervous around girls that you\u2019re interested in, because you don\u2019t want to get rejected again. And so on, and so forth - there are lots of bad ways to cope with problems, just as there are lots of good ways. The point is, if you cope with his particular example in a bad way, your self-esteem takes a massive blow because you didn\u2019t get what you want. Which makes you think that you\u2019re somehow unworthy, or \u201cnot enough\u201d as a human being, to get the things that you want. So you start developing insecurities and other psychological issues. And that\u2019s where it all goes downhill. So you see, low self-esteem and its various issues become deep-rooted as people develop them while growing up, through many, many years of various life stages and experiences - mostly negative ones that happened to them and they didn't know how to cope with in a healthy way. So really, most of these issues come from a person's upbringing. The way that person lived his life and what problems he dealt with and how he coped with them, and whether he knew how to cope with them in the right way or not. This rejection example is just a random one at the top of my head. I could think of a hundred other ones.  Finally, you can learn how to cope with the negative things that you\u2019ve experienced in life, in the right way. If you do, these negative experiences will stop affecting your self-worth, and you will always determine your self-esteem yourself - and not base it on external things. Especially those that you have no control over. It\u2019s about learning the reality of life and that some things you just can\u2019t change, and that you can\u2019t have everything that you want, and not everyone\u2019s going to like you, no matter what you do. And many other revelations. ",

            "answer_text": " While self-esteem can be caused by many things in life, one underlying reason for low self esteem, that I have found, is due to the habit of being the cartographer over the adventurer.

You don't ever get up to the plate and swing the bat. You are constantly analyzing and practicing the \"perfect swing.\u201dYou don't ever sit down at your desk and write your magnum opus. You are browsing Youtube and other utilities on how to write the \u201cperfect book.\u201dYou don't ever take risk in starting your own business. You either remain at the same job you hate or continue climbing the academic ladder in search for \u201cperfect tool belt.\u201dPerfect doesn't exist. The striving to be perfect only keeps you thinking you're inadequate. When you take action and become the adventurer you make mistakes. You learn from the mistakes and try again. You get up to the plate, sometimes you swing and miss, sometimes you hit a single and ever so often you hit that grand slam.You start writing, you get to know yourself as a writer, you write your first book, it sucks, you re-write and learn what works and what doesn't. Perhaps you finally get a book published.You start your business, bootstrapping your resources. The business fails. You learn what didn't work. You apply those lessons the next time. You've built the next great app.How can you expect to gain self-esteem by sitting on the sidelines? You'll never fall in love and have that ultimate relationship if you keep reading books on relationships and how to be the \u201cperfect lover.\u201d Perfect doesn't exist. Perfect is the antithesis of action. Action is the self-esteem builder. (Photo Credit: Photo by David Straight on Unsplash) Jon Brosio  Ready For A Boost?
