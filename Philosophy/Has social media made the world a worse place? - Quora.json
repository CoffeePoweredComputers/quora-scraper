            "answer_text": "Bullying - Since people can create accounts in different social media sites, any person can be anyone. Thus, anonymity is not a problem. Yes, you can block an individual but they can still do cyberbullying without you knowing. Posting something to degrade you in one way or another. Thus affecting you and the people around you. Fake news spreading - Things can be posted without the verification if its true. Allowing the innocent public to consume fake news and false information to propagate since sharing can be done in a single click of the icon. Pornography - Since there is privacy for end-to-end user, pornography can also be done using social media application. They can send realtime videos to multiple individuals allowing this kind of issue to be disseminated. Drug trafficking / Human Trafficking - Aside from pornography, users may be able to do illegal transactions online. Only to give the address, what to get and when, they can do given the cheapest budget as far as communication service is concern, perpetrators may do what they want. Depression - Social media somewhat affects user directly and indirectly. People tend to compare their individuality with others such that they wanted to be someone, they wanted to be somewhere but somehow every now and then, another post from another individual would appear which affects them one way or another. Thus, driving them to depression. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes and no. This question is so complex, and there really isn\u2019t a black and white answer. Has the world worsened as a result of social media? There has been a rise in infidelity, a facilitation of online theft, a rise in attention disorders, and a general dis-connect in face to face human interactions. Has the world improved as a result of social media? There has been a rise in innovation, improved global communication and sharing of ideas, a greater opportunity for international collaboration, an increase in exposure to ideas and knowledge\u2026 My lists are barely scraping the surface of pros and cons, but I think the real question is, \u201cHow do you plan on using social media?\u201d This will define whether your experience is largely positive or negative. Personally, social media has been life-changing for me. It has allowed me to make friends all over the world, achieve my childhood dreams, share my thoughts and ideas to cities I\u2019d never even heard of, and make more money than I ever achieved possible.
