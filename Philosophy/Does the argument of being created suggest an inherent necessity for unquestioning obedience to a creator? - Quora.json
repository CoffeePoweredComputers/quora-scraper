            "answer_text": "Does the argument of being created suggest an inherent necessity for unquestioning obedience to a creator? No. Say, just for the moment, we accept the fact that our creation was as the result of the actions of a vastly powerful entity. Why? Why did this entity create us? For what purpose? What if the reason for creation was that this entity was bored and wanted a plaything to take out his rage on, to be cruel to and punish for no good reason? Should we owe this being unquestioning obedience? What if we are a science experiment? And this entity just wanted to see what would happen and they always had the intention of just tipping the whole thing into the incinerator the moment it gets boring? Or the moment this entity gets the results they want? Should we owe this being unquestioning obedience? What if this creator entity is part of a whole species, of which the one that created us was the equivalent of a 3 year old that just made a mistake and doesn\u2019t even really know what they\u2019re doing? Should we owe this being unquestioning obedience? I\u2019m willing to bet you said NO to all three of these scenarios. Now let\u2019s come back to reality. We have no evidence at all to say that there is a creator entity in the first place, and even if we extend to the mental wandering above, we still have no evidence to suggest that the \u201ccreator\u201d isn\u2019t one of those three scenarios I mentioned, or perhaps something worse. So, until we have evidence to say that this alleged creator is actually deserving of unquestioning obedience then no, we should not give unquestioning obedience to anything. ",

            "answer_text": "The question is, \u201cDoes the argument of being created suggest an inherent necessity for unquestioning obedience to a creator?\u201d Yes: if we are created, then it makes sense to try to understand what the creator\u2019s purpose is, and once we feel we understand it, to live in harmony with it, which can be reasonably described as \u201cobeying the creator.\u201d \u201cUnquestioning\u201d applies only after we have satisfied ourselves, through questioning or through other means of study and inquiry, that what we are obeying is truly from our creator, and not just fanciful inventions of our own or other people\u2019s minds. It is no different from building a spacecraft. We have to obey the laws of physics and chemistry in order for it to perform correctly. If we make any mistakes in our obedience to those laws, the craft will fail to take off, or will explode, or will fail to go into orbit, or will escape entirely and either fall into the sun or wander into the remoteness of outer space. Likewise, if we misunderstand the laws of human existence, we will find ourselves dying of obesity, or having an early-age stroke, or being unable to earn a living, or having wars with other nations. God has, over the ages, sent us His \u201coperating manual\u201d for human civilization on planet earth. It is in serial form, and never finished. Its authors include Adam, Krishna, Abraham, Zoroaster, Moses, Buddha, Christ, Muhammad, the B\u00e1b, and Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, as well as many others whose names we barely know or don\u2019t know at all. Here are a few items from the most recent pages of the manual. O Children of Men! Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust? That no one should exalt himself over the other. Ponder at all times in your hearts how ye were created. Since We have created you all from one same substance it is incumbent on you to be even as one soul, to walk with the same feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in the same land, that from your inmost being, by your deeds and actions, the signs of oneness and the essence of detachment may be made manifest. Such is My counsel to you, O concourse of light! Heed ye this counsel that ye may obtain the fruit of holiness from the tree of wondrous glory. \u2014The Hidden Words, Arabic #68. All men have been created to carry forward an ever-advancing civilization. The Almighty beareth Me witness: To act like the beasts of the field is unworthy of man. Those virtues that befit his dignity are forbearance, mercy, compassion and loving-kindness towards all the peoples and kindreds of the earth. Say: O friends! Drink your fill from this crystal stream that floweth through the heavenly grace of Him Who is the Lord of Names. Let others partake of its waters in My name, that the leaders of men in every land may fully recognize the purpose for which the Eternal Truth hath been revealed, and the reason for which they themselves have been created. \u2014Gleanings from the Writings of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, number CIX. The time must come when the imperative necessity for the holding of a vast, an all-embracing assemblage of men will be universally realized. The rulers and kings of the earth must needs attend it, and, participating in its deliberations, must consider such ways and means as will lay the foundations of the world\u2019s Great Peace amongst men. Such a peace demandeth that the Great Powers should resolve, for the sake of the tranquility of the peoples of the earth, to be fully reconciled among themselves. Should any king take up arms against another, all should unitedly arise and prevent him. If this be done, the nations of the world will no longer require any armaments, except for the purpose of preserving the security of their realms and of maintaining internal order within their territories. This will ensure the peace and composure of every people, government and nation. \u2026 \u2026 Among the things which are conducive to unity and concord and will cause the whole earth to be regarded as one country is that the diverse languages be reduced to one language and in like manner the scripts used in the world be confined to a single script. It is incumbent upon all nations to appoint some men of understanding and erudition to convene a gathering and through joint consultation choose one language from among the varied existing languages, or create a new one, to be taught to the children in all the schools of the world. The day is approaching when all the peoples of the world will have adopted one universal language and one common script. When this is achieved, to whatsoever city a man may journey, it shall be as if he were entering his own home. These things are obligatory and absolutely essential. It is incumbent upon every man of insight and understanding to strive to translate that which hath been written into reality and action. \u2014Tablets of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h, Tablet of Maq\u1e63\u00fad. That the divers communions of the earth, and the manifold systems of religious belief, should never be allowed to foster the feelings of animosity among men, is, in this Day, of the essence of the Faith of God and His Religion. These principles and laws, these firmly-established and mighty systems, have proceeded from one Source, and are rays of one Light. That they differ one from another is to be attributed to the varying requirements of the ages in which they were promulgated. \u2014Epistle to the Son of the Wolf. ",

            "answer_text": "Does the argument of being created suggest an inherent necessity for unquestioning obedience to a creator? That is the ancient Middle Eastern mindset. In that culture, the individual has no meaning. The group is what is important, and individuals are easily sacrificed for the \u201cgood\u201d of the group. Obedience to Authority is stressed, and questioning is a sign of rebellion. In fact, our words of \u201cGood, bad, evil, wicked, right, wrong\u201d and so on all hark back to an authoritarian view of the world, where no one was \u201cfree\u201d and thinking for yourself was \u201cwickedness\u201d and \u201ciniquity.\u201d It didn\u2019t matter what the outcome of something was, whether people lived or died or did better or did worse, if you following your instructions, you were \u201crighteous,\u201d and if you didn\u2019t you were \u201cwicked.\u201d This kind of thinking pervades the churches in Christianity and frankly, most every other religion in the world. There are Authorities to obey, and they expect to be obeyed. Without question. ",

It is not significantly at odds with the scientific big bang idea. What makes no sense is the jealous, vengeful, self absorbed god of most religions who acts like a petty tyrant, demanding bowing and scraping and begging for forgiveness. We condemns his creation to Hell for not obeying or doubting his majesty. No such god would be deserving of our respect. ",
