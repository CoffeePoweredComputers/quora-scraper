            "answer_text": "Not the psychedelic part of the experience but you can certainly experience the bliss, floating, happiness, peace, excitement and joy. Actually the hallucinations when using a psychedelic are a distraction if you wish to have a meditative experience. It is actually far better to just meditate without drugs if you wish to feel the bliss, floating, happiness, peace, excitement and joy. Also, if you are depending on a chemical to experience those things then they are not real. If you experience them in meditation then they are very real and can be experienced any time you wish. ",

            "answer_text": "It should not that would require intense focus on certain areas of the brain, meditation should balance consciousness with the whole body increasing energy efficiency. It can give feelings similar to drugs that have this effect like weed which often unlocks consciousness from brain areas but can also in some cases focus consciousness of negative brain areas. Meditation done with purpose can give all the positive experiences of drugs for free and with no side effects, the effect is increased with practice rather than losing effect as resistance builds. ",
