            "answer_text": "It is immoral to believe in the distorted teachings which mislead people. People search the internet to know the true word of God but are being misled into the distorted teachings by the bad preachers. The faith based on the common ground prophets\u2019 teachings and harsh teachings should provide peace and certainty to believers. But the bad pastors can make us feel happy by the attractive teachings in order to reap the \u2018financial gifts\u2019 in exchange of their alleged \u2018spiritual gifts\u2019 Most people do not follow the harsh teachings which urge us to obey God as taught by Jesus in Matthew 22:35-40, Luke 10:25-28, Mark 12:28-34, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018We are saved by grace through faith apart from works\u2019 - Ephesians 2:8-9 \u2018Even when we were dead in sins, we are saved by grace\u2019 - Ephesians 2:5 \u2018A man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law\u2019 - Romans 3:28 \u2018A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith\u2019 - Galatians 2:16 \u2018For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse\u2019 - Galatians 3:10 Most people do not follow the harsh teachings like If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away which is taught by Jesus in Matthew 18:9, Matthew 5:29 and Mark 9:47, but they prefer the attractive teachings of Paul like: \u2018God has chosen us before the foundations of the world\u2019 - Ephesians 1:4 \u2018God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation\u2019 - 2 Thessalonians 2:13 \u2018For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation\u2019 - 1 Thessalonians 5:9 \u2018But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed!\u2019 1 Corinthians 15:51 \u2018God has saved us and called us\u2019 - 2 Timothy 1:9 \u2018we have been justified through faith\u2019 - Romans 5:1, Romans 5:9 Bad scholars do not teach the true teachings like Matthew 10:8 \u2018Freely you have received; freely give\u2019; they teach that it is o.k. to reap the financial gifts in exchange of the spiritual gifts and teach the attractive ones \u2018And those he predestined, he also called; those he called, he also justified; those he justified, he also glorified\u2019 Romans 8:30 They try to make people feel happy by such attractive teachings in order to receive more donations. \u201cIf we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you?\u201d 1 Corinthians 9:11 The sad reality is that people prefer the beautiful lies and ignore the harsh truth.

            "answer_text": "This is kind of a tricky question. The simple way of answering would be no, a belief in and of itself can't be immoral, unless you act on it in a way that hurts or disadvantages others who have not harmed you in any way. But that's a bit too simplistic. Not everything we do is carefully monitored and guided by our most noble and compassionate tendencies, and we have many unexamined biases that may play a role in our decisions and actions. We also have very imperfect knowledge of all the downstream consequences of the actions we take based on our beliefs. So even at our most conscious and noble, we may engage in immoral behavior stemming from our unexamined biases, and situations in which we neglect to consciously \"check in\" with our own ethics before deciding or acting.

            "answer_text": "This is a good question but fraught with ambiguity and subjectiveness. What one believes is immoral depends on one\u2019s early nurturing and environmental influences. One\u2019s code of morality and immorality is subjective, just as is religion itself\u2014from which most folks form their subjective opinions about immorality. For example, a great many people in the western nations believe that a woman breastfeeding her baby in public is immoral because her breast is showing. many do not\u2014it\u2019s a natural thing. That is a subjective opinion. Others, especially in Islam, believe that a woman who does not have her entire body including ankles, neck and arms covered, is being immoral. Still others, such as myself, believe that forcing women to cover themselves is immoral. Most societies believe public nakedness is immoral. Other societies do not. Even in very religious nations, such as in the U.S., quasi-public nudity (quasi meaning a community of nude people is allowed so long as it is separated from the general public) is allowed because the U.S. has a secular Constitution that recognizes every individual\u2019s beliefs in matters of morality and religion are as valid as the next person\u2019s. It is the right to have a free conscience. ",

It can be all three: immoral, legal and ethical, or any combination of these three. It is therefore a question that has many answers that are as subjective as philosophy can be. It is also lends itself for a great discussion with friends over dinner. ",

You could hold a belief, that if you acted on it the action would be immoral. Morality only addresses harms (and to a lesser extent benefits) to moral agents. Thoughts that no one ever knows about other than the thinker of course, cannot harm anyone else and so are not within the realm of morality. ",
