            "answer_text": "People cant actually explain how powerful music is. It also varies on what type of person you are and what type of music genre you prefer. Find best genre for you. And prefer Rock n Roll, 60\u2019s to 90\u2019s music. Bands like Pink floyd, Metallica, Guns n Roses, Slipknot, the Beatles, the eagles, scorpions, journey and similar others. And most importantly what i feel about the power of music is that it basically takes to another dimension, music expresses things what words could never express. it gets you high, their philosophical lyrics just makes me feel the sense of being, it helps you to find deeper meaning in everything. and basically i dont listen music i breath it ;) ",
