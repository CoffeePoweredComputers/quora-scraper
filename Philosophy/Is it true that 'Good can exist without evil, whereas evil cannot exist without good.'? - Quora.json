            "answer_text": "If you want an answer to this question, start with the understanding that humans are (at the core) animals. We evolved from animals, we are born with nothing but animalistic impulses and urges, and if/when we lose the capacity for higher reasoning and insight \u2014 through intoxicants or senility or ignorance \u2014 we revert back to animalistic behavior. That\u2019s neither good nor bad, that\u2019s just genetics; we are designed by evolution to scrabble around in the dirt after roots and insect, relieve ourselves wherever it\u2019s convenient, and have sex whenever and wherever the urge and the possibility arise. Go to a few frat parties or bars at 2:00 am and you\u2019re likely to find someone who has momentarily reverted to that primal animal nature. The concept of \u2018good\u2019 arises because we have the capacity for higher reasoning and insight. We can stop and think to ourselves: \u201cI want to be more than an animal.\u201d Things that takes us away from the reactive existence of an animal are efforts towards the good. They may not be perfect efforts, they often chaff with our animal urges, and sometimes they create confusions and tangles (see the next paragraph)\u2026 But in general that desire to move beyond animal existence to what we consider properly human \u2014 or in Nietzsche\u2019s sense, the \u00fcbermensch or idealized human \u2014 that is what we call \u2018good.\u2019 The concept of \u2018evil\u2019 arises when we see people who do things that seem to oppose the good: that oppose that rise from the animal to the human. This doesn\u2019t mean an urge to return to animal nature \u2014 if that\u2019s all such people wanted they\u2019d buy a bottle of bourbon and check out \u2014 it means that they try to upset, destroy, or block what is good, for some purpose or interest in their own heads. Sometimes this is because we want something good for ourselves that someone else has: gluttony, envy, jealousy, lust, etc. Sometimes it\u2019s because we are stuck on some partial ideal of the good and get infuriated because someone else disagrees or refuses to conform: pride and anger. A lot of times evil arises because people get tangled up in differing conceptions of good, and are not skilled enough philosophically to balance them properly. For instance, bathrooms have the positive good that people don\u2019t relieve themselves everywhere; gender segregation in this context has the positive good that it helps people feel safe and secure; freedom of identity is an aspect of the positive good of liberty; but the three have combined to produce transgender bathroom laws (in places like North Carolina) that are roundly considered to be evil. But in any case, what we call evil is always some effort to reduce people back to animalism; to uproot their efforts to reach the good of being fully human. It may be physiological or emotional or ideological; it may affect people far away, or close to home, or even one\u2019s own self. But it is always that effort to reduce the good. The ideal of \u2018good\u2019 can exist on its own because good is actually the opposition to animalism: it is that rising to the human that we all in our heart-of-hearts want. The concept of \u2018evil\u2019 can only arise in opposition to the concept of good, or as a corruption of the concept of good. It\u2019s worth remembering that no one ever thinks they are evil; everyone thinks they are pursuing the good, and that evil is someone else\u2019s fault. But the dynamic is always more complex than that. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, there is no such thing as a FORCE that is evil, or good, acting on its own with motives. What good, and evil, are, are what we call ACTIONS. IE: They DESCRIBE an action or intent. So, if a person intends to do something evil, its not because \u201cevil\u201d is making them do it\u2026its because that\u2019s what we DESCRIBE things as. So, what is the opposite of an apple? Can an apple exist without some opposite of an apple? So, of COURSE good actions can exist if there are no bad actions. As good and bad are DESCRIPTIONS, all that happens if one is missing, is we don\u2019t need a WORD FOR IT. :D IE: If, in addition to good and evil, there was also govil, an act that makes people want to eat chocolate ice cream. So, a good act is fair, helpful and doesn\u2019t cause harm. An evil act is unfair, hurtful, and causes harm. A govil act is one that creates a desire for chocolate ice-cream. Is there an opposite to govil? Vanilla is not REALLY an \u201copposite\u201d of Chocolate, its merely another popular flavor of a contrasting color\u2026but, consider: Can chocolate exist even if there was no such thing as vanilla? :D If there was no vanilla in the world, would we need a word for it? And so forth. ",
