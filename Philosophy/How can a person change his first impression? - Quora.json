            "answer_text": "If you mean you\u2019ve met someone and are afraid you made a bad first impression \u2026 I\u2019ll give you the bad news first. [If on the other hand you want to know what to do to make a great first impression, that\u2019s a different subject; one I\u2019ll address in another post if you like.] But assuming that you\u2019re asking what to do if you feel you made a bad first impression, here\u2019s that bad news I promised. It\u2019s extraordinary hard to alter a first impression because the most important thing that happens during the first few seconds of someone meeting you - is trust. When you meet someone for the first time they will trust or distrust you in 0.05 seconds - five one-hundredths of a second. This was revealed by a study authored by Jonathan Freeman (NYU) and his colleagues called \u201cAmygdala Responsitivity to High-Level Social Information from Unseen Faces.\u201d If you felt you might have made a bad impression on someone, and your feeling is correct, then the odds are that they didn\u2019t trust you when they met you. Because trust is an absolutely instinctual emotion, regaining trust is not something that is possible. There is no such thing as \u201cearning trust.\u201d You can\u2019t earn something that is instinctually granted or denied. However, you can go for the next best thing - which is confidence. Now, unlike trust, confidence can be gained and earned over time. If in every interaction you have with that person, your actions are guided by three simple mantras: \u201cHonesty, Trust, and Putting the Other Person First.\u201d If you learn to be more honest than you have ever been. If you learn to be more trusting of that person than you have ever been. And if in all of your actions and interactions you are always putting the other person first, as time goes by, that person will develop a great deal of confidence that you will always be there for them. Confidence is not trust, but it\u2019s the next best thing. And with enough time and enough interactions with that person, confidence will come pretty close to trust. \u201cHonesty, Trust, and Putting the Other Person First.\u201d In my opinion, those are the three foundational stones of every great relationship. If you do those three things, the other person will almost always reciprocate \u2026 and if they don\u2019t \u2026 that\u2019s good information to know \u2026 and it\u2019s time for you to reevaluate that relationship. Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "Impression is a very important aspect in the life. Be careful and be alert while impressing others. Impression is an easy process where as suppression is an difficult stage. Impression is always dangerous in life. As it causes to various distractions which lead to negative mindset. If you want to change the first impression, don't expect only positive or good things to happen in life. Don't keep any expectations. Be ready to face the challenges. Question yourself, how was your first impression towards your family members ? and Was it possible to change ? the answer is \u201cno\". Likewise you cannot change. But if you wish to change the first impression, then need to exercise yourself in changing the process. Try to understand the reason for change. Better to impress yourself first and understand the feelings of the process. ",
