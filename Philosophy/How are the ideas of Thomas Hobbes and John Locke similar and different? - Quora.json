            "answer_text": "Can you answer Allyn Barragan's question: \"How are the ideas of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke similar and different?\" Yes I can. Summarily, Hobbes and Locke both believed in and espoused something called \"the Social Contract.\" The Hobbes was the first to declare that was how the rulers of his day maintained their rule over the masses, not by \"Divine Right\" (which they then claimed) but by the 'collective and unconscious consent of the masses.' He believed that without a strong, central Ruler --a Monarch--that society would devolve into Chaos and destruction. So he saw and approved of the rulers living lives of luxury by taxing the work of the commoners who, in turn lived lives that were, in his words, \u201cnasty, brutish and short.\u201d Locke agreed that there was a Social Contract in all Societies, but he took a different view of existence. While Hobbes believed that basic human existence depended on \u2018survival at any cost, total selfishness, and violence and barbarism\u2019 Locke declared that individuals had certain \u2018Natural Rights of life, liberty and property\u2019 which had to be earned and that the Social Contract between people and their governments existed to defend those rights which would result in the greater good for all society. While they both agreed that the social organization of society existed only because of the consent of the masses of its citizens, they disagreed on the purpose of the Social Contract. Hobbes, to keep society from devolving into Chaos, Locke, to protect the individual\u2019s Natural Rights and promote the greater good for all society. There were other areas as well, but these were the central differences. You can tell by history that Locke\u2019s ideas did produce the greatest, wealthiest societies on Earth while, today, proponents of Hobbes are even now, attempting to regain total control over the results.

            "answer_text": "You re asking concerning a widely recognized disputed issue turning on the question of how to interpret Locke\u2019s writings concerning the \u2018state of nature\u2019. And the issue is exactly what drives your question. What is the issue? Crucial or you would not be asking. It is the question of whether there are different conceptions of the state nature in Locke\u2019s account of it and that of Hobbes. Some argue that they are complimentary and some that the difference is efficient, leading to different conceptions of the legitimate government.. My opinion is that Locke is a liberal and Hobbes the conservative. using those terms in the way they are used at this moment in America. Those who argue that the philosophers are at one have an uphill struggle because Hobbes and Locke describe the state of nature very differently. Hobbes that it is nasty and brutish, Locke that it is just a like a legitimate state but lacking the pleasure of the government. Now, why does all this matter? Simple, these are the British philosophers and Britain does not have a constitution like the American one. This means that there are no founding fathers for Britain as there were for America as it struggled with its state of nature, in the culture which had evolved along the Eastern seaboard. So Britain was lacking those spectacular anchors which blessed America at its founding and only had the political science of Locke and Hobbes. So for Britain the nature of these two philosophies matters as a practical matter and their opinions stand-in for much of the intelligencing which was provided to America in a stupendous bounty of European philosophers. Just read the Federalist Papers! America had glorious midwifes for the birthing, brilliant philosophers of the day, men like Jefferson! ",
