            "answer_text": "As others have said, it\u2019s not really possible, as what we call \u201cbias\u201d is intrinsic to the ability to act. The best you can do is acquire the ability to treat your biases flexibly, sort of like pieces of clothing that you can switch between, or a pair of glasses that you can either wear or not wear. The good news is that this cognitive flexibility can be achieved by anyone in three steps! I\u2019ve handily provided a guide below. Step 1: Obliterate your value system. This usually happens involuntarily, say, due to a traumatic event, or a brush with mortality (death of a loved one, or near-death experience). It can also happen as a result of \u201creaching the conclusion\u201d of some status game you were playing, and realizing that there is no real payoff. The end result of this step is that everything you have been raised to believe is exposed as rootless.Step 2: Dwell in nihilism for a period of time. This stage conclusively eradicates any vestiges of the prior belief framework. During this stage, action is pretty much impossible, because action requires motivation, and all motivation has been destroyed. It is possible to \u201ccontinue doing whatever you\u2019ve been doing\u201d at this stage kind of like Wile E. Coyote running off the cliff \u2014 but there is a ticking time limit to one\u2019s ability to act in a state of moral rootlessness.Step 3: Realize it\u2019s more enjoyable to have enough beliefs to be able to act; tentatively start to re-acquire an intentionally curated set of biases. Once you look around enough, you\u2019ll realize that the people who are having fun have belief systems. In fact, you\u2019ll realize that joy and happiness may depend on having beliefs, and thus human happiness depends on re-entering the fray. You will start to pick and choose beliefs; you can try them on like hats. It will all seem kind of gross at first because after all you haven\u2019t solved the original problem (that none of these beliefs are justified). But you can get some security from the fact that it\u2019s now possible to remove any belief, or at least to temporarily subtract the belief and re-evaluate. You\u2019ll wind up in a position kind of like a scientist. You\u2019ll lean on biases as a way of making sense of the world, but you won\u2019t be attached to any particular bias, except as a kind of pure exercise in intellectual vanity. You\u2019ll no longer have \u201ctribal\u201d affiliation to a belief system.Good luck! ",

            "answer_text": "I think the first rule to avoid getting trapped in confirmation bias is to acknowledge that it will always be an issue, and that there is no way to be totally free from it. So we had best develop some techniques to minimize it, to control for it as much as possible. In my opinion, almost the whole of what we call \u201cthe scientific method\u201d is an attempt to come to grips with bias, particularly confirmation bias. We believe something as true, we notice evidence that is in agreement, and fail to notice evidence that is in conflict. And so all the evidence recorded is in favor of our \u201chypothesis\u201d - thus it is confirmed. One of the more powerful techniques in statistically based research is that of trying to prove \u201cthe null hypothesis\u201d - \u201cwhat would it take to prove that \u2018my idea\u2019 is worthless? how can I prove myself wrong?\u201d And you design your experiment in part to answer that specific question. You can set a particular statistical threshold for the odds that your results are more than random BS. You try to prove yourself wrong. I think that is a very good process, no matter what the inquiry. I don\u2019t need so much to try to prove myself right, my bias will do that just fine on its own. But if I really want to know something, I should start with an idea, and begin throwing rocks at it. When I have modified my idea enough that I can no longer knock it full of holes, then I might invite some palls (and even perhaps some enemies) to try their best - hand them some rocks - let them bash my idea in. (That is called \u201cpeer review\u201d by the way, and is another essential of the scientific method.) If it holds up to all that bashing, there is a chance that I am right. Popularly, we might call that technique \u201cplaying the devil\u2019s advocate\u201d and I think it is essential if one is to stay out of the confirmation bias swamp. Interestingly, I understand the old Hebrew concept of the devil, of Satan, is exactly that. Unless there is a prosecution, innocence is just a word without a meaning. the satan was not seen so much as an \u201canti-god\u201d as the accuser- a necessary function- the dark background by which the stars could be seen to shine. The biblical book of Job is an example. So you beat confirmation bias by not trying to eliminate it (a futile effort). Instead, you beat it by acknowledging it as inevitable, and designing your thought to deal with it. Partly, you turn your though on its head, and argue for the other side - the null hypothesis - the idea that my original thought is bogus. That way confirmation bias works in your favor as you try and find ways to poke holes in your idea. You use it, because you can\u2019t eliminate it.Science has worked with this idea for some 500 years now. ",

            "answer_text": "1. Understand Why It Happens (and Be Honest with Yourself About It) Reasoning is emotional. Neuroscience shows our feelings arise more quickly than our deliberations, which is likely tied to our evolutionary need to react quickly to environmental stimuli to survive. Basically, our fight-or-flight response kicks in when we\u2019re presented with facts that contradict our deeply held beliefs, before we have a chance to assess the new information rationally. That\u2019s why we must be conscious of what Chris Mooney warns: \u201cwhen we think we\u2019re reasoning, we may instead be rationalizing.\u201d That tendency leads us down the slippery slope of confirmation bias, which nudges us to collect information that supports our beliefs and ignore information that doesn\u2019t. Once you accept that we are wired to be biased, you can start overcoming your biases and move towards a higher state of objectivity. 2. Adopt the \u201cScout Mindset\u201d Adopting what Julia Galef calls the \u201cscout mindset\u201d is the first step in reducing your own bias. Scouts try to get an accurate picture of reality, even when it\u2019s unpleasant and inconvenient. Their self-worth isn\u2019t tied to being right, but to testing their own beliefs. They feel bad about themselves if they fall into black-and-white, right-or-wrong thinking, and they feel most proud of themselves when they collect new information and pursue their curiosity. In other words, the first step to is to change your relationship to truth. The more you prioritize finding truth over being its master, the more likely you are to be objective. 3. Look for Empirically Testable Facts In a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, researchers found that when religious participants were presented with a critical article on religion they were more likely to cite untestable evidence for their beliefs than those who were presented with a neutral article. This trend towards the \u201cuntestable\u201d cemented them in their beliefs because new information could not be used to verify or refute what they shared. Two additional studies from the same researchers found that the more untestable facts were presented to participants, the more entrenched in those beliefs they became. Focus on rejecting untestable beliefs and searching for testable facts. This will help you fight the desire to cling more deeply to your current beliefs and allow you to evaluate them less subjectively. 4. Build Hypotheses First We are taught to study information first and then we are tested on that same information afterwards with the goal of error reduction. However, this may teach us to reflexively believe what is in front of us. Getting it wrong, or specifically coming up with answers first and then comparing them with the correct information, can actually improve recall and learning. It may also help us look more critically at facts served to us by search engines and news articles. Holding onto doubt at the beginning staves off certainty at the end. 5. Change the Tools You Use to Find Answers Finally, if you must Google, avoid the risk of finding the most popular facts or the ones most associated with your search history by changing the tools you use to search for information. Instead of defaulting to Google\u2019s default search engine, test your theories and beliefs in Google Scholar. Google Scholar searches your terms against academic articles, which will force you to confront testable facts and wade through more information than you would normally to get to an answer. This method is not foolproof. Science itself can be biased, and theorists are human too, which means they are biased in favor of what they believe. Still, by looking at contrary articles on the same topic, you can start to get a sense of what is true. ",

            "answer_text": "Eliminate confirmation bias? Confirmation bias is the tendency to notice things that agree with existing beliefs more than one notices contradictory evidence. Not only is it impossible to completely excise this trait, it wouldn\u2019t even be rational to want such a thing. The human brain is a powerful organ, but it has very real limitations. We can\u2019t notice every detail. Observations have to be filtered if we are going to function. This happens at the very basic level \u2014 no one notices the blind spots of their eyes \u2014 and also at more abstract levels. For an example, if you are driving down the road looking for Sixth Avenue so you can make the correct turn, you are not going to retain Smallman Street \u2014 that isn\u2019t the road you need, so you discard the information as soon as you take it in. When you hear a crazy conspiracy theory about planes releasing chemicals into the atmosphere, you don\u2019t dedicate the same amount of mental effort to understanding that theory as you would to understanding the theory of immunity (at least I sincerely hope this is the case). You have limited cognitive potential, so you can\u2019t squander it. I am reminded of the movie A Beautiful Mind, which depicts the brilliant John Nash (Economist/Mathematician) falling prey to mental illness and identifying what he believed were patterns in the layout of words in American newspapers to be Soviet codes. His brilliant mind identified patterns, all right, but any sane individual would note that Russian spies could much easier hand off secret messages in person than puppet foreign news organizations. It would make no sense to waste time and energy on such an insane theory. Tunnel vision makes perfect sense much of the time. Confirmation bias is only a problem when it becomes an impediment to accepting actual evidence. I think a Bayesian perspective is helpful in determining when confirmation bias is justified or a problem. If the evidence is strong, then it should be analyzed. If the evidence is weak, then it may not be worth the effort. ",

            "answer_text": "Question: \u201cAre there any ways I can combat confirmation bias?\u201d Yes. One way we do this is to use the Scientific Method. Unfortunately this usually requires a great deal of work, perhaps a lab, or people to go out and gather data. It\u2019s not practical for one person to \u201cdo science\u201d much any more. But, this is one way we help to eliminate bias. One a personal level, left to our own recognizance, we have to do several things to check if we are suffering from bias. Simply start by asking yourself questions, through healthy self-doubt, \u201cIs what I\u2019m thinking real?\u201d \u201cIs what I\u2019m thinking related to something I honestly understand, or am I just assuming I understand it?\u201d Here we have to be careful because we want to believe ourselves. Generally, we like to be correct, and do not like to be incorrect. But to avoid bias, we must be willing at all times to be incorrect.We can learn what good argumentation is. Here is a little online book that I like to read. I\u2019ve read it many times and pondered it. This is just a beginning look into the art of argumentation. Argumentation is the art of supporting viewpoints. If someone argues, \u201cWe should all do X!\u201d Then they need to provide the arguments that support that position.https://bookofbadarguments.com/We can learn what various fallacies are. I do not know all these fallacies are but there are many listed on the following page in Wikipedia. If I did memorize all of these I\u2019m convinced I would think more clearly. As it is, I like to go down the list and just ponder in what areas of life I might have run into these issues. Fallacies help us to understand that arguments can be very wrong, but that fallacious arguments are all around us.List of fallacies - WikipediaThese two things, The Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments, and the list of fallacies in Wikipedia is a great start to learning how to doubt yourself in a healthy way, and replace any incorrect thinking (bias) with more correct thinking. What I mean by doubting yourself in a healthy way is simply realizing that we all can be wrong, and being open to being wrong, and being open to correcting things that seem wrong. Finding truth is a journey, and takes time. As far as I know, none of us have complete knowledge about anything. Life and the Universe is extremely complex. Humility is also required in the search for truth with the realization that we can never know the \u201cabsolute truth\u201d about anything. Some people feel that they are aware of a God or religion, and that God or religion contains absolute truth. I\u2019m not saying they are incorrect here, but I am not one of those people who thinks this way. If you want truth, you\u2019re going to have to fight yourself for it. I don\u2019t see a way around the above statement, but we can be easy on ourselves while in search of truth. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think there's an easy way. Kahneman's recent book on cognitive biases doesn't talk about the confirmation bias, but he makes an important claim about biases in general: despite having studied them extensively, he considers himself to be ~ as susceptible to the biases as before. Your intuitions will always bias you, and your judgments will always be dependent on a background of intuitions. However, there is room for slight improvements -- just don't expect a vaccine. I think the best you can do is to bias yourself in as many contradictory ways as possible. In other words, be the Devil's Advocate until the Devil seems like an Angel. And then turn on the Angel. Rinse, wash, repeat. This metaphor is usually applied to moral issues, but I suggest you do the same with scientific and philosophical positions. In philosophy, a similar bias is common except that people don't bias the information but the definitions they choose to couch their argument (this philosophical problem is common in the soft sciences). Just as both sides can rely on a different set of information, they can also rely on a different set of definitions. The latter is even more tricky because most people aren't used to asking themselves what they mean by words like \"probability\", \"freedom\", \"truth\", \"bias\", etc. It's by questioning the context and definitions that frame the information that you will diminish the strength of your biases. I sugget this questioning as complimentary to the Devil's Advocate role. Via the questioning, you find new perspectives, and as the Devil's Advocate, you embrace these new perspectives -- you bias yourself in their favour. The more perspectives you play around with, the more balanced your judgments. If you  take this far enough, then you'll realise that there's nothing certain and perfect belief. This can be paralysing. Some people become nihilists. But I believe our inquiries should serve to refine our actions, not paralyse them. So, when it's time for action,  the best you can do is to embrace your biased intuitions.  In more practical terms, the way you protect yourself against the confirmation bias is to draw information from sources with different biases, and to raise questions not just in the name of your own intuitions, but the intuitions of other people. To do this, you must first become familiar with how different people think. Indeed, I think that this integration of other personalities into your own is one of the main reasons why reading a book is good. I'm currently reading Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\". A few years from now, I doubt I'll remember his exact arguments or be able to define his method. However, the kinds of questions he raises will stick with me 'till death do us part. These kinds of questions, like all other kinds, are tools I use to discover new perspectives and moderate my conclusions. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve made progress in dealing with confirmation bias in myself. It\u2019s part of my efforts to be more self aware. I pause a lot to check in with myself when I am processing information. I especially try to get in touch with what I\u2019m feeling. If I\u2019m feeling some version of afraid, or angry, then I\u2019m at risk for not being open to information that conflicts with what I wish was true, and too open to information that supports what I already believe. If I\u2019m not in the right emotional state, I stop processing information, and instead do something emotionally healthy. Sometimes that is venting, but I try hard not to do that on quora. I question my motives regularly. Why am I thinking about this? Why am I reading this? Why am I typing this? What need am I trying to fill? I have three healthy needs I am trying to fill at quora. One is personal growth. By answering questions, I have to get in touch with what I\u2019m feeling and thinking, and find words to express myself. This is good for me. Hopefully people who take time to read things I write gain something worthwhile. Another need is social connection. Hearing what other people, especially people who are willing to identify themselves, have to say about things helps me understand other people and not feel so alienated and alone. I especially like hearing what people who are very different from me, but are reasonable, have to say. I feel less fear when I know that people who disagree with me are still decent, reasonable people. The third is find meaning by having worthwhile information and viewpoints. I don\u2019t have a lot of education or training. I used to believe that I knew a lot about something because I read one book about it, and I could imagine what else might be true. That\u2019s a part of what confirmation bias is. Believing something because it makes sense to me. There are some quora users that appear fairly knowledgeable. I keep trying to remind myself that just because it sounds reasonable and seems well sourced, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. It only increases the likelihood that it might be true. ",

            "answer_text": "The first step in protecting one's self from confirmation bias is knowing that \"confirmation bias\" is a thing. It sounds silly, but there are probably more people than not who have never heard of cognitive biases or the effects of said biases. After one has this awareness, there are at least a couple of different things that one can do. One could attempt to mitigate (or overcompensate?) by intentionally seeking out information that may be contradictory to your beliefs. For instance, let's say that one tends to watch/listen to Conservative media. One way to protect against confirmation bias would be to flip on MSNBC or be sure to read some Liberal commentators. The other option is to seek out people that may have contradictory beliefs (to yours). This option is usually a little more difficult because it forces people into situations that may be uncomfortable. The one suggestion I would make on this point is that it's important that you've found someone who won't \"blow up\" at you. It's no good for anyone when there's a shouting match. The first suggestion (contradictory information) is usually easier to try than the second (contradictory people), but some would say that the second suggestion is actually more effective. Why? Because a person may be able to more adequately rebut. ",

It\u2019s the tendency to look only for evidence or viewpoints that support one\u2019s point of view, no disconfirming evidence considered. How does one guard against it? Look for disconfirming evidence, always. The first practical step in King\u2019s method of Non-Violent Direct Action is to gather the facts before acting. And part of that step, as he describes it, is conscientiously looking for ways one could be wrong in one\u2019s view. As a philosophy professor this sort of self-criticism goes without saying when forming a view. You float an argument, then try to rip it down. Whatever survives the onslaught is seen as worth taking forward, though it will be subjected to criticism again and again. Key here is that you don\u2019t personally identify with the view. It\u2019s about the quality and validity of the view, not about you. Whether you like it, agree with it, is irrelevant. So not personally identifying is one terrific way to avoid confirmation bias, striking it at its root. The word \u201copinion\u201d used to be object focused. It meant taking a stab at the truth. Now it has come to mean self-expression, voicing your likes and dislikes through views. And so, we have talk radio, ideological divisiveness, bullshit parading as free speech. It\u2019s pretty dispiriting to anyone who cares about things related to truth. \u201cAlternative facts, fake news,\u201d Oh my god. Get over yourself. ",

Individuals do not like mental pressure thinking about contradicting values. They want to avoid conflicting thoughts. They choose to ignore such information and avoid people who persuade them to believe otherwise. People own their culture due to confirmation bias. They will focus on one idea and ignore the rest. The pre-existing values are more relevant to them than any other suggestion. They do not want to find whether there are some underlying truths or other possibilities worth exploring.

As an individual, you can take several steps to reduce the effects of confirmation bias in others. You can help others to control triggers that make them defensive about their ideas.

Research shows that as soon as we commit ourselves one way or another, we begin to filter information. This quickly turns into an emotional investment to achieve the outcome to which we committed. The lawyer is biased from the start. Good leaders that want to avoid confirmation bias posit a question, but then have others go forth and gather evidence and present arguments. This allows the leader or judge to remain impartial or at a minimum less partial towards one direction or another. Those that go forth to gather evidence become highly biased, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. Bias is a key factor in motivation which results in a deep, rich search for information. The biased individuals bring more to the table, allowing the judge to make a better ruling. Why humans reason?

Once you\u2019ve realized that you tend to engage in confirmation bias, this insight should be enough to prevent you from engaging in the same again. An external action that you can take to prevent this tendency is to actively search for contradictory evidence for any beliefs you hold. That should help you form a more balanced opinion of the issue at hand. You can also try to discuss a single issue with four or five different people. You will find that each of them will add some of their unique insights that will broaden your perspective. At a deeper level, confirmatio Continue Reading",

As a scientist, long in the tooth I have all too often had to scream inwardly \u201cyou fool how did you fall for that!\u201d when something we were told was gospel was shown to be almost completely and utterly wrong, And it is so much worse when you just taught a bit of biology, to have to think OH SHIT, i got that wrong, have to rewrite for next semester. You do get a bit of a buffer, you have to expect as a good scientist that things are sometimes not how you were taught. But do any of use ever have zero confirmation bias. But to answer the question simply in four words: I don\u2019t th Continue Reading",

Emotion based memory valuations is the root cause of most cognitive bias. Example: If you hired a Mexican American to repair your roof and he ran off with your money. This will create and emotionally valued memory that can bias a future decisions about hiring Mexican Americans. Even though you don\u2019t believe that judging all Mexican Americans by the actions of one person. By observing (being perceptive of) emotional influences while making decisio Continue Reading",

            "answer_text": "I find that most destructive biases come from the emotions rather than the thoughts because most people tend to believe what it makes them feel good to believe and consruct what appear to be rational thoughts to defend their beliefs. In order to overcome this you need to look underneath your thoughts and examine the feelings that are driving them. Some people are much more vulnerable to this way of thinking than others, but we all do it. If, for instance, you have developed an irrational fear of doing something based on a past experience that no longer has any relevance but are completely unaw Continue Reading",

Our circumstances and acquaintances influence us in manners far too chaotic and numerous to try to actively control. However, some ways to minimize the effects of confirmation bias, is through understanding that our worldview, especially about society and emotional affairs, is/are constructed models. I call it a model, because it aids us in understanding systems, but due to the sheer complexity of real life and human limitations, we tend to ignore, downplay, or emph Continue Reading",
