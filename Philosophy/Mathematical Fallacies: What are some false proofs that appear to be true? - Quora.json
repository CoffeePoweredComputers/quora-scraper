            "answer_text": "That the sum of all natural numbers (which are POSITIVE), is NEGATIVE.  [math]1+2+3+4...... = -1/12 [/math] An equation seemingly so beautiful that it has found it's way on many answers in Quora. An equation which is obviously intuitively wrong, and yet when Ramanujan writes it, and you get to know that it has had string theory applications, you begin to doubt yourself. Can this really be true?  Maybe there's something fishy about the proof? The proof: We take three sums, defined below. [math]S1 = 1 -1+1-1+1-1......[/math][math]S2 = 1-2+3-4+5-6.......[/math][math]S3 = 1+2+3+4+5+6.....[/math] Now the proof goes as follows, S1(also known as Grandi's series) will alternate between 0 and 1, depending on the number of terms. Therefore, we can consider the average of these two possibilities, 1.e. [math]1/2[/math]. Add S2 to itself, after shifting each term once to the right in the second S2 sequence.[math]S2=1-2+3-4+5-6....[/math][math]S2= 0+1-2+3-4+5...[/math] (sorry I'm having to write the 0).[math]2S2=1-1+1-1.......=S1[/math][math]S2=1/4[/math] Now, [math]S3-S2:[/math][math]1+2+3+4+........[/math][math]-1+2-3+4.......[/math][math]=4(1+2+3....) = 4S3[/math] Therefore, S3=-S2/3 = -1/12 The problems: A series is said to converge absolutely if   If that doesn't happen, it is not converging. So, S1 cannot be said to be equal to 1/2, because the series is alternating between 0 to 1, and not converging to half at any point of time.  However, there may be a way to assign a sum to a divergent series. Cesaro's summation states that, Let {an} be a sequence, and let   be the kth partial sum of the series  If the average of this sequence of terms converges to a value, then we say that the series is Cesaro summable. For example, if S1 is taken, the terms, in successive order, are:[math]1,1/2,2/3,2/4,3/5,3/6......[/math]This is clearly a Cesaro summable series converging to 1/2.However, the key is that the existence of Cesaro summability only means that there may be a way of assigning a measure to this series; it may still not EQUAL to this series. So, this is potentially an error. But let's ignore this for once. Look at the series S3. Take the series of it's partial terms. What is it? The sequence of sums:[math]1,3,6,10,15,.......[/math] The average of the sequence above:[math]1,4/2,10/3,20/4, ......[/math]The sequence above is clearly diverging, so S3 is not Cesaro summable. But then, the operation S3-S2, subtracting a Cesaro summable series from one that isn't, isn't consistent! And, we have just proved that S3 (the required sum) isn't Cesaro summable anyway. The intriguing bit:-1/12 IS ASSOCIABLE with something related to the sum of natural numbers. The general term for sum of first n natural numbers is [math]n(n+1)/2[/math]Convert this to an integral form, and find the integral sum between -1 and 0, it's roots. You may not be surprised by what you find! ",

Consider two variables a and b, which are equal. So, a = bLets the do some math around the equation. 94a = 94b (by multiplying the l.h.s. and r.h.s. with 94). That makes, (100-6)a = (100-6)b Now,100a - 6a = 100b - 6b 100a - 100b = 6a - 6bi.e.,100(a-b) = 6(a-b) this makes100 = 6 (a-b)/(a-b)    and you know x/x is 1. So, Here it is 100 = 6 ",
