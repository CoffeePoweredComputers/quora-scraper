            "answer_text": "It is a mistake to distinguish between the two disciplines based on methods. Both disciplines use both quantitative and qualitative methods. It is also a mistake to suggest that qualitative methods are not as scientific as quantitative methods. They have different functions, but you can't do science without both kinds of methods. Anyone who thinks that quantitative data analysis is more scientific has no idea of how the categories that all quantitative methods are based on came into being. You can't measure anything if you haven't defined what you want to measure. And you can't define anything without using qualitative methods. Categorization is the process of defining things and that is exclusively a qualitative activity, although it is certainly informed by quantitative work. If methods can not distinguish the disciplines, then what does? I think you have to look at the emphasis of each discipline. Sociology is more sociological. A tautology, I know, but what I mean is that it is more interested in broader trends. Sociologists do look more at census data and large surveys. They want to know how large groups of people behave. But many sociologists would probably fit quite well in Anthropology departments. Anthropologists are more personal, in general. They look at stories and look for meaning in stories. They look at cultures and myths. They approach things from a more individualistic perspective, although they are also quite interested in groups of individuals. They do tend to use qualitative methods more often, but they certainly use quantitative methods a lot, as well, especially archeologists. But they often use quantitative data to put their studies in context. Then again, so do sociologists, and where I work, I would say that the majority of sociology PhD candidates use qualitative methods, as well. They tend to investigate issues that are more narrowly defined, but that lack specific definitions. Thus they have to do qualitative work. Still, it is in context of a larger social perspective. I was talking to a sociologist a few days ago. I was asking about the speaker's topic and why it seemed so anthropological. The speaker was a reporter who had investigated immigrants, and told the story of travel across Mexico. It was a very personal story, because he was there with the immigrants, experiencing what they experienced. He ended up with a price on his head from Mexican drug lords. It seemed like anthropology to me, yet he was sponsored by the Sociology department. Not his fault, I suppose. I don't know if he claimed to be in any discipline. But it is illustrative of the relationship between qualitative and quantitative methods.  While the stories our speaker told were personal, the issues they raised were all quite global. Issues of the power of drug lords in Mexico. The influence of coyotes and the power they have as a result of American attempts to build a wall at the border. The plight of Central American immigrants who travel illegally in both Mexico and the US. The fact that coyotes offer each woman a condom, so that when she gets raped, she will not necessarily get pregnant. Should she refuse, she would be killed.  These are personal details, and yet, writ large, they amount to vast patterns that have an impact on all of society. All of us, even if we don't know it. These people from Central America want to be here so badly, they spend all their money and risk getting raped or killed in hot rail cars to come here.  There is much overlap between Sociology and Anthropology. They certainly employ many similar methods. But I would say that Anthropology focuses at a more personal or community level and that the larger the groups get, the more we are talking about Sociology. However, I think this distinction is not a very good one, and I don't really know if there are any good, well-accepted definitions of the two disciplines. The sociologist I was talking to told me that she didn't think there was that much difference between anthropology and sociology. I think that people who worry about the distinction are mostly worried about the budget for their department. I think that Liberal Arts Colleges would like nothing more than to be able to combine departments and cut budgets. And the departments themselves desperately want to maintain their viability. ",

            "answer_text": "These two fields are usually considered to be quite similar, and are sometimes offered as one program at universities. While their purposes and methodology are historically a bit different, there's been more crossover between anthropology and sociology lately. So while these are widely regarded as the basic differences between them, it's entirely possible for anthropologists to quantitative methods and sociologists to use qualitative methods, etc. Both fields are social sciences that study human beings and human behavior. Sociology Driving question: What is society, and how does it shape and reflect human nature?Emphasis on society and its origins and development (social classes, institutions and structures, social movements)Has its historical basis in studying industrialized Western societies (\"us\")Quantitative methodology (survey & sampling) - viewed as a harder social scienceMacro-level focus - studies how the larger society and social trends affect individuals, families, and communitiesMore oriented towards solving problems (e.g. housing, welfare, etc.)Incorporates economics and statistics to a larger degreeAnthropology Driving questions: What does it mean to be human? How do humans behave and why?Emphasis on culture and its physical and social characteristics (kinship, language, religion, gender, art, etc.)Has its historical basis in studying non-Western cultures or \"the other\" (\"them\")Qualitative methodology (ethnography) - viewed as a softer social scienceMicro-level focus - studies how individuals, families, and communities engage with the larger society and social trendsMore oriented towards human understanding and the \"bigger picture\"Incorporates material/physical culture (archaeology, biophysical evidence)Aspects of these two fields are remarkably similar, and growing increasingly so. In fact, modern social anthropologists are beginning to look at Western cultures, while sociologists are beginning to apply anthropological methods to their work. But this is the most basic summary I can give without getting muddied up in the theories that shape and drive critical thought and analysis in each field. ",
