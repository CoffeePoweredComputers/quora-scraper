            "answer_text": "Yes, of course. It is one of the official recommendations of the government. Like Trump, the current Mexican president is a bit\u2026 unreliable on his advice and how he himself follows it. But Mexico is not its president, and the Mexican government and health department is saying the right things. As of April, it\u2019s mandatory in Mexico City and many other locales.  They even make then \u201cLucha Libre\u201d style.  Mexico has a central location for all official government advice and notices about Covid-19 at Inicio - Coronavirus. Daily report, what to do, mask advice, a regional \u201csemaphore-level\u201d status so you know the local risk level without numbers (the numbers are also there under \u201cDatos Abiertos\u201d) and even a superhero, \u201cSusana Distancia\u201d (\u201cHer Healthy Distance\u201d - get it?), designed to teach children (and the child-at-heart) to keep a few feet apart.   So whatever you read in the news media, or whatever silliness the president may say in his morning ramble which will be worldwide news because.. well, reasons, the official government requirement continues to be: Listen to your local authorities, and follow the color scheme for what is allowed or not based on the epidemiological risk - see Sem\u00e1foro - Coronavirus for more details.
