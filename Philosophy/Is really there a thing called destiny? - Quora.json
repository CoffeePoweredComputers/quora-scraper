            "answer_text": "There is no destiny in this world of humanity. This world of humanity (Martyaloka) is called as Karmaloka (Evemkarmachitolokah\u2026 Veda). Karma means action with full freedom. The upper worlds, called as Bhogalokas, are destined because those are the worlds in which the destined fruit of your actions done here is to be enjoyed. The concept of destiny can be mentioned in this world also in the form of Samskara or the psychological trend carried from several previous births. The soul from the upper world is born in this world with small remains of the previous psychological trends only after enjoying the fruits. Therefore, the actions done in this world are according to the previous balance of psychology only. In that way, the destiny can be maintained here. But, this psychology can be changed in this world by meeting a Satguru, who can change the psychology, which is a form of wrong knowledge, through right knowledge. God will help in the chance of such meeting provided your psychology is good. Therefore, the fruits reaped in this world are the fruits of your own actions done in this world based on your psychology, which has a freedom to change by meeting a Satguru. It is not good to encourage the worship, which is only meant for removing the difficulties. It becomes a sort of encouragement to corruption and soaping. Still, God encourages by giving good fruits for such worships because any concept in the beginning meant for masses is always blended with defects (Sarvarambhahidoshena\u2026 Gita). In course of time, you will lose interest on the solutions of your difficulties and get fixed in God. The real devotion comes up at a later stage. The child always loves his father since he gets chocolates from father. But, as the child grows and becomes adult, he loves his father irrespective of the chocolates. The fire in the beginning is covered by smoke. But, in course of time, the smoke disappears and the fire alone burns fully. Hence, the false devotion becomes the stepping stone for the real devotion as time proceeds. Therefore, God really answers the worship by removing your difficulties to build-up real devotion in course of time. It is not correct to say that such worship is only to build-up psychological confidence. In such case, there should be no result for the worship. But, real results are seen actually after the worship. The Lord says that He is responsible for everything but not responsible for anything (Kartahamapi\u2026 Gita). This contradiction can be removed if you understand that God is the creator of everybody and everything, but, is not the creator of the direction of any action and hence, is not bound by the deed and fruit. The bull carries you to the forest on your direction only where you are beaten by the robbers and the bull is not beaten. Similarly, if the bull takes you to the house of your relatives in the city by your direction, you receive the honor from your relatives and the bull is not honored. In both cases, bull is the power of your journey and is responsible for your reaching the goal but at the same time, the bull is not affected by the direction of the action and fruits. This is the meaning of the Vedic statement, \u201cAbadhnanpurushampashum\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't know destiny is there or not,becoz in life what we plan for our future sometimes do not work, what we never think that will happens.nobody wishes sorrow, upset in health issues,death of our loved people but it suddenly happens that time people will say this is called destiny. I think destiny is the God who gives us right messages to our life. If we do some mistakes in the past knowing or not knowingly we will get the punishment in future with out fail but we should have realising capacity. If we do good things al's God will bless you in future in your hard times. ",
