            "answer_text": "Is there such thing as a 2 dimensional object in our 3 dimensional universe ? I'd like to challenge the Oxford dude, and say that, yes it is indeed possible to build a 2d object. There is a recent new discovery, that electrons don't have electric dipole moment and that they're spherical [1] This means that there is no requirement, as far electro magnetic fields are concerned, that the electron is supposed to have any spatial dimension. It doesn\u2019t need to occupy any space and it could well be a perfect point particle. So it's possible to build a perfect two dimensional electron gas. A 2d object!. Some techniques include, confining a bunch of electrons perfectly to a 2d plane using lasers inspired from the laser based techniques such as laser cooling [2] and optical lattices [3] to create negative temperatures. I can't go into detailed experimental design because it's never been done before. But just speculating on how it could be done. And believe me it certainly could be done. Just wait for 10 to 20 years, someone will probably publish something.  Now this is much more interesting than the \u201c quasi\u201d 2d objects that are already created on the laboratory and even commercially! These are of course the 2d electron gases. Or should I say quasi-2d electron gases compared to what we just discussed. There are two examples I\u2019m aware of, graphene and graphene inspired nanosheets [4] and thin films on wafer substrates created by atomic layer deposition and other techniques [5] I'm sure there many, many more. I wanted to take this opportunity to write a more detailed explanation about these 2d systems , like one of opening a band gap for graphene, stanford\u2019s graphene transistor, quantum well lasers and LEDs in a way that hopefully a non expert could understand , for my quora blog. But I don't have that time right now, perhaps another time.  But I'm going to leave you with a tit bit about graphene. Graphene is a (ahem \u2018quasi\u2019) two dimensional material made of one atom thick layer of structured carbon. It's electrically conductive. And because of its structure it only conduct on the flat plane of the material. It can't conduct on any plane perpendicular to it. Heres the thing, this behavior continues, even case of highly ordered graphite from which graphene is exfoliated from. That makes electric conduction (and I also presume thermal and magnetic too) anisotropic. That's two-dimensional behavior in a three-dimensional object for you!

            "answer_text": "No, because an \u201cobject\u201d is generally defined as a tangible composite of atoms or other particle constructs (i.e. the sun has relatively few atoms, but a lot of nuclei and unbound electrons in a gravitationally bound plasma) Since such constructs necessarily exist in 3D space (an atom is a 3D object), then any composite of them will exist in 3 dimensions. You can't make a true 2D object out of 3D things - and since atoms are 3D, that severely restricts you. However, you can have 2D \u201cthings\u201d, if you lose the \u201ctangible\u201d requirement. For example - the image in a mirror exists in a 2D plane, it has no \u201cthickness\u201d - but that's not an \u201cobject\u201d. ",
