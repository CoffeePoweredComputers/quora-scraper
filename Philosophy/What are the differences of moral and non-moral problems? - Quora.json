            "answer_text": "Moral problems affect other people. Non-moral problems do not affect other people The minimum conception of morality, from Rachels, James. The Elements of Moral Philosophy, 3rd edition: \u201cMorality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one\u2019s conduct by reason\u2014that is, to do what there are the best reasons for doing\u2014while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of each individual who will be affected by what one does. The paragraph immediately preceding states, emphasizes, that there is a requirement of impartiality which equals \u201cproscription against arbitrariness.\u201d It is a rule that forbids us from treating one person differently from another when there is no good reason to do so. [author\u2019s emphasis] I believe that the Minimum Conception of Morality is a fundamental element of moral philosophy, like a fundamental particle, regarding its preciseness in definition. Non-moral problems, by not affecting other people, are not moral problems. Who can marry to whom, is not a problem, just opinion or judgment, certainly not a state matter unless you live in a totalistic society which controls everything and watches everything. Cannabis use, in relation to all other drugs, alcohol (a drug) or pharma, is a non-crime. It is also a non-moral problem because it leads more to pacifism than to aggression, it helps prevent Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia, is still the least toxic substance used to decrease eye pressure, helps patients with chronic illness that is not helped by any conventional or current means. Claiming that Cannabis affects other people to the extent that it is a prison-worthy offense just to use or have or cultivate the plant is unjust.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced legislation (S. 3174) , the Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act, to remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and to provide funding for the expungement of criminal records for those with past marijuana convictions.

            "answer_text": "Virtually any questions can be linked to moral questions. Morality is really about making wise, virtuous decisions, i.e. doing the right thing. It\u2019s hard for most people to understand morality, when most people haven\u2019t figured out the answers to the important questions of life. Even the question about dying one\u2019s hair can have implications concerning virtue and morality; for instance, your hair style may be immodest, be designed to draw attention to you out of weakness in your personality and insecurities, or it might be designed to send a false message about you, which is tantamount to lying.What few seem to understand is the importance of free choice and how that relates to morality. Virtually all things evil are things that limit free choice. At the same time, if you don\u2019t have freedom to choose, then morality is moot, because you were not able to make a choice but were forced to do the right thing. ",
