            "answer_text": "There are a bunch of criticisms that can be levelled against it, ranging from the vague to the fairly concrete. Here are two that seem to me particularly interesting. Quantum mechanics seems to show us that we could never, even with unlimited resources, actually measure the state of everything in the universe (or even in a human brain) and then apply rules that would predict exactly what it\u2019s going to do next. Not even in principle. It\u2019s not only that the outcome of quantum measurement are mathematically truly random, but also that we have to make a choice about what to measure, which influences the thing we\u2019re trying to measure.So this ends up resembling the metaphorical philosophical question \u201cIf a tree falls in a forest and no-one sees it fall, does it really fall?\u201d. If we assert that there is a deterministic mechanism but we can never hope to watch it in action in enough detail to predict what it will do, and that appears to be fundamentally impossible even for a god (operating within the laws of physics), how do we know the universe is really deterministic? We can assert that it is, but we cannot prove it.These \u201crandom\u201d effects make their way very easily into the macroscopic world, even in the case of many quite simple systems. They are more the norm than the exception. The fact that we have to make choices that determine what random outcome we observe is a problem for any attempt to prove that the universe is deterministic. It throws into question the whole notion of everything having an existing state, upon which determinism is predicated.If human brains are deterministic, why do we experience emotion? A car engine would not be expected to feel anything; if it did, its emotions could not influence how its engine works without violating physical laws. Its emotions would therefore be a useless and surprising phenomenon. Even though the human brain is much more complex, the same idea would apply to it. The key difference is, car engine are built to be as deterministic and quantifiable as possible, whereas the human brain cannot be fully measured and quantified to the point of predicting behaviour to any significant extent. There are experiments that claim to be able to predict a person\u2019s future choices, but few philosophers or scientists consider them to actually show that any freely-willed action can be predicted in advance with any reliability. They show only that we mentally \u201cgear ourselves up\u201d to do things, which we already know. Often we then suddenly change our minds.A related point is that G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems show us that we cannot always expect to predict what a system will do, even if it is deterministic, except by actually running that system or an equivalent system. Often a system will run indefinitely, and we cannot know (without running it) whether it will ever stop. However the no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics tells us that we cannot create exact copies of any system unless we first carefully prepare it in a particular state that we determine. This means that we cannot create an exact copy of a brain in order to figure out what it will do, for example. If a brain was a system that had been arranged so as to be as deterministic as possible, like a car engine or a digital computer (which are deterministic except when they aren\u2019t \u2014 which is when we consider them to have \u201cgone wrong\u201d), that wouldn\u2019t be a problem \u2014 but the brain is not such a system, and neither are most of the system that we are surrounded by. So while we can contrive system that behave deterministically most of the time, providing we don\u2019t look too closely and we discount events that aren\u2019t supposed to happen, we don\u2019t have a solid basis for arguing that all systems are deterministic, nor that they are random. A counter argument is the argument from incredulity that a system \u201cmust\u201d either be random or deterministic \u2014 because, what else could it be? Only something that we cannot imagine, or not using logic. However, such systems clearly do exist, and must exist, due to inherent mathematical limitations of mathematical logic. No matter how we set about analysing a system logically, ultimately we come to a point where we are stuck with axioms that cannot be proven using logic itself and cannot be said to derive from other axioms, unless you commit to an infinite series of axioms which you say must exist and which do not follow any discernible pattern, even though time and space prevents you from listing them.

            "answer_text": "It is crazy that I got drawn into this by trying to rationalize time travel in my novel. Here are problems with hard determinism: 1.) It does not explain the first cause, for the beginning of the universe began without being attached to a chain of prior events. Thus something free will/chaotic/independent was the first cause, not a dterministic one. 2.) The theory of determinism is based on the methodology of cause and effect, which was created by humans to explain how the universe appears to us. Determinism itself points to the fact that humans are limited in our view of the universe, flawed at worst. While it is true that for someone to \u201cgrasp straws you need straws to grasp\u201d, we must be skeptical of any theory that claims to be able to define existence in its entirety. 3.) Morality or the understanding of some kind of right or wrong does not exist if free will does not exist. The understanding of morals is not beholden to neither reason(cause or effect) or emotions(desires, pleasures, or the lack of desires and pleasures). The need to do good or evil often leads us into situations that have no long term or short term impact on anyone or anything involved. It can be nonsensical and undesirable with no benefits, actual or imaginary. 4.) On this one I can't explain a lot because I am still working on it myself but I believe the act of learning and rebelling is free will. The nessecity to learn becomes no longer important after a certain point in history in a deterministic universe. Likewise rebelling against logic and knowledge ceases to exist after a certain point as well. Since neither are true it casts a poor light on pure determinism. Sorry I can't be more specific. 5.) Finally\u2026.. This argument is the final point. The fact that determinists will go to their grave never accomplishing anything should not affect them but it does. This knowledge changes the way they interact and think as they advocate their cause. Free-willers on the other hand will continue on as they always have. Think on that. Here is a quote from one of my favorite book series Fablehaven by Brandon Mull: \u201cOur beliefs don't always harmonize with our instincts, and our behavior doesn't always reflect our beliefs. ... We wage war between the person we are and the person we hope to become.\u201d Free will and determinism only work together through intelligent design. ",
