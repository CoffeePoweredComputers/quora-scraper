            "answer_text": "By that, I assume you mean, having created the ideal world, there are no more goals to reach (hence you second \"ideals\").  With no goals to reach, would that then be 'ideal'? That's a subjective question, not objective.  Each person's ideal is their own, so let's say my ideal world is where everyone cares for animals and is a vegetarian.  Now if I then get to a world where that is the case, it really doesn't mean there are no other ideals, or goals, to shoot for.  It also doesn't mean there aren't millions of others who wish for a world of hunting and meat dinners, so they still have an ideal to shoot for. If by ideal, you would like to mean unequivocally perfect, then I would suggest the only way to do that is to lobotomize the citizenry to accept what is now some perfection - people now show themselves to get bored with what they've originally wanted or thought would be perfect.

            "answer_text": "Hi David, my take on this is: There are many definitions of the word 'ideal'.   I would quote 2 for the purpose of setting out this view: 1.  A conception of something that is perfect. 2.  Something that exists only in the imagination. Basically a world that is ideal does not exist and that is the truth of the matter.  Therefore the question cannot be answered in real terms, only imaginatively! ",
