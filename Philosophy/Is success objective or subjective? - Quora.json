            "answer_text": "Success is relative, because it depends on the way you define it. Some chosen criteria may be objective. A successful writer will hardly ever make as much money as a successful CEO. But a successful CEO will hardly be influential to as many people as a successful writer. And Nobel-winning writers are hardly known by as many people as paperback nobel writers. So, we have entirely different definitions of success at play. People who are anonymous can also have their own definitions of what success may look like for them. My mother never finished high school and always earned barely more than minimum wages. She raised three boys mostly alone and they all became more educated and had better salaries than she ever got in her life. Before she passed away, she used to say her work was done (I disagreed). She never made the money the CEO made or influenced as many people as the writer did, but who\u2019s not to say she was successful? More than that, all those definitions of success are objective within their own logic. The writer touches lots of people; the CEO makes lots of money; my mother made her next generation better off than her own. You can have subjective measures of success, too. I feel successful for a job well done, even if you may think I should feel successful for something else. A religious man can feel more successful than his neighbors for feeling his faith makes him a more complete person. And we can never forget \u201cWoman\u201d, the beautiful tribute John Lennon wrote for Yoko Ono, manifesting his gratitude to her \u201cfor showing me the meaning of success\u201d. That was after a period of living as a househusband, ten years after disbanding the band that, according to himself, was more famous than Jesus Christ. Beautiful, beautiful song.  But anyway success is always relative to the way we define it. ",

            "answer_text": "It seems to me that using the word success about ones self would be subjective and others using the word success about you would be objective. In the same way, another person using the word success about their self would be subjective as well.Having made that distinction in how one sense of how subjective and objective are commonly used, there is the issue still that humans can't actually become totally objective and can only hope to become \"more objective\"when considering the terms subjective and objective in a more literal sense. The English language often has several senses of definition for the same terms. This goes to illustrate the importance of additional context when wanting to formulate a clear communication. An additional context that the question does not contain with no details. There are ways of becoming \"more objective\", using empirical methods and using reason to a higher degree than emotion or intuition. How much \"more\" objective can one become using these methods? Quite a lot more objective, especially compared to how some people adopt very low reason perspectives, which leads to very low objectivity in their perceptions. Ironically, success will always be partially subjective and partially objective, and depends on the metric one uses to measure success. Some people measure success by an objective metric, such as financially, and some people measure success by a subjective metric, such as feelings of contentedness or happiness.I don't think there is one decisive answer to your question. The answer is somewhere along the spectrum of more or less subjective or objective and seems to be a conscious choice for some and an unconscious \"go with the flow\" perspective.My suggestion to you is that you may be able to find a balance by accident but that it is more likely that you will find a balance deliberately.
