            "answer_text": "\"That what you seek, is seeking you.\" - Remy This is one of my favourite quotes of all time. Why, because it can mean so much to so many people. And each of us will have a different definition, or answer to that question. But when it comes to what the best philosophy of life to live by, well then it comes down to understanding our personal story, and how we live it. Are we connected to our Authentic selves or are we living a completely disconnected life? See this photo below: That\u2019s me on the right from a few weeks ago, enjoying some long overdue summer weather. And that\u2019s my buddy Craig Cherlet, who gave me advice, that changed my life. About 4 years ago, while at the same corporate job, Craig helped me understand that if I wanted start doing more of what I loved, if I wanted to share my story with the world, and start living my authentic life, I didn\u2019t have to wait for my book to get published in the NYTimes, all I had to do was start writing about what it was that helped me reach my goals in life, so I could inspire others to do the same\u2026and all I had to do was start writing those stories on the internet\u2026And the rest is history! My website, link below, has been read around the world, in over 100 countries, because I think, I hope, it helps people reach their goals. Plan and simple. The philosophical question I ask again and again on the site is, \u2018what is happiness to you, and how can you take steps to get there, or maintain it, if you\u2019ve already found it: The-Inspired.com: Tools, Tactics and Habits to Help You Reach Your Goals The first question to ask is for you!\u2026  I have a question for you...whats your story? All of us have a story. All of us started somewhere. Some of us come from loving families, while others had a much harder journey into life. So, what's your story? And how does your story align with the current life you are living today? Do you own your days, or do you get dragged through them, like I did for decades, until I finally started to change what I did each day? So, What's my story? And what are the top 5 realizations I\u2019ve had in my life? Well, I wanted to share that with you, so you know exactly why The-Inspired exists today. And how it might be able to help you in your journey, in whatever personal goals you're working on now, or thinking about starting soon. But, if you don't feel like, or have time to read this, you can go to the bottom and click on the link below, or here to visit our 'Inspired Foundations' section... Ok, have your cup of coffee ready? Or glass of wine perhaps? If so, let's begin! Here's my story... My name is Goran Yerkovich, and in December of 2016 I'd hit a new rock bottom in my life. But the thing was, on the surface, my life seemed perfect; I was making great money consulting in the corporate world as a Business Analyst, my wife and I owned property, and a luxury sports car paid in cash, we also did yearly vacations travelling around the world to incredible, exotic places. And I had a wealth of friends and family and most importantly, a loving marriage, and yet something was still missing. It was then, sitting in my office, feeling depressed and not sure why, that I stumbled on a Tony Robbins video on youtube explaining that... Realization #1: The decisions and choices we make in life that will empower us to live the life intended for us. I realized the journey I was on, putting all my energy in the corporate world, and making money, and more money and then spending it on material things, was not living my authentic life, and was failing to give me true, deep, rewarding happiness. Realization #2: I was not doing the things I knew I was placed on this earth to do. So slowly, in Dec 2016 I made a few big decisions and started taking massive action. With some planning and budgeting, and the emotional support of my wife, and a good friend, I decided to take a break from the corporate world and figure out exactly who I was, and what I was meant to do. Realization #3: Changing your life means taking massive action in your life. In that time off, I started with a list of 7 things I wanted to be, or do. And over time, in trying them all, I realized what items in the list truly represented my authentic self. Over the past 3 years I realized my love, passion, and talent for storytelling and writing. Realization #4: Take Action, the biggest mistake people make is not starting on something because they worry they might not have it all right. Once that realization set in, I would spend almost every single day writing, six or seven days a week, some days just 30 mins, some days 8 hours. Over the years I've written hundreds of articles, including real life stories, self-help articles, or short fiction. I now know with 1000% certainty, that I love writing and storytelling. I also realized what I wrote about mattered; inspiring others to reach their goals in life matters deeply to me today, as much as it did when I started 3 years ago. So today, still on this new rewarding journey, I'm proud to say I am a writer, an internet entrepreneur, and life coach. I'm also the founder, and principle author of The-Inspired.com, an online magazine filled with tools, tactics and habits to help readers reach their goals in life. The-Inspired's articles are currently read by thousands each week in over 100 countries, and I was recently published in Fatherly | Dad Advice for Parenting, Gear, Life & More, and syndicated on MSN, Yahoo and Flipboard which has reached millions. I certainly wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019ve \u2018made it,\u2019 but I know I\u2019m on the right journey for me, one that I hope inspires and motivates others to work and accomplish their goals in life, and live their authentic lives too. Because waking up each day and doing something you love, something that fulfills you, is an amazing way for anyone to spend the rest of their life. Realization #5: None of what I accomplished would have been possible without \"Inspired Foundations\" - our anchors in life. Inspired foundations, are like life foundations. They cover the basics, like how we live each day, what we do, and don't do, and how we interact with ourselves, and with each other, which add up to making today a great one, or a miserable one. If you'd like to learn more visit our Inspired Foundations click here, and our Start here page which has a neat little diagram explaining what its all about. And, I hope these articles help you in journey and in whatever goals await. -Goran Yerkovich  ",

            "answer_text": "Hello, I am an 18 year old boy, and with that being said i don't have the same life experence as others. I have died before, lost before, and have giving up before. Yet I have also lived, gained, and most importantly loved before. From my adventures of life I have found a few things to live by Do not let the dream of tomorrow limit your today. Mind over Matter, if it doesn't matter then you shouldn\u2019t mind You need the lows to appreciate the highs in life Their are no trailers on a hearse You create your future, nobody else Failure is your greatest success, look towards it to teach you and inspire you You can either do things right or twice Inspire to be yourself, not anyone else People are not necessarily against you, but rather for themselves Everyday have 30 seconds of unwavering extreme confidence Your greatest ally is the person in the mirror Do not judge others, everyone is fighting a personal battle that you do not know about It\u2019s not about the destination, but rather the journey When in doubt hug it out Just because you could doesn\u2019t mean you should Pain can last a second, a minute, or even a year, but eventually something will replace it. Celebrate the stories and memories a person gave you, do not morn there death Find someone to accompany you on the longest journey of your life, the one from your heart to your head. Their is always hope Their is no try, their is only do and do not Time waits for no man or women Be the person your 10 year old self would look up to For every action there is a reaction Act the way you wish to be treated Its the little things you do for others that make others day big Never forget the power of love Climb mountains not so that the world can see you, but so you can see the world The most dangerous risk of all- The risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later Go where you\u2019re celebrated not where your tolerated If you accept our limitations you go beyond them People often say motivation doesn\u2019t last. Well, nether does bathing so I recommend it daily. Everyone you meet is afraid of something, loves something, and has lost something Satisfaction is every great persons greatest down fall All in all life is what you make it, enjoy it, live it, and make mistakes in it. I do not own all of these phrases. ",
