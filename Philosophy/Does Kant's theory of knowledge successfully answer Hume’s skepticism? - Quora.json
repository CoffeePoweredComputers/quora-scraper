            "answer_text": "Yes. Hume\u2019s claim was that human beings never actually observe or experience causation occurring in the world; we actually just see sequences of events that follow one another regularly (and then we pretend that there\u2019s an imaginary force that causes these sequences to occur in a necessary way in the phenomena we witness or experience) undermines the possibility of genuine scientific knowledge. Kant\u2019s solution was to claim that all human experience is structured and mediated by our mental apparatus. Our mind provides causality to our sensual experience of the world in a universal manner, so all human minds (scientific or not) can indeed proceed to gain knowledge about the world with some confidence. Of course, Kant believed that our minds added a good deal to our actual experience including something so basic as our constant experience of physical objects as existing in space and time. So, to repeat, Kant did, in his first Critique, indeed succeed in answering Hume\u2019s skepticism. Unfortunately, it required an enormous amount of intellectual heavy lifting on Kant\u2019s part to make the case for our mind structuring and filtering all our experience, constantly from the moment of our birth to our last breath. Many subsequent philosophers consider Kant\u2019s brilliant and difficult solution to this skeptical challenge to ultimately raise far greater problems than it solved. ",

            "answer_text": "No. On the contrary. It proves Hume\u2019s point, since we can never know the world as it is, but only as it appears to us; likewise, we cannot know the laws of nature, but only our conventions for describing it. Kant was wrong to call what he achieved a Copernican Revolution in thought, for it was nothing if not Ptolemaic. Conversely, Hume was mistaken about both personal identity and causality. The human self is not a bundle of perceptions, any more than it is an intuition or a revelation of being (as the cogito would have it, by making thought self-sufficient and thus in effect divine\u2014the sly Cartesian heresy that created secular modernity). It is a social construct, not an individual one, formed by language and culture, not by a declaration of independence or theophany of the will. Causality is also a construct; since, like Berkeley, Hume had no use for abstractions, he could no more account for cause and effect relations than he could for algebra, cube roots, or the Pythagorean theorem. Hence his anxiety that the future might not be like the past was the product, not of political paranoia but of conceptual poverty. Had he been more astute, he might have realized that the real problem the world faces is its constancy, its stubborn refusal to change, to make genuine progress, as opposed to \u201cadvances\u201d in techniques of mass slaughter and indoctrination. We should pray that the future will not be like the past, or else we are doomed. Hume wanted to be known and celebrated as an historian, yet history cruelly altered his identity and thus the memory of him, which is just as well, since he spent most of his life defending the monarchy. Kant was nearly as naive, never examining the contingent conditions for the possibility of his tranquillity; contemplating the Napoleonic era from a safe distance, only to advocate \u201cperpetual peace\u201d following the Reign of Terror. He and Woodrow Wilson would have been soul-mates, sans souls. Apart from being categorically impervious, his mistake was taking Humean skepticism too seriously. He went from dogmatic slumber to transcendental confusion, without becoming enlightened about the world as it is, which is neither noumenal nor phenomenal, but as real as it is surreal\u2014undeniable, unpreventable and unbearable.

            "answer_text": "The Paradox of Skepticism: I would say reality answers Hume\u2019s skepticism. Not to mention, Hume\u2019s life answers Hume\u2019s skepticism. The famous critique of the skeptic is that write a bunch of stuff at their desk during the day that is abstracted from reality and then they go and live in the exact opposite way. That is their life becomes a refutation of their philosophy and ideology. The challenge is their life is the empirical evidence they have\u2014which should be challenging that very reality and incongruity. In otherwords there should be cognitive dissonance, but apparently it\u2019s not enough to change. Humans are prideful. Humans don\u2019t tend to like authority or what they perceive as external control. That\u2019s the ego and pride coming through again. And it\u2019s also a kind of default biological cognitive bias and distortion. This is Behavioral Economics 101. In a very real sense, the tell-tale sign of skepticism is that it\u2019s detached and de-contextualized from reality. I think you have to answer Plato\u2019s Cave before Hume even gets a seat at the table. Assuming away the world of Forms doesn\u2019t prove materialism. The importance of the Forms to ethics, to how the world operates for humans (it\u2019s underlying Logos and Telos), as well as the way theory and ideas work point in the direction of the truth of the underlying logic of Plato\u2019s Cave. Not to mention, the basis of Western civilization and progress has been the Idealism which Plato was specifically illuminating for the rest of future generations and ultimately civilization. This is arguably the reason it can be common to here the phrase \u201cdoubt your doubt\u201d or \u201cbe skeptical of your own skepticism.\u201d Doubting your doubt is actually an exercise in what skepticism is supposed to be about in the first place. We don\u2019t have any control over the words that others speak. We only have control over what WE say and think. It\u2019s this self-reflective power\u2014this ability to examine our own opinions, beliefs, and assumptions in light of the radiant and cleansing glow of Truth which skepticism can help us with. Learning to be skeptical of our own bad arguments\u2014keeps us on the way toward truth. Avoiding logical fallacies. Avoiding stereotypes. Avoiding assumptions. This is the real way we keep false belief and dogma out of our life. Skepticism of skepticism or at least skepticism of our own beliefs is the only and best way to guild us toward a more verdant, robust, and complex understanding of the truth. Such a move would help overturn the dry rots of scientism and materialism as well. The Voice of Truth in the Wilderness: All forms of skepticism are mirror images of each other. It\u2019s hard to sustain that other skeptics are \u201ctin foil hat\u201d and not see the \u201ctin foil hats\u201d on the other skeptics in your group as well as yourself. In my experience and observation, the spirit of skepticism, doubt, and denial in this case becomes rationalization and sophistry\u2014a hollow exercise in foot dragging and putting up artificial rhetorical walls. Denying the elephants in the room is an exercise is futility and truth denial. Eventually we end up bumping up against the facts of reality. And often those bumps can be in the form of \u201cwake up calls\u201d that are quite painful and expensive\u2014draining our emotional and economic capital\u2014and leaving parts of our lives as collateral damage, left behind. I\u2019ve been there myself. And everyone else on the planet has as well. When confronted with our wrong doing and evill-the nature human reaction is fight or flight. And in this case in some sense it\u2019s both. The denial of the sinner and addict\u2014is awful to watch\u2014and awful to suffer under as well. Seeing lives torn up by all forms of human toxicity\u2014all forms of listening to the wrong messages\u2014the wrong voices\u2014following the wrong paths\u2014and ending up sideways or upside down, well past the legal limit, crashed into a telephone pole, passed out with a cop shining a flashlight at 2 a.m. is a pretty clear signs. Sometimes the signs aren\u2019t so clear. But we have to take actions on before our life gets sideways or upside down. And we have to have the humiltiy and foresight and wisdom to scream \u201cEnough is enough!!!\u201d or simply enough \u201cI need to get better.\u201d ",
