As a slight change of perspective before launching upon this complex question, I would suggest that rather than thinking about the \u201chistory of philosophy\u201d, you might instead think upon the \u201cphilosophy of history\u201d instead. The manner in which you conceptualize this project\u2014that of a \u201cphilosophy of history\u201d\u2014will, I suspect, facilitate your answer to the original question. ",
