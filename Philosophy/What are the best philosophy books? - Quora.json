            "answer_text": "Edit: to be clear, I\u2019m uneasy with the idea of an absolute ranking of philosophy books, and I certainly have no such ranking in mind. This, in accordance with the original question that I answered, is a list of what I have found to be good philosophy books. Everything that I\u2019ve read so far and found to be interesting (that I remember), in no particular order: (probably the single most immediately impactful book on the list to this point is The Role Ethics of Epictetus) Meditations, Marcus AureliusA great introduction to StoicismDiscourses, EpictetusA detailed collection of lectures on StoicismEnchiridion, EpictetusA concise summary of Discourses as a sort of Stoic handbookLetters and various essays, SenecaReally well-written, in-depth pieces of advice and philosophyMany dialogues, PlatoIntriguing explorations of philosophy and a great way to learn about the Socratic methodMemorabilia, XenophonA seemingly more trustworthy discussion of Socrates himself, interesting for the emphasis on disciplineCynicism from Diogenes to Dilbert, Ian CutlerAn interesting discussion of the Cynics, plus some interesting thoughts on the continuation of the tradition (including a not half bad argument that Nietzsche was a continuation of the Cynic tradition)Human, All Too Human and The Dawn of Day, NietzscheNo coherent philosophy presented at that point, but a lot of interesting things to think about. I\u2019ve been less impressed (thus far) with The Joyful Wisdom (edit: the last few parts were better, but I can\u2019t say that I\u2019d recommend it on the whole).Sapiens, Yuval Noah HarariThis isn\u2019t philosophy, but it is a great resource on philosophy by helping to understand our origins and how we operate. Know thyself.Edited in later: Prolegomena, KantWritten as a sort of introduction to Critique of Pure Reason, it doesn\u2019t have the full arguments, but I think it gets some of the points across well. An interesting and relatively easy read, compared to what I\u2019ve heard of the Critique.Kant\u2019s first two Critiques, of Pure and Practical Reason (I haven\u2019t read the third)These are tough reading but for a good reason, the newness and complexity of the ideas, which in and of itself is somewhat worthwhile. However, the actual value is that they do introduce new and interesting ideas. While I disagree with much of Kant\u2019s thought and find some of his arguments questionable, they are still powerful ideas worthy of exposure.The Role Ethics of Epictetus, Brian JohnsonJohnson argues that Epictetus, in his Discourses etc, does not simply explain Stoic orthodoxy but actually introduces a novel extension to Stoicism in the form of Epictetean role ethics. The role ethics described are powerful, practical, generally clear, and, interestingly, not dependent on a particular ethical framework (or so I would argue)\u2014I\u2019d point the reader to a fuller discussion I wrote elsewhere: Daniel Philippus's post in Applied Philosophy.I think role ethics is a powerful and novel framework that is worthy of study for anyone, coming from any moral framework.",

            "answer_text": "Ancient philosophy\u2014and Stoicism in particular\u2014is my favorite topic in the world. Before I recommend some reading suggestions, let me provide some background. Almost exactly ten years ago, I bought the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius on Amazon. It arrived in package like any other book but it landed on my like a ton of bricks. Meditations would be for me, what Tyler Cowen would call \u201ca quake book,\u201d shaking everything I thought I knew about the world (however little that actually was). It was that book that introduced me to Stoicism and a ten year study of philosophy as a whole. It also inspired my own take on the topic The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living, which brings all-new translations of Marcus Aurelius, Seneca and Epictetus (as well as few other Stoics) and a daily stoic thought each morning via email. And before we jump into the recommendations, I want to stress that philosophy is not something you know, it\u2019s something you do. It is medicine. As Marcus Aurelius put it, it\u2019s \u201ca soothing ointment, a warm lotion.\u201d It\u2019s designed to help us deal with the difficulties of life\u2014to heal, as Epicurus said, the suffering of man. It\u2019s meant to be read and re-read, to be discussed, written about and most of all, to be lived. I hope these recommendations get you started along that path and I hope the path is as fulfilling, provocative and helpful as it has been for me. Here we go. You asked for one but I will go crazy on this. Hope that\u2019s ok! ***The Best Of the Stoics*** Meditations by Marcus Aurelius It still strikes now\u2014some 10 years into reading this book\u2014how lucky we are to even have it. Meditations is perhaps the only document of its kind ever made: the private thoughts of the world\u2019s most powerful man about how to make good on the responsibilities and obligations of his positions. Marcus stopped almost every night to practice a series of spiritual exercises\u2014reminders designed to make him humble, patient, empathetic, generous, and strong in the face of whatever he was dealing with. You cannot read this book and not come away with a phrase or a line that will helpful to you next time you are in trouble. Read it, and then read it again as often as you can. (Note: I strongly recommend the Hays\u2019s translation above all others and you can also read my interview with the author here). Letters from a Stoic by Seneca Seneca, like Marcus, was also a powerful man in Rome. He was also a great writer and from the looks of it, a wise man who dispensed great advice to his friends. Much of that advice survives in the form of letters, guiding them and now us through problems with grief, wealth, poverty, success, failure, education and so many other things. Seneca was a stoic as well, but like Marcus, he was practical and borrowed liberally from other schools. As he quipped to a friend, \u201cI don\u2019t care about the author if the line is good.\u201d That is the ethos of practical philosophy\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter from whom or when it came from, what matters is if it helps you in your life, if only for a second. Reading Seneca will do that. (Other collections of his thoughts are great too: Penguin\u2019s On the Shortness of Life is excellent and if you\u2019re looking for an audiobook of Seneca, try Tim Ferriss\u2019s edition The Tao of Seneca: Letters from a Stoic Master) Enchiridion by Epictetus Unlike the other powerful Stoics, Epictetus overcame incredible adversity. A slave who was banished from Rome, he eventually became a philosopher and opened a small school. Notes from his classes survive to us in what is now called the Enchiridion, which translates as a \u2018small manual or a handbook\u2019 and it is exactly that. It is the perfect introduction to Epictetus as it is packed with short Stoic maxims and principles. Unlike both Seneca and Marcus, Epictetus is somewhat more difficult to read and I recommend beginning with those two if you haven\u2019t yet read them. The next step would be Epictetus\u2019 Discourses, which are much longer and deserve a bigger commitment. ***Works From Other Great Stoic-Like Philosophers*** The Moral Sayings of Publius Syrus by Publius Syrus A Syrian slave in the first century BC, Publius Syrus is a fountain of quick, helpful wisdom that you cannot help but recall and apply to your life. \u201cRivers are easiest to cross at their source.\u201d \u201cWant a great empire? Rule over yourself.\u201d\u201cDivide the fire and you will sooner put it out.\u201d \u201cAlways shun that which makes you angry.\u201dThose are a few I remember off the top of my head. But all of them are good and worthy of re-reading in times of difficulty (or boredom or in preparation of a big event). Fragments by Heraclitus The Stoics\u2014especially Marcus\u2014loved to draw from Heraclitus, a mystic, ephemeral philosopher whose beautiful fragments are eminently quotable. My favorite line from Heraclitus is his line about how no man steps in the same river twice\u2014because it is not the same river and he is not the same man. Another favorite: \u201cApplicants for wisdom / do what I have done: / inquire within.\u201d And of course, his most direct and timeless remark: \u201cCharacter is fate.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for philosophy that is poetic but also practical, give Heraclitus a chance. Man\u2019s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl Man is sent to a concentration camp and finds some way for good to come of it. Finds some way to turn it into the ultimate metaphor for life: that we have little control over our circumstances, complete control over our attitude, and our ability to make meaning out of the things which happen to us. In Frankl\u2019s case, we are lucky that he was a brilliant psychologist and writer and managed to turn all this into one of the most important books of the 20th century. I think constantly of his line about the man who asks, \u201cWhat is the meaning of life?\u201d The answer is that you don\u2019t get to ask the question. Life is the one who asks and we must reply with our actions. Essays by Michel de Montaigne Montaigne was deeply influenced by some of the books I mentioned above. He was the epitome of Heraclitus\u2019s line about \u201cinquiring within.\u201d So much so that he spent basically the entire second part of his life asking himself (and other people) all sorts of interesting questions and then exploring the answers in the form of short, provocative essays. (A favorite: Whether he was playing with his cat, or whether he was the toy to his cat). These essays are always good for a helpful thought or two\u2014be it about death, about \u201cother\u201d people, about animals, about sex, or anything. Nature and Selected Essays by Ralph Waldo Emerson While Montaigne\u2019s essays are good for making us think, Emerson\u2019s essays make us act. They remind us that we are ultimately responsible for our own life, for making ethical choices and for fulfilling our potential. I prefer Emerson to the more indolent Thoreau and because unlike most classic writers, he embodies that uniquely American drive and ambition (but in a healthy way). If you have not read Emerson, you should. If you have\u2014and you remember fondly his reminders about recognizing our own genius in the work of others, or his reminders to experience the beauty of nature\u2014that counts as philosophy. See how easy it is? Essays and Aphorisms by Arthur Schopenhauer Schopenhauer is another brilliant composer of quick thoughts that will help us with our problems. His work was often concerned with the \u201cwill\u201d\u2014our inner drives and power. \u201cFor that which is otherwise quite indigestible, all affliction, vexation, loss, grief, time alone digests.\u201d But he also talks about surprisingly current issues: \u201cNewspapers are the second hand of history\u201d\u2014and that the hand is often broken or malfunctioning. And of course, the timeless as well: \u201cHope is the confusion of the desire for a thing for its probability.\u201d Maxims and Reflections by Goethe I\u2019d never read or even heard of Goethe until I saw him mentioned in the Hays\u2019 introduction to Marcus Aurelius but I am grateful to have been exposed to the man\u2019s brilliant maxims. The topics range from natural science, art, ethics, literature to observations on chance encounters he\u2019d have. Goethe himself was prolific, writing poetry, dramas, scientific treatises, novels and in the last decades of his life he would begin publishing these short reflections. Some favorite ones from the book: \u201cBehavior is a mirror in which everyone shows his image.\u201d \u201cAbsolute activity, of whatever kind, ultimately leads to bankruptcy.\u201d \u201cTell me whom you consort with and I will tell you who you are.\u201d ***Works About The Stoics*** The Inner Citadel and Philosophy as a Way of Life by Pierre Hadot Pierre Hadot is maybe one of the smartest people I\u2019ve ever read. The Inner Citadel is mostly about Marcus Aurelius and the Stoic concept of the self as a fortress. Philosophy as a Way of Life is essentially a book about the wisdom of ancient philosophers cumulatively acquired and how we can use the same exercises in our struggles. I highly recommend both of these. If you\u2019ve read both and want more from the master, I also suggest The Present Alone is Our Happiness which is a series of interviews with Hadot. Rome\u2019s Last Citizen: The Life and Legacy of Cato, Mortal Enemy of Caesar by Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni Marcus Cato has certainly earned his place in the history books\u2014he was the Stoic senator who led the opposition against Julius Caesar who then killed himself rather than live under a dictator. Cato was a soldier, a politician, a thinker and, because of how he lived his life, a philosopher. His unassailable place in Roman culture is best seen in the old proverbial expression used to make excuses: \u201cWe\u2019re not all Catos.\u201d You can also read an interview with Jimmy Soni over at the Daily Stoic. Marcus Aurelius by Matthew Arnold (essay) Matthew Arnold was a Victorian scholar who fell in the category of \u2018sage writers\u2019\u2014the type of writer who instructs and chastises the reader. This is a fantastic essay on Marcus, who as he remarked in 1863, was a man who held the highest power and most powerful station in the world\u2014and the universal verdict of the people around him was that he proved worthy of it. A few other great essays on Marcus: \"Homage to Marcus Aurelius\" by Joseph Brodsky (available in On Grief and Reason: Essays) and \u201cStoicism in the South\u201d by Walker Percy (available in Signposts in a Strange Land: Essays). Memoirs of Hadrian by Marguerite Yourcenar There are not many great works of fiction about Stoicism, but this is one. Written from the perspective of Hadrian, the book takes the form of a long letter of advice to a young to Marcus Aurelius, who would eventually succeed him as emperor. It\u2019s somber but practical, filled with beautiful and moving passages from a man near death, looking to prepare someone for one of the most difficult jobs in the world. The only other work of fictions about Stoicism I can recommend is Tom Wolfe\u2019s A Man In Full\u2014and then of course, the Loeb edition of Seneca\u2019s plays. During his lifetime, Seneca was actually more famous for his tragedies than he was for his philosophy (there is a line from one of his plays entombed as graffiti at Pompeii). Anyway, I was enthralled by these dark, disturbing but ultimately stoic plays. Dying Every Day: Seneca at the Court of Nero by James Romm I loved this book and read it in one long, long flight. I was riveted and I'm someone who already knew a lot about Seneca. This book is particularly interesting because the author understands that his subject is a person of contradictions but doesn't judge the subject. Instead he seeks to understand it. In Seneca it is this: how can a philosopher accumulate so much political power? How can a wise man tutor such a monster? How can an austere man aspire to (and enjoy) great wealth? How can a philosophical writer also be a passionate playwright? I'll say it again: I loved this book. I don't necessarily agree with all its conclusions but it made me think all the way through. Lives of Eminent Philosophers Volumes I & II by Diogenes Laertius Ironically, Diogenes\u2019 most famous biography in this collection is of the other Diogenes\u2014Diogenes the Cynic. Other excellent and illustrative sketches include Zeno, Ariston, Cleanthes and Chrysippus the Stoic. Heraclitus is another great biography. All of these vary in length. Zeno is over a 150 pages, Herillus (not to be confused with Heraclitus) is 2 pages. But regardless of length, they are all quite good. My favorite little quirk of the book is Diogenes\u2019 weird poem that he writes about each philosopher and of course the credulity with which he reports on their unusual deaths (on that note, you may also like the book The Book of Dead Philosophers, a book on how many of the world\u2019s most famous philosophers supposedly died.) *** All of these can be life-changing and I hope you get around to giving them a try. Of course, I also hope you find the time to give The Daily Stoic a chance! ",
