            "answer_text": "Newtonian physics is based on absolute space and time uniform throughout the universe. As Einstein observed that velocity of light is constant irrespective of observer'a speed only way for to explain this is to make spacetime dynamic that is varying through out universe based on the gravity of celestial objects. This is the fundamental to special and general theory of relativity ",
