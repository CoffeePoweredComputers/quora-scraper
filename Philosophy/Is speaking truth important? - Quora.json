            "answer_text": "A2A. We rarely, or perhaps never speak the truth. What we speak thinking it to be true, is merely our perception, thought and belief. And perceptions, thoughts and beliefs, while true for you, may be quite far from truth. This may also be for matters established scientifically, which science may also think, represents truth. By the way, truth and fact are entirely different things, with facts having a point of reference and truth as something absolute and unshakable. Truth, in the way we all use this word, is just a belief. And, a belief is rarely true. Perhaps they are half-truths, one may say, or a perspective that appears to be true. But that also means, it is half-untrue, is it not? Hence, it is untrue in the same reasoning one holds something as true. Truth is actually something that is unknown and inaccessible to entire humanity. We really do not have the intelligence or inward awareness for touching truth. It surely implies, whatever seems true to you, may not really be so. Let\u2019s look at time for instance. If I ask, \u201cis existence of time a truth in actuality?\u201d You May say \u201cyes\u201d and point out the watch and his we grow old, age and die. Now, some yogis or enlightened may tell you time is an illusion, but appears to be true to us. To comprehend how it\u2019s an illusion and not true, we may need super-human intelligence. Just because we lack that kind of intelligence is not a justification to call something untrue as truth. Therefore, according to me, it is not at all necessary to speak truth all the time. Actually, one never speaks truth all the time; no human being has done that. So, why give so much importance to speaking the truth? That doesn\u2019t mean, one can speak lies. A lie is not the opposite of truth; it is the opposite of what is believed to be true. Truth has no opposites. So, speak anything you wish - a lie or truth - anytime. It doesn\u2019t matter at all. If one is sensible, he or she may speak whatever suits a situation, completely disregarding whether it is true or false in his or her viewpoint. But there are those moralists who will go into extremes to speak what they think is true. Needless to say, their belief may not at all be true! But then moralists are those who do not know what freedom is, and unknowingly spread violence. That\u2019s far worse than speaking cold lies, unless that lie affects the freedom of someone. Personally I would prefer to be a liar, than becoming a moralist. Moralists, according to me, are enemies of society, as they set of morals and values are based on beliefs which sometimes they expect from others. Hence, according to me, it is not at all necessary to speak the truth every time. Why every time? Do we ever speak truth anytime? Which human being has done that. ",

            "answer_text": "Truth is a baseline. Truth is based in fact. Let\u2019s say for argument\u2019s sake nobody ever spoke the truth. There wouldn\u2019t be one human who would know what anything was. We would live in a factless world. Everything would be left to conjecture. I could say the sky was orange and you could say it was purple and both of us would think we were right - yet both of us would ultimately be wrong. We just wouldn\u2019t know it. You think humans argue now? Imagine if there were no truth to act as a baseline. Imagine if everyone lied all the time. Everything, every notion in the world would be up for grabs. We would constantly be at war because the only thing any of us would hold as true is our own opinions. And we see how well that\u2019s working anymore. Look at America\u2019s current president. He constantly lies. He lies about other countries. He lies about trade and the economy. He lies about what he does and has done. He lies about everything. And many people don\u2019t know what to believe anymore. Now, magnify that by 7.6 billion. Without truth, nobody would ever feel compelled to improve themselves, because they would never have to face the truth of who they are. You wouldn\u2019t be able to trust the products and the food you buy because you wouldn\u2019t have a clue whether they could harm you until it was too late. Is a world without truth a place you want to live? A little story: I lived with a couple of pathological liars at various points of my life. One time, one of them stole my rent money and fabricated a huge lie about how the house had been broken into and how he had chased the vandal away. He went so far as to ransack the place to make his lie seem more convincing, and blamed the incident on a neighbor. It got very ugly very fast. But when he started spreading lies about me to people I knew and people I didn\u2019t know, telling them that I had AIDS (which I don\u2019t), that was the last straw. And then his whole web of lies came out. I threw him out of the house, his employer fired him (for lying on his job application), his friends disowned him, and his partner left him. And he ended up dying with only a few of his immediate family caring anything about him. And guess what he died from\u2026 AIDS. That\u2019s why you should speak the truth. As long as truth remains our cultural baseline, being untruthful will ultimately work against you. People will not respect you. You will have no friends, you may not be able to keep jobs, and you will probably die miserable, unloved and alone. ",
