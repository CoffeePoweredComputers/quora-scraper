            "answer_text": "Long before Occam, many astronomers and physicists considered and rejected heliocentric theories of what we now call the Solar System going back at least to Aristarchus. It seemed to them that allowing the Earth to rotate and orbit the Sun would cause huge winds and other complexities. Aristotelian physics demands the simplicity of a stationary Earth and circular orbits for planets, which was later organized into Ptolemaic astronomy. It was not until Galileo's telescopic observations of the mountains on the Moon, sunspots, the moons of Jupiter, and the phases of Venus that the Copernican heliocentric system began to seem simpler. Newton's derivations of Keplerian elliptical orbits of planets and their satellites from three Laws of Motion plus the single notion of inverse square gravity made the heliocentric theory many times simpler than the geocentric theory. Observations of comet orbits, including those done by Jesuit astronomer Roger Boscovich at the Vatican Observatory, sealed the deal. Then we ran into a problem with the advance of the perihelion of Mercury, which led to Einstein's very simple equation for General Relativity, [math]R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\tfrac{1}{2}R \\, g_{\\mu \\nu} +  \\Lambda g_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G }{c^4} T_{\\mu \\nu}[/math], which is, however, very complicated to solve.

            "answer_text": "Momentum was originally thought to be just p = mv, where m is mass, and v is velocity. But this doesn't work for anything going close to the speed of light. It was later found that the equation is p = \u03b3mv, where    \u200b c is the speed of light, and v is the velocity. Note that at non-relativistic velocities, gamma is basically just 1 (and so vanishes from the equation). Now, this relationship is not even close to being as simple as p = mv, but it is correct to the best of scientific knowledge right now. Occam's razor does not proclaim to lead to the correct answer, but the best starting point. Without knowing p = mv, it's unlikely we'd be able to discover p = \u03b3mv. ",

            "answer_text": "If such cases exist, they would be the ones in which an explanation cannot account for all of the available data. An explanation can be simple, and then, it can be a little bit too simple, like, verging on an \u201canti-explanation\u201d. Many years ago, there was a British mystery series (\u201cJonathan Creek\u201d) in which a magician investigates crimes which appeared to have been committed under extraordinary circumstances. In a lot of these crime cases, there was an obvious and simple, but usually faulty explanation for the occurrence. So, the simplest explanation is not always the correct explanation, especially if it doesn\u2019t fit the known data. ",

Occam\u2019s Razor itself (and translations will present a problem here) contains a caveat: When faced with competing theories, the simplest one is most likely the correct one. Or, When faced with competing theories, the simplest one should be chosen. Occam\u2019s Razor most definitely does not say: When faced with competing theories, the simplets one is always correct. In fact HL Menken captured this view very well: For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong. ",
