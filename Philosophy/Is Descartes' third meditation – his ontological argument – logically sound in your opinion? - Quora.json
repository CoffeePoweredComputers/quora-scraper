            "answer_text": "Personally, I\u2019m not sold on the idea of necessary existence, whether it\u2019s Anselm or Descartes suggesting it. I would have to agree that a malicious demon could possibly trick the senses of a thinking thing only when there is a thinking thing to trick, but I\u2019m inclined to ask: then what? The only defense that Descartes can imagine against the demon is God. An omniscient, omnipotent, omni-benevolent being would certainly protect him against such an entity. At this point, the argument hits a snag. Descartes has already discounted most forms of knowledge, but he now is faced with the task of proving that God exists. To my memory, Descartes\u2019 ontological argument is similar to Anselm\u2019s: God is the ultimate being: omnipotent, omniscient, omni-benevolent, etc. The ultimate being cannot lack any quality, including existence, and so must exist. Since you ask for my opinion: I have to admit, the first time I heard Anselm\u2019s ontological argument in class, it annoyed me! I didn\u2019t like the notion that someone could \u201cprove\u201d God\u2019s existence with a clever linguistic syllogism. I\u2019m more inclined to agree with Guanilo and Kant. Point one: positing the existence of an ultimate being that must exist is like positing the existence of an island \u201cgreater than that which can be conceived\u201d and must also exist (Guanilo). Point two: existence- whether \u201cnecessary\u201d or not- is not a predicate (Kant). Also, I\u2019m inclined to believe that Descartes\u2019 reasoning comes from the kind of knowledge that he sets aside due to his (rhetorical) demonic foe. ",
