            "answer_text": "What? True? Absolutely NOT! Why people attempt to create divisions between Brazil and Portugal, I don't know. It baffles the mind and it\u2019s rather irritating be ecause no one will ever separate Portugal from Brazil. We are father & son, and if this bothers you, sorry \u2026(not) because the reality is, we will always be related, linked, and close countries. So, kindly snap out of your funk towards Portugal (or v.v.) and face the truth, for whether you like it or not, Brazil shares a lot with Portugal and not just culturally. Both countries are Catholic, family oriented societies, though they don\u2019t act much like devout countries, to the chagrin of the Church. Portuguese are low key and rather distrustful at first, but upfront once they get to know you, or when they are with family and friends. Many Brazilians equate our upfrontness with them as rudeness, but we are family and we just don\u2019t beat around the bush; we are direct but rather nice like many Brazilians. In Portugal, where it is blissfully safe and peaceful, we love sounds. We talk loud when happy, we love to sing and have fun, so are we really \u2018sad\u2019 people, when we party at festivals, eat lots of great food and talk non stop? Does this sound familiar to a Brazilian? Of course it does, because Portugal shares more than just any sound. We don't like crazy loudness but the sounds of music. Additional to a common spoken language, we share a deep musical legacy with Brazil, and this bond is very strong. So strong we could say a few musical genres would not exist today, had it not been for Portugal\u2019s musical influence in Brazil. In the N & NE regions of Brazil is where the concertina + accordion sounds play along with the \u2018cavaquinho', (hukelele) \u2018triangulo', (triangle) and the \u2018reque reque, or \u201creco-reco\u201d, (a ridged gourd percussion instrument) all dead give aways to centuries\u2019 old origins, going back to the deep N & NW of Portugal, in particular the areas of Porto, Tr\u00e1s-os Montes, Minho and also Beira, all provinces where many Portuguese emigrated from to go to Brazil, and many other countries as well. Many also came from the A\u00e7ores (Azores) and Madeira islands, and in all these places, Portuguese musical legacy is very strong. These simple Portuguese brought into Brazil their way of life and cultural expressions, including the gift of sound shared in another language: music! Thanks to this, Brazil simply became a world music powerhouse. It benefited from Portugal\u2019s ancient musical roots, instrument know-how, plus Brazil was also gifted with strong musical influences from their West Africa slave population brought over by the Portuguese. From humble beginnings Brazil took off musically, giving the world musical genres like Bossa Nova, Frevo, Forr\u00f3, Ciranda, Maracat\u00fa, Samba, Chote and many others rhythms, including amazing new beats, instruments and dances. Portugal also shares with Brazil the love of poetry, literature and writing. Although it is true that during early colonial times a certain type of higher education was not a colonial priority, Brazil has given us great writers: The 10 Best Brazilian Writers, but interestingly, our well known Portuguese poets and writers are just as popular in Brazil. An Introduction to Portuguese Literature in 6 Authors. Brazil inherited our Portuguese language and shares it with nine other official Portuguese speaking countries, making it the 6th biggest language in the world. Portuguese, or a creole version is also still spoken by some Eurasians from Malacca, (Malaysia) Singapore, Goa, Daman, Diu, Korlai, India) East Timor, and is also found in words loaned to many other languages, including Indian languages like Konkani, Marathi, Hindi, and Kannu Creole, (Kerala, India) but also in Javanese, Japanese and Papiementu, spoken in the ABC islands of the Caribbean, (Aruba, Bonaire, Cura\u00e7ao). Portuguese is a beautiful, lyrical language, especially the Brazilian version, although outsiders claim it sounds rather Slavic. It is a romance language and the pride of us all, because it sings and reads beautifully, no matter where spoken. If the only cultural glue amongst us were language alone, Portuguese would be the best crazy glue for the job. But our language is only one of the many deep cultural gems shared. Brazil also took many of our festivities and celebrations, which many don't even realize. The wild folly of \u2018Carnaval\u2019 you think came from Holland? How about the \u201cFestas Juninas\" or the June Saints\u2019 Festivals? Portugal, on both counts. Even religious festivities later influenced by African animist practices (like Candombl\u00e9) originated here in Portugal, taken over by settler emmigrants and aggregated by slaves and natives, such as the feast of \u201cLavagem do Sr. do Bonfim\u201d, \u201cC\u00edrio da Nazar\u00e9\u201d and others. Let's talk about Brazilian artesanal skills. Who taught Brazilians how to bake some of the best bread in the world, their amazing sweets, desserts, and other delicious dishes such as \u2018feijoada\u2019 or codfish dishes? Portuguese of course. Other nationalities also contributed towards Brazil's national dish menu and that mix is wonderful too. How about the \u2018Cal\u00e7ada Portuguesa\u2019? This is a pavement style normally used in Portuguese town plazas and sidewalks. It is laid down with hand cut small squares of black, cream and at times hpinkish red cobblestones, hammered one by one into white sandy soil while designing beautiful patterned walking paths. How did this practice end up on the sidewalks of Rio de Janeiro, and in other parts of the world? You will figure it out.  Now how about the \u2018bilro' (bobbin lace) and \u2018renda' (lace) industries of Brazil's northeast coast? Did Belgians bring them to Brazil or was it a \u2018little bird\u2019 going South?   Again, centuries ago, our multi tasker Portuguese women, rich and poor, brought these skills from Portugal and taught them to the local Brazilians. Interestingly, it was the Flemish that introduced the \u201cbilro know-how\u201d to Portugal, when quite a number of Flemish families came to the Azores in the late XIV century and settled. Their red haired descendents are still found living there, particularly in Graciosa and Terceira Islands. Ever heard of the so called \u2018Poesia de Cordel' and \u2018Repentismo'? No idea? Well, I found both living quite well inside Portugal of course, but never did I expect to find them in the city of Patos, 10 hours + by car from the costal sea town of Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, deep in the \u201csert\u00e3o\u201d (wilderness) of Para\u00edba! In Portugal, \u201cRepentismo\u201d is known as \u2018Cantigas ao Desafio\u2019 or \u201cDesgarrada\u201d. It is quite alive in Minho, particularly in the district area of Viana do Castelo, were people of all ages form groups of \u201cminhotos\u201d, how people from Minho are called, getting together certain Sundays in their town squares or city gardens, all gathered in a circle, (a time immemorial Celtic practice) happily playing their beloved musical instruments, singing, and dancing to their old songs. Take a look at the video below; they even stop traffic. Notice there is a \u201cdance step keeper\u201d {uma, duas, \u2018birou\u2019} and notice the blondies and redheads of the area; descendents of Minho's ancient Celtic and Germanic peoples.  But many times, they also have their \u2018Cantares ao Desafio'. The towns of Arcos de Valdevez and Ponte da Barca (or just Barca) are well known for these get togethers, but the practice is spread throughout Minho. A \u2018Desgarrada\u2019 is a sing-along, normally involving two people to see which one comes up with the best improvisational story and punch line. From the Portuguese verb: \u201cCantar\u201d meaning \u201c to sing\", comes \u201cCantares\u201d or simply \u2018songs\u2019. From the verb \u201cDesafiar\u201d meaning \u2018to dare' or \u2018to challenge' comes \u2018desafio' which is a \u201cdare or a challange\u201d. The two face each other singing \u2018daring\u2019 words, forming a tale, hoping the other comes back with a flimsy comeback, but the comeback is rarely flimsy, and that's where the tale and delicious wicked fun begins. The pairings can be 1 male & 1 female, or 2 males & 2 females, and I have seen even a 3 mix male/female/male or female/male/female all going at each other, with the concertina player sometimes he/or she also going with the singalong as well. They start our firing three or four small lines, be these preliminary greetings to the crowd like: \u201cBoa tarde meus senhores, boas tardes lhes vou dar\u201d (Good afternoon gentleman, good afternoon, I bid you all) then the real sing along starts each in turn, with daring imagined stories thrown at each other, normally criticisms, statements of fact, including gird size, personal inaptitudes, (mostly of the sexual kind) adultery, personal uglyness, some cursing flying back & forth and risqu\u00e9 undertones, which are OK as long as they tell a story and it rhymes. You hear it all unfiltered from men & women, sometimes strangers but with plenty of sexual innuendo. This despite the participants not being married to each other, nor in an obvious sexual relationship. Often they know each other as neighbors, friends, family, or maybe they already know each other from previously sing-alongs. Regardless, as the tales lengthens, it gets as \u2018bad, \u2019 if not worse than two Quim Barreiros at the Improv, with bust your chops verbal slashing below the belt, which means, of course lots of fun! In this, there is no political correctness, after all, they are all a huge big family of \u201cminhotos\u201d, but this is not for the shy, deeply religious, sensitive or conservative types, nor those wincing at the mere mention of the word \u2018fornication'. Our \u201cCantigas\" bring much merryment to the crowds, which at times, include the priest too! There could be lots of howling, laughing, claps on the back and cheering sections, with much laughter from the gathered around, especially during feast days. Singers follow musical queues from the concertina player, and in between jesting and insults, encourage each other with better comebacks, particularly after a \u2018mean\u2019 verbal slashing from a given side, the concertina player slowly playing along, between the rhyming verses for added show. Singers share funny verses and stories, some rather mortifying but it brings loads of laughter, and quality is always measured by the cheer & laughter of the crowd. It is loads of fun and it takes talent for simple folks, some never having studied much, to improvise such intelligent and wickidly funny rhyming stories. It also sounds a bit medieval, with jeering, cheering and laughter from the X rated stories being sung about, like a Shakespeare play, but this is northern Portugal, ancient but still deliciously wicked, proud of its traditions, transparent, and in your face whether you like it or not. Take a listen and note the strong accent from Minho: Part 1  Part II  Brazil was also granted this fascinating cultural gift from Portugal, although, the Brazilian versions I heard were \u2018tamer', with no sexual or risqu\u00e9 undertones, maybe because my (squeeling with delight and) smiling wife was on the receiving end of the \u2018quadras' (verses) sung by two young \u2018Casanova\u2019 Repentistas, and I was there right next to her. Here is a sample of a Brazilian style \u2018Repentismo':  Folks, I could go on and on, but by now I think you get my drift. Brazil and Portugal are culturally extremelly close, despite the hate and ignorance of many that wish to distance us and belittle Portugal's contributions in Brazil. From across the pond we brought our way of life and some of the best, simple, hard working people you could find. They worked their fingers to the bone building Brazil too, so when you look at your Brazilian beautiful historical cities and the architects that planned them, I certainly hope you do not thank the British! On a much profound cultural level, we brought Brazil something more important: Brazil's recorded beginnings, their history. As a newly found land mass, Pedro \u00c1lvares de Cabral, Portuguese nobleman in charge of the fleet to India, which the Atlantic winds pushed off course and landed them in the land that is now Porto Seguro, Bahia, the Portuguese thanked God for this land with a simple Catholic mass on arrival, as it was custom upon finding new land. In a beautiful but unusual and strange land, Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral decided then and there, that this seemed like a good place, and two Portuguese \u2018desterrados\u201d or convicted petty criminals on board, (probably nabbed for stealing food in order to survive, but maybe not) these would stay behind while the fleet continued on its way to India. When they were told their fate, according to the written passage of the voyage, they cried their eyes out in despair, (shit I would too!) but a will to survive, a courage or something else forced them to man up, brave the jungle and survive. Not totally alone were they, thanks to the native Indian tribes that helped them, but one thing is certain: they never gave up. Much later, others would man up and courageously leave Portugal to look for work, build their legal (or not) families with slaves, \u2018mulatas\u2019, free blacks, whites, natives, start families and a new life in Brazil. But going back to our two convicts, a couple of years pass and another Portuguese fleet arrives to check on the two, report back to the king if they were alive, how things were going , etc, and hold & behold (!) not only were the two alive, but looking well! The crying twosome had been \u2018consoled\u2019 by native Indian women, and just like that Brazil gifted life to Portugal and Portugal gifted Brazil the art of the \u2018desenrasco\u2019! \u2018Desen\u2019\u2026what \u2026you ask? Yes\u2026\u2018desenrasco' meaning: to get out from under, or to make do with whatever little you have\u201d. A type of philosophy similar to: \u201cyou want oranges, but life gives you lemons, so make lemon juice\u201d attitude, because let\u2019s face it, the situation these two were placed in called indeed, not just for a \u2018desenrasco\u2019 but much more. To this day Portuguese are great at this, and we use this \u2018art\u2019 every time it is needed, which is often. Brazilians are even better at it and so are the Cubans, but since, and for the most part Cubans are of Galician stock, the legacy obviously runs in the family. During the Roman reign of Iberia, northern Portuguese and Galicians were the same people ethnically and culturally. We were part of the same Roman province, brothers up to 800 + years ago, but since we have been politically separated. One took a liking to the kingdom of Leon, the other, rebellious Portus Cale, broke apart from southern Gallecia and became the independent country of Portugal. So going back to our petty thieves, five hundred years ago these two Portuguese rascals \u2018made do\u2019 under the circumstances, which the official scribe of the journey, Pero Vaz de Caminha duly recorded. Now\u2026how many countries have their country\u2019s birth narrated? I only wish Portugal had, but it happened with Brazil so voil\u00e1, another Portuguese cultural gift, and this is a HUGE one, the narration of the voyage, the arrival of the Portuguese in Brazil and their interaction with the natives written down in the detail by the captain's scribe, Pero Vaz de Caminha, another \u201cMinhoto\"! I don't know about you, but surviving as convicts in a strange land, with no other mates and under such conditions takes balls, and Brazil inherited ours. As Brazilians currently face their biggest political, economical, and social crises since independence, it is good to remember their history and how their country started: by simply, overcoming! Those two convicts used the wonderful survival tactic of the \u201cPortuguese desenrasco\" in order to survive, and after all said and done, Brazil grew and even became the capital of the Portuguese kingdom. If anything else, this should remind Brazilians nothing is impossible and that united, you should all remember never ever give up, for had those two brave convicts given up, there would be no Brazil today. The wonderful mixing of Europeans, local indigenous people, blacks and other races, plus the amazing cultural exchange between us, an ocean and hemisphere apart made Brazil and Portugal what they are today: two multicultural, independent, yet deeply related countries with strong and well blended cultures, different, yet alike. This is why a Portuguese feels at home in Brazil and a Brazilian at home in Portugal, yet in both places, neither can really say it\u2019s 100% alike. We like it that way because amongst differences, it\u2019s as close as it gets. Being culturally linked to Portugal yet independently different, is in my humble opinion, why apart from being the giant nation Portugal wanted it to become, Brazil is also by far, the most beautiful and interesting country in all of South America.

            "answer_text": "The Portuguese fell in love with Brazil. Maybe it was the shared position of much of the two countries\u2019 coastlines bordered by the ocean. Perhaps it was the fact, that like Portugal, Brazil was filled with people of different heritages. Indeed, the Portuguese did not hesitate to marry the natives of Brazil and a new race was born, called the Mesticos. In addition, Brazil is home to a lot people referred to as Mulattoes, which are a combination of the Portuguese and African slaves. Brazil\u2019s line of people has indeed grown to a blend of Portuguese, Africans and natives. Despite the fact that Brazil on the land side is bordered by Latin countries, the Latin influence is minimal in terms of culture. Of course this aspect of Portuguese culture was carried over to Brazil and even more varieties developed considering the Afro-centric and indigent people that mixed with the Portuguese. For example, Rio and several Brazilian host their own version of Carnival, where people dance in the street to heavy African beats and Caribbean flavours. Whether you are in Brazil or Portugal, music is everywhere, from the traditional \u201cfado\u201d to modern pop, jazz, folk and even hip hop. Fado comes from the word fate, so it tends to have a melancholy nature to it. The Portuguese value fado as their own, and it was actually also recognized by UNESCO as a cultural heritage music in 2011. Love is usually the subject of a fado song and it can be heard in city streets at night as well as occasionally in larger city nightclubs. Portugal and Brazil are both also great places to see artworks. In Portugal, sculptures were once hugely popular, especially from the 15th to the 18th centuries. By the 1700s, it had carried over to Brazil, except the sculptures tended to be made out of wood rather than rock. Paintings, contemporary art and a unique concept became popular in the 17th century called Azulejos, or the art of glazing tiles. These beautiful, artistic tiles began to grace the walls and floors of palaces, mansions and churches. In Brazil, art dates back to the native inhabitants renditions of pottery. Art as defined be Western Civilization was introduced by the Portuguese and especially the Catholic Church. Today, Brazilian art encompasses a myriad of influences, from colourful Afro-centric paintings and murals to sculptures and pottery with their base in the tribes of the country before the Portuguese \u201cinvasion.\u201d In Brazil, as with Portugal, there were a variety of influences, such as the colonial style from the Europeans, and specifically the Portuguese who brought the ornate Baroque style from across the waters. Rio is home to an enormous piece of exclusive art \u2013 the Cristo Redentor or Christ the Redeemer, which is considered Art Deco. It stands 130 feet high and the arms stretch across 92 feet. It took nine years to build. Located on top of Corcovado mountain area, it overlooks Rio. One thing is for sure; the food that comes with Portuguese culture is nothing short of amazing. Again, the blends of different countries and influences, along with the fact that both Portugal and Brazil have major ocean access, provide options to satisfy any taste. Portugal is one of Europe\u2019s highest fish consumption rates per person, so fish is definitely a staple. Cod is extremely common and it is cooked in every way imaginable. Cod is usually dried and salted and then soaked in milk to make it tender. Other popular fish include sardines, octopus, squid, crab, shrimp and lobster. Because of the influence of the Spaniards and the Moors, spices are an integral part of preparing most seafood, such as chili pepper, black pepper, saffron and cinnamon. Most fish is cooked in olive oil along with herbs such as garlic and coriander.      ",
