            "answer_text": "Algebra  Algebra was invented by al-Khwarizmi. Some dispute this claim as the Greek mathematician Diophantus and the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta were clearly using algebraic methods to solve complex equations centuries before al-Khwarizmi. The difference, however, is that al-Khwarizmi laid out the fundamental rules of the discipline in his Kitab al-Jebr and recognized it as a branch of mathematics in its own right. Algorithms  The algorithm, which means the concept of laying out rules and formulating steps to solve a problem, was the invention of the famous mathematician al-Khwarizmi which he devised while solving algebraic equations. Modern computers would not have been possible without them. Big Science  The reliance of scientific progress on large-scale state-sponsored projects (Big Science) was a tradition first laid down by the Arab scientists and Abbasid Caliphs, Caliph al-Ma\u2019mun to be specific. He formed a team of his best astronomers and mathematicians -comprising of Sanad ibn al-Yahudi, Yahya ibn abi Mansur, al-Abbas al-Jawhari, al-Farghani and the esteemed al-Khwarizmi - and set them to the task of building the first observatory of the Islamic world, northwest of Baghdad. These astronomers then proceeded to make observations of the night sky and produced the most accurate star-chart of the Middle Ages. They would also go on to calculate the circumference of the earth and draw the most accurate map of the world, all on the state\u2019s expense. Chemistry  Yes, the entire field of chemistry owes its existence to Jabir bin Hayyan, an 8th century chemist who was the first person to distinguish chemistry from alchemy and establish it as an empirical science. He also left behind the \u2018Jabirian Corpus\u2019, a mammoth collection of scores of volumes and manuscripts containing records of his experiment, observations and findings; properties of substances and several new compounds that he discovered. Circumference of the earth  This was the remarkable result of the genius of the 11th century polymath al-Biruni. Using nothing but a mountain and a square wooden board with a ruler dangling from one of its corners he calculated the circumference of the earth to be 25,000 miles, he was off the correct value by just 100 miles. Classification of substances  Although substances of all sorts were being classified long before the advent of Islam, it was the physician al-Razi who changed the way this was done. Previously the Greeks used to classify all substances on purely philosophical musings but al-Razi was the first person to classify substances based on their physical properties. For example: for chemical substances he derived six categories; spirits, metals, stones, atriments, boraces and salts. Clinical trial  The earliest known clinical trial involving a control group was also carried out by al-Razi. He selected two sets of patients suffering from meningitis and treated the first with bloodletting but not the second. After continuing his treatment for several days he reached the conclusion that bloodletting was an effective treatment for meningitis as the first group of people was cured of the illness while the second was not. Cosine rule  The famous Cosine rule, which allows the sides of a triangle to be calculated provided an angle and the other two sides are known was derived for the first time by al-Kashi in the 15th century. Cryptanalysis  The field of cryptanalysis or code-breaking was created by the polymath al-Kindi. He invented the frequency analysis method by which the frequency of the symbols in the code was analysed and compared with the frequency of letters in the original language of the code. Dream theory  The influence of the subconscious mind on dreams was first documented by al-Kindi. He also attempted to interpret dreams and devised a crude form of Freudian psychology to do so. Egyptology  There is convincing evidence that the tenth century ibn Wahshiyya was the first Egyptologist. He conducted extensive research on the pyramids and deciphered a substantial number of the hieroglyphs. Indology  The study of the history and culture of the Subcontinent was pioneered by al-Biruni in his The History of India. Intromission theory of vision  This was another contribution to science of the great Ibn al-Haytham. Previously the Greeks believed in the \u2018emission theory\u2019, which meant that the eyes sent out light rays that allowed us to see. With some clever reasoning Ibn al-Haytham proved it wrong and gave the intromission theory, according to which light from our surroundings entered our eyes that allowed us to see. Lamarckist evolution  A rudimentary theory of Lamarckist evolution was proposed by the biologist al-Jahith who speculated how their environments could influence animals living in them, further arguing that acquired characteristics could be passed down to children. Length of the solar year  This was the work of the Persian poet and mathematician, Umar Khayyam. In his twenties, using a sundial, a water clock and an astrolabe, he measured the length of the solar year to 365.24219858156 days. His figure was incredibly precise and accurate to the modern figure to six decimal places. He also used this figure to make the Jalali calendar several years later. It\u2019s worth noting that this calendar is even more precise than the modern Gregorian calendar. Maragha revolution  The Maragha revolution refers to the findings of the astronomers of the Maragha observatory in Persia. Lead by Nasr al-Din Tusi their findings included the Tusi-couple, a geometric model that could be applied to astronomy. It cleared away the mess of Ptolemy\u2019s complicated system of equants and epicycles that he used to describe the geocentric model of the universe and laid the mathematical foundation on which Copernicus would propose the heliocentric model of the universe. Music therapy  The therapeutical value of music was another contribution to science of al-Kindi. He reportedly used it to cure patients with peculiar ailments, most famously a quadriplegic boy. Programmable machine  This may come as a surprise to you but the first programmable machine was a robotic flute player constructed by the Banu Musa brothers, a trio of gifted scientists who had a specialty for mechanical devices. Known as \u2018The Instrument that Plays by Itself\u2019, it was a complicated assemblage of tiny levers, drums and valves that ran on water and air and could be set to play a tune. Psychology and psychotherapy  In an age when the rest of the world considered patients with mental disorders to be possessed by spirits, the great physician al-Razi sought to seek medical solutions to their predicaments. He ran psychiatric wards in his Baghdad hospitals and due to the many progressive cures he devised he is often referred to as the Father of Psychology and Psychotherapy. Pulmonary transit  The process of pulmonary transit was the discovery of Ibn Nafis who described how blood went from the right chamber of the heart to the left via the lungs. This was a revolutionary discovery at that time and laid the groundwork on which William Harvey would discover the entire process of blood circulation. Scientific method  The scientific method, a set of rules governing how science is conducted, was devised by the greatest physicist in the era between Archimedes and Sir Isaac Newton, Ibn al-Haytham, though wrongly attributed to Francis Bacon. The scientific method involved obtaining knowledge through observation and measurement followed by formulation of hypotheses and experimentation to arrive at a solid conclusion. This method was advocated by Ibn al-Haytham and central to all his research. Snell\u2019s Law  Snell\u2019s Law of Refraction should actually be known as Sahl\u2019s Law of Refraction because it was Ibn Sahl who discovered it. Disproving earlier theories, he showed how the refraction of a light beam in water was proportionate to the sides of the triangles that formed rather than the arc lengths. Surgical instruments  The Andalusian surgeon al-Zahrawi was the most prolific creator of surgical instruments. He invented more than a hundred of them, including the surgical hook, spoon, rod, needle, speculum and bone-saw, not to mention the syringe, lithotomy scalpel and use of inhalant anesthesia.

            "answer_text": "Okay, not an exhaustive one obviously, but a list that summarize what may well be known in the scientific community. Here we go; 1. Definitive descriptions of smallpox and was the first to differentiate smallpox from measles - Al Razi (wiki)  \"One of his most innovative assertions related to measles and smallpox. Previously they were lumped together simply as a disease that caused rashes, but through careful observation al-Razi recorded the differences in appearance of the skin inflammations as well as the accompanying physical symptoms, and proposed correctly that they were indeed two distinct diseases\" Abu Bakr Mohammad Ibn Zakariya al-Razi (Rhazes) (c. 865-925) 2. Pulmonary circulation was first described by Ibn al-Nafis (wiki)  \"Ibn al-Nafis (1213\u20131288) was an Arab physician who made several important contributions to the early knowledge of the pulmonary circulation. He was the first person to challenge the long-held contention of the Galen School that blood could pass through the cardiac inter ventricular septum, and in keeping with this he believed that all the blood that reached the left ventricle passed through the lung\" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2612469/ 3. Inductive experimental method, the earliest by Al Hazen/Ibn al-Haytham (wiki) \"The origins of the scientific method hearken back to the Islamic World, not the Western one. Around 250 years before Roger Bacon expounded on the need for experimental confirmation of his findings, an Arab scientist named Ibn al-Haytham was saying the exact same thing.\" Ibn al-Haytham: The Muslim Scientist Who Birthed the Scientific Method | RealClearScience \u201cAlhazen's experiment may seem simplistic today, but his methodology was ground-breaking: he developed a hypothesis based on observations of physical relationships (that light comes from objects), and then designed an experiment to test that hypothesis. \u201c https://science.missouristate.edu/assets/science/PosterAlhazen.pdf  4. One of the most accurate estimation of Earth Radius, by Al Biruni   \"He was the first able to obtain a simple formula for measuring the Earth\u2019s radius. Moreover, he thought possible the Earth to revolve around the Sun and developed the idea the geological eras succeed one another \" https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1312/1312.7288.pdf Calculation method http://www.jscimath.org/uploads/J2011172AG.pdf 5. The Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopedia which became a standard medical text at many medieval universities and remained in use as late as 1650 (wiki)  6. The earliest tin-glazed pottery in Abbasid, Iraq (wiki) \"But the technique appears to have been forgotten until Islamic potters in Mesopotamia reinvent it, in an attempt to imitate the richly colored T'ang earthenware arriving from China. During the following centuries tin glazes spread through the Muslim world during a very creative period of Islamic pottery. They are used in the prosperous and lively western extremity of Islamic civilization, that of medieval Muslim Spain, and from here they eventually reach Christendom - inspiring great interest in Renaissance Italy. The route of that last leg of the journey gives tin-glazed wares their first European name. In about 1400 they are exported from Spain to Italy by merchants of Majorca. They become known to the Italians as Majorca-ware, or majolica.\" HISTORY OF POTTERY AND PORCELAIN 7. Most sophisticated water-powered astronomical clock & an early example of a programmable analog computer by Al Jazari (wiki)  \"Because of its extremely accurate timing, complex pulley system, and ability to be re-programmed, Al-Jazari's water clock is considered one of the earliest forms of a programmable computer \" History of Computers - Al-Jazari's Castle Clock 8. Among the earliest mention of the idea of the Laffer Curve (wiki)  \"The Laffer Curve, by the way, was not invented by me. For example, Ibn Khaldun, a 14th century Muslim philosopher, wrote in his work The Muqaddimah: \"It should be known that at the beginning of the dynasty, taxation yields a large revenue from small assessments. At the end of the dynasty, taxation yields a small revenue from large assessments\" The Laffer Curve: Past, Present, and Future 9. The first known recorded explanation of crypt-analysis was given by 9th-century Arabian polymath, Al-Kindi (also known as \"Alkindus\" in Europe) (wiki) \"Al-Kindi\u2019s breakthrough, known as frequency analysis, may seem obvious to modern eyes, but at the time it was a radical breakthrough that destroyed the security of the existing encryption system. He realised that letters of the alphabet appear with varying frequencies in written text, e.g., on average E accounts for 12.7 per cent of letters in an English text, whereas J, Q, X and Z combined add up to less than 1%\" Arab Code Breakers \"He gave the first known recorded explanation of cryptanalysis in his work, Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He is credited with developing the method known as \"frequency analysis\", whereby variations in the frequency of the occurrence of letters could be analyzed and exploited to break ciphers.\" Brief Introduction to Al Kindi. Compiled by Mari Garcia and Joy Usher 10. Earliest recorded coffee trade & drinking culture in Arabia (wiki) Arab Coffee House  \"Coffee cultivation and trade began on the Arabian Peninsula. By the 15th century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni district of Arabia and by the 16th century it was known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey. Coffee was not only enjoyed in homes, but also in the many public coffee houses \u2014 called qahveh khaneh \u2014 which began to appear in cities across the Near East. The popularity of the coffee houses was unequaled and people frequented them for all kinds of social activity. Not only did the patrons drink coffee and engage in conversation, but they also listened to music, watched performers, played chess and kept current on the news. Coffee houses quickly became such an important center for the exchange of information that they were often referred to as \u201cSchools of the Wise.\u201d The History of Coffee 11. The first complete surgical treatise by Al Zahrawi @ Albucasis http://www.rcpe.ac.uk/journal/issue/journal_41_1/ex-libris.pdf \"One of the key players who made the real breakthrough in surgical instrumentation wa Al Zahrawi a.k.a. in the West as Albucasis. Albucasis practiced extensively in the Arab nations and kept the evolution of surgical tools ongoing.\" http://heinrichmedika.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Insight-Into-The-Old-Surgical-World.pdf  12. Algebra (by Al Khwarizmi)   \u201cHe later wrote The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing, which established algebra as a mathematical discipline that is independent of geometry and arithmetic. Later, Persian and Arabic mathematicians developed algebraic methods to a much higher degree of sophistication. Although Diophantus and the Babylonians used mostly special ad hoc methods to solve equations, Al-Khwarizmi's contribution was fundamental. He solved linear and quadratic equations without algebraic symbolism, negative numbers or zero, thus he had to distinguish several types of equations\u201d Algebra - Wikipedia 13. Introducing Hindu-Arab Numeral  \u201cThey originated in India in the 6th or 7th century and were introduced to Europe through Arab mathematicians around the 12th century (see al-Khwarizmi). They represented a profound break with previous methods of counting, such as the abacus, and paved the way for the development of algebra.\u201d Hindu-Arabic numerals 14. Transmission of paper-making technology (wiki) \"It took several hundered years for the ancient Chinese art of papermaking to reach the west. In 750, Chinese knowledge of papermkaing reached NOrth Africa from the prisoners taken at the battle of Samarkand. The 1st recorded use of paper for packaging was in 1035, when a Persian traveler in Cairo market noted vegetables etc., wre wrapped after they were sold\" https://web.archive.org/web/20110716105826/http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2012%202005/288%20twede.pdf 15. The oldest continuously-operating degree-granting university in the world by the Guiness Book of World Records. \u201cThe al-Karaouine mosque was founded by Fatima al-Fihri in 859 with an associated school, or madrasa, which subsequently became one of the leading spiritual and educational centers of the historic Muslim world. It was incorporated into Morocco's modern state university system in 1963. It is the oldest existing and continually operating educational institution in the world according to UNESCO and Guinness World Records[5] and is sometimes referred to as the oldest university, although some scholars dispute whether the term can be properly applied historically to institutions outside the European model.[6]\u201d FAMOUS ALUMNI Allal al-FassiLeo AfricanusAbd el-Krim el-KhattabiIbn KhaldunMaimonidesMuhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-HilaliAbdullah al-GhumariUniversity of Karueein  ",

The Islamic age at the time had a great interest in science, and in particular the fields of mathematics (like algebra, an Arabic term), astronomy (the first mention of the Andromeda galaxy) and medicine (many canons and works about the workings of the human body).  They have read, translated, and then built upon the works of the great Greek philosophers. It was from them that the Europeans recovered the lost knowledge from the 10th century onwards. Beyond mere inventions and treatises, there were advanced to the scientific method itself - like Alhazen and his approach to experimentation. They erected great learning centres as well, like the House of Wisdom in Baghdad,the oldest university in the world at University of al-Qarawiyyin, and centres in Spain and Sicily.  When the work of leading Arab natural philosophers was translated back into Latin, they formed the increasing foundation of knowledge for Western science.
