            "answer_text": "Times were different in 500bC and 150bC. The political situation of the Greek world was different. The military forces engaged were different. Roman rule was different from what Persian rule would have been. When Persia advanced into the Balkans in the late 6th and early 5th century bC they had Greek allies. The Macedonian kingdom was a Persian vassal state for many decades. Thessaly submitted when the Persian conquest turned south. So did most of the city-states of Boeotia (Thebes, for instance). The Greek cities of Asia Minor had already been under Lydian and Persian rule for generations when the great battles of 490\u2013479bC took place. It was essentially the city state of Athens that won at Marathon (490bC). A decade later, in the naval battle at Salamis (480bC), only the fleets of the southern Greek states (with Athens having the highest number of vessels) destroyed the Persian fleet, making it possible for united Greek land forces to definitely defeat the huge Persian army at Plataea in 479bC, and throw the Persians out of the Balkans for good. After 300bC the Greek city states lost much of their importance (and probably a part of their inhabitants choose to try their chance in the newly conquered regions). The Greek world now covered the Middle East. New Greek kingdoms emerged (not democratic city-states). Some of the old cities of the Greek core lands created confederations (Achaean League, Aetolian League) to escape to Macedonian rule. During the whole 2nd century bC, the conflicting Greek kingdoms (Macedonia, the various kingdoms of Asia Minor, Egypt) and what was left of the city-states were in constant warfare against each other, with the Romans (who had in the meantime destroyed Carthage and unified Italy) offering alliances, arbitrage and later on, garrisons. Macedonia might have prevailed (at least for some time) against Rome, had it been successful in maintaining a mutally acceptable alliance with the democratic minded city-states of southern Greece. The divided Greek kingdoms fell to Roman domination one by one. For a Greek in those days it might not have made a big difference to be a subject of one of the Greek kings or the Roman Senate\u2026 Roman rule over the Greek world was benevolent. The cities continued to have internal autonomy. The religion was the same (same religion was a very important factor back then). Last but not least, the Romans admired, embraced and assimilated Greek civilization/culture. If the Persians had won in the 5th century bC, would they have adopted Greek culture ? Greek religion ? Doubtful. In 479bC the Persian king Xerxes ordered the destruction of the Athens Acropolis temples. A Roman general could not have done that. ",

            "answer_text": "I think Evangelos Lolos sets the contrast up pretty well. However, I\u2019d emphasize one critical distinction between the critical years of Persian conquest and their Roman counterparts. Persia The Greece which fought the Persians had never been united, even nominally; the sense of Greek nationhood was still very much in flux at the time. The appearance of a large and powerful enemy in the heartland of traditional Greece changed they way Greeks saw themselves: the experience of defeating the Persians helped to create a national consciousness that didn\u2019t really exist before; the ideal of Panhellenism \u2014 the feeling that Greece could and should unite around common goals \u2014 first found expression in the wake of the Persian war and became widely influential in Greek sentiment in the century before Alexander. In the early 4th century BC rhetoricians and poets spread the ideal of Greek union in literature which eventually became canonical for later Greeks. However, the Greeks turned out to be terrible at putting this ideal into practice. Athens and Sparta both used panhellenist rhetoric in their bids for leadership in Greece \u2014 but both tended to enrich themselves at the expense of fellow Greeks whenever the opportunity arose. More damningly, both were happy to take Persian money when they were on the losing side of a conflict: the Spartans won the Peloponnesian war on Persian gold; the Athenians took Persian money in the Corinthian war. Finally the the Spartans signed on to the Peace of Antalcidas at the end of that war, which basically made them Persia\u2019s enforcers in mainland Greece and abandoned any pretense of rescuing the Ionian Greeks from the barbarians. In other words \u2014 resistance to Persia was an anomaly, not the norm. It remained a vague cultural ideal \u2014 but not one that had much practical impact \u2014 for the rest of Greek history. Even at the time \u201cresistance\u201d wasn\u2019t really universal; Boeotian, Thessalian and Ionian contingents fought for the Great King at Salamis and Plataea; Greek mercenaries could be found in Persian armies fighting Alexander. To some degree the Roman situation reflected a fairly widespread recognition in Greece that panhellenism was sham. After Alexander For 200 years after Alexander, the successor empires used panhellenic rhetoric in their conflicts, but none of them ever seriously considered \u2018freeing\u2019 Greece. Against that backdrop, laying down your life to protect Greece from the Romans didn\u2019t seem particularly appealing when protecting it from the Romans meant handing it over to the Macedonians, the Syrians, or the Ptolemies. All of the wars which brought Roman armies into Greece were wars against the successor kingdoms \u2014 not against \u201cGreece\u201d. Roman dominance in Greece was established by a war against the the Syrians and a war against Macedonia: the Romans became the patrons of Greek cities by defeating their foreign overlords. Those overlords spoke Greek, it\u2019s true \u2014 but in the hyper-local world of Greek politics the difference between a Greek-speaking Macedonian and a Greek-speaking Roman senator wasn\u2019t necessarily decisive. Rome The Romans generally did a good job of convincing the Greeks that they were better overlords than the successor kings. They allowed greater autonomy and interfered less routinely in the internal workings of most Greek cities. You can get a sense of the flavor in Plutarch\u2019s Life of Flamininus: Accordingly, at the Isthmian games, where a great throng of people were sitting in the stadium and watching the athletic contests (since, indeed, after many years Greece had at last ceased from wars waged in hopes of freedom, and was now holding festival in time of assured peace), the trumpet signalled a general silence, and the herald, coming forward into the midst of the spectators, made proclamation that the Roman senate and Titus Quintius Flamininus proconsular general, having conquered King Philip and the Macedonians, restored to freedom, without garrisons and without imposts, and to the enjoyment of their ancient laws, the Corinthians, the Locrians, the Phocians, the Euboeans, the Achaeans of Phthiotis, the Magnesians, the Thessalians, and the Perrhaebians. At first, then, the proclamation was by no means generally or distinctly heard, but there was a confused and tumultuous movement in the stadium of people who wondered what had been said, and asked one another questions about it, and called out to have the proclamation made again; but when silence had been restored, and the herald in tones that were louder than before and reached the ears of all, had recited the proclamation, a shout of joy arose, so incredibly loud that it reached the sea. The whole audience rose to their feet, and no heed was paid to the contending athletes, but all were eager to spring forward and greet and hail the saviour and champion of Greece. The main example of nationalist resistance to Rome came after the Fourth Macedonian War, two generations after Flamininus \u201cfreed\u201d the Greeks. The Macedonians were defeated in short order, but the Romans fell out with their erstwhile Greek allies in the aftermath. This lead to an anti-Roman reaction and the Achaean War \u2014 a was a poorly organized uprising which had strong overtones of social conflict inside Greece (the Romans tended to support the local upper classes, so Greece\u2019s remaining democrats were the nucleus of the opposition). The revolt was also inflamed by a very naive misunderstanding of the war the Romans were fighting against Carthage at the same time. The rebellion led to a very brutal Roman reaction, but it was never a widespread resistance; only the Achaean territories in the northern Peloponessus were involved in the brief fighting. Roman culture had grown up in the shadow of Greek culture: Romans got their letters from the Greeks of Campania; the earliest written Roman literature was in Greek, and most educated Romans spoke and read Greek. This minimized the gap between the conquerors and the conquered; by contrast the differences between Persian and Greek lifestyles were much larger. Perhaps for this reason the Roman ruling formula was a light burden on the Greeks. Persians \u2014 monarchists, after all \u2014 tended to support tyrants and strongmen rather than allowing any form of elective self government in their Greek possessions. Romans were much more familiar with the Greek pattern of republican governance; they allowed a lot of local autonomy, prevented inter-state warfare, and above allowed the local elites to remain important in local affairs . This made for a much more stable foundation, even if both sides remained conscious of their differences. ",
