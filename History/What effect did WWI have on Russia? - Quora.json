            "answer_text": "In a million ways, literally. Let's sum up the most important ones: (1) The Russian Revolution of 1917 took place directly as a result of the effects of the WWI. The deaths of millions of Russian troops on the battlefield and the capture of millions more, the destruction of Russian economy and enormous sufferings of the Russian common people, the foreign occupation of Russian territory - all these led to the overthrow of the Russian Emperor Nicholas II on February 1917, and the subsequent Bolshevik takeover in November 1917. The new government took Russia out of the war. (2) The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk signed in 1918, which the Bolshevik government was forced to sign with the Central Powers. As per the Treaty, Russia ceded the Ukraine, the three Baltic states and the Russian Poland to Germany and the Kars and Ardahan provinces to the Ottoman Empire. This resulted in Russia losing one-thirds of its European population, and almost 80% of its industrial centers. (3) Those who opposed the Bolshevik policies revolted against them and as a result the Russian Civil War began. The former allies of Russia (the UK, France, the USA and others) sent troops to Russia and occupied strips of Russian territory to support the anti-Bolsheviks. And this list may go on\u2026. ",

            "answer_text": "One word - devastating. Not that much as after WW II, but it was devastating simply because of the fact that Russian civil war occured at the worst moment possible, during quite succesful campaign toward Germany and Austria, causing great damage to already weakened Russia. Suddenly brother started to fight his brother with same weapons they used against Germans, and because of vast territory and many political and social movements (monarchists, communists, anarchists, nationalists\u2026) Russia became one big \"playground\" for social experiments that occured until 1922, when CCCP was established.
