            "answer_text": "If you major operations where the French singlehandedly won, then no.  However, the Free French Forces after the Fall of France offered strong support as part of the Western Allies.  This included various actions in North Africa and during amphibious landings in Southern France concurrent with the far more famous Normandy Landings.  A liberated France also contributed large numbers of troops in the closing months of the war.       But no, during the actual Battle of France in 1940, France won no major engagements, although they did slap the Italians silly when they tried to invade.  Resistance only ended after the government in Paris surrendered.  Still, French soldiers, despite the stereotype, fought valiantly and won local victories.  But then, why didn't they win if they fought so valiantly?  Its important to note that virtually no one could stand before the mobile warfare of the Germans until the invasion of the Soviet Union.  And even this was done with great cost.  France did not lose because it was populated by cowards, rather it lost because it never had time to adapt how the USSR and UK could because of a lack of space to retreat to and some criminally idiotic decisionmaking by its leadership.  And in any case, its useful to note that the French suffered serious casualties before surrendering.  In over 2 years of fighting in Italy and France after D-Day and into the final days in Germany, the USA suffered a bit over 200,000 deaths in Europe.  France lost roughly this many killed in just a single month of combat in 1940 while the British fled in the hundreds of thousands after seeing barely any combat. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, they did, but most of them were lesser-known battles. Free French forces participated, however, in many larger battles that were jointly won by the U.S., the British Empire & Commonwealth, and other Allied countries. Free French units played a major role in stamping out Vichy regimes in Central Africa before gradually shifting northward to the Sahara and North Africa. Probably their biggest single engagement, in North Africa, where French soldiers fought without much Allied assistance, was the Battle of Bir Hakeim, in Libya, in 1942. French troops also played a major role in driving the last remnants of the German Army out of Paris in 1944. I believe there were also some successful French engagements along the German frontier, and within Germany, but I am not that familiar with those campaigns. Between June 1944 and the end of the War, the number of troops available to the Free French expanded rapidly, and this gave French commanders more scope. ",
