Chinese emperors' huge armies lead Turkish leaders choose  not to build cities. Turkish people lived as nomads on horse.       Turkish men start to ride horse from very little ages 4-5 so they can use horse like their limb. Horses were very important power factor in warfare. Turkish armies are very rapid organizations can make agile blows to enemy in combat.   Rapid reaction traditions against Chinese armies, needing to live as nomads on horses , required organization structure and live as soldier lifestyle make Turkish people effective warriors.  According to old Turkish tradition before Islam, dying in bed is not honorable as dying in combat so Turkish men were not afraid of death. They seek honorable death as a warrior , they make fearless attacks.  In  Battle of Manzikert Turkish Commander Alp Arslan was informed by their excited spearheads that a huge Roman army was approaching to Turkish army.Alp Arslan replied that \"We are approaching them too\".  Roman Emperor was taken as prisoner . This was turning point of East Roman Empire's history. Helmuth von Moltke the Elder is accepted as one of the great military tacticians in history  describe Turks with this sentence. \"The most vivid example of armed nation is Turkish nation. Turkish peasant hold their sickles like paw arms, secretaries hold their pen like paw up arms... Turks sits like astride, walks like awake troops  sent to combat\"Moltke ",

            "answer_text": "The Ottomans had one thing most imperial people do not. They had the foresight to know they were not administrators. The Ottoman Turks were formidable in combat, relentless and brutally efficient in occupation, ruthless when necessary. One thing they were not, was good administrators and book-keepers. But they knew that. When the Ottomans made the step from a raiding kingdom to Imperial holding, they understood they needed to find someone to administer all this for them. Thus they gave some autonomy to their conquered people (most of which were not really that good warriors but definitely better scholars) and used them for the task the Ottomans were ill-suited for. They obviously kept the most important positions for themselves, but the could delegate some responsibilities. It is not surprising that in the Ottoman Empire (as in almost all succesful Empires) you could find every conquered people represented in the command structure. Sometimes even Beys\u2019 and Pashas\u2019 were at least partly member of the conquered population (but always Muslim). They also undestood that Unity is very important in an Empire, so they went to great lengths to unite the population under their religion. Unfortunately, their aggresive nature led them to use some more\u2026 well aggresive measures, causing the conquered population to respond in kind and therefore the measures were not as successful as they could be. So all in all, the Ottomans stuck to what they were good at, fighting, and left the tedious day-to-day management to mostly others. That delegation of duties (centuries before it was put to paper by economists) made the Ottoman Empire so successful (and also caused its downfall later, but\u2026. these things happen). ",
