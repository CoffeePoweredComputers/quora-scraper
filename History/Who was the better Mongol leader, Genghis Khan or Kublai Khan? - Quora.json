            "answer_text": "Genghis Khan started with a bunch of tribal confederacies and built an empire that would go on to become the largest contiguous land empire in history. It grew to its peak well after his death, but its success in the decades after his death could be attributed to the policies he put into place himself. For all his greatness, maintaining Mongol unity was not one of Kublai's strengths. In fact he started a civil war to get the position of the Great Khan. Soon after he allowed Berke Khan and Hulagu Khan to go to war with each other. The Berke-Hulagu war permanently halted the growth of the Mongol empire, outside of China. It led to the breakup of the empire into Khanates hostile to each other, and a long process of their dissolution. So in a way, Kublai took one of the greatest empires in history and oversaw it starting to descend into chaos. Ultimately though, Kublai was probably more successful as an emperor of China, than the Mongol Great Khan, a position in which Genghis had no peers. ",

The overwhelming impression one gets of the horse nomad empires is their ephemeral, here today, gone tomorrow quality. Timephased maps of old Eurasia show steady-state situations at the Roman-Byzantine western end and the Chinese eastern end. But they show a churning whirlpool in the steppes between. Kublai tried to bring some stability to the Mongol rule but the Mongols weren\u2019t having it and eventually the Chinese weren\u2019t having them. at the end of the day if the question is:\u201c were the Mongols better off at the end of their \u201cEmpire\u201d as at the beginning of it?\u201d the answer would be NO! between China, Russia and the Ottomans they were nearly destroyed. China not only crushed them but annexed the best lands leaving the Mongols only mountains, steppe and the Gobi desert. the Majority of Mongols live in China as a minority. then there is still the fallout from the various war crimes Genghis Khan and his successors committed. Anti-Mongolian sentiment has been prevalent throughout history, often perceiving the Mongols to be a barbaric and uncivilized people. Descendants of Genghis Khan fight for survival in Afghanistan and Pakistan ",
