            "answer_text": "1: It happened in China, which is in Asia. Which is neither the US or Europe. As such, in true human fashion, since the West did not have a vested interest in the region at the time, events happening there went unnoticed. Frankly, this is still a problem in the US education system, but that is a story for another time. 2: We weren\u2019t their foes long enough, and allies with the Chinese long enough, for it to come to a head. The Germans, frankly, picked a fight with everyone, and so everyone had a bone to pick with them on their\u2026 policies. the USSR was similar, in that we had a half century long silent feud, so any dirt that could be dished was worth dishing. China, meanwhile, rather quickly changed sides to the communists after the dust settled. 3: Japan hasn\u2019t really brought it up much. Unlike Germany, who has taken full responsibility for their actions, to the point that even Israel has grudging respect for them, Japan hasn\u2019t fully admitted to the extent of the warcrimes. This in particular has created severe friction between China, Korea, and Japan in recent years. ",

            "answer_text": "They do. Some people compare Japan with Nazi Germany.The Nazi systematically murdered civilians.Japanese army never systematically murdered civilians.If you look at the so-called Nanjing Massacre, the Chinese communist government claims that 300,000 people were killed.According to Western media at that time, the population of Nanjing was just over 200,000.So the Japanese army must have killed the whole population of Nanjing 1.5 times. Those were the fake news during the wartime to prop up the support of the war efforts. So many people were killed during the WW2, but that was a result of the war.Nobody talked about the massacred Japanese civilians, is it simply because Japan started the war, so it was the Japanese government\u2019s fault, not the people or the countries who did it? Think Bomber Harris, he is a hero in Britain, but the murderer in Dresden. ",
