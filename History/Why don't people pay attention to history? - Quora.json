            "answer_text": "I'm not entirely certain what you wanted to convey with the headlines in your link, but I think I got the gist (forgive me if I got it wrong). Maybe I can give you a few things to research and consider. First off, humans are violent. I doubt there are many people in the world who would say that's untrue, especially when one looks at our species' history over the last 15,000 years. There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of archeological examples of human skeletons that show incontrovertible evidence of fatal damage caused by weapons, and since we are the only species that regularly wields them, they pretty much have to have taken that damage from a fellow human. While it's true that many, if not most, people have never been actually moved to DO violence to another, we all have the capacity. Even an extreme pacifist may at least consider harming another if it might save a loved one's life. The reason most of us don't commit mayhem on others to get what we want is that we have rules. By taking the impulse to do violence for ANY reason out of our hands, at least theoretically, and putting it in the hands of a group created for that express purpose (police, armies, judiciary, etc.), we take the emotions out of it. Again in theory, once that happens, the perpetrator can be exposed to a deterrent or appropriate revenge by proxy: the punishment. That is the ideal, and while it's LONG way from perfect, it still works better than the alternative, which is to take the making and enforcing of rules by individuals or private groups (which would then be subject to infinite variations depending on the individuals involved and the circumstances of the moment), and can and has led to all manner of violence, including feuds, vendettas, vast wars, genocide and extremely inventive and widely enacted torture. A while back, I found a book called \u201cBetter Angels of Our Nature,\u201d by an author I have read before named Steven Pinker. I picked it up for two reasons, one being that as mentioned, I have read other works of his, and I found him to have unusual and far-reaching perspectives. The premise was this: that our global cultures today are actually far less violent overall than ever before in human history. If you're like me, that's a rather provocative idea! We are told so much about global violence, by means of so many different media, both interpersonal crimes and wars involving many thousands; and it appears that criminal activity, as well as brutality on small and large scales, are not just rampant but on the rise. It's fascinating reading and appears to be exceedingly well researched. Now I have to say that I didn't finish it. I read about 3/4 of it and by that time, I was pretty much convinced that his perspective had some serious merit. Over the decades, I have read a huge amount, both non-fiction and fiction. I'm no expert on anything by the stretch of anyone's imagination, but I am also by no means uneducated. I had read about many of the examples of our human history, many of the examples of conflicts that he drew from. All of this is a VERY long circle which comes (finally!) back around to my point: not everyone knows (or cares) much about history, but many, MANY people do. Many people make a good living learning and disseminating the accumulated history of our people and planet. If you feel that the people whose company you keep are uneducated in history, why not try finding some who are? Consider seeking out people who have studied the topics you have, as well as topics you may not even know existed. You could find yourself pleasantly surprised, maybe even comforted, that the lessons we have learned might still be used to good effect in the \u201ccivilization\" of our species. Who knows? Maybe you're the next mover and shaker on our behalf. Good luck! ",

You can tell, because I say \u201can Historian.\u201d ANyway, the reason many people do not pay proper attention to history, is bad education. They haven\u2019t been taught to recognize the intense functional importance of the past. Many have actually been taught to OPPOSE paying attention to history. ",
