            "answer_text": "To be more precise with terminologies , Greek speaking people and orthodox Christians could be found almost anywhere in Anatolia in big or small concentrations. These people could be better identified as Romans before the 19th century . The Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire tagged these people as Greeks . Regarding the question, someone could find a lot of Pontic Greek speaking people in Pontus where even nowadays there is a handful of Muslims who speak Pontic . There were also Greek speaking communities in Erzurum or Theodosiopolis as they called it which was in the geographical borders and I stress it to avoid misunderstanding , the geographical borders of Anatolia and Armenia . Last, in the southeastern borders , Greeks could be found in Adana bordering Hatay which belonged to the region of Syria and also hosted a sizable Greek speaking community . ",

            "answer_text": "Greeks at one time could be found as far east as India and the modern northwest border of China. These Greeks came from the armies of Alexander the Great. In modern times, Greek communities could be found (and still can to this day) as far east as the Caucasus mountains (Caucasus Greeks), therefore spanning the entirety of Anatolia. There are Greek communities in Eastern Turkey, Armenia, Georgia, and Russia that were part of the Greek diaspora during the Byzantine Empire and afterward the Ottoman Empire. Although much smaller, these Greek communities still exist today. Some examples are the Cappadocian Greeks (Eastern/Central Turkey), Pontic Greeks (all along the Black Sea and Pontic Alps), and Transcaucasian Greeks (As far north as Russia living within Volgograd and Rostov Oblasts).
