            "answer_text": "Hello! Donald Trump is a first-rate con artist. He is a counterfeit, autocratic dullard impersonating a commander in chief. He is hate personified and incompetence exemplified. He is the imbecilic farce of a white man convinced of his own supremacy. Before voicing their exasperation over the Trump/Putin/Pence administration, all the white liberals, the people at the helm of the resistance movement, will adjust their pink p*ssy hats and straighten their safety pin-adorned \u201cRESIST\u201d shirts and explain why and how Donald Trump is not fit to represent their beloved country. In their attempt to convince the world of his lack of qualifications, they conveniently forget that this misogynist, this lie-spewing, racism-filled narcissist, is the perfect person to represent America. Republicans will overlook the inherent evil of his immigration policy just like this country overlooked Jim Crow, segregation, lynching and the evil that remains in every sector of society. They have forgotten how Trump excused a white supremacist murder in Charlottesville, Va., just like America excuses white supremacy as an institutional reality. And he lies \u2026 Despite what the numbers say, his inauguration was the biggest inauguration in the history of inaugurations. He passed more legislation than any president ever. He won the electoral college by a record amount. Truth be damned, facts no longer matter. And according to Trump, America is the greatest country on earth, despite what the numbers say. We are a beacon of freedom and liberty even though we rank first in the world\u2019s prison population. We are the smartest nation in the world, despite ranking 14th in education and second in ignorance. We believe in equality and tolerance, despite ranking No. 1 on the list of the most racist countries in the world. See? I told you we were No. 1. Trump promised he would fix our health care system, like America has been telling us for decades, but he made it worse. He preaches prosperity for the middle class but his policies benefit the wealthy. He promises peace but starts petty conflicts around the world. He elevates white mediocrity. He put an unqualified dolt (Betsy DeVos) who has never attended, studied or worked in public schools, in charge of America\u2019s public schools. He placed Jeff Sessions, known for supporting injustice, in charge of the Department of Justice. Rick Perry, Trump\u2019s Secretary of Energy, became famous after stating his desire to eliminate the Department of Energy. America\u2019s love affair with celebrity and disregard for substance made Kim Kardashian a freedom fighter, Kanye the most-quoted expert on slavery and Donald Trump the leader of the free world. America is all too willing to remain blind to his transgressions, even with definitive proof. This country is willing to watch Trump and his minion of secondhand liars\u2014Sarah Sanders, Kellyanne Conway, Kirstjen Neilsen\u2014tell boldface lies to the American public without penalty. We watch definitive proof of his cronies\u2019 coldhearted bullshit captured on video. Yet we are told that we must respect them. We are supposed to remain civil towards them after they have demonstrated they don\u2019t give a f*ck about us\u2026 Does this answer your question? ",

            "answer_text": "There is one thing. Currently, the US is pushing military hostility or outright war against/in Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Cuba, Ukraine, Iraq, Syria, Russia, China and an unknown number of African nations. Military overextension is partly why Rome fell. Trump is damaging this eternal war system by ruining the credibility needed for war excuses. He is pushing the globe away from the dominance of the US dollar and banking system. He is helping to pile up debts that will eventually enfeeble the US in threatening others. He creates daily distractions that encourage the superficial media to ignore huge problems that require hard choices and thinking. Rationally stopping the military industrial complex is impossible. He is running it into the ground. It\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride. ",
