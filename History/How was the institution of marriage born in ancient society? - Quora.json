            "answer_text": "This Process has taken considerable lot of time. At first living was in the nomadic way, there was no systematic way of living which was non organised. Food,cloth and shelter was the prime concerned of each human being and thus this continued. After the search for an home which were build by stones having no architecture but was only in a form of a kind of shelter.This was shifting from caves and dens and coming forward for getting regularized. Slowly,and gradually cooking, storing, preserving, started and so on.Than the cults were formed. Than there were strong people who ruled the cult.The strong fighter who won the feeble had many children, out of many wives. There after the marriage institution developed but still not in a perfect manner, as any body slept with any body and children were born out of such relations which were only identified by their mothers only. There after due to sexual jealousy there were small quarrels between the strong verses weak. Females were considered as slaves and instruments as sex tools!!! Finally after long duration the exact MARRIAGE institution began. Which consisted their own rituals,rules and the like. This was slow transformation from savage like life to a sort of semi organised way of living. We have observed,that ladies were won on the ground of bravery fights.There is no perfect date or time duration as to when the marriage institution was born, but from the above presented details,things should have been clear. But history revels clear that women have always been considered as sex oriented THINGS tools, used them,children producing machines, sold them like slaves bartered and much more!!! Thanks for today\u2019s society framing and protecting women with proper rules and regulations. ",
