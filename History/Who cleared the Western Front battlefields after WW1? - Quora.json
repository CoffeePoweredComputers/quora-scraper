            "answer_text": "In part they were cleared by United States troops. My father was a company commander in the 29th Division, Ordinance Corp. US Army assigned to France in 1918. After the war, his company was assigned the task of clearing a section of the front not far from Orleans. He told me many stories of how the battlefield area was so churned by artillery that the landscape looked like a storm at sea that had been frozen. Not a tree survived. He said you couldn\u2019t pick up a handful of dirt without finding pieces of metal and sometimes human body parts as well. He picked up a boot and bones fell out; another time he picked up a helmet and a skull fell out. The Americans went home as soon as they could \u2014 his company was repatriated in July, 1919 \u2014 unlike post-war Europe in the late \u201840s, so American involvement in the cleanup was limited, but it was real, and it was emotionally scaring for the participants.
