            "answer_text": "Something important to note that I do think deserves some praise that Castro did is that he did the opposite of what North Korea did in a similar situation. Both North Korea and Cuba\u2019s economies were very much linked to the Soviet Union. Many people do not know this now but during most of the Cold War both North and South Korea had very similar economic outputs, but as the Soviet economy started to stagnate so too did North Korea\u2019s and by the time the USSR collapsed the North Korean GDP per capita was nearly a third of South Korea\u2019s and today it\u2019s around a depressingly incredible 1/22 of South Korea\u2019s GDP per capita whereas Cuba\u2019s GDP per capita is now catching up to Mexico\u2019s. Something the Kim family did that Castro did not, in addition to the \u201cSpecial Period\u201d mentioned by another person here that opened Cuba to some privatization, was that North Korea did not decrease its military spending in the time of crisis following Soviet collapse. Cuba had a very large and powerful military during the Cold War both out of fear of the US and to assist its allies overseas. Cuba has cut its military spending after Soviet collapse to one-third of what it had been relative to GDP. North Korea, which has never had significant overseas deployments and is interested in defending only its own state, not only did not decrease its spending after Soviet collapse, it increased it using the state ideology of \u201cJuche\u201d as justification and according to some estimates they spend as much as a third of their entire GDP on their armed forces. North Korea has weighed its self down into a hole with military spending and Cuba has lifted the drain its military had on the economy. ",

            "answer_text": "Announced the \u201cspecial period\u201d. It was an incredibly difficult gime for Cuba but, thanks largely to the jngenuity of the Cuban people themselves, they conducted a massive- very successful experiment in localised food production, permaculture and buildng a post fossil fuel society. In fact, the world should have been paying attention and taking notes because Cuba is one of the first societies to mostly transition to a post petroleum era. It took a long time for life to find its rhythm in Cuba when the USSR collapsed and the US tightened the blockade hoping to use starvation to provoke a revolution. This did not happen. Most of the population that really couldn\u2019t stand the privations of the special period got on anything that could float and fled to Miami. We all know the tragedies of that era- the many lives lost at sea. Back in Cuba itself, those who stayed had to find ways of making an extremely low resource economy function. And they did. Cadtro had no choice but to authorise a greater degree of market activity and to permit people to start businesses. He didn\u2019t like it and there was a lot of grey legality in the economy of the 1990s. Most people had to do something to either earn dollars or get extra sources of income and the regime was forced to turn a blind eye, or sometimes openly recognise and legitimise private business activity. A climate of bribery and corruption fairly naturally arose around this. Although the Castro regime found itself deeply challenged by circumstance and was forced to open up the market aspect of the economy and wind down some aspects of the command economy, it weathered the crisis better than anyone had expected. The Cuban economy still has serious problems and deficiencies and is still trying to institutionalise the huge informal economy that exists but, partly despite the regime, partly because of it, the Cuban people have become outstanding improvisers and seat of the pants entrepreneurs. Castro was forced to grudgingly accept, and even embrace, this entrepreneurial Cuban spirit. It has certainly become a defining feature of life in Cuba since the special period began. ",
