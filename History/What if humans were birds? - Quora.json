They think the engineering major I choose is not realistic for the future, but who can guarantee the future? I'm willing to risk becoming the person I want to be. And maybe you want to be a bird? I am sorry, please give up. ",

Unless of course, you\u2019re not interested in a sensible answer, but just curious as to what if humans were birds. Well, I guess we\u2019d be the curiosity of the actual humans around us observing all our features and behaviors just like we do them, now. ",
