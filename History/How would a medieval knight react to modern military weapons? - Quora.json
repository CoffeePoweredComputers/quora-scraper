            "answer_text": "He would shit in his armor. A jet powered fighter bomber, spitting 20mm, at an armored tank with a 120mm main cannon, while SAMs streak up into the sky, all set to the brutal sound of machine gun fire? It would seem like the apocalypse had come down on this poor, religious soul. Not a single thing would be familiar, every sound, machine, weapon would be terrifying to him. The average medieval knight was poorly educated, and schooled in swords, Lance\u2019s, axes and horsemanship, none of which would do him any good on the modern battlefield. Unaware that the ferociously loud shots he was hearing carried lead at 3000 ft per second, he wouldn\u2019t know to duck, and given the bright armor, he\u2019d be an easy target. So about 30 seconds after soiling himself, he\u2019d be dead. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the Knight would be surprised of course, confused, may be even scared,but not for long. He would ask questions. And at this point he, would be getting calmer.Keep in mind, that the gunpowder powered weapons were used at the end of the late medieval period. I think he could easily comprehend modern guns and artillery. He would know it is just a better versions of those of his times. It would be harder to explain the existence of tanks, planes, rocket weapons etc. Knights were soldiers not scientists. It would be hard to explain those scientifically. But I think he would understand after long explanation, but it would be hard. For example. You would tell him about the tank. Telling him it's the complexes explanation fails. Expect questions like what is an engine, what is that and further more. If you tell him it is a siege engine and use equivalent of the thing from his times he would at the end be not surprised but amazed of what humanity is capable of. ",
