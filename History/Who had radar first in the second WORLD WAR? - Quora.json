The British were a very close second - but they made it an essential part of their air defence network. When the Graf Spee was sunk in 1940 secret British investigation of the wreck revealed an unmistakeable radar aerial. German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee - Wikipedia  What really got the British depressed was that, when they went back over their records the installation was visible on photos taken in 1938! Seetakt - Wikipedia Trenckle says that Admiral Graf Spee had an experimental FuMO 22, and Prager that Deutschland had a Seetakt set in the autumn 1937 (which proved very useful for night navigation in Spanish waters). German Naval Radar HMS Sheffield got a Type 79 in August 1938 Radar Equipment of the United Kingdom / Britain However, the Germans were primarily interested in gun laying radars and single installations. Radar was not really essential for blitzkrieg. Before the war the British were worrying about \u201cthe bomber will always get through\u201d problem. The bomber will always get through - Wikipedia In 1936, to general bafflement, Thomas Inskip was made Minister for Coordination of Defence.  His appointment to this particular office was highly controversial. Winston Churchill had long campaigned for such an office and when its creation was announced, most expected Churchill to be appointed. When Inskip was named, one famous reaction was that \"This is the most cynical appointment since Caligula made his horse a consul\". However, Inskip was a lawyer, gifted with a clear mind and a lack of \u201ctribalism\u201d. In the early 30\u2019s the RAF was fully signed up to the \u201cbomber will always get through\u201d idea and thought the best solution was to build bombers and threaten retaliation. Inskip pointed out that fighters were a great deal cheaper. He drastically cut back on bomber production and ordered fighters instead. He also gave the Fleet Air Arm back to the Navy. To say the RAF \u201ctop brass\u201d hated him is putting it mildly! However, the RAF got on with the idea of defending Britain with fighters. and a \u201cCommittee\u201d was set up to see what could be done Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence - Wikipedia From the problems defending London in WWI it was realised that standing patrols of fighters were very costly in terms of fighter numbers. So, the critical issue was the early detection of attacking bombers. After various dead ends, like super listening devices Acoustic mirror - Wikipedia the first radar detection system in the world was set up under the guidance or Watson-Watt Robert Watson-Watt - Wikipedia The first five Chain Home stations were installed by 1937 and up and running by 1938 Chain Home - Wikipedia  Technically it was inferior to the German radar. But it was integrated into a 3C control system RAF Bentley Priory - Wikipedia  Filter Room - Wikipedia - that allowed the outnumbered RAF fighters to defeat the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain. Battle of Britain - Wikipedia Hugh Dowding - Wikipedia So, the important point was not who had radar first, but who used it first to best effect - and that was the British ",

            "answer_text": "Who had radar first in the second WORLD WAR? Who was first could be argued back a long way.The key was: \u2018implementation of the technology\u2019 In a war scenario \u2018correct implementation\u2019 does not mean \u2018best technological solution\u2019. We have long known that the German command structure failed to curb the excesses of the engineering community. They (the engineers) always tried to create the next best thing - perfect for a peacetime scenario.\u2026 but warfare requires material which does the job, and can be easily mass produced and maintained. The Tiger tank is an excellent example of a machine that was over engineered, and the same can be said of their implementation of radar. German Air Defence Their land based \u2018air defence product\u2019 was technically superior because they chose to make it technically superior.\u2026 but it required a complex pyramid support infrastructure. This infrastructure was easily attacked, and by taking out any element, the entire regional system was brought down - and it took time to bring it back into service. British Air Defence The British chose to make their air defence very simple. The operators got to see a few blobs on a screen, enough to be able to vector a squadron into the path of the oncoming aircraft. If a radar station was damaged - within a few hours it would be working again - certainly in time for the next attack. Understanding the Thinking It is very easy to view the past in simplistic terms, say, relating to a piece of equipment \u2026 was it better or worse, or who got it first? When you are fighting for survival, you are looking at winning battles.There were many battles; one of which was the \u2018radar battle\u2019. Britain could take out the German radar for a week (say) - leaving gaps in the continental defence. Germany could take out a single British radar for a few hours (there was no pyramid structure) - meaning that the gap could be easily re-filled. You can decide for yourself, which side developed the best system for the job.
