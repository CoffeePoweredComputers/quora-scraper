Cooperation: by providing shared values and assumptions, culture may enhance goodwill and mutual trust, encouraging cooperation 2. Decision Making: shared beliefs gives members a consistent set of basic assumptions which may lead to a more efficient decision-making process due to fewer disagreements 3. Control: control is provided by three mechanisms 1. The market control mechanism relies on price. If results fall short of goals, prices are adjusted to stimulate necessary change2.

Communication: culture reduces communication problems in two ways: 1. no need to communicate in matters for which shared assumptions already exist2. shared assumptions provide guidelines and cues to help interpret messages that are received5. Commitment: strong cultures foster strong identification which causes commitment 6. Perception: what an individual see is conditioned by what others sharing the same experience say they are seeing 7.
