            "answer_text": "Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of diseases in populations. It is the key quantitative discipline that underpins public health, which is often defined as the organised efforts of society to prevent disease and to promote health. (1)  There have been significant developments in epidemiologic methodology during the past century, including changes in basic concepts, methods of data analysis, and methods of exposure measurement. However, the rise of modern epidemiology has been a mixed blessing, and the new paradigm has major shortcomings, both in public health and in scientific terms. The changes in the paradigm have not been neutral but have rather helped change--and have reflected changes in--the way in which epidemiologists think about health and disease. The key issue has been the shift in the level of analysis from the population to the individual. Epidemiology has largely ceased to function as part of a multidisciplinary approach to understanding the causation of disease in populations and has become a set of generic methods for measuring associations of exposure and disease in individuals. This reductionist approach focuses on the individual, blames the victim, and produces interventions that can be harmful. We seem to be using more and more advanced technology to study more and more trivial issues, while the major causes of disease are ignored. Epidemiology must reintegrate itself into public health and must rediscover the population perspective. (2) For a detailed understanding, this short course is highly suggested: What Is Epidemiology in Public Health? (1) Epidemiology and Public Health Reesarch at the School of Clinical Medicine  (2) Traditional epidemiology, modern epidemiology, and public health.  ",

            "answer_text": "Epidemiology is the study of disease in populations. Veterinarians and others involved in the preventive medicine and public health professions use epidemiological methods for disease surveillance, outbreak investigation, and observational studies to identify risk factors of zoonotic disease in both human and animal populations. Knowledge of these risk factors is used to direct further research investigation and to implement disease control measures. The use of hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) systems depends greatly on information produced by epidemiological studies. Epidemiological methods are used for disease surveillance to identify which hazards are the most important. Epidemiological studies are also used to identify risk factors which may represent critical control points in the food production system. ",

            "answer_text": "Epidemiology is one of the most valued analytic tools we have in public health. It informs us what diseases and problems threaten the well being of the populace and how we should start dealing with them. A concrete example of this is the recent Chipotle food poisoning techniques. When large outbreaks happen you can plot out the number of cases and when they occurred to help give you a time frame of the attack. Then you can do patient interviews to figure out what exposure they all had in common. This helped with identifying Chipotle as the cause of the outbreak. With further analysis they were able to identify the vegetable prep step as the one that resulted in the exposure and now Chipotle has changed its prep procedures in response.  We do epi on all kinds of problems such as the flu, HIV spread in segregated neighborhoods, and identifying risk factors for all sorts of cancer. Epidemiology is the hard backbone that makes up the science of Public Health. ",

            "answer_text": "Epidemiology is used in various ways in public health, most importantly it is used to understand the trends of the worlds/locally most common illnesses. The study of epidemiology allows you to understand the rates, risks and look at populations that are more prone to the identified illnesses or social conditions. This is where the real work and public health gets fun and more practical, you then begin to use this data to try to understand the risk factors and develop preventative programming, vaccines/ medications/ information for those at risk. The goal of public health is always prevention, in turn epidemiology is 1 of 5 disciplines that allows public health professionals to understand what /why and how we can develop real solutions that meet the needs of those being affected!

Epidemiology in public health practice uses study design and analyses to identify causes in an outbreak situation, guides interventions to improve population health, and evaluates programs and policies. In this course, we'll define the role of the professional epidemiologist as it relates to public health services, functions, and competencies. With that foundation in mind, we'll introduce you to the problem-solving methodology and demonstrate how it can be used in a wide variety of settings to identify problems, propose solutions, and evaluate interventions. This methodology depends on the use of reliable data, so we'll take a deep dive into the routine and public health data systems that lie at the heart of epidemiology and then conclude with how you can use that data to calculate measures of disease burden in populations.
