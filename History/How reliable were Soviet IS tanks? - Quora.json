            "answer_text": "World War II IS tanks, the IS-1 and IS-2, were quite reliable due to upgrades in the designs from the KV, such as an improved transmission.  But let\u2019s let the reports say for themselves. Here\u2019s a page from Tank Archives[1] detailing a report from the 6th Guards Tank Army detailing their tank\u2019s life span. IS-2 and its assault gun counterpart, the ISU-122, were lumped together to give a mobility life of 1200\u20131800 km for a total running time of 230\u2013280 hours. To put this in perspective, the German Panther in February 1944, when it was deemed the most effective from Heinz Guderian, has a reported life of 700\u20131000 km. The Sherman and T-34 were reported to go up to 2000\u20132500 km. So not the most reliable of all tanks, but it was reliable enough for decent running time to get to the battlefield. Post-war, the IS tanks move on to the IS-3, IS-4, and so on.  And now, some problems erupt with these new heavy tanks. Back to Tank Archives were their report on the IS-3[2], it seems that the IS-3 only ran 980 km with an engine running time of 58 hours before the tank broke down. There are many other problems as well as far as structural integrity[3] went (the pike hull had a tendency to crack from the weight strain and even from the 122 mm cannon\u2019s muzzle blast). The Russians spent a good part of the early Cold War refining and modernizing the IS-3 to fix its problems, and it probably showed in the 6-Day War when Egypt with about 100 IS-3M tanks, though the engine proved unsuitable to desert climates.  IS-4 was in a sense a beefed up IS-2, though with a different engine. However, it was only put on limited production as it had mobility issues even with the engine. It also had problems with the transmission that dented its reliability[4], So that was a stalled project.  T-10 was the last mass-produced Soviet heavy tank and technically still in the IS tank family. Not much is known on their overall reliability, however it might be safe to say that it carried over the mobility issues its predecessor has with an underpowered engine for the weight. That said, in the many modernizations its adoption that followed, most of the projects were based on improving the fire-control system[5] rather than its mobility, so perhaps it was not a very big problem or at the very least wasn\u2019t a concern to the Russians.

            "answer_text": "Is-3 was a least reliable tank. Problems with its maintenance and low reliability lead to cancellation of the project in 1946, only after one year in production. And already produced tanks were heavily modified under \u201cUKZ\u201d (Removal of Construction Errors) programs. But Is-3 was itself heavy modification of Is-2 tank, and the works on Is-3 started only after 4 months into production of Is-2 tank. In the times of war most priority was given to the quantity, not quality, thus most of the changes required by the army were not included in the production of the Is-2, thus lead to poor quality, some serious design flaws and very low reliability. Least than a half of produced tanks were accepted from the factory without need of changing some of the major parts. Situation was so bad, that factory was required that one tank from the 50 produced shall be tested in 300km run, not a single Is-2 made this course without breakdowns. ",
