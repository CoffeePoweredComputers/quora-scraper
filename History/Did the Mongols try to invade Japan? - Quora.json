            "answer_text": "Yes, Mongols tried to invade Japan twice. The first attempt by Kublai Khan in 1274 after conquest of Korea. Mongols invaded some islands and killed basically everyone they faced in smaller skirmishes. However they were defeated in the battle of Torikai after which retreaded to their ships. An untimly typhoon hit the ships ending the first invasion. This is where the name \u201ckamikaze\u201d comes from, meaning \u201cdivine wind\u201d. Kublai Khan tried for a second invasion in 1281 with a much larger force but Japanese were better prepared. Mongols had a huge fleet that was very hard to provision so they were slowed down in the entire campaign. Japanese fortified the islands with high walls so Mongols never really had the chance to disembark the entire army. Japanese won most of the skirmishes and once Mongols retreaded back to their ships another kamikaze hit the shores for two days straight destroying majority of the Mongol forces. Even though Mongols had the strong Korean ships, most of the fleet were made of Chinese river boats that couldn\u2019t handle the storms. There\u2019s historical talk about a 3rd invasion which has never been initiated. ",

            "answer_text": "They did not. They attempted it twice (first in 1274 then in 1281), but it didn\u2019t work out either time. The weather turned out to be very much against the Mongols. The first invasion involved a relatively modest force of a little over 20,000 Mongols and allied troops. They met with some initial success, though resistance was stiffening, when a storm caught most of Mongols out at sea and destroyed the bulk of the fleet and the embarked troops with them. The Japanese were able to mop up the few remaining Mongols with little trouble. The second invasion was much larger, nearly 150,000 total troops, though more Chinese and other vassals than Mongols. Once again, the invading army met with mixed success. The Mongol-led armies outnumbered the Japanese, but the Japanese had constructed some very good coastal defenses, keeping the Mongol forces at bay. And, once again, a tremendous storm struck, destroying much of the Mongol armada. ",
