            "answer_text": "The Bible says that Abraham came from Ur of the Chaldees (KJV, Genesis 11:31), which would mean that he was a Chaldean. The problem with this is that the Chaldeans only migrated out of the Arabian Peninsula in the eighth century BCE, quite long after the time attributed to Abraham. There is reason to believe the legend of Abraham existed several centuries before the eighth century BCE and probalby portrayed him as coming from Ur, but the reference to the Chaldeans was written during the Babylonian Exile. If Abraham really did exist, he could not have been Sumerian, because the Sumerians were not Semitic and we have to posit a Semitic ancestor for the Hebrews. On these assumptions, he could have been Akkadian, because at least the Akkadians were a Semitic people. Historically, Abraham is unlikely to have existed as a real person. ",

Amorites? The Torah says he was \u2018a wandering Aramean\u2019, so maybe that\u2019s it. He and his descendants settled in the land of Canaan, and adopted the language and (some of) the customs of that area (apparently). ",
