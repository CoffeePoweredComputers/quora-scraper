            "answer_text": "Because Stalingrad wasn\u2019t some sort of a swift and decisive victory by the Red Army and because eventual German defeat was far from apparent in early 1943.  Battle of Stalingrad The months-long battle, siege and counter-siege, relief force and all the rest exhausted both sides. Losses were grevious, German allies lost most of their forces and the Wehrmacht lost a full field army. Yet the Soviet victory was costlier still. Soviets had over a million of wounded, captured and missing, over 400 thousand dead. They lost three tanks to each German tank, two aircraft to each German aircraft and more. After Stalingrad the Wehrmacht in the east was bloodied badly, but the Red Army fared little better. Furthermore, Stalingrad wasn\u2019t even the focus of the Soviet offensive. That would be Rzhev pocket to the north. There fighting raged for 14 months and over 3.5 million Soviet soldiers faced 1.5 million Germans. Casualties at Rzhev made Stalingrad look tame by comparison: 2.6 million Soviets (killed, wounded, missing) and some 700 thousand Germans (killed, wounded, missing). That\u2019s three full Stalingrads in an inconclusive series of engagements with no clear victor. Yes, the Battle of Verdun (WW1) is be better known, and Stalingrad especially so. Rzhev was larger, longer and bloodier, but doomed to obscurity because all fame went to Stalingrad, as if it were some sort of a turning point. It wasn\u2019t. Mere weeks after their victory at Stalingrad, the Soviet forces were ambushed by smaller but skillyfully handled German forces. Soviets lost another 80 thousand men to perhaps 10 thousand Germans and lost the initiative. Battle of Kursk followed and Russians won that one on points too and even that largely due to the well-timed invasion of Sicily and only after losing more men than Germans lost at ill-fated Stalingrad.

            "answer_text": "It is against human nature for nations to surrender when the situation turns against them. After much sacrifice and misery, it is hard to merely, give up. For example, the South lost the US Civil War after the fall of Vicksburg but fought on for almost two years. In truth, the subject of surrender was not a consideration for Germany or the USSR. No one was dumb enough to even whisper the idea to Stalin or Hitler; it was inconceivable. In fact, having a low chance means\u2026there is still a chance. We can all say it was impossible for Germany to win, in retrospect. After the loss at Stalingrad, and the failure of Operation Case Blue, Germany still LOOKED impressive:  Germany (& Japan) knew they were going to be hit with a sledge hammer to the face. They were aware of these facts, Military production during World War II :  Lend Lease supplied 400,000 trucks and jeeps to the USSR (Studebakers have a cult following in Russia to this day). Ivan loved his studer:  As you can see from the chart above, that was two thirds of the entire Axis production for ALL fronts. Over 80 percent of Wehrmacht was this or walked:  Yes, Germany and Japan, \u201csaw the writing on the wall\u201d by 1943. The odds were heavily stacked against them but they had to see this enterprise through. A low chance of success is still a chance. ",
