            "answer_text": "Because the pace of progress tends not to be linear, but rather geometric. The easiest example is taking a penny, and doubling it every day. You\u2019ll start out slowly, but in a month you\u2019ll have a fortune. Have you ever heard of the phrase \u201cstanding on the shoulders of giants?\u201d What it really means is that scientific break thrus and achievements of the past can be used as guideposts and stepping stones to further achievements, using the previous knowledge as a starting point. In the distant past things may have been recognized, but there was no way to preserve the knowledge other than hand writing it down on papyrus. If that paper was lost, so was the knowledge. Which is why the fire at the great library of Alexandria was such a tragedy. No one will ever know what was lost in that fire. With the invention of the printing press, now knowledge was much more easily retained, replicated and widely disseminated. The pace of progress really started its huge leaps and advances during the Renaissance and has continued ever since. Theory became reality, which later became technology. Think about this\u2026in 1903 the Wright Brothers flew the first rudimentary plane. In 1927 Lindbergh did his solo flight across the Atlantic. And in 1969 Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the Moon and returned safely to Earth. Now that is a leap, made possible by knowledge and ideas from the past built on and expanded upon. The internet only accelerates the pace of such development, and barring a global catastrophe, that pace will continue onwards for the 21st century and beyond in ways we today can scarcely imagine. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s the snowball effect and, as Joe Nevin said, it\u2019s a little bit like compound interest. Another major factor in just the last 10\u201320 years has been the rise of the internet and the ability for people from all over the world to all remotely come together to work on a project together. There are even foundations and other non-profits like Wikipedia and WordPress that have facilitated the growth and spread of knowledge even further by making products and information available in the public domain. Then there are other new technologies like 3D printing which have made it possible to iterate designs faster and to develop new hardware at a much faster rate than was previously possible. And of course, we have all sorts of advantages that weren\u2019t available even 30 or 50 years ago. Ultimately, we\u2019re not held back by new research being carried out from the top of some sort of pyramid of knowledge. Now some kid in a bedroom can create technology that changes the world - and they can raise money for it through crowdfunding sites while they\u2019re at it. ",
