            "answer_text": "The issue is not getting tested, the problem is kids can be asymptomatic or they could be negative one week and then have the virus the next week. Teachers are more concerned about getting the virus from their students. All is takes is one student to contract the virus and they are in close proximity to other students that get the virus and then it spreads to staff and now you have an outbreak at a school. Too many things to worry about, it is not just cut and dry test and open up the schools, you need to have protocols in place. ",

            "answer_text": "This sort of approach makes a small amount of sense for college campuses where students come to live on campus, or perhaps for a K-12 boarding school. Even so, they will be exposed to delivery people, teachers who don\u2019t live on campus, etc. In a K-12 day school, just testing students isn\u2019t helpful unless you pretty much can re-test them all every week. They\u2019re out in the community, at home, with family and friends and relatives who work in other places. They can pick up the virus at any time, bring it to school and spread it widely before all but the most aggressive testing regimes can detect. ",
