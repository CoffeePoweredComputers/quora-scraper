            "answer_text": "First of all, you ask this question as if there were only ONE civilization in the world, but in fact, there are many, many civilizations. FYI, the ancient Greeks had little or no impact on Indian, Chinese, and a vast number of indigenous civilizations. As for assuming the Greeks were the crucible of *Western* civilization, that is also a vast exaggeration. In my mind there is NO doubt that the Jews, the ancient Hebrews, had a far greater impact on Western civilization than the Greeks. The Hebrews/Jews brought, not just to the West, but to the whole world, the their ideas of God, morality, justice, and social organization. The Greeks, on the other hand, had almost no impact on these matters. Indeed, their ideas on these matters are considered primitive, and comprehensively discredited by most civilizations, including the West. Even democracy, largely attributed to the Greeks, is an illusion. The Greek idea of democracy is highly limited, including only land-owning men, with a limited range of matters subject to public assent, and largely limited to one Greek city, Athens. The Bible, on the other, clearly delineates an idea of democracy (tho not called democracy (it\u2019s a Greek word, after all)) that is universal, and much closer to our modern ideas. It is true, the Greeks had a greater impact on the *form* of most Western literature (especially poetry and drama), than the Jews. But as for content, the influences are many and complex, and should not, under any circumstances, be attributed primarily to the Greeks. The Greeks excelled in a few areas that get a lot of press: philosophy and math (and \u201cscience\u201d in a very limited sense). And here their influence was great. However, modern research is beginning to show that the Greeks were, to some extent, and perhaps to a large extent, not the creators of their mathematical ideas and systems, but primarily just transmitters of knowledge acquired from other civilizations. As for using their philosophy, math, and science to develop technology, that was completely lacking in Greek civilization. The Babylonians were *far* greater technologists, and modern technology is a product of modern, not ancient Greek thinking. ",

            "answer_text": "They DID found democracy and inspire the idea of Republics (which are some collections of crazy ideas nearly all modern governments are based off of today). That alone should be reason enough, if we are not counting the art, architecture, drama, or philosophical schools and sciences they discovered/invented. which is the foundation of most of Western Civilization and has bled through on some level to almost ALL of modern Civilization.
