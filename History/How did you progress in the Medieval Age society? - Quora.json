You could excel in your field. A good blacksmith might get commissioned by noblemen and thus get more prestige and money. You could go to the church. The church was very highly regarded and often involved in politics. You could kill a lot of people. Battlefield skill was almost always rewarded. Men-at-arms in 14th Century England for example were common people but they were basically professional soldiers and they often had equipment to rival a knight. They got paid a lot and were very prestigious. You could get lucky. If a nobleman is impressed by you then they might raise your station, grant you some land or a prestigious job. ",
