            "answer_text": "It\u2019s actually quite unique answer. Technically the classic Aztec and Mayan governmental political entity is gone but their culture, language, and their descendants are still around. You still find Indians down there that speak the old languages. They do carry on some of the culture and stuff to modern ages. I know this for a fact because of two experiences I came across in media providing info or a hint of their existence. In the old Star Wars classic trilogy D.V.D.s they have a commentary of one of the original production staff mentioning one of the langues was actually original Aztec or Mayan language being spoken. The individual explained they were looking around for various exotic, unheard of, unrecognizable real world languages to use for the movie to use. Apparently in Mexico they still had some people that speak one of those long lost languages around during the production of these films. They are scattered across Mexico. They used one of these languages because it was very advantageous to slip in as an alien language that they did not have to spend time creating made up unique phonetic sounds to give it a other worldly culture style to it. Another was form a Imax documentary or a documentary I saw somewhere that included some native Indians from Latin America. In it the narrator stated they were descendants of the original Aztecs that fled the catastrophe of the conquistadors coming in. Some of these people ran from these cities to wilderness to hide, find refuge, or something like that. In the process, over time, they developed their own unique culture and tribe that was different from others. They were in fact not the only tribes that had this origin of their culture. When the empire fell multiple people fled to different places to eventually evolve over time to become a unique tribe of their own. These tribes still carry on some of stuff from the ancient Aztec culture, including the language. The languages are all different in dialects, and I am assuming some might have changed to be something different, but I have also heard languages evolve and change very slowly through time. Different languages also change in a different speed rate than others. This means some langues still exist in their original form and hardly altered in time, while others evolved so drastically they became their own language, or dialect from the original. These tribes actually do help in studying their own empire. I think with their help they allowed some people figure out what the language sounded like and how it was spoken back then. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were a lot of tribes still speaking their old initial languages virtually hardly unchanged from their first escape from their fall. So I would say the Aztecs and Mayans are in a loophole. You can say they are dead entities these days. You can also claim their culture is long lost, but I feel not all of it is lost and is still carried on more than you think. I would say whatever still being carried on and existing it\u2019s not to the level it once was or exactly the same anymore. They are both extinct and not at the same time. You can respectfully argue for either being the case today. (gone. still around.) Basically, it can be debatable which is the answer because people have different view points on what qualifies for a ancient culture to still exist or died out. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s some argument over whether or not \u201cAztecs\u201d existed as a people or ethnic group rather than a political entity. Some hold that the Aztecs were those people involved in the Aztec triple alliance or multi-ethnic subject territories, and once that state fell apart, they were no longer Aztec. Others use the word to describe Nahuatl speakers in central Mexico. Using the latter definition, the Aztecs have, if not vanished, then at least largely transformed into modern Mexicans. The Maya, though, are still there. There are several million native Maya speakers still living in and around the Yucatan peninsula. A distinct Maya civilization is long gone, but the Maya people are alive and well. ",
