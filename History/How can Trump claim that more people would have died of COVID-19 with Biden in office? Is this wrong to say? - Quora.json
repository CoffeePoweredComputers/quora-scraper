The thing about these hypotheticals is, they\u2019re impossible to refute. \u201cDemocrats would have been just as corrupt/incompetent if they were in charge!\u201d is a really safe deflection. Democrats will deny it, of course, but Republicans will never believe that denial anyway. The reality is, Joe Biden hasn\u2019t held a government office at all since 2016. That\u2019s a simple, obvious fact which Republicans and their supporters seem unable to grasp. Hell, Democrats have had extremely limited ability to effect policy at all in that time frame - they didn\u2019t control any part of the Federal government until 2018, and Mitch McConnell has basically decided that since he doesn\u2019t like Democrats that part of the US Government is irrelevant. What I\u2019m saying is, Democrats in general, and Joe Biden in particular, have had no power to do anything about Covid-19. Every failure on that front sits firmly, unequivocally, on Republicans and specifically on Donald \u201cWhatever happens, you\u2019re responsible\u201d Trump. In spite of this, somehow Joe Biden still managed to be more effective at addressing Covid-19 than Donald Trump was. At the very least he sounded the alarm in January, and of course under Obama Biden played a lead role in Global Health Security - an initiative which specifically sought to mitigate threats similar to Covid, and which Trump partially dismantled. Would Biden have done worse than Trump? Well, again, realize that we\u2019re comparing facts against hypotheticals and that this is a deflection from the massive failure of the Trump administration, which has killed 200,000 Americans and counting. Yet, we can see that even though Trump has all the actual power and responsibility, and Biden is a private citizen, Joe Biden has still done better than Trump. A rational person cannot doubt that, invested with the powers of the President, Joe Biden would in fact be better able to respond to this and other crises. ",

            "answer_text": "The 1st Amendment guarantees that Trump can say that; beyond being a hypothetical, it will have no impact. Of course it\u2019s wrong, but it\u2019s also irrelevant. His followers who will agree are already swimming in the Flavorade. The 2/3 of the country that is reality-based already knows he\u2019s a liar who likes to say crazy things about his critics and other people that make him feel insecure, and they know that his words either mean nothing or are projections that make it easier to figure out what\u2019s going on with Trump himself. As for COVID-19 deaths, it would have been hard to mismanage it more than Trump has done. He\u2019s pathologically unable to accept and admit his blunders, but the analyses by public health experts and the evidence from other countries that handled it much more effectively, that is, nearly all the other countries in the world. Trump has the blood of most of the American casualties on his hands, and that\u2019s the thing - along with being impeached and being accused of rape and sexual harassment - for which he will be remembered long after he\u2019s gone. His name is tied to those events and that\u2019s what the first section of any chapter on Trump in a future history book will focus on. He\u2019s wanted to be famous his whole life. He\u2019s getting his wish. ",
