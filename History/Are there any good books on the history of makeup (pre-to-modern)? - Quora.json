If you are interested in a book which covers the history of makeup, going into things like color, tools, the beauty industry going all the way back to the Renaissance, and the possible future of makeup this may be the book for you. If you click on the image credit, it links you to a detailed review of the book:  Image: Book review: Face Paint: A History of Makeup by Lisa Eldridge There is another review here: Review: Face Paint, The Story of Makeup by Lisa Eldridge Another book, which may be worth investigating is this one:  Image: Painted Faces Whereas the Lisa Eldridge book seems to be more \u2018artistic\u2019 Susan Stewart\u2019s book is more focused on the scholarly side. You could compare the two books by reading both reviews by the same person: Book review: Painted Faces: A Colorful History of Cosmetics Lastly, this is a very short book, which covers a lot of territory in a few pages:  Image: Beauty and Cosmetics 1550\u20131950 (Shire Library): Downing, Sarah Jane: 9780747808398: Amazon.com: Books ",
