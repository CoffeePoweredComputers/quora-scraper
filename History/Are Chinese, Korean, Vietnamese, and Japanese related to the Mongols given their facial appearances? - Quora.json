            "answer_text": "This is quite weird for me to answer, because I don\u2019t deal with genetics, but there is something that is quite interesting with much of Asia (Home of Mongoloids). While I can discern most Asian facial appearances from each other, the part that I find interesting is the Mongol Mark. Basically a mark on the babies of most Asians that is like a little bruised-looking area where a \u201ctail\u201d would be. Not meaning anything by calling it a tail, just giving a reference point. This \u201cMongol Mark\u201d leads me to believe that they were/are related. As well, their migration patterns from Africa make them related. But then again, that makes us all related. We all came from the same place, not sure why everyone always wants to distinguish one from another. ",

This 1st MAN, he could had been there, Korean Penilsula when there was no such countries like China or Mongo around.. So we cannot really say that this 1st man is from somewhere~ as we can call him really one of our ancestors (forebears) and~ it's simply too long time ago that nothing can be found and proved at this time. Young Korean infant often have Mogo-banjeom (Mongolian Spot) on babies But~ this appears on Korean strongly~ mono eyelid also is a bit similar thing to Mongo people. East Asian often related to their race as mongoloid, it means the smilarity of this kind over the skin color and how they look.. this is because there was Chingiz Khan who were most well known guy to all in Asian history and he was from Mongo area.. so it's just something named for East Asian Race to categorize. Chao~ ",

The term \u201cmongoloid\u201d means \u201cof or relating to the broad division of humankind including the indigenous peoples of east Asia, SE Asia, and the arctic region of North America.\u201d This humankind named so may simply because early Europeans know Mongols first and more than other races and anthologists keep this name. Anyway, Mongols were the first eastern Asian race that Europeans are widely known of. ",

Most East Asians and those on continental part of South East Asia are related to some degree, though Korea and Japan are more isolated and it is easier to tell them apart than e.g. a Chinese and a Thai person. For example, my girlfriend is a Thai scholarship student in England and many Chinese students assumed she was Chinese; they started to talk to her in Mandarin but of course she couldn\u2019t understand. But, if you think all Asians look like the Mongols, then you\u2019re probably not Asian, and you\u2019re demonstrating the cross-race effect. ",
