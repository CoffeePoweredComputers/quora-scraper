            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a bloody good question ! And a complex answer to follow ! Indeed, aristocrats are just a small part of the issue. Executed aristocrats an even smaller portion of it. Let\u2019s put some context before diving into your question. The french revolution did not aimed to execute AristocratsIn fact, some of the leaders WERE aristocrats themselves. Aristocrats were even active in the Terror. Aristrocracy wasn\u2019t made illegal. Yes, aristocrats were executed, among others (20% of the executions were aristocrats or clergy members, which is high statistically, still not even the majority of it). Hundreds of thousand of people died during the revolution and the terror. But as for the aristocrats, most of them either stayed put, took part in the revolution or emigrated to escape the turmoil and/or fight back from foreign countries. The french revolution did not confiscate aristocrats propertyWhat the Convention did was to abolish the feodal system, within which a \u201cseigneur\u201d (ie. a lord) was free do decide of the tax rates he\u2019d impose on the people working his lands. This system was very heterogenous from one lord to another, from very low rates to very high ones. You basically had to pay to be allowed to work, and then again pay a more or less important chunk on your production in various taxes. The French Revolution was before anything a revolution against the fiscality, in a time when the kingdom debt would put back to bed the situation that Greece is facing nowadays. The French Revolution consecrated the concept of private property :You get that right, at the very same time the Convention was abolishing the feodal tax system, they protected the property rights of land owners INCLUDING those of aristocrats. Though they lost most of their revenue sources with the abolition of their \u201crights\u201d, they were although consecrated as owner of their lands. The nationalization of lands did not focused on the aristocracy but on the Church estateIt\u2019s estimated that around 10% of the land switched hand due to the nationalization. From this 10%, more than 60% comes from nationalization of the Church properties. The remains comes from confiscation of lands of the aristocrats and other land owners (once again, a lot of them were NOT aristocrats) not because of their status, but because they emigrated or fought back the republican and were considered traitors to the nation and people of France. The revolution didn\u2019t stand for long, monarchists were back soon afterThat\u2019s a part of french history often overlooked. Most people think that we had a big revolution and then \u201cpoof\u201d, we got democracy. Nothing would be less true than that. Here is an overview of the political landscape since the french revolution. the 19th century is a MESS, with constant struggle between monarchists, republican, and imperialists (ie. tenant of the Napoleonic power)  \u2014- Then back to your question, what happened to those confiscated properties (which, once again, were not all owned by aristocrats) ? Well, when the monarchists came back, under the Restauration in 1814, all their properties had already been sold to reimburse the state\u2019s debt and finance the defense of the country. There was no going back from that, after 15 years of war, would who be crazy enough to go the rebellious bourgeoisie and take back from them the property they BOUGHT ? Sure, the aristocrats claimed it back. And the newly appointed king Charles X told them to stfu. Instead he instituated in 1825 a compensation of 1 billion franc to be shared among all who had seen their property confiscated. That sum was to be distributed within a period of 5 years. The victims were frustrated (the amount was arguably of way less value than the loss), the populace was infuriated to see the \u201ctresor public\u201d used to pay back the aristocrats. A mediocre solution, but in the end it solved definitely that issue. Thanks for reading ! Although, a good read on the matter that I used as a reference material : R\u00e9volution et redistribution des richesses dans les campagnes : myt... ",
