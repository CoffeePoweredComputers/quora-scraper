            "answer_text": "The difference between a nationalist and a White nationalist is similar to the difference between a flower and a red flower. White nationalism is simply a specific form of nationalism, and, as the red flower does not represent all flowers, White nationalism likewise does not represent all nationalists. Nationalism is simply a political, social, and economic ideology which believes in the prioritisation of the nation and its interests. The 5 main types of nationalism are civic, cultural, ethnic, religious, and racial nationalism. As is quite self-evident, White nationalism is a form of racial nationalism. Donald Trump is most certainly a civic nationalist, he has not introduced any legislation which could be considered to be of a cultural, ethnic, religious, or racial nationalist nature, and additionally, he has shown no intent to do so. I strongly doubt he has said anything which could even remotely be of a cultural, ethnic, religious, or racial nationalist nature. Donald Trump\u2019s nationalist beliefs are completely based on civic nationalism, in accordance with the American Constitution and other American laws. \u201cA globalist is a person that wants the globe to do well, frankly, not caring about our country so much. And you know what? We can't have that. You know, they have a word. It sort of became old-fashioned. It's called a nationalist. And I say, really, we're not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, OK? I'm a nationalist.\u201d -Donald Trump Notice how he said \u201cour country\u201d? He is clearly referring to the United States, to the entirety of the United States, he did not say \u201cour White country\u201d or \u201cour Catholic country\u201d, he said, \u201cour country\u201d, clearly a term which does not denote any cultural, ethnic, religious, or racial implications. Of course, the entirety of the United States includes a multitude of cultures, ethnicities, religions, and races. Donald Trump is essentially saying that all American people should be cared about, regardless of their culture, ethnicity, religion, and race. ",

To a certain extent, it\u2019s also a form of cultural nationalism, but it\u2019s mainly in the \u201cethno\u201d camp. Donald Trump is a very strong cultural nationalist. He\u2019s accepting of other races, but only so long as they assimilate and conform to his idea of American culture. Some of his attitudes in this regard do, in my opinion, straddle the line of intolerance. Others see it differently, in that some regard his views as acceptable, and others feel that he is over the line. ",
