            "answer_text": "In modern times Indo-European refers to a language group, that stretches far outside of Europe.  In ancient times, in European pre-history it refer to a collection of semi-nomadic herders that basically entered and dominated most of Europe prope\u2026the Yamnaya \u201cCivilization\u201d is thought to represent Indo-Europeans, migrations into Europe.  A more complex map can show Indo-European migration in Western Eurasia and into Eastern Eurasia  In any case Hungarians, like all Europeans have some amount of ancestry from these people, although today they do not speak an Indo-European language. How much of a caveman are YOU? Take the test to find out  So how did Hungarians come to speak their language? Well their language came from Asia. You may be wonder? WHAT? Hungarians look like this?  There is a VERY small percentage of Asian admixture in modern Magyar (Hungarians) are usually pretty much the same as their neighbors, despite their proven ancient admixture with Asiatic people from the Eurasian Steppe, but it has pretty much been absorbed and dispersed\u2026almost like Neanderthal DNA in modern humans. I will go into detail about the Asian stuff below. But what about the other ancestry, the vast majority? What does it look like? The existence of Hungarian on what was Roman Pannonia is a function of the mobility and power of Magyar horseman, and their cultural domination over the Romance and Slavic speaking peasantry (their genetic impact seems to have been slight). Some of the Indo-Europeans found? Volkswanderung - Gene Expression Yep, Hungarians basically look like some mix of Romanians, Slavs, and Germanic tribes that were conquered by Magyars\u2026 All of the above are Indo-European speakers. Nothing shocking there\u2026look ate their location? What really survives from those Asiatic warriors that came about 1,000 years and conquered the region, as well as forcing their language on the native population, which is non-Indo-Europeans (Finno-Ugric like Finnish and Estonian\u2026which came from Asia). It has been well-known that in the case of the genetics of today's Hungarian population, only 4% of our DNA indicates the Asian origin. Genetikusok szerint a honfoglal\u00f3k \u0151sei hunok voltak, \u00e9s a magyar az avarok nyelve lehetett I translated it from Hungarian (using Google) This is the route by which these nomadic Asians came into Europe. More: Phylogenetic and population genetic analysis indicated that more than one third of the Conqueror maternal lineages were derived from Central-Inner Asia and their most probable ultimate sources were the Asian Huns. The rest of the lineages most likely originated from the Bronze Age Potapovka-Poltavka-Srubnaya cultures of the Pontic-Caspian steppe, which area was part of the later European Hun empire. Our data give support to the Hungarian Hun tradition and provides indirect evidence for the genetic connection between Asian and European Huns.  Ancient mitogenomes reveal Central Asian (Hunnic?) admixture in HungarianConquerers (Nepar\u00e1czki et al. 2018 preprint) When did they come? The Hungarian language belongs to the Finno-Ugric branch of the Uralic family, but Hungarian speakers have been living in Central Europe for more than 1000 years, References: Mitogenomic data indicate admixture components of Asian Hun and Srubnaya origin in the Hungarian Conquerors Ancient Hungarian mtDNA Unexpected ancient mtDNA from Neolithic Hungary Forensic study of Hungarian Y-chromosomes Who were the ancient Hungarians?

            "answer_text": "Hungarian people are actually followers of the ancient people living in the area for thousands of years before Magyars conquered Panonia. The language does not represent at all the population genetics and origin by any means. It is the same for Serbs, Croats, Bulgars, or Slovaks. They are all part of the same family of Illirian-Dacian-Thracian sort, that lived there for millenia. Conform Kurgan hypothesis, Indo-Europeans migrated in all directions from the Caucasus north region, especially between 4000 BC to 1000 BC. Two main directions were West, towards European continent and East, towards India of today:  The Western branch reached and settled in Central Europe, Carpathian basin and Balkans, by 2500 BC and in West Europe, by 1000 BC. Being at a cross-roads between East European steppes (Ukraine), Pontic area (Turkey and Balkans) , Baltics (Poland, Lithuania) and West Europe (Germany. Austria), Hungarian territory of today was a migration hub and melting pot of all Caucasians moving back and forth for around 3000 years (between 4000 BC and 1000 BC). If you look at the genetic map of Y-DNA (males, who travelled most) you may find all main European genes of today populations in Europe. Caucasians brought three main genetic groups to Europe: R1a, R1b and J2. West Europeans have as main gene R1b, Celtic. They are the Western branch of Indo-Europeans (Caucasians). Hungarians have similar (15\u201320%) R1b genes proportion to Scandinavians and Central Europeans (Sweden, West Poland, Austria, Czech, Romanians and Balkans):  East Europeans have more R1a, from the ancient Slavic people. Hungarians have similar proportion (15\u201320%) of R1a genes as Balkans, German and Scandinavian people:  A very old marker in smaller proportion (8\u201315%) in Hungarian population is the J2 Y-Dna marker, present again in similar numbers in: Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, part of Sweden, Austria, Romania and Bulgaria. One fourth of the Vlach people (isolated communities of Romance language speakers in the Balkans) belong to J2, considerably more than the average of Macedonia and northern Greece where they live. Quite a few ancient Mediterranean and Middle Eastern civilizations flourished in territories where J2 lineages were preponderant. This is the case of the Hattians, the Hurrians, the Etruscans, the Minoans, the Greeks, the Phoenicians (and their Carthaginian offshoot). Interesting is the fact that the highest concentration (30\u201340%) of J2 marker is in Caucasus mountains:  Now, about the older populations of Europe before Kurgan (4500 BC). North Europeans have I1-I2, Neolithic, Scandinavian, Sardinian, Dalmatian are two close genetic groups representing ancient populations from the North and South of Europe before the Indo-Europeans. They are the ones Indo-Europeans kind of destroyed all over Europe, during migrations. They are in higher proportion on the extremes North (Scandinavia) and South (Sardinia) of Europe. I1 neolitic (North) earlier people, Hungarians have low percentage (1\u20132%), similar to French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanians, etc.:  I2 neolitic (South) earlier people, high percentage (15\u201320%), similar to Corsicans, Austrians, Serbs, Croats, Romanians, Slovaks, Ukrainians, Bulgars:  South-Mediterranean Europeans have E1b1a1, of North African origin. They were early migrations of agricultural and cattle grower people coming through Anatolia, but original from North Africa. Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Etruscans had a strong E1b1b marker. Hungarians have similar proportion (10\u201315%) of E1b1b genes with most West Europeans (same as France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany), most Central Europeans (Czech, Serbia, Croatia, Romania, Austria) and Ukraine. This is less than South Balkan and South Italian people (they have more, which is normal):  On the mother side though, things are even more clear, as women traveled/migrated less in the past; J, U5, HV0, V and K markers (MtDNA) are dominant among Europeans and, again, Hungarians have the average percentages of all. Interesting is the 39.2\u201337.2% for H, 10.1\u201310.5% for J and 7.4\u20137.2% for U5, 6.9\u20137.9% for K markers that account for around 65% of European MtDNA genome, Hungarians and Romanians seem to be the closest. Distribution of haplogroup J (mtDNA) in Europe:  Distribution of haplogroup U5 (mtDNA) in Europe:  Distribution of haplogroup K (mtDNA) in Europe:  Distribution of haplogroups HV0 and V (mtDNA) in Europe:  It seems female markers are pretty similar all over the continent, with definitely fewer variations than the male ones. That seems logical, as women traveled and moved around very little compared to men, thousands of years ago. Most of those markers are ancient, long before Caucasian migrations; however, that does not mean that Caucasians did not bring similar female (MtDna) markers themselves. Whilst each area of Europe has only one, or two, main genetic groups, Hungary and surrounding countries have around 15\u201320% of each of the five main branches. You can find all those four branches in a fairly balanced proportion in today\u2019s Hungarian population. Similar genetic proportions exist in the neighbouring countries, such as Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Bulgaria. Slovakia and Ukraine have more R1a, which is normal (being more Slavic). Look at today\u2019s genetic map of Europe:  Magyars, that gave the language of the country, were mostly assimilated, living behind the language and the beautiful customs, as a reminder of a unique culture that once migrated there. Conclusion is that Hungarian people are Indo-Europeans in the same proportion with their neighbours. ",

Hungarians speak an Ugric language of the bigger Finno-Ugric language family, and its closest relatives can be found in Russia (Khanty and Mansi), whilst the Finnic languages form a separate branch which includes Finnish and Estonian, as well as several smaller languages such as Ingrian, Veps, Karelian and such.

Last, but not least, Hungarians absorbed many Indo-European peoples during their migration in Central Europe, so, from a genetical point of view they could be considered as Indo-Europeans, but because of their language they are Uralic now. P.S.: They are not Altaic too, so, nothing in common with Attila and the Huns! That's all! ",
