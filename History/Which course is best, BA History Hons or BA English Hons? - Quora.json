            "answer_text": "Every one here have expressed well. The basic questions before you must be the choice of professional life/ career you would like to see yourself in. Let your heart lead first and the mind look for synergy. Next, after you understand the careers/ professions you could get to, just remember, for History you need good command on english (written and spoken), whereas for English, you do not need knowledge of History, but may get a chance to learn it all over again :) Both these tracks are good for Civil Servies also. But if you find you are good at Languages, you have a chance of adding foreign languages to your CV, which are very helpful in many career and professional streams. ",
