            "answer_text": "Ukraine means basically \u201cthe borderland\u201d. So it is easy enough to figure out the genetic makeup of the people- it\u2019s the borderland between North and West and South and East. So, a mixture of darker nomadic people from the South and East and big blond tribes from North and West. This was exactly my Ukrainian dad\u2019s background- Tatar on his dad\u2019s side, and some northern huge blond tribes on his mother\u2019s side. Also lots of red hair running in the family. My grandmother had red hair and was still almost six feet tall when she died at the age of 106. The Vikings sailed down the rivers into the Ukraine long ago, there are still runestones standing near the rivers, so there is a good chance of Scandanavian ancestory in many fair-colored Ukrainians. Also the original tribes of the area, Neuri and Kurgan and so on, must have left their genes, culture and language. What is now the eastern Ukraine, and the surrounding places, is pretty much the \u201cAfrica of white people and culture\u201d, the place where the Indo-European language originated, and the religions of the western part of Eurasia originated, too. The horse was first domesticated and ridden in this region, too, so of course they were able to expand militarily and culturually, including taking over the Indian subcontent. It is popular now for many people, especially Russians and Poles, to try to deny the existence of a Ukrainian people, but this is just ignorant idiocy and bullying. A similar thing happened with Bosnia in the 1990\u2019s, claims that Bosnians are not a \u201creal people\u201d. Fortunately this was thouroughly debunked by more impartial studies, which showed that Bosnians are not only a people, but there is even a specific Bosnian genetic haploid group, originating with the tribes who were there even before the Roman Empire. There must be something similar with Ukrainians, too, because when we kids did a genetic test (ancestory.com), the map we got in the results included the exact village my dad came from, and the village his mom came from, near Kharkiv. I wasn\u2019t surprised to find that I\u2019m 1/4 Tatar, because even though I could \u201cpass\u201d for a totally \u201cwhite\u201d northern European, like my dad, his brother, my uncle Hrihoryiy, looked very much like us except colored nearly black. -Bobro Miron Juravi\u010d, alias Frank Zamjatin ",

            "answer_text": "Ukrainians are indigenous, autochthonous population of Ukraine. Early Slavs originated in north-western Ukraine (Volhynia, Polesie). In IX century East Slavic tribes lived in almost all parts of Ukraine, except Crimea, Budjak and steppe zone to the east of Dnieper (Zaporizhzhya, Donetsk, Luhansk). Then they were forced to retreat to forest and forest steppe zones by Turkic nomadic tribes. By the XII century local people already had one Rus'/Rusyn identity (known by \u201cRuthenians\u201d exonym) and one Rusyn language. At the same time people of northern Rus' spoke unique Old Novgorod language. Mix of Rysyn, Old Novgorod and local Slavic and Finno-Ugric languages was spoken in the North-Eastern Rus' that soon became the core of new Moscowian nation. The difference between Moscowians and Ruthenians increased with time due to different history and different influences of neighbouring ethnoses and cultures. By the XVII century Rusyns/Ruthenians and Moscowians/Russians were conpletely different ethnoses with different enough culture, traditions, languages and with opposite mentalities. In 19th century the replacement of \u201cRysyns/Ruthenians\u201d ethnonym by \u201cUkrainians\u201d ethnonym started. The main reason for the change was to clearly destinguish Rusyns/Ukrainians from Moscowians since latter officially took \u201cRussians\u201d name and started attempts of assimilation and destruction of separate Ruthenian/Ukrainian identity. By the end of XIX century Ruthenians/Ukrainians were the dominant ethnos not only in all parts of Ukraine (except Southern part of Crimea), but also in some parts of Southern Russia. Ruthenians/Ukrainians lived in rural area, while Russians, Poles and Jews lived mostly in cities. ",

Rurik - Wikipedia According to the Primary Chronicle, Rurik was from a tribe like \u201cDanes, Swedes, Angles, and Gotlanders.\u201d So, it seems that some of the earliest history of Ukraine indicates it was populated by a mix of Slavs, Finns, Danes, Swedes, and Angles. I learned this while researching my own ancestry, which indicates Rurik is my 28th great grandfather. ",
