            "answer_text": "History derives from the term \u2018historia\u2019 (from the ancient Greek, IIRC) and is more literally translated as \u2018inquest\u2019 or \u2018inquiry\u2019. The study of history is an effort to piece together the past from contemporaneous accounts and oral/written traditions passed down. History is an interpretation of the past because it is all that plus ongoing efforts at revision, based on newer discoveries. Troy was once considered an outright myth; Now we at least know a city existed in those times and it was brought low. The Roman port of Caesarea in Palestine/Judeaea/Galilee was once believed to have been greatly exaggerated in size in Biblical accounts and others; excavations have shown this was incorrect, and it was much closer to the larger sizes described. Even something like the Book Of Revelation can fall into this. Many Christian scholars bitterly feud with Fundamentalists over whether it is meant as Prophecy or a tome which disguises the history of the Roman persecutions in such a way as to avoid Roman retaliation. To paraphrase Sir Alec Guinness, all of history turns on a certain point of view. ",

Now here\u2019s a few follow-up questions: Is it absolutely, 100% correct, to the last, most minor detail?Did you include the perspectives of others of what you did, or only your own?Do you have proof/primary evidence to back up what you wrote to the last letter?Did you remember to not embellish your account, such that qualifying adjectives (great, bad, minor, good, etc\u2026) should be completely absent?If the answer to any of these isn\u2019t an unequivocal YES, then you\u2019ve essentially written an interpretation of the past, not what actually happened.

It says; \u201chind sight is 20\u201320\u201d There is another saying that says; \u201cif we do not learn from history, we a destined to repeat it.\u201d One can interpret history in any way they want, but if you do not look at it with open eyes, you will probably miss something. There are a lot of people who in America are trying to hide the history for some reason. They say statues are too much of a reminder. I say, leave them alone, we need to be reminded so that we do not repeat the same mistakes again! ",

            "answer_text": "Because it depends which side/who writes it. For instance, I was taught at my British school that Napoleon was a war crazed megalomaniac, whose thirst for fighting was insatiable. It was only later when I read more deeply that I discovered that it was actually the British that continued to want war-Napoleon actually offered peace several times, but the British refused. So history is always someone\u2019s interpretation. ",
