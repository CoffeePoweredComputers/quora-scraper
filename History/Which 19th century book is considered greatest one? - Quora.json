            "answer_text": "Middlemarch, Moby-Dick, Madame Bovary and the works of Tolstoy are all strong contenders, but I fully agree with Harold Bloom when he says: \u201cAt its most flourishing, in the Democratic Age, the novel\u2019s masters were astonishingly numerous: Austen, Scott, Dickens, Eliot, Stendhal, Hugo, Balzac, Manzoni, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Goncharov, Dostoevsky, Zola, Flaubert, Hawthorne, Melville, James, Hardy, with an epilogue in Conrad... But no nineteenth-century novelist, not even Tolstoy, was stronger than Dickens, whose wealth of invention almost rivals Chaucer and Shakespeare. Bleak House, most critics now tend to agree, is his central work; Dickens had enormous affection for David Copperfield, but this was his Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. The Dickens cosmos, his phantasmagoric London and visionary England, emerges in Bleak House with a clarity and pungency that surpasses the rest of his work, before and after. No other novel in English invents so much, though perhaps more in the mode of Ben Jonson than of Shakespeare.\u201d Edit: Harold Bloom also agreed, however, that Balzac, Dostoyevsky and Victor Hugo had something at least of Dickens\u2019 breadth in them. So I\u2019d like to make mention of another strong contender: Les Mis\u00e9rables, one of the longest novels in Western literature. In David Bellos\u2019 book \u201cThe Novel of the Century: The Extraordinary Adventure of Les Mis\u00e9rables\u201d, the notion posited by the title that \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d is the novel of the (19th) century is given a thoroughly good airing. Not least because it proved to have such a considerable impact on French society: Bellos underscores four policy prescriptions the book proposes that have since been adopted by French governments of all political persuasions over the last 150 years. These include allowing convicts to re-enter society without a perpetual black mark against their names (or in the case of Valjean, abolishing the \u201cyellow passport\u201d that makes it difficult for him to find food, lodging and work); amending the penal code to recognize crimes of necessity, so that (for instance) poor people who steal bread to feed their starving children won\u2019t be sentenced to hard labor; creating more employment for the uneducated; and building schools for the poor while making elementary education \u201cuniversal and obligatory.\u201d Above excerpt from Tobias Greymarch\u2019s review ",

            "answer_text": "There were so very many superb literary works in the 19th century in Europe and the US that it is virtually impossible to give an adequate answer short of a book length survey. It would help if your question was more specific. What are you looking for? Poetry? Novels? History? Political science? Philosophy? Theology? Biography? Travelogue? Personally, I\u2019d suggest Tolstoy (War and Peace, Anna Karenina), Dostoyevsky (Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment); Goethe (Faust); Schopenhauer (World as Will and Idea); Nietzsche (Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil); de Tocqueville (Democracy in America); Melville (Moby Dick); Darwin (Origin of Species, Descent of Man); Marx (Das Kapital); Balzac (Com\u00e9die humaine); Dickens (almost anything, Oliver Twist, Bleak House); George Eliot (Middlemarch, Great Expectations); Fontane (Effie Brest); Stifter ( Nachsommer); Emerson (Essays); Thoreau (Walden); Mark Twain (Huckleberry Finn, Life on the Mississippi); Claude Bernard (Introduction to the Experimental Study of Medicine); James (Psychology); Mommsen (Roman History); Parkman (Oregon Trail); Harriet Beecher Stowe (Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin); Kierkegaard (Fear and Trembling); Schleiermacher (On Religion); Poets: Wordsworth, Keats, Byron, H\u00f6lderlin, Browning, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, Verlaine, Hugo, Heine, Pushkin, Whitman, Emily Dickinson, et cetera, et cetera.

And I\u2019m also going to assume we\u2019re talking about English fiction; otherwise we\u2019ll be here forever. Nineteenth century literature is fascinating, partly due to the social, scientific, and intellectual developments that took place during this period: the suffrage movement, Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection, a fair chunk of the Industrial Revolution, Freud\u2019s psychoanalytic theories\u2026 it must have been an exciting time to be a writer. It\u2019s easy enough to find a good selection of writers from this era. A quick google search will yield the likes of Oscar Wilde, the Bronte sisters, Lewis Carroll, Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy, George Eliot, Charles Dickens, Mary Shelley\u2026 Over in the States, there\u2019s Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Mark Twain\u2026 And how about some poets, while we\u2019re at it? Walt Whitman? Emily Dickinson? Or maybe the Romantics are more your shtick? Keats? Byron? Shelley? Blake? God yes, Blake\u2026 get your hands on an illustrated edition. I desperately want to shoehorn Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill in there. Just because. So many writers. So many books. So little time. But you\u2019re going to make me pick one at gunpoint, aren\u2019t you? Fine. Emily Bronte - Wuthering Heights. Because I\u2019m ridiculously, incurably sentimental, and the following lines never fail to make me bleed a little inside: \u201cI cannot express it; but surely you and everybody have a notion that there is or should be an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation, if I were entirely contained here? My great miseries in this world have been Heathcliff\u2019s miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning: my great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I should not seem a part of it.\u2014My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I\u2019m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff! He\u2019s always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am always a pleasure to myself, but as my own being.\u201d Argh. Swoon. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t know about \u201cbest\u201d but here are two of my favorites relating to history. An Introduction to the Study of the Middle Ages (375\u2013814) by Ephraim Emerton 1888. As a history major in college, I have read a lot of really bad history books. This book, happily, is quite a page turner. It is refreshingly politically incorrect, and explains so much that connects the Romans right down to today\u2019s current events. Quite a bit of the book deals with immigration and population movements that are a relevant topic in today\u2019s modern world. This book changed my views on immigration. The second book is \u201cThe Crossing\u201d by Winston Churchill 1904. I know this is techinically 20th century but I am including it for this reason. It was written at the beginning of the 20th century about American history events of the late 1700\u2019s. It\u2019s as if today we were writing about the events of WWI. The events are in the past, but the echos still hang in the air. This is historical fiction as told from the point of view of a young lad who stumbles from one significant historical event to another in \u201cForest Gump\u201d fashion. The author is the very famous writer Winston Churchill, not the equally famous British politician of the same name. ",
