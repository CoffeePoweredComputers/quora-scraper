            "answer_text": "That depends on the time period in question. Middle ages: No, they were not. The Japanese have written about their experiences from the Mongol Invasion 1274 that their swords would chip and break against Mongolian armor, which makes them inferior to European and central Asian swords of the time - this is party due to the low quality iron found in Japan. In later time they developed new techniques of forging blades (folding steel similar to Damascus forged blades) that gave blades that would not easily break. These were of comparable strength to European swords of the middle ages. As for usage, the Europeans had far more different designs for different purposes - straight double-edged arming swords, heavier longswords more useful against armor, short blades intended to pierce armor etc. The Japanese Katana and Tachi were intended for slicing in the same manner as the eastern Scimitar, and were not as effective for thrusting, making them inferior against European medieval plate armor, not that swords were much effective against those in the first place. Once sabers became popular in Europe, the match up would be fairly equal. In fact, the Japanese word for saber IS Katana, so the only way to differentiate them in Japan would be to to label them with nationality (Nihonto - meaning Japanese sword). The saber could have an advantage in usage for being one-handed, which offers more reach for the same length of blade, and maneuverabilty, but the Katana wielded with two hands is easier to use for less experienced swordsmen as the second hand improved the grip and force of blow. Sabers tend to have better hand guards than the Katana, which has a small disc called Tsuba that prevents an enemy blade from sliding down the blade to cut the hand, while sabers often have knuckle guards that protects the hand against targeted attacks too. The saber is also a lighter weapon thus easier to swing. For this I would give the edge to the European saber, assuming it is wielded by a skilled swordsman and was properly sharpened and maintained. In the 19th century there are accounts from Europeans that says otherwise: The Katanas were kept sharp, while the European sabers were often neglected by it\u2019s Europoean users, and an unsharpened Saber is of course just not going to cut it. Moreover, the Japanese kept their tradition of Samurai elite who would keep practicing their skills including through sports such as Kendo, while Europeans focused more on drill, discipline and shooting.

            "answer_text": "Yes and no  You see, europeans made many different sword types while japanese made basically only variations of the same sword. The steel of a good japanese sword is on the level of a good european sword, the difference is only in design. If we compare the Katana to the similar Kriegsmesser you will see, that the Katana is a better cutter. It\u00b4s blade is thiccer as it\u00b4s typical for japanese swords and therefore vibrates less when entering the target. But this also means it will break while a european thinner sword (like the Messer) will deform. So now the giant flaws- -European swords have better hand protection in most cases-Swords like Long or Greatswords are multitools. You can stab with them (most japanese swords can\u00b4t) , you can cut with them (slightly worse than with japanese designs) and use them as a mace ->Mordhau (try that with a japanese sword) ",
