            "answer_text": "It had a predominantly negative effect. The Philippines has been colonized throughout much of it\u2019s history by major powers; 1458\u20131521 - Bruneian Empire (63 years) (pre-European Colonial period) 1521\u20131898 - Spain (333 years) 1762\u20131764 - British (2 years) 1898\u20131946 - United States (48 years) 1942\u20131945 - Japan (2 years) The Spanish influenced race (many Filipinos are mixed race), culture, language (Tagalog, Cebuano, etc are to some extend hybrid languages) and of course the introduction of Christianity and Catholicism, probably their most enduring legacy. However, the Spanish had a particularly pervasive way of running their empire. They created a powerful mestizo class to exploit people, extract wealth and control political and business power. When the Spanish left those powerful dynastic families had no intention of giving up their power. They never legislated for a strong nation state that was free and fair and inclusive for all. Instead they consolidated their wealth and power and to this day the Philippines, a country of over 100 million people, is governed by 400 dynastic families. As they say, \u201cthe faces change but the surnames stay the same.\u201d The Philippines is unfair because it was designed to be that way. Many of the economic problems the Country faces today can be traced directly to the Spanish colonial period. This problem also affects former Spanish Colonies in South and Central America. The Americans had some positive influences. They introduced representative democracy and the American system of Government (although as mentioned above by this time the dynastic, Oligarchic elite could not be shifted). They were not without their faults (which colonial power wasn\u2019t?) such as atrocities committed during the Philippine-American War. The also introduced the English language (Filipinos are by far the best English speakers in Asia) and an affinity for Western culture. In the end the Philippines is where it is. Those centuries were the high age of imperialism and there was no way the Philippines was getting out of it \u2018uncolonized\u2019. Although I believe the effect was predominantly negative, there is no question the colonizers had a profound effect in shaping the Philippines you see today. ",

            "answer_text": "First off let's Inject some reality into this subject. What happened to the Philippines has happened to many other people and places all over the world. People conquer other people. That is life. The Philippines is no different. Deal with it. Having said that the Spanish and the Americans left both positive and negative legacies to the Filipino people. Because of the Spanish the Filipino culture for the most part a Hispanicized one for good or ill. Your Catholic religion for good or ill is a gift from Span. For good or ill money is counted in Spanish. Pantalones? Zapatos? Coche? Chisme? Direct words from the Spanish language for good or ill. As for the Americans they gave you your education system. Your House of Representatives and Senate both write legislation in English. Like your Jollibee? Where do most of The menu items come from? In point of fact English is one of your official languages for good or ill. Like it or not. Negative things as well. For one thing thanks to Spain there is What's called Filipino Time. It's the same thing as Mexican Time which I know well. I hate both. Another thing which Spain left which the Philippines didn't need is the Patron-Client System. it's part of the reason why most former Spanish colonies are permeated with corruption and inefficiency. It's also the reason why political power in the Philippines is concentrated in the hands of 50 families. The negative legacies left by the American? There is the matter of the Philippine American War which was fought with ruthless efficiency by the U.S. military but war is hell isn't it? ",
