            "answer_text": "The third bomb, if and when it was dropped, was planned for Tokyo. They wanted the emperor alive to direct a surrender, which he did, knowing that if he were killed, then they would have to kill virtually every adult Japanese, since the adults regarded the emperor as a living god. If he didn\u2019t direct the surrender, then he was worthless to us and we could decapitate the government by killing him and all of his advisors and the military rulers, too. Fortunately for all concerned, the emperor directed the military to stop fighting and ended the war. The surrender to follow. Backstory bonus: When one reads the transcript of the Imperial Rescript-the Gyokuon-h\u014ds\u014d, or \u201cJewel Voice Broadcast\u201d one is struck by the singular absence of the word \u201csurrender!\u201d The Emperor said that he has ordered the government to accept the terms of the Joint Declaration-the Potsdam Declaration and for the fighting to stop. Nothing about surrendering. Even at this ultimate moment of capitulation, there was still no mention of the word \u201csurrender.\u201d He even justified the attack on the US and Britain to ensure Japan\u2019s \u201cself-preservation and stabilization.\u201d He expressed sorrow for the Japanese people who have suffered from the war, but none for the barbaric treatment of those under the control of Japanese forces. Reading the the transcript of the Rescript is a REAL Whiskey Tango Foxtrot moment! ",

            "answer_text": "The object of the nuclear attacks wasn't Hiroshima Nagasaki or any other city. The target was Hirohito\u2019s mind. If the Emperor wasn\u2019t going to be convinced by Bomb #1 & 2, he just wasn\u2019t going to be convinced. With the Ultra and Purple intercepts the US was reading the Japanese high commands mail. They concluded that the Supreme Council for the Conduct of the War (The Big six) were deadlocked 3\u20133 on whether to fight on or accept the Potsdam Declaration. They were also aware that Japan was seeking a way out via the USSR. The three bitter, Jewel Smashing advocates, Anami, Umezu and Toyoda said that they would only accept terms that included: No occupation Emperor is retained War Crimes trials to be conducted by Japanese of the Japanese. There is no way the US the US was going to let Imperial Japan become another Weimar Republic. Tokyo was ruled out because they did not want to kill the Emperor just change his mind. They correctly surmised that, at this point, only the Emperor could turn things off. Tokyo was also NOT a clean target. That would compromise the bomb damage survey. However with 2 bombs being produced a month, at some point they would have thrown in the towel and dropped it. ",
