            "answer_text": "China is a communist country, and I take it that you wonder why China is not poor like Russia, Venezuela or India. For the record, some of the countries with the highest standard of living in the world are socialist (democracies): Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, and to a lesser extent Canada, are all in this category. 1/ The thing that (almost single handedly) ensured China\u2019s economic success is Deng\u2019s embracing the market economy - this is where China started to move in the right direction... In life - no matter the subject - the worst thing one can do is solve the wrong problem (see Trump\u2019s running for the presidency in the US for an example). Solving the wrong problem wastes both resources and time. Communism was good for early 1900\u2019s Russia because Lenin correctly identified his time\u2019s problem (poverty) and proposed a simple solution: \u201cCommunism is Soviet power plus electrification of the whole country!\" This worked wonders for Russia - which was seen as an enemy by capitalists everywhere because it proposed an alternative social system which worked well! How well? Not just Sputnik and space programs well: the Iron Curtain countries enjoyed years of strong economic growth and managed to pull millions of people out of poverty - and the West noticed: Communist ideology was quite strong in Europe where Communist parties did well after WWII and up to the 90s: France (the PCF was part of the running coalition under Mitterrand in the early 80s),Italy ( the PCI won the second most votes - <26% - in the country from 1946 to 1988),Greece (the KKE had members in every post Parliament since restoration of parliamentary democracy in 1974),Portugal - the PCP had 12 to 18% of the votes between 1975 and 1986,Spain: the Communist Party has been the 3rd largest party (by votes) between 1977 and 1983\u2026People today say that Reagan proved that communism doesn\u2019t work; I think this argument is not specific enough (and too generous, but that\u2019s another answer, for a different question): after all China is the only credible challenger to the US today. What Reagan proved was that planned economy doesn\u2019t work. In the 70s and 80s, Russia\u2019s Communists kept using Lenin\u2019s economic ideas long after they were made irrelevant by economic realities: and this is where Deng\u2019s genius comes into focus: he correctly saw that the market economy is better and steered the country towards it - instead of maintaining the status quo - like the leaders of most other Communist parties at the time. There are four other factors that helped China get rich - the key word here being helped: I think that all other factors combined do not have the same impact as Deng\u2019s market economy decision. Here they are for completeness: 2/ The comparatively low level of corruption in China vs. that in some other \u201ccommunist/socialist\u201d countries like pre-1989 Russia, Romania, or present day India or Venezuela. This prevents funds from being funneled into the hands of a small clique witch will then spend it on Yachts, English football teams, or a modernized Army. 3/ A young work force - China couldn\u2019t become the factory of the world if it dind\u2019t have the required workers. 4/ A good economic environment - one driven by commerce and free trade agreements. The wold today is much closer to an open market than in any time in (recent) history. 5/ Finally, China is also helped by being a communist country - as opposed to a messy democracy like India (think of the ease of doing business in the two countries and you will see what I mean). However in the long term communism (or generally any one party system) runs the risk of major setbacks (think Russia post Gorbachev). Gabriel ",

            "answer_text": "Because China is not a socialist country. a) First off all, let\u2019s start off by understanding what China is: A social market economy. The last two words are important, and don\u2019t receive the level of coverage they should ideally receive. Market economy is an economic system in which the prices are determined by consumers, based on supply and demand. Perceived value of goods/services is what determines theirs prices. The system does not follow Marxian economics (i.e. the amount of physical labor involved doesn\u2019t set the prices). It results in efficient allocation of resources, and is a tried and a tested formula for wealth creation. Since Deng Xiaoping implemented market reforms back in 1978, China has seen a stupendous increase in its wealth. As simple and obvious as this might sound, this economic system is amoral in nature, i.e. it does not take into account factors such as inequality, birth-based privileges, races, religions, the rise of social classes, preservation of culture, among others. And so, depending on the kind of society you envisage, you might need to make modifications to this free-market economy. This is where the word social kicks in. The word social denotes the role the government will play in creating an egalitarian and a just society. b) What China is not (at least now): A state planned economy. In a state planned economy, the central government (could either be a democratically elected or an authoritarian government) decides the prices of goods/services as well as the allocation of resources. Though this system has some advantages of its own, it usually results in very inefficient allocation of resources, and could eventually lead to an economic collapse. The countries that have been failures are the ones that have/had persisted to continue with a state planned economy (think of Soviet Union, North Korea, and to a certain degree Cuba). c) Lastly, I would like to remind you that China is not really a rich country at the moment. It has a GDP per capita of less than $10,000, which barely makes it eligible to be a middle-income country. China creates headlines because of its size and influence - there is a lot of work that remains to be done for the nation to truly become a wealthy country, and provide her citizens with a good quality of life. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 On a side note, I would like to add that despite implementing market reforms, China continues to get linked with socialism/communism, because it is run by the Communist Party of China. On another side note, to fully understand the difference between socialism, marxism and communism, here is an answer I recommend: Robert Palermo's answer to What's the difference between Socialism, Marxism and Communism?
