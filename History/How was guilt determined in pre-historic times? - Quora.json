            "answer_text": "No one really knows but theorists like Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau have all attempted to make an argument for what this State of Nature was like. Hobbes argues that life in this State of Nature was \u201c\u2026nasty, brutish and short.\u201d. There was no justice to be found, which is why we, as rational beings, entered into society. Hobbes puts forward that the only justice in pre-historic times was your ability to defend your life, and if you could not do that, any injustices could be easily forced upon you. Locke argued that since we are rational beings, that there was a form of natural law and justice, but since the state of nature does not provide effecient means to act out justice, we enter into civil society. Rousseau puts forward the idea that the State of Nature was more just than civil society. That as rational beings we were better able to dispense justice through natural laws and only when we entered into civil society did we become unjust, unhappy and morally corrupt. To be honest, I have to favor Hobbes\u2019s argument, with Locke as a close second. From all archaeological evidence we have found, the prevalence of murder not only in human skeletons, but also Neanderthal skeletons is extremely high. Tribal warfare was apparently quite common, and the average life span of an early human was likely quite low. Rousseau, while a great thinker and arguably right on other ideas, dropped the ball on his philosophical state of nature. ",
