            "answer_text": "Barrel length is only one major aspect of accuracy, sight placement is just as important. First, the traditional theory is that a longer barrel equals better accuracy, simply because the bullet has a longer path along a stabilized, rifled barrel. This is primarily the case for long range weapons, like hunting and sniper rifles. Barrel rifling is basically grooves along the length of the barrel that cause the bullet to spin, thereby further stabilizing it's trajectory. However, when it comes to infantry battle weapons, long range isn't as important as it is in sniper rifles. Firefights are usually limited to 300m or less. In my opinion, when it comes to infantry battle rifles, sight placement is the major factor for accuracy. For example: The Soviet AK-47  AK-47 - Google Search Notice how the rear sights are well forward of the breech, this is a major problem in the area of accuracy. The further apart the front and rear sights are from one another, the more accurate the weapon is. This was corrected in a another, famous infantry rifle, one that is similar to the AK platform, but is actually quite different. The Israeli Galil  IMI Galil - Wikipedia Notice the glaring differences in the sight placement on the Galil as opposed to the AK, by placing the rear sight as far as possible from the front, the weapon is much more accurate and stable for longer range fire. A little known feature of the Galil is the addition of a bottle opener on the folding stock, a little fun fact. The bipods on the ARM variant were also used to cut wire. The US M16  M16 rifle - Wikipedia The US made M16 platform went further than the previous two examples in its sight format, they are equipped with what's known as a peep sight. Today's infantry battle rifles are usually equipped with modern optical additions, like a red dot holographic sight unit, or various large diameter scopes. ",

            "answer_text": "They aren\u2019t actually any more accurate. However, they do allow a more complete powder burn which generally increases a bullet\u2019s initial velocity (muzzle velocity). So why is that so important? A bullet starts dropping the instant it leaves the barrel and this will continue until it hits something solid or hits the ground, whichever comes first. If the shot was taken completely parallel to the ground and a second bullet was dropped from the same height as the bore at the instant the bullet fully left the muzzle, they would hit the ground at the exact same instant. This is because gravity doesn\u2019t care about forward momentum. However, the mechanics of zeroing a rifle are a bit more complex than this. The crosshairs of the scope are generally about 1.5\u2033 above the centerline of the bore and if the rifle is zeroed at 100 yards, the bullet intersects the spot the crosshairs are set at. For this to happen, the bullet must travel in a slight upward path and reach its zenith at the range of exactly 100 yards. Until that point the bullet is rising slightly because the barrel is pointed at a slightly upward angle. There is a second method of doing this where a rifle, such a s the military M-4, is set with a close zero and a far zero. The close zero will be about 25 yards, but due to the ballistics of the bullet, it will come down again at about 250 yards. Between 25 yards and 250 yards the bullet is slightly above the line of sight. However, it is sufficiently close that it makes no discernable difference on the battlefield. An enemy at 150 yards would be hit about 1\u2033 higher than the point of aim, but that is well within the margin of error of the rifle itself so it is unnoticeable. Here is a diagram showing this.  But with a precision rifle zeroed at 100 meters it hits the line of sight at exactly that distance and never goes higher.  So why the big lesson on how a bullet travels? It has to do with perceived accuracy by the shooter. A guy tested the effect barrel length had on 4 different 308 rounds and they all showed that longer barrels had higher velocities. For example, a Federal 168 Gold Medal round had a velocity of 2673 with a 26\u2033 barrel and a velocity of 2565 with a 20\u2033 barrel for a drop of 108 fps over that 6\u2033 difference. At a range of 300 yards with a rifle zeroed at 100 yards and a 26\u2033 barrel, that round will have dropped 14.9\u2033 and at 325 yards it will have dropped 18.8\u2033 for a difference of 3.9\u2033 That same round with a 20\u2033 barrel will have dropped 16.5\u2033 at 300 yards and at 325 yards it will have dropped 20.7\u2033 which is an extra 4.2\u2033 or 0.3\u2033 more than the faster bullet. At farther ranges such as 1,000 yards the effect is even more pronounced. If you\u2019re not sure what the exact range of your target is and your margin of error is +- 25 yards then reducing the amount of drop can be important. Faster bullets do just that. The other factor that contributes to inaccuracy is wind. The wind can cause a bullet to veer several feet off target if it is strong enough and the distance is great enough. Getting the bullet to the target faster reduces the amount of wind drift. However, not every bullet gets faster with longer barrels. At some point the gasses from the burning propellant will reach the maximum pressure and will be unable to counter the effect of friction in the tight fitting barrel past that point increased barrel length only slows the bullet down. Furthermore, a gun with a very long barrel is usually impractical outside of professional shooting matches. because of this, most hunting rifles have barrels between 20 and 24\u2033 in length and military rifles are usually between 14\u2033 and 20\u2033 in length. Hopefully this will help. ",
