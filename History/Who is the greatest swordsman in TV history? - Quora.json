            "answer_text": "Well, you\u2019re unlikely to find the greatest TV show swordsman from Highlander, or Game of Thrones. A couple have been from movies, and my candidate has movies and Tv shows. At age fifteen, he killed a knight renowned for killing thirty men on his own. In his early twenties, he fought an army of a hundred on his own. By the time he was thirty, he was murdering demons. And, in one of those movies, specifically Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I: The Egg of the King, he has (at least in my opinion) one of the most well choreographed sword fights in movie history. Skip to about 4:55 for the fight, but the rest of the scene adds to the drama of the situation, and the five minutes spent watching it won\u2019t be a waste of time.  Add to the already fantastic fight scene the fact that it\u2019s one of the few times we see reasonably competent Longsword combat on cinema (despite the fact that, like many TV shows, it treats armour like it\u2019s made from tissue paper). There are plenty of BS OP swordsmen in fiction, but the fact that most of Guts\u2019 accomplishments are done purely through skill (up until he gets the berserker armour) make him stand out. ",
