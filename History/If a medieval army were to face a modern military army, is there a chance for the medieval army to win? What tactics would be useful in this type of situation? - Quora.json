            "answer_text": "Let's take the medieval army to be a regiment of Praetorian guards, and they face off against a regiment of Prussian line infantry. In this case the Praetorian guards have a fair chance of victory. These elite soldiers of Rome wore the best of the armour during their times, and had a shield equally strong- strong enough to stop a bullet from a Prussian bolt action rifle. The Prussians have an advantage though. The sheilds cannot cover the whole body of the Praetorian guard, so at least one part is exposed, which may serve as a fatal weak point. But the Praetorian guards were quick with their shields as they were with their swords. And their attacking testudo formation was virtually impenetrable. So once they reach close enough to launch their javelins, it may very well be goodbye for the Prussians. Till then, it maybe equally balanced. ",

            "answer_text": "With a face of shear brutality, a surprise attack from an armored regiment of medieval soldiers may be able to take down a squad of infantryman, but without some deflection against bullets and being able to get close before the fighting starts, they would not stand a chance against the modern weaponry. Swords and spears are dangerous in their own right, but neither one is highly effective from 300 meters. ",
