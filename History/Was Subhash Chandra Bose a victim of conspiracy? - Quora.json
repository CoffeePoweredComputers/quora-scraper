            "answer_text": "Yes he is, of course unequivocally victimized. I'll explain to you the reason why. \u201cHistory always leans towards the ruling class\u201d  This quote turned out true in the newly independent India. Congress men(Nehru too) along with its bunch of Nehruvian historians pulled out all the stops to bury Bose in the pages of distorted history. The great Nehru had tried to place a ban on the display of Netaji's portraits in public places, including offices and army mess halls as a recommendation on behalf of the Government. Nehru had also succeeded in garnering support for his anti-Netaji policies even from Netaji's comrades in INA, including Shah Nawaz Khan and SA Ayer. The INA comrades had also betrayed Netaji for high-profile positions offered by Nehru in the then government. For the record, Shah Nawaz Khan was the chairman of the National Inquiry Committee (NIC) constituted by Nehru in 1956. Mahatma Gandhi was overly-exaggerated as the foremost leader of Indian freedom struggle even today in our textbooks but a stalwart like Bose was abandoned.But fortunately, the anti-Netaji policy of these patrioteers was not quite successful in waning off his name because the country men (young generation) of this nation still admire Bose as an icon of revolution. One of the evidence :  In fact, Bose can rightly be called \u2018The most neglected man of Indian freedom moment\u2019 as opined by eminent historians. Apart from this devilish conspiracy, Bose still lives on in the hearts of Indians because of two reasons : Bose selfless contribution to Indian freedom movement.His death conspiracy highlighted by the Indian media now and then.For information about Bose death mystery you can refer : Sai Sanjit's answer to How did Netaji Subash Chandra Bose die? Why is it mysterious? Nonetheless, legends still live on in spite of conspiracies..  ",
