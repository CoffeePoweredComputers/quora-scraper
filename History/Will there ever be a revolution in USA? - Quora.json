            "answer_text": "I think it depends hows secure your life has been.  People are more aware than ever that their financial security is an illusion, just as most other types are.  I also believe that if another revolution were to take place in America, that the end result would appear as nothing like the first.  I think a lot of folks don't realize how easy it is to become invisible in our nation, if one is willing to endure some hardship.  For those already enduring an imbalance of it already, there are probably instances of violence in their lives, and feel that they have little control of it.  This too is an illusion.  What it is really is a choice.  This choice is simple, how attached are you to the status quo, and do you honestly believe that your attachments warrant cutting off all ties.  For many the answer is yes, as evidenced by the fact that there are an enormous amount of people affilicted with so-called mental disorders.  While many of these are in fact indisputable, many are also social definitions for communal abnormalities.  Social experiments with rats proved this long ago.  As we are not rats, the scale of potential goes up exponentially when taking in the the sheer intellectual capacity that the disenfranchised truly represent.  This is in social aberrations as well as technical capacity for greater impact.  An example would be any of the shooter tragedies that have plagued us recently.  These situations are indicators of the stress that the less influential in society feel.  Personally, I feel a sleeping giant is in for a very rude awakening, for they ignored the fact they've been making their bed on a powder keg.  Honestly, it frightens me for I feel a new revolution would closer resemble the French revolution with baskets of \"bloody fruit\" than our own historical one. ",

            "answer_text": "At some point, inevitably, the United States will decline to the point where people want to. That point, if I had to make a guess, is still a few hundred years away. Also, given the size of our military, my guess is that it will be part of our military obeying the government and the rest attempting to restore the Constitution. ",
