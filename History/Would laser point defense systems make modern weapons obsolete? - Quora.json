            "answer_text": "Some. These sorts of systems are already in testing for use against missiles. However, most of these systems to have limits. Most rely on blinding the missiles guidance, with only the most powerful ones actually attempting to detonate the fuel or warhead. Against pure ballistic munitions, such as cannon shells, and especially against modern SABOT rounds, a laser point defense system would be of negligible benefit at best. This is because any point defense system is limited by both its reaction time, and its ability to intercept a target. Pure ballistic munitions usually move as fast or faster then their rocket propelled counterparts. But a pure ballistic projectile has no guidance system to blind, and may not even have a warhead to detonate. It also is harder to detect a pure ballistic projectile, since they have much smaller thermal signatures, and often a smaller radar signature, on top of being impossible to cause guidance errors to. Even modern CAS/point defense systems, with their method of spraying bullets to intercept, have issues with modern missiles. Tracking errors make it such that a large spray of bullets is arguably preferable, since it merely needs to be aimed in the general direction, rather then have a precise position be known. So while they can definitely help, they are not perfect, and would still leave many modern weapons as being viable. ",

You\u2019re just changing a small piece of metal zooming at you into a small amount of molten metal zooming at you. It would be somewhat helpful for taking out explosives missiles and grenades though. If you can trigger the explosives before it gets close. A better solution would be a bullet based point defense. If you have a fast enough computer, you could shoot a bullet in mid air with another bullet, stopping or deflecting it. It's would also work for grenades and missiles. ",
