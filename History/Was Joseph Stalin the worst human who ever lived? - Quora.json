            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think so. Why? Well because he was mentally ill. While the full extend of his illness is still debated, in terms of diagnoses, he non the less was pretty sick. By layman nomenclature he be called a Psychopath. This doesn\u2019t excuse all that he did, obviously, but one has to take that into account. He did what he did partially because he couldn\u2019t feel anybody else pain. In addition to that he was quite paranoid. I would nominate couple of people ahead of Stalin to the list of worst humans who ever lived. First and foremost Mao. That guy not only is responsible for far more deaths than Stalin, but he did so out of conviction not mental illness. As to second person? Reinhard Heydrich author of the Final Solution. By all accounts to him it was a mental exercise, and means for personal promotion. He simply didn\u2019t care that others maybe hurt, as long as his personal goals were achieved. While some people believe he was mentally ill, I personally don\u2019t think so. I think he was just evil. ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t believe there is a monopoly in Evil. Hitler (actually all the senior level nazis meticulously planned unimaginable atrocities), Stalin, The Soviet army was worse than the nazis, in WWII probably raped every German woman they encountered - worth mentioning that the German army excepting the SS and other extermination units was a professional army), Pol Pot, Mao, Castro, John Wayne Gayce, Al Qaeda, ISIS, etc. There was a Latin Drug Lord who dropped a baby in a deep Fryer in front of the parents to intimidate them. There have been supremely evil people as long as there have been people. It serves no good purpose to create a top ten list or ranking. That will just inspire some dirt-bag to try to achieve Number One. Better to recognize evil for what it is, DO NOT give the evil-doer a lot if publicity, DO NOT put his picture up and call out his name constantly in the press. This is PROVEN to inspire copycats who think its cool to get in the news regardless of the reason. ",
