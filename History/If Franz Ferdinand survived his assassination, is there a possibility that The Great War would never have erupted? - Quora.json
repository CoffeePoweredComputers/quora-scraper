            "answer_text": "::If Franz Ferdinand survived his assassination, is there a possibility that The Great War would never have erupted?:: So, Franz Ferdinand lives. If he is unharmed, the first immediate effect is that we won\u2019t see a July Crisis, although Austria will make a lot of noise about the attempted murder. Not much of a war scare, though. The old diplomacy will keep peace until next crisis happens, that could or could not start an alternate Great War, thanks to the Alliance system, the plague of secret reassurances, and General Staffs pressuring for manu militari solutions. If he is harmed, chances are that Austria will go with its unacceptable ultimatum to deal once and for all with the Serbian question, starting (more or less) our Great War. If we assume that Charles I lives until November 1918 as in our timeline, then Franz will be the last Austrian emperor and Hungarian king. Or could he manage to keep an Austrian monarchy alive? ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: The Great war as we know it would not have happened. Long answer: The Serbian nationalists who killed Franz Ferdinand probably didn\u2019t realize that they were killing off a potential ally. If FF had survived and succeeded to the throne in 1916, his aim was to create a \u201cUnited states of central europe\u201d  He could have countenanced giving part of Bosnia to Serbia as a peace deal. Keeping the core German, Hungarian, Polish, Czech and Slovak and Croat parts happy would have prolonged the lifespan of the Hapsburg dynasty. As you can see above, Central Europe was a mess of ethnicities \u2014 even the above is a simplification - there were different ethnic groups mixed and mingled nearly everywhere. Net result - no declaration of war between Austro-Hungaria and Serbia, so no trigger in 1914. The AH descends to irrelevance. The Kaiser is still itching for a war, so probably provokes it in Africa or Turkey or (a long shot) China. My bet is Turkey \u2014 it was weak and the Balkan states and Russia knew this. The second Balkan war would have been followed by the third Balkan war, with Russia scrambling for the east and to grab the Dardanelles. Note that the 1917 revolution wouldn\u2019t have happened in this timeline. The Arabs would have revolted against the Turks and created an Arab Hashemite kingdom consisted of the Hejaz (Mecca-Medina), through Israel, Jordan, Syria, Iraq. The Egyptians would take their own state back. The Germans would want to interfere with this to get their own cut of the land (as would the British and the French). This would probably trigger a proxy war in Anatolia and / or the Levant. A Europe-based war would probably not have happened (why risk losing your own troops when you can send colonised people and mercenaries to die?) ",
