            "answer_text": "Because it\u2019s economically infeasible. Let me phrase it better: Because an army officer who would suggest such an idea would not last long on the job. In establishes countries, anything army-related these days is serving one and only one purpose: increase own budget. To put it blunt, \u201ccheap and brutally effective\u201d is the end of the spectrum that criminals and terrorists use. Modern \u201creal\u201d armies effectively want themselves to be brutalizing, cool-looking, high-volume, expensive, and high maintenance. The better they can send this \u201chey, we need more money\u201d signal the better off they are. The concept of a one man army is simply a political suicide, if you look at the problem from this angle. It would be a miracle if some country even talks about something like this seriously. ",

So famous groups of soldiers are regarded as being formidable but fighting has been played out as described in the Art Of War for almost the entire length of civilisation and the beginning of cities as states.
