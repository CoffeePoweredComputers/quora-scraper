            "answer_text": "Louis XIV did no such thing. These days when people hear of French \u201cabsolute monarchs\u201d they think somehow they were sort of Stalin. Louis XIV was not Stalin and his power was much more limited than you think. It\u2019s quite debatable wether France stopped to be a feudal state until 1789. Feudality is when there is a social hierarchy made of lords that would express their allegiance to other lords (vassality), thus creating a social hierarchy made of mutual trust. This still existed in Louis XIV\u2019s France, you still had some people vassal to other, however it had no political or military relevance anymore. The most striking characteristic of medieval feudality, the ost (army), was gone. Vassals did not have a military power that could compete with the King. You can\u2019t credit Louis XIV for creating that situation, it was a long process that required many kings. In the Middle Ages, a powerful king like Phillip II Augustus did a lot to centralize France. Medieval kings invented the hommage lige to make sure that in case of conflict between the interests of two different overlord of the vassals, the King would prevail. The Valois dynasty kings also contributed, little by little, to take gradual steps towards centralization. They created a royal power that rested on a non-noble administration (offices). They created a fiscal system for the King. It accelerated with the Bourbon. Nowadays people have a very good opinion of the \u201cGood King Henri IV\u201d, but in his time he was considered quite authoritarian. He had to face difficult civil wars against the nobility of the Kingdom that did not support him, he was always suspected of being a closet protestant despite he converted to catholicism. He was assassinated by a catholic fanatic. It was Henri IV that started the habit of having an energic \u201cprime minister\u201d (the Duke of Sully).As a result Louis XIII was raised in a regency. His mother and her favorites would have the actual power. He had to remove the power from them. So he had civil wars against the supporters of his mother. He had civil wars against a league of nobles and officiers (public charges holders). In fact his reign was difficult and in order to prevail against the counterpowers to the King he had to be authoritarian. It was Louis XIII that started to build Versailles, not Louis XIV, a fact people often forget. The terrible Thirty Years War happened in his reign and this war convinced the King to have a more permanent fiscal system and to have \u201cintendants\u201d to rule on his behalf as an independent power only loyal to the King. Absolutist philosophy started to get written at the time of Louis XIII, Louis XIV invented nothing.Louis XIV was traumatized in his youth by the revolt of the nobility and the officiers (public charges holders) called la Fronde. This is why he never allowed them to be powerful ever again. He turned Versailles into a court in which to survive nobles would need to beg him for services, in which nobles would be domesticated, court hostages.Louis XIV remained however limited. For a long time, absolutist thinkers (like Cardin Le Bret) wanted to abolish the privileges of the provinces. Remember that each province was once a sovereign state, or at last a distinctive juridiction, and so they enjoyed their own laws and customs, and the King could not just abolish that. These privileges often were an obstacle to centralization.He could not question the social order, the privileges of the nobility. He could not even convince them to take part to lucrative activities, since it was considered unworthy of the nobility, and he tried many times in different edits. Generally, when you have to repeat the same edict, it means the previous one didn\u2019t work.He could not increase taxes without some retaliations (popular revolts, jacqueries).He and his minister Colbert really wanted to abolish the system of the offices, public charges that had to be bought and that over time became hereditary. It did happen on several instances the officiers turned against the King because the other pretender promised them greater privileges, they hated the intendants appointed by the Kings, they wanted to protect provincial privileges, it was considered to overstaff the state and thus costing too much to the Treasury (because a lot of offices were useless and existed for the just to ensure a rent to their holders and to give quick money to the state)\u2026 So Colbert did try to end it all, and guess what, it was impossible. Offices was like a drug for the French state, when there was a war it allowed to raise quick money, despite it cursed it with costs later in peace time. It\u2019s a little like a state emitting treasury bunds (obligations). Colbert was not the first to want to abolish the offices, the cardinal of Richelieu at the time of Louis XIII wanted that too. He failed too. Officiers were so powerful within the French state they were considered an informal Fourth Estate.Louis XIV could not disobey the fundamental laws of the Kingdom, despite he tried to. Louis XIV tried to have them changed and in the end, even him did not dare to. He had to observe the legality of the Kingdom and the traditions.So no, Louis XIV was not responsible for the end of the political and military relevance of feudality, it was a process that took centuries and many kings. He did not have the idea of Versailles. He was no Stalin since his power was more limited that you think. Despite everything I said, the Kingdom of France remained a multinational state and a minority of the French subjects actually spoke French. The Kingdom never was centralized in the same way the Jacobins would do with the French Republic. ",

            "answer_text": "Louis XIV was an abominable butcher and dictator. This is my overall opinion, although I do roughly agree with many of the compliments one usually offers to that monarch. However one tends to omit important dimensions of Louis XIV\u2019s reign. Once one integrates them, the resulting overall mood is different. Louis XIV was imprinted by the Fronde and his arrogant mother: \u201cMonsieur, nous ne sommes pas en R\u00e9publique\u201d did she say to the head of the Paris Parliament (\u201cSir, weren\u2019t in a republic\u201d) Louis XIV exhibited a first clear case of misbehaving when he cancelled the inquiry in the Affaires des Poisons, when it implicated his de facto second wife (\u201cmistress\u201d). He threw the whole file in the fire. He also decided not to consult with the People anymore (\u201cEtats Generaux\u201d), and cancelled consulting with Parliaments. Louis XVI would go back to these, a century later, but, by then, it was too late, after a century of autocracy. The major disaster of Louis atrocious rule was the \u201cRevocation de l\u2019Edit de Nantes\u201d, an edict of his grandfather making possible the life of Protestants in mostly Catholic France. The Revocation made life impossible for two million Protestants in France (10% of the population, often the most gifted). Most of them left, weakening France, and storing fuel for wars against Louis XIV, that is France. The result was the (world war) of the Spanish Succession, which ravaged Europe. That brought more than 1.2 million killed, a high percentage of the european population, and France lost sizable territory. The admiration of the all too many French for Louis XIV is just as immoral and demented as the admiration for Napoleon (who stole the revolution for his personal profit), or Joan of Arc (a pawn of the queen of Aragon and the three other kingdoms, who relaunched the \u201c100 years war\u201d, initially a civil war, between the French and the French, which lasted, as a result, nearly five centuries)\u2026 ",
