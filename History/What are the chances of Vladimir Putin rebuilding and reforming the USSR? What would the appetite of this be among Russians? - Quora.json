            "answer_text": " There are a lot of similarities between Germany after WW1 and USSR after Cold War: both were huge military powers, they both collapsed because of internal economical causes-huger included, the democratic regimes created huge economical and political turmoil, unemployment, huge inflation, Western Europe stood aloof, without granting significant financial support to Russian(Germany), a large population outside its borders. Ten years later, a strongman took over power in both cases and restored order; luckily, for the world, Mr Putin is NOT Hitler. Hitler tried to recover formerly German-populated regions by waging war.   For Russia, the Cold War loss was devastating: it lost an empire, its status as a global leader and nuclear power to be reckoned with and its identity as the Socialist nation\u2019s titular leader. It was difficult for Russians to accept that they no longer had a natural right to dominate their neighborhood and exercise influence beyond their borders.  Russia\u2019s ability to exert influence in its neighborhood has been facilitated by the persistence of the \u201cpost-Soviet syndrome\u201d in all of the former Soviet republics\u2014except for the Baltic states.  Two hypotheses can emerge here: either this haste that Russia has shown is proof of its intention to rebuild USSR or the aggressive foreign policy and rejection of democracy have really different causes. Should Russia aim at restoring the lost glory of an empire in the wish to be respected again? Or do they feel invaded by the West? They might have never experienced any other way of interaction with other countries - especially the small ones and, simply for them this might look normal. Russia asked to be an equal geopolitical partner with the United States, China and the EU in a multipolar world. Are they nearby this goal? NO.  The main factor for rebuilding the former USSR was the oil price. At 160 or 200 USD/baril the prospects of a new capitalist USSR look brighter. At 40 USD/baril the prospects are quite dark. For recovery after COVID, EU will spend 1.8 trillions EURO. Russia doesn\u2019t have too much too spend for economic recovery of its friends.  Russia\u2019s main directions of action in Putin\u2019s era : 1. The transition from \u2018\u2019empire USSR\u2019\u2019 to smaller empire \u2018\u2019Russia\u2019\u2019; DONE 2. Economic development by reducing dependence of oil and gas exports. That largely failed. Catalin Olteanu's answer to Why has Russia not been able to diversify the economy and reduce its reliance on oil?  3. Reshaping the political system and creating a political consensus. If Putin goes down in history for only one accomplishment, it may be his success in turning a fractured political system of powerful, competing political elites jousting for the right to steal what they could for their personal interests to something that more closely resembles a Western democratic state.  4. Control of rampant corruption. Failed. Countries are then ranked from 1 (most clean) to 177 (most corrupt) of all the countries in the 2013 ranking. Russia received a score of 28 out of 100 and was ranked 127 out of the 177 total, placing it very high on the corruption perception scale.  5. Find a mutual beneficial policy with the former republics and neighbors. Belarus and Kazakhstan are the two former Soviet republics with the closest remaining ties to Russia. States such as Armenia, Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova are characterized by high levels of antipathy toward Russia. They are also where Russia has exercised armed aggression through support of independent enclaves, ostensibly to protect Russian minority subjects remaining in the regions. In Russia\u2019s borderland states-Finland, The Baltic, Poland, Ukraine, the public perceives Russia as their greatest enemy\ud83d\ude01.  6. Reestablish a once powerful military/industrial establishment - that is OK.  ",

            "answer_text": " There is zero chance that Vladimir Putin will rebuild the Soviet Union. I make this bold assertion for two reasons. The first reason is that contemporary Russia simply isn\u2019t attractive enough, wealthy enough, or powerful enough to act as a geopolitical magnet for post-Soviet countries. Russia\u2019s neighbors tend to want to leave Russia\u2019s sphere of influence rather than become immersed in it. Over Putin\u2019s two decades in power, Russia has gradually lost influence in Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova, Azerbaijan, and arguably even in Kazakhstan and Belarus. The three Baltic countries are long gone as well. The gains Russia made in the small regions of Crimea, Donbass, South Ossetia and Abkhazia pale in comparison to the huge losses in influence Russia has suffered across much of the post-Soviet space. Russia simply has not offered an attractive political model, and it cannot compete culturally and economically with the West and with China. Moreover, most neighboring countries are very apprehensive after the events in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014. The second reason why Putin will not rebuild the USSR is that Russia lacks the kind of strong political ideology the Soviet Union promoted. Putin is not at all a communist, and communism is a marginal political movement in Russia. There are aspects of nostalgia for the Soviet past, but very little appetite for returning to communism. Russians also are more nationalistic than they used to be. The easiest countries for Russia to re-integrate would arguably be the poorer Central Asian countries like Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. There is very little appetite for such a reintegration within Russia. Russians by and large would like to reunite with nations that are ethnically and culturally similar to Russia, but not with ones that are seen as different and perhaps less developed. In that sense very few people in Russia and in the Russian government are interested in restoring the USSR, geographically or ideologically. ",
