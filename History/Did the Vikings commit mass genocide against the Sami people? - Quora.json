            "answer_text": "The answer is no. The Viking age Norse didn\u2019t expand much into Sami territory, that came much later. Even then, the Nordic nations did not massacre or expel the Sami in most of the territory, but did tax them and eventually try to eradicate the culture and make them \u201cnormal\u201d citizens with the same language and the same religion and lifestyle. This stopped only recently, like in the past 50 years or so, and in some more subtle ways it may not even have stopped yet. But none of this has anything to do with the Vikings. They actually had a superstitious fear of them, as they were said to be powerful magic users. But of course the occasional raid would happen, Vikings being Vikings and all. Mostly it wasn\u2019t considered worth the risk though. The northern natives were ferocious fighters and infamous for their strong sorcery. ",

From the few remaining historical sources, it appears that Norwegian Vikings in late Viking time did describe serious problems with fast-moving armies moving across the mountains. There are not so many alternatives, Finns living like Sam\u00ed or what is Sam\u00ed or other indigenous people from current Russia, but which was then independent chiefdoms. According to this WWII source, Sam\u00ed/Finnish reindeer transportation outperformed WWII horse, car, and truck transportation in Winter and Arctic conditions. Of course, the author probably does a bit of embellishment. This Reindeer Battalion of WWII Was Braver than Soviets, Tougher Than Tanks Regards ",
