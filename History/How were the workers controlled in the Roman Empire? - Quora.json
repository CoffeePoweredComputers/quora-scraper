            "answer_text": "Romans were divided into strict classes. There were the patricians who could serve in the senate, the plebians who were normal citizens, and slaves who were slaves. Within the plebian class there were further classes. Equities were rich Romans who wielded almost as much power as the patricians. Then there were middle-class Romans who worked a trade or owned a small bit of land. Last there were poor Romans who had nothing and lived hand to mouth off government handouts. People in the Roman Empire were controlled with \u201cBread and Circuses\u201d. The idea was simple- entertain and feed the people and they will be happy. Romans were constantly celebrating holidays and throwing lavish games. This certainly kept a lot of people in line but it was not perfect. Rome controlled it\u2019s workers like modern America does- meaning they didn\u2019t. Workers worked because they needed money for rent and food. They would keep doing their job so long as they were paid. If the economy was in a bad spot and food was scarce there would be riots and revolts all over Rome until the military could restore order. Rome was constantly having to maintain the food supply and livable standards less they risk open revolt. Upset Romans could also vote a populist into power who promises them help (Caesar). When it came to slaves they were kept in line by force. Slavery in the Roman Empire was not liked slavery in the USA. Slaves children were not considered slaves and slaves were often freed upon the death of their owners. Many slaves lived somewhat decent lives in Rome. Slaves inside Rome would reside in their owner\u2019s mansion and enjoy the comfort of such a place. If they did as they were told they could hope to be freed and granted citizenship There was a holiday in Rome called Saturnalia. In this holiday one of the themes was overturning the social order. Everyone would wear these little hats reserved for former slaves and enjoy feasts, games, and gift-giving. Since the theme was upending things owners would serve slaves meals and wait on them- or at least speak to them and treat them as equals. Roman slaves were still considered people by the Romans- not property. Thus they were not abused like slaves in the US before the civil war. In summary- Food and constant holidays kept the population entertained and fed, thus leading to stability. However, it did not always work and in rough times there were riots and revolts. Most however just did their job to earn what money they could and kept their heads down. Slaves were not horribly abused and were often freed. Thus they would continue their work in the hopes of one day gaining their freedom. ",

            "answer_text": "Roman society was very rigidly structured. You had: Patricians (the elite)Citizens (men who had the right to vote)SlavesThe patricians controlled the Senate through heredity. Slave owners (generally these same patricians) controlled the slaves under fear of death. Romans thought nothing of executing a slave, save for the time, money and inconvenience it would cause them. Life was dirt cheap. The citizenry (think vast lower class and smaller merchant classes) had to have a skill whereby they could earn a living. In essence, they were controlled by the driving desire to survive, along with their wives and children. Being in the military allowed the opportunity for upward mobility for those who had little, though no common citizen could ever hope to become ennobled. In essence, society was extremely stratified and, for the most part, your future was spelled out at birth. There wasn\u2019t a whole lot of need for codified control for workers since most were well aware of their lot in life and \u201csurvival\u201d was the order of the day, at all levels. Daily bread rations were also critical to the patricians in order to control the lower classes\u2026they, too, understood that their very survival depended upon a citizenry with something in it\u2019s stomach. One million people tend to forget about \u201cclass distinction\u201d pretty damn quick when they and their children are starving! ",
