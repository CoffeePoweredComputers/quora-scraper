            "answer_text": "Ireland had a very different literary heritage, language and traditions, although there is evidence of religious plays being performed from the 14th Century onwards, oral poetry reading, music including the harp, unaccompanied singing, eulogies to Kings & Chieftains and stylised mythological literature were more the cultural norm in the Gaelic medieval world. Gaelic society was patriarchal but women had more rights under ancient Irish Brehon Law, many poets were male but there were some banollamh, female poets too Sadhbh B\u00e9an \u00d3 Mailchonaire - Wikipedia. Were there female actresses? plays and playwrights were not an Irish tradition at their outset, it would be moreso later in the 1700s before talented Irish actors and playwrights would move to London to make their names and they quickly caught up. The first widespread report of a play being staged in Ireland was in 1601 and that was in the English area of influence, Dublin. The question is also somewhat academic, Ireland in the late 1500s was on fire and in the middle of the Tudor religious reconquest and there were English and Irish areas of influence. Warfare, famine and survival was the day to day reality for many. One of the great English poets, Edmund Spenser was involved in anti Irish propoganda during this period publishing A View of the Present State of Ireland in 1596 were he set out his desire to subjugate, rid Ireland of it\u2019s laws (Brehon Law) and it\u2019s language. \"Ireland is a diseased portion of the State, it must first be cured and reformed, before it could be in a position to appreciate the good sound laws and blessings of the nation\" His views were at the harsher end of the spectrum but it was clearly not the most conducive period to introduce a new cultural innovation, plays.  Derek Bell - O\u2019Carolan\u2019s Receipt - Music composed for harp by the 17th Century composer, Turlough O\u2019Carolan. The wife of his father\u2019s employer Mrs. MacDermott Roe looked after his education and apprenticed him to a harper when he went blind from small pox at 18. In summary, there wasn\u2019t a tradition of plays or playwrights in Irish cultural areas, which ebbed and flowed sizewise but ultimately occupied a much smaller % of the country by 1610, and it is likely that any plays that were staged in English areas of influence followed the English norm for actors i.e. no girls need apply. This is mere opinion, an academic working in the area would know more.
