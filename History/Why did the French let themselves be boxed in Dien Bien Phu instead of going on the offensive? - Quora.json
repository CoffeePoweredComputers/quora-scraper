            "answer_text": "Not only did the French go on the offensive near constantly during the Battle of Dien Bien Phu at the cost of significant casualties but it was done in large part to avoid the very \u2018box in\u2019 that ultimately resulted. The question is a bit confusing due to the actual wording of it but we can dispel some things right off the bat: The French deliberately chose Dien Bien Phu in line with the \u2018hedgehog concept\u2019 that involved armed strongholds scattered throughout the countryside to act as essentially strategic bait. A \u2018box in\u2019 was inevitable considering it was the primary aim of the hedgehog but never intentionally desired.Occurring simultaneously with the Battle of Dien Bien Phu were Operation Atlante and later Condor that not only had differing strategic objectives but also employed significant parts of French manpower and material present in Indochina. Dien Bien Phu only entailed the employment of roughly 4% of all French manpower in Indochina at that time.During the battle itself, several attacks and counterattacks were launched from the French side with aims ranging from the removal of entrenched mortar and AA positions to retaking lost hill strongholds such as Eliane and Dominique with the latter being a particularly bloody affair.One of the crucial defensive positions\u2014Isabelle\u2014was located roughly 2\u20133 miles south of the main base at Dien Bien Phu, necessitating several relief columns from the position and the main base itself in order to continually supply the garrison and relieve it of its wounded. Constant attacks and counterattacks had to be undertaken to prevent it\u2019s annihilation.Where the French erred was in the location of this particular hedgehog, the plans for resupply, the high op-tempo that drained manpower and combat effectiveness, and an overall breakdown in command at all levels at various points throughout the battle. It\u2019s far too simple to just state\u2014\u2018The French just let themselves get boxed in! Why didn\u2019t they fight back or prevent it?\u2019\u2014it ignores plenty of context and the actual operations undertaken to prevent such an event. To be sure, one can and many do criticize the various decisions of the French prior to, during, and after the battle but they do so with a couched understanding of background and the facts on the ground, not a vague picture of a surrounded French force. The question simply makes no sense in face of the facts. ",

            "answer_text": "They didn't \u201clet themselves be boxed in\u201d. No military force would purposely do this. The French believed the mountainous terrain surrounding Dien Bien Phu was a natural barrier. And that the elevation of the surrounding area, as well as the heavy foliage and vegetation, would make it nearly impossible for anyone to navigate it, much less move heavy weapons and equipment up it. Dien Bien Phu was strategically chosen due to its proximity to the Vietminh's supply lines. In theory, this would make it easy for the French to disrupt and possibly destroy their major supply routes. ",
