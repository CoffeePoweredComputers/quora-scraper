            "answer_text": "a muse is a person or personified force who is the source of inspiration for a creative artist. A muse might be a lover, a friendly infatuation, or maybe even a stranger the artist never even speaks to. It's usually assumed that the muse is a lover, but really, it's not as clear-cut as that, and in fact some of the best muses never end up as a lover or romantic relationship at all. ",
