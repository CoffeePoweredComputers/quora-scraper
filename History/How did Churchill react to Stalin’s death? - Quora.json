            "answer_text": "Prof Geoffrey Roberts sent a letter to the Financial Times, where he stated that whilst Churchill did not send his condolences on the death of Joseph Stalin Churchill\u2019s greatly admired the dictator. In January 1947, for example Churchill received a message from Stalin which stated that he would \u201calways have the happiest memories of [his] work with the great war leader of Britain\u201d. The message went on to say that Stalin had \u201cthe greatest respect and admiration for what Churchill had done during the war\u201d. Churchill replied to Stalin that: \u201cYour life is not only precious to your country, which you saved, but to the friendship between Soviet Russia and the English-speaking world\u201d (this correspondence may be found in both the British and Russian archives). That apparent admiration did not stop Churchill from urging America to use the atomic bomb against Russia, in a pre-emptive strike, before they had attained their own. Given Churchill\u2019s huge ego, and declining mental faculties, I doubt that the death of Stalin would have had any personal effect (or give cause for any feelings) with regards to Churchill. I suspect that they both recognised a mutual degree of psychopathy that they seemed to have. ",
