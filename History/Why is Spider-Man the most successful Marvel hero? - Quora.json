            "answer_text": "Because he\u2019s the most accessible and relatable. Captain America is a Icon and a relic from a different age. He is a Larger Than Life Hero and Ideal Patriot. He is someone you may look upto and wish you could be like, but he is not someone you could ever be. Ironman is a genus and multi-millionaire/billionaire depending on the era. He\u2019s also been a womanizer and a drunk. He created his own power armor out of spare parts\u2026 He is not someone you could ever really be, or may not even want to be. Wolverine and the rest of the X-Men are mutants and quite often repressed just because they\u2019re different. Some people may associate with that, but no one wants to be that. Hulk is a rage machine and often a monster. Thor is a god. Daredevil is a blind lawyer, Punisher is a mass murderer. None of these things are things most people can associate with. They\u2019re not things they might wish they could be. Spider-Man is, or at least was a guy in high school, which just so happened to be the main demographic of comic book readers. Sure he had super powers, but he also had to deal with bullies and couldn\u2019t really use those powers without giving away his secret identity. He had to deal with teachers and parent figures. He had to deal with asking a girl out on a date. Even after HS he was often broke, and just barely scraped by, and his life as the wall crawler got in the way of his social life all the time. If he had a dime for everytime he missed a date or something because Doc Ock or the Green Goblin showed up he\u2019d be nearly as rich as Stark. Yet he always, always did the right thing no matter the cost. Because with great power comes great responsibility. Spider-Man perhaps more than any other character was someone the typical comic book fan could both associate with, because a lot of his life was like our life. But also had the escapism of being a superhero, something many of us wished we could be, and would often fantasize about, or pretend to be. But he was also someone who was a positive role model with his ethics and morals. He was a genuinely good person who did the right thing no matter the personal cost. He was someone we wanted to be, yet someone also going though many of the same struggles as us, and if we were more like him we\u2019d likely be better people. Plus he was funny as hell. ",
