            "answer_text": "No. Its not. It is quote possibly the worst solution to trying to solve racism. If we segregated society, black people would sit at the back of the bus, would use different restrooms, would drink from different water fountains, would eat at black restaurants or would be forced to take food away from white restaurants. Not only is that supremely racist, but it is also a lot of work. An easier solution would be getting rid of police unions, banning the extreme use of force by police, defunding the police, passing an act that gets rid of not being hired because you checked off that you\u2019re black, instead of white. Don\u2019t even get me started on red lining and how banks make it harder for black people to buy houses. The court case Brown v Board of Education and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed because segregation was destroying society. MLK Jr was shot because he wanted to dismantle segregation. Segregation is a racist policy that conservatives tout because they want to go back to when they had all the power, instead of trying to change the USA so that everything can be more equal. ",
