            "answer_text": "What are some formerly popular spices (Bay leaves) or flavors that have gone out of fashion in the last 50 years? Bay laurel leaves are essential in making chai spice. I keep my favorite recipe in my notes so I can text it to people when they want my version. Play with the balance until you like it. This has more black pepper and ginger and less anise than the recipe I was given. Chai masala 2 whole star anise1/2 Tbs ground cardamom12 whole cloves2 cinnamon sticks (2 tsp ground - I use a high oil variety)1 large piece of ginger, diced (juice and keep in fridge)- for a shelf-stable blend, use a TBS-ish ground ginger.1 tsp to 1 Tbs black peppercorns (how much heat do you want?)2 or 3 bay leavesGrind in a spice grinder and keep in the cupboard. Use 1-2 tsp in a pot of Assam. ",

            "answer_text": "I wouldn't say that any spice has really gone out of favor. You could have spice blends that are not as popular. There are spices that are not used as frequently as others, such as those that are used in seasonal spice blends like Pumpkin Spice, or spices that are predominant in only certain dishes - if you don't like curry, you wouldn't have curry powder. Bay leaves, by the way, have not lost any popularity, and are in fact, showing up more and more in the media because of their nutritional value and healing qualities. I use them a lot, especially in stews and beans. ",
