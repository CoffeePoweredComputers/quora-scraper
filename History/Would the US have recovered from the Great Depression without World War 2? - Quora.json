            "answer_text": "What are you talking about it already started recovering before WW2.  Most of that money being spent on weapon exports to the Allied powers wasn\u2019t even paid for, it was debt. The US spent all that money paid for by debt that wasn\u2019t paid back with money. It was paid back by \u201cjoint action directed towards the creation of a liberalized economic order\u201d which actually translates to \u201cwe\u2019re going to fight the Nazis and then we\u2019re going to fight our close buddy Russia\u201d. So it could just as easily, if needed, spend that money building its own military to even greater heights (I shudder to imagine what that would look like) or scientific and infrastructure projects for pure economic purpose rather than war.
