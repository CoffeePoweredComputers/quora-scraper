You also have heavily Native areas in Mexico in places like Chiapas. Some areas don\u2019t have much of that Spanish and European ancestry. It\u2019s a large country. Here is a famous Native group that made the news in the world recently. : The Mexican indigenous community that ran politicians out of town The indigenous Pur\u00e9pecha town of Cher\u00e1n threw out all political parties after a popular uprising in 2011 \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t want them back. \u201cThe only thing the parties have done is divide us,\u201d said Salvador Ceja, Cher\u00e1n\u2019s communal lands commissioner. \u201cNot just here \u2013 in the entire country.\u201d Presidential campaigns officially kicked off at the weekend, and polls put the left-leaning populist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 ahead of his closest challenger by double digits.

            "answer_text": "There are relatively few Mexicans who are not descended from Aztecs, Mayas, and other native Americans. Ethnic statistics in Mexico are notoriously contradictory \u2014 and for good reason : there are no sharp dividing lines between those categorized as \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cMestizo\u201d, or between \u201cMestizo\u201d and \u201cIndian\u201d, with economics, social relationships, and first-language proficiency in Spanish being just as decisive as ancestry in deciding such questions. Even those self-identified as \u201cwhite\u201d nearly always have some native ancestry, and even those self-identified as \u201cIndian\u201d usually have some \u201cwhite\u201d ancestry. In addition, most Mexicans have some African ancestry, too. This Wikipedia article is informative. ",
