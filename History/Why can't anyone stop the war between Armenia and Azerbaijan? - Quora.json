            "answer_text": "I am not an expert on such topics, but as far as I can tell, there is not much to gain from stopping it. The frozen conflict had erupted in Nogorno-Karabakh and 7 adjacent regions recently, in 27 September to be more exact. In terms of international recognition and law, it is Azerbaijan territory and simply everyone(including Armenia) accepted. Russia having good relations and selling weapon to both countries, intervening the war directly is not favorable and adding the fact that the current Prime Minister of Armenia had some problems with Russia, it does not seem logical for Putin to stop it. OSCE Minsk Group members tried several times to diplomatically solve the issue, but it had no major outcomes. Considering recent speeches of the Prime Minister, refusing diplomatic solutions and calling people not only from Armenia but also from abroad as \u201cdiaspora members\u201d makes it hard to negotiate. Furthermore, Azerbaijan providing energy to Western countries, and being backed by international community it does not seem rational to say much. ",

            "answer_text": "In fact, there is a military alliance including Russia and Armenia: Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) This alliance includes Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Belarus, Armenia, Russia. Normally, when there is an attack within the borders of any of these states, all countries intervene as an alliance. The reason for the intervention in the current Azerbaijan-Armenia war is as follows: Nagorno-Karabakh is actually Azerbaijani territory. Today it is defined as the land occupied by Armenia. No UN member state recognizes the independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Let's get back to the point: Azerbaijan is intervening to reclaim its territory. So it's not something CSTO can prevent.That's why Putin doesn't intervene. Another important power in the region, Turkey is already a supporter of Azerbaijan.Therefore, the war will probably continue until Azerbaijan gets what it wants. Armenia does not have the military and economic power to fight Azerbaijan without the help of other countries. ",
