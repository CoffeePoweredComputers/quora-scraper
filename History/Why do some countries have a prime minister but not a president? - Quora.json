            "answer_text": "That is not the case as there will always be a President along with a Prime Minister. For these countries, there is a Prime Minister due to their adoption of a Parliamentary government. Unlike a Presidential government, Parliamentary government works through the elections of parties. Parties will get seats in parliament in proportion to the votes they receive and the party with the highest votes will become the majority while the runner-up becomes the opposition. As the Parliament needs a leader, the leader of the majority becomes the Prime Minister and he becomes the Head of Government. The difference to Presidential systems is rather than voting for a President, you vote for the party that best represents your political views and in a sense, it\u2019s a win-win scenario for you as they become the majority and your leader becomes the head. In comparison, using the US as example, while the Democrats is the majority and you support for them, the President can easily be a Republican and that will cause political conflicts. (This is hypothetical just to illustrate my point). However, the Prime Minister is only the Head of Government. As such, the President fills in as the Head of State and he is often more of a figurehead. Often, they are also not affiliated to any political party to erase bias. In some Commonwealth countries, the President is substituted for Queen Elizabeth II. They also have different roles. The Prime Minister is often the head of Legislative. He and the Parliament will draw up drafts and bills and they are executed into law by the President or the Governor-General. The President has the powers to open and dissolve Parliament just as the Queen does. The Prime Minister is only there due to the political structure adopted. ",

            "answer_text": "Why do some countries have a prime minister but not a president? Usually such countries are monarchies, not republics. They have a King (for instance, The Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Norway, Sweden), Queen (United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Denmark), or Grand Duke (Luxemburg) as head of state and not a president, with a prime minister as head of government. Some countries (like France, Russia) have a president and a prime minister (the latter sometimes called chancellor, like in Germany), others (like the USA) have only a president who is both head of state and head of government.
