            "answer_text": "In the beginning of the war, the usual armament was 3 to 8 rifle caliber machine guns (7.62 to 8 mm). This was considered enough for shooting down fabric and lightly armoured planes. They would also be enough to impair water cooled in-line engines Proved that this was not sufficient. Already in 1939 armour plating and glass existed, and rifle caliber could do little damage on radial engines. So 1 to 2 cannons - usually 20 mm - were added. They were usually enough to damage the vital parts (wing spars, longerons, engines) etc. The Mitsubishi Zero, Spitfire Mk. V and Bf 109E all had 20 mm cannons and rifle caliber machine guns. Machine guns were now used for aiming and cannons were shot when the rifle rounds began to hit. The Italians favoured two heavy machine guns. They were good against fighters, but insufficient against bombers. LeLv 26 of the Finnish Air Force got an awful lot of \u201cdamaged\u201d or \u201cunconfirmed\u201d victories with Fiat G.50 in addition to their 102 confirmed. Americans favoured heavy machine guns, and the standard armament was either a combination of six to eight 12.7 mm machine guns, or a combination of heavy machine guns and cannons. They would shred any aluminium, but not necessarily armour plating. The British finally standardized their armament to four 20 mm cannons, while the Germans used a combination of 20 mm and 30 mm cannons. One single 30 mm cannon shell was enough to bring a B-24 down and seriously damage a B-17. The heaviest armament on any fighter was on Bell P-39 Airacobra, which had 37 mm cannon, two heavy machine guns and up to four light machine guns. The Soviets claimed one single hit with the 37 mm Oldsmobile gun was enough to bring any German plane down. The Soviets removed the wing guns, making P-39 extremely agile. More kills has been scored with P-39 than with any other American fighter. ",

            "answer_text": "8 mm. rifle rounds: Basically you need a lot of these in order to bring down a plane, unless you hit pilot or radiator of a liquid cooled engine. If fuel tanks weren\u2019t self sealed they can cause fuel loss. British incendiary rounds were somewhat effective and you can start a fire in fuel tanks..5\u201c or 13 mm. rounds: Generally considered minimum effective caliber against aircraft. Depending on their velocity they could even cause structural damage. AP versions could penetrate pilot armor, incendiary versions are quite effective, there were also AP-I rounds. They considered smallish for high explosive contents while using against aircraft. Self sealing tanks would struggle for closing 13 mm. holes. .5\u201d Brownings extensively used on American planes.20 mm. considered minimum effective high explosive round against aircraft. Germans used minengeschoss, mine round version with thin walls filled with maximum amount of explosive. They could give serious damage to aircraft structure. Self sealing tanks couldn\u2019t hope to contain 20 mm. holes. Pilot armor would potantially fail against 20 mm. AP shots. A 20 mm. HE round into cockpit would make a similar effect to a small grenade, in bomber cockpits, multiple personnel could be disabled by single hit. 20 mm. was minimum effective caliber against heavy bombers. A single engined fighter could be downed by 4\u20137 hits on average. However, extra tough aircraft like P-47 or Hs-123 returned with much more 20 mm. hits. Towards end of WW2, 20 mm. considered inadequate as ground based anti aircraft weapon due to increased armor of newer aircrafts (but still was good as an aircraft mounted gun).30 mm. Basically 20 mm. on steroids. A single hit was usually enough to down most single engined aircraft. Imagine you throw a granade inside a small plane. A few hits could down even a 4 engined strategic bomber. there are footages of 30. mm machine cannons cutting through wings of B-17s like buzzsaw.37 mm.+: We are talking about airborne artillery now. They can down a viermot heavy bomber with just single high explosive round. 37 mm. AP rounds used for busting tanks from air.",
