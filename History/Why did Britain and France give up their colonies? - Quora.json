            "answer_text": "There were a number of reasons most European countries gave up their colonies, while many had autonomy at the time independence was either promised during WWII for India or Burma for example, much of the Independence movements came after WWII. European powers became desperate for more assistance as they needed more resources and militarily assistance, this brokered deals such as after the Japanese were defeated in Burma, the Burmese would only help the allies if they were granted independence. This deal was fairly easily accepted as the Japanese were considered the far greater threat. This also happened from the Ducht East Indies, French Indochina, which would resist Japanese forces after Vichy France had held little grip on most of its colonies, then would force the French out, after the WWII, in the culmination of the battle of Dien Bien Phu, a brutal battle and a taster of the Vietnam war. Battle of Dien Bien Phu  Burmese declaration of independence  Anything is better than fighting the Japanese in the early 1930`s and 1940`s.  Some Independence movements did increase after WWII particularly after violence occurred. Some did protest peacefully easily the most famous being Gandhi which led to the Partition which went over very well (!) Heavy Sarcasm While being a controversial figure today like many figures of the time such as Churchill. We have to remember there were mindsets which would not be accepted today, which were commonplace all over the world at the time. Gandhi's salt march over the price of salt  Another reason, which I think is ALMOST the biggest is that most European powers ran out of money to run their colonies and as soon as countries asked for Independence TYPICALLY it was given. Suddenly countries left and right popped up. This typically occurred during the late 50`s and mainly the 60`s when the bells tolled for the old empires. For Perspective how can a country that stopped rations in 1957 and started building these run an Empire? Post WWI Map of North Africa and the Middle East  Note: The USSR should really a lot more Eastern Europe and Nazi Germany would spill all over Europe and Japan would burn through all of Asia all the way to India. I suppose you could also include Western Canada but that would be too complicated. This does all prevent border gore however.  That`s a lot of colour. The USA also played a part as did European liberalism and really more of the adoption of equal rights and ethics. American pressure added fuel to the flames as economic assistance was virtually a must due to how expensive the world wars were for all parties. Such as the Suez Canal crisis. Pressure from the USA USSR AND the UN (The UK and France will never forget this) led to the UK and France invading and defeating Egyptian forces, along with Israel, who were already making headway in the Middle East. (Don`t worry I`ll get to the Middle East. Winner of the clusterfuck award, or joint with Africa? You decide.) This like many Western and European conflicts their defeats might not always be actual defeats but stalemates like Vietnam, not winning the people, Suez Canal political outmaneuvering and even Afghanistan were a country that has resisted the Russians,twice, the British after 1827 and more. Its likely that pitched battles won`t succeed, hence the development of modern warfare. Dammit another tagent. Then European powers got a bit lazy at times. Or played too safe such as staying with old borders, sometimes very old and mixing them up as to were a majority of religions and ethnic groups reside leading to the partition of India and the drawing up of the middle East, to Rwanda, Rhodesia and South Africa becoming war torn and multiple ethnic groups taking turns to commit genocide and oppression. Belgian defining Tutsi and Hutu features. This made things from bad to worse   Khmer Rouge at work At least railways and schools were built. Makes Tourism a bit easier I suppose. These give a detailed and visual look into Colonialism.   This one is very British   As show not just by the Ottomans and Japanese not all empires have been European, we remember these empires as the ended only recently and there were pictures, videos and accounts of what life was life then. We should not forget any bad or good and learn from our mistakes and we should never forget empires and kingdoms before these ones. For truly \u201cWho are you, that do not know your history?\u201d Ulysses Videos I shared as well as pictures are used via fair use. I`m too tired for my footnotes. I hope this answers your question.
