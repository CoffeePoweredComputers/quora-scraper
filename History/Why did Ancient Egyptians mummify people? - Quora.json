            "answer_text": " If you have actually read the mythology, it is pretty obvious why ancient Egyptians invented mummification, it has to do with Osiris the chthonic and empyrean god who was dismembered and murdered by his brother Set. Osiris\u2019 body had to be reconstituted before the incantations were performed to revive his body, and thus Osiris became the god of Heaven; the after life; and the lord of salvation and resurrection. Egyptians would preserve the body and its organs for their own individual reconstitution and eventual resurrection in the after life. Osiris\u2019 cult was about receiving salvation in the kingdom of Osiris(i.e. heaven), and living with him in the Elysian fields for all eternity, where the deceased that had been granted admission into Osiris\u2019 kingdom would enjoy eternal abundance of food, sex, slaves, and communion with the gods. Osiris is the only Egyptian god with this particular ability, no other gods in the Egyptian pantheon are able to resurrect the dead. The kings of Egypt wanted to be identified with Osiris, believing that at death they would become Osiris, in the old kingdom, kings such as Unas, Teta, and Pepi would refer to themselves as Osiris-Unas, Osiris-Teta, and Osiris-Pepi. Identifying with Osiris secured resurrection for Egyptian kings(Pyr. Sakkarah). The preservation of the organs in canopic jars was for the reconstitution of the deceased, believing that once they resurrected they could be reunited with not only their body parts but also their personal belongings in life. Hence way many tombs have been found to contain material goods. Many of Osiris\u2019 organs were said to have been buried throughout the country of Egypt. Osiris\u2019 head was buried at Abydos and given a shrine called \u2018Aterti\u2019 a funerary coffer where his head was kept. His sacrum which is symbolically personified as the Djed(Tet) was buried at Busiris. Osiris\u2019 jaw bones and several other parts of his body were scattered throughout the country and consecrated. Hopefully this answers your question, and provides some insight. If you have any more questions, visit my blog or message me on Quora. ",

            "answer_text": "The following passage is part of a description of the so-called \u201cOsirean Judgment\u201d.  As you certainly have noticed, it was not the soul the entity being judged. It was the dead person, the dead body! The judging gods would assess the body and if the disgusting (to the gods) isfet faults were detected in it, the body would be refused entry to the gods\u2019 land. In order not to present to the judging gods a rotten corpse, the mummification process was invented! That paranoiac practice was the result of having converted the life after judgment (that people born and raised in the harems lived after their assessment for social classification) into a life after death. The Egyptologists\u2019 as well as mainstream academic understanding, is that: \u201cthe conception of the post-mortem judgment, as it finds its most complete expression in the Book of the Dead, represents a most significant achievement in both the history of religions and of ethics\u201d Yet, neither post-mortem judgment nor the soul idea can be called conceptions as they were the products of chance.
