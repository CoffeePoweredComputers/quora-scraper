            "answer_text": "My Gran was born in 1898. She was from a small town, and by 1912 she left her family home and worked in service for a wealthy family, many miles away from home. She told me that she spent most of her time doing laundry, and trying to get washing dry. She told me the sheets were the worst - They had to be white, and the lady of the house thought hanging them up outisde when it was snowing would help to achieve this. Many years later, she blamed her gnarled, crooked, arthiritic fingers on those freezing days at the washing line. It was a place of a few very rich, and many very poor people. Infant mortality rates were high and pay was low. Pre war years of lack and want. Emigration levels were high, choices were few. Read a bit more about Bessie if you like.

            "answer_text": "At the time Britain was probably at its imperial zenith.  It was not realised then but the forces which would see the end of that Empire were already under way, especially in India, with the beginnings of the independence movement/. These would be hastened by both world wars.  Although war with Germany was considered a possibility most thinking people were looking forward to a new century of peace and prosperity. The Navy was at its greatest, keeping the peace throughout the world. Although this period was later to be seen by post-war generations as a time of unparalleled peace and prosperity, at the time that was not necessarily how contemporary people thought.  The Suffragettes, for instance, were becoming increasingly violent with their protesting.  It could be argued that the suffragettes were not wishing to disrupt the political situation but rather they were wanting to get into it.  Other sources of violence included the growing Irish nationalist movement.  Again the Nationalists  were seeking a part in the political process rather than trying to destroy it.  Those who were aware of the situation in mainland Europe may have worried about the growing forces of anarchism, as well as Bolshevism (as it was then known).  The Labour Party was rising in importance in Britain although that would not be seen until after the First World War and especially after the next war.  At that time Liberalism seemed to represent the most assured party of Britain.  My apologies to a any Conservatives reading this - Conservatism was certainly the party of the landowners.  Domestic service was a major source of employment.  Only the lower sectors of society would not have had some form of domestic assistance. All industry would have been privately owned.  Trade unions were seen as a thereat by many employers  and they were growing.  Public morality had progressed in some ways from the Victorian era but divorce was rare and looked upon with disdain by most.  Having children out of wedlock invited social disgrace. The Church of England was seen as the upholder of public morals.  Nonconformists too had their say over the aspiring lower and middle classes. The Roman Catholic Church was considered as a foreign power to most in the establishment. ",
