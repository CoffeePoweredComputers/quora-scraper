            "answer_text": "Historical information is not abundant on this matter but historians do know this.The minimum height requirement to join the Roman legions stood at 5'8\" in spite of the average height of men from the Italian peninsula being around 5'4\" to 5'7\"We do not know what the minimum height requirement was to join the Roman Auxiliary Army. Ironically, the auxiliaries may have been on average taller since non-citizens and provincials could only join the Roman auxiliary army and many of those men were Germanic or Celtic in origin.Roman citizens were allowed to enlist in the Roman Auxiliary Army if they wanted to despite the lower pay of the auxiliaries. Typically a male Roman citizen would join the auxiliaries because of parentage and/or location. For example, a Roman auxiliary stationed in an outlying province would receive Roman citizenship upon retirement and this would extend to his children. His son would be likely to join the same Roman auxiliary unit still stationed in the region.In some history books it was thought the minimum height was 5'10\" but later this was found to be based on an inaccurate conversion from Roman feet to modern measurements.The 5'8\" minimum height stood until the 4th century when it was reduced to 5'7\". In the 5th century this reduced further to 5'5\" and later was altogether abolished during the manpower crises of the late empire.One can only speculate that during periodic manpower crises throughout the empire even at its height, army recruiters might have winked at enlistees who were slightly under the minimum height of 5'8\".Historians truly do not know how closely the Roman Legionary Army adhered to this minimum standard. It would be easier to do so during peacetime. But during times of crisis, one good example being the Marcommani/Quaadi invasions of the Roman Empire during the time of Marcus Aurelius, manpower was so critically short that the Roman government resorted to appropriating gladiators throughout Roman and confiscating healthy male slaves, officially freeing them and immediately enlisting them into the legions. No doubt, shorter men would have been allowed into the legions if they looked healthy and strong enough. Allowing in men who were between 5'6\" and 5'7.5\" would have allowed for hundreds more enlistees, if not thousands. ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean true Latin Legion member.. Although well fed and immensely tough.. They were rarely taller than 5 foot 6/7.. This by no means meant these men were not some of the toughest to ever draw breath.. Of course average is a pretty wide spectrum.. and in the later eras of the Roman Empire.. When Goths.. And various other Germanic peoples could earn Roman Citizenship by long service or bravery in Roman axillary forces\u2026that changes the height dynamic considerably.. The Germanic tribesmen were reported by the Historians of the time to be absolutely huge\u2026terrifying in battle and absolutely fearless\u2026once incorporated into the Legion itself\u2026the sight of iron hard disciplined Squads of six foot odd heavily armoured soldiers must have been a sight to put the fear of god into the opposition\u2026even though Roman Legionnaires fought against warriors of great bravery and savagery\u2026the telling difference was their robot like discipline\u2026and their far superior armour and the legendary Gladius.. The Roman short sword\u2026height was not really a telling factor when weighed against well trained.. Well led and provisioned.. Superbly fit what were essentially Military Robots. As is still the average in elite regiments in the 21st century\u2026on the average many Commandos etc are relatively small men\u2026small men move faster and make considerably smaller targets while still being deadly up close.. One does not need to be an Arny Schwarzenegger to slip a stiletto through a man's ribs or cut a throat. ",
