            "answer_text": "Traditionally, celluloid. But in 2014, the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) mandated that all ITTF sanctioned tournaments would use balls made of a non-celluloid plastic. They claimed celluloid was a dangerous plastic (which is true\u2014celluloid is classified as a hazardous substance with shipping restrictions and there have been manufacturing accidents due to its highly flammable nature). Also, they claimed there were fewer and fewer manufacturers of the celluloid sheets from which ping pong balls are made. They predicted that if they didn\u2019t do something before it was too late, that someday, there might not be any balls to use for playing the sport. So nowadays, many table tennis balls are made from other plastics. I have heard that cellulose acetate and cellulose diacetate are among the plastics now being used. But some manufacturers don\u2019t disclose the exact material they use (proprietary information). Non-celluloid balls are often referred to as poly or plastic balls. While celluloid balls can still be found and purchased, as far as I know, all current ITTF affiliates (such as the USA Table Tennis, the national governing body of the sport in the US), use only poly balls in their sanctioned tournaments. And since many players in table tennis clubs play in sanctioned tournaments, and those players like to use the same ball as they will use in a tournament, most clubs use poly balls for club play. To tell these two types of balls apart from one another, ITTF requires approved balls to be stamped 40 for celluloid and 40+ for poly balls. (This naming convention came about because ball manufacturers used to cheat when sizing the celluloid balls so their actual diameters averaged about 39.7mm, at the lower end of the allowed range. ITTF wanted the balls to be at least 40mm, so when they introduced the new poly ball mandate, they also required them to be a minimum of 40.0mm.) Also for whatever reason, no manufacturer currently manufactures an orange poly ball, they are all white. Celluloid balls were almost always available in either orange or white. Most of the reputable manufacturers abide by the above conventions even for the balls they make that are not ITTF-approved. So if you see a 40+ marking on a ball, it\u2019s almost certainly a poly ball. And if you see an orange ball, it\u2019s almost certainly a celluloid ball. If you don\u2019t see a 40 or 40+ marking on the ball, it may be a much older 38mm ping pong ball. ITTF changed the diameter of the ball from 38 to 40 mm in 2001. Before that time, ping pong balls did not have a size marking on them, and they were almost exclusively made of celluloid. I do remember for a brief period in the seventies when a non-celluloid ball was available made by Barna, but it was not a commercial success and was soon discontinued. Poly balls can be substantially more expensive than celluloid balls. Premium quality 3-star, ITTF-approved balls can run up to $3/ball or more, whereas premium, ITTF-approved celluloid balls were often about half that. (Well, I feel like a fool. After writing all this, I posted and realized I misread the original question. I thought I read, what are table tennis balls made of, but that\u2019s not the question at all, it\u2019s how are table tennis balls made? ) To answer that question, I\u2019d link to this excellent video made by Nittaku, widely regarded as one of the premier table tennis ball manufacturers. This video has no voiceover and Japanese subtitles, but I think it is pretty clear to see and understand each step of the ball-making process. Pretty fascinating. This is the process for making a seamed table tennis ball, where two pieces of plastic are formed into half spheres and then glued together. The above linked video shows celluloid balls being made, but the process is virtually identical for poly balls. But poly balls also brought about the introduction of a new process to make ping pong balls called rotational molding. In rotational molding, plastic resin powder is poured into a round mold and then heated and rotated along two axes. The powder slowly forms into a liquid that coats the mold. It is then cooled and when opened, out pops a seamless table tennis ball. Here is a video that explains rotational molding, but not specifically for table tennis balls. Update 12/19/17: Poly balls are now available in orange and ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is now being used as a plastic for making table tennis balls. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a lot of materials that the balls are made only the best balls are ITTF Selected. The ball started by a round sheet washed, then measure it into sheets sizes, on the dipping station, round copperhead mold dip the sheet into the hot water, while being shape, hot water is included to avoid any cracks. The balls are then go into another station, which is the half-edge trim, the half ball is removed the small round side. These process are automatic. The balls are then glued in halves, the solvent must be well spread together, to avoid the half ball cutting from. Then the balls are pass through and roll and into the linen bags. Then they gave them into the storage room for 2 months or even until 1 year. After that, the balls are then chalked (For Nittaku table tennis balls) Then the balls are taken to the quality control station, where they get a several test. There are mainly 5 test for the ball to be passed. The test has to be ITTF quality. If some of the balls passes, they are ITTF approved. On the packing line, the balls are printed logo and stars. Some of the 1-star and 2-star balls like DHS they writes: \u201cChina Table Tennis Association Approved\u201d. 3 star are ITTF approved, ITTF or ITTF Logo to specify that the ball is ITTF approved.
