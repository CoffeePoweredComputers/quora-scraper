            "answer_text": "Yup they still do although their numbers are dwindling substantially. From what I understand it is exhorbitally expensive for one evening, although they are amazing hosts. I had the chance to meet some of them in the town of Arima just north of Kobe (mercifully I didn't pay as it was part of my time as a Kobe PR ambassador). These women sacrifice a great deal to become a geisha and I imagine not many women want to go through that tough reigieme. Everything is focussed on being the perfect host, and helping their clients relax (not in that way - get your head out of the gutter). In fact they try to imitate child-like behaviour and innocence in all that they do.   Just some photographic evidence that genuine ones still exist. If you have the time and money I strongly recommend going for a visit. PS Different regions of Japan will use different names for what most people would assume to be geisha (\u82b8\u8005). In Arima, Kobe they are referred to as \u82b8\u5b50 (geiko). The ko(\u5b50) means child and I guess they wanted to emphasise their childlike nature. As opposed to sha(\u8005) which more associated with a profession e.g. \u533b\u8005 is medical person I.e. Doctor PPS I remember there was even a foreign geisha called Fiona Graham, you can read about her experiences here\u2026 Sayuki ",

            "answer_text": "Shimoda, a small seaside city in Shizuoka prefecture, was home to as many as 200 geisha working its tea-houses as recently as 30 years ago. However, the number of geisha currently based in Shimoda has now declined to just five, prompting the rare intervention of government officials to keep their presence alive. As part of the plan, three prospective geisha will receive wages from central government employment subsidies for a six-month period, during which they will be trained fully in traditional singing, dancing and instrument playing. The geisha training proposal, which will cost the local government an estimated \u00a343,000, aims to reverse the city's dramatic decline of its geisha population \u2013 a problem replicated across much of modern-day Japan. The move is a rare example of government employment funds directly subsidising the world of geisha, which has traditionally been independent of such financial support despite its decline in modern-day Japan. The source of this answer is a report published in Telegraph dated15sept2011. After reading this you can understand that there is depletion in the number of Gesiah and to retain this traditional art ,Japanese Govt. is framing different policy. ",

            "answer_text": "There are still a few geisha left, but not too many, and you\u2019d need a personal introduction and have major $$ on you if you wanted to see one, yet would probably be pretty disappointed by the experience. She would probably be in her 70s or even 80s, plastered in make up. I think there is still at least one geisha house left in Tokyo, and quite a few in Kyoto. Its quite an elite world, barred to most foreigners. The depression of the 90s wiped out a lot of former geisha houses and restaurants, as well as much of the hostess bar nightlife. Companies can\u2019t afford the very \u2018generous\u2019 entertainment budgets that were common in the Bubble Days. To be a patron of a geisha you have to be very rich. ",

To watch a Maiko perform ( they are like intern geishas) , go to Gion Corner, foreigners pay 2500 yen. It was so relaxing, definitely worth it. It is more of a cultural presentation and Maiko Performance is one of them. I took this picture during the performance.  ",
