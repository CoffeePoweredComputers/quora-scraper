            "answer_text": "Greek pupils are taught at schools that Ottoman rule of Greece were dark times. Subsequently most Greeks that have not researched into the subject more than basic education and greek movies, think that during the Ottoman Empire Greek culture was suppressed, Orthodox christianity was under persecution, taxes were unbearable and parents were under the constant fear of losing their children to forcible conscription to the jannisary corps, under the devsirme system. Greek culture was saved - according to the predominant popular narrative - thanks to the underground efforts of the Orthodox Church, Greek guerrilas on mountains (that were called \u201cklepts\u201d, meaning \u201cthieves\u201d or \u201cbandits\u201d) and the Greek diaspora living mostly in Italy, Austria and Russia. The reasons behind this attitude from the Greek state was (and possibly is) to instill to sudents the feeling that the Ottomans, and subsequently their successors the Turks, were barbaric and mortal enemies to the Greeks, thus every Greek should be aware and bitter of Turkey always. This is an example of selective use of history accompanied with non-truths for the purpose of strengthening the nation state and unifying its people against present enemies. For example, Greece was also under occupation from the Republic of Venice, but current relations with Italy are very good. Hence, past Venetian rule is largely omitted from history classes, and when referenced is portrayed as very mild and sometimes desirable versus the Ottoman one. But historians know that the truth is much more compliacted than the one presented above. Most of the times the Ottomans left the Greeks to educate themselves and practice their religion as they pleased. In fact, it was the Venetians that wanted to subject the Orthodox churches of Greece to Catholic bishops. Venetian taxes in most provinces were heavier than the Ottoman ones, at least before 1700 when the Ottoman Empire started to descend into economic crisis. The Devsirme system started to wane after 1600 and completely stopped after 1700. When a Greek documentary of national broadcaster revealed these facts and more from historic research some years ago, the Greek public was shocked. This was an indication that most Greeks have a very limited knowledge of the Ottoman Times and their understanding is based on myths and misleading analyses. Recently, some Greeks have started to review the Ottoman rule, and its assessment is getting more balanced. It wasn\u2019t always that bad, and not only Turks, but also Albanians, Venetians and Greek collaborators are to be blamed for misfortunes. The main problem of the Ottoman rule, in my opinion, is that because Greece was not independent, contact with European technological discoveries and ideas, like Enlightment, was limited and this bogged down Greece development for the next centuries\u2026 For example, Belgium and Greece were liberated at the same time , around 1830. But Belgium had already experienced an early industrialization and shortly after independance had built railways. Greece on the other hand struggled hard to develop this former Ottoman backwater province\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "The Greek educational system has been teaching about a 400 years Turkish yoke . An occupation where Greek culture and religion were suppressed. Obviously this historical point of view was strictly based on the history of the early Greek state which was confined in what is now southern Greece and not the whole country . Thus , a lot of Greeks today are unaware that quite a big portion of the Greek nation continued to experience an Ottoman past up to the 20th century and not only up to 1830 .Thus it was not a four centuries occupation for all. Also many Greeks, especially those living in and around Constantinople found favorable conditions during the Ottoman times to become rich through trade , advance in the ranks of the clergy, be appointed as diplomats and representatives of the Porte , be appointed as kodjabashis, and be appointed as Hospodars of Moldavia and Wallachia. All of this has failed to be mentioned in history books , firstly because Eastern Thrace and Istanbul never became part of the Greek state and their Greek population dwindled over the years . Therefore this region\u2019s history became irrelevant for the Greek mainland . Also post 1830 enmities between the Greek and the Turkish states had led to an adaptation of their respective histories and the way they viewed each other . ",
