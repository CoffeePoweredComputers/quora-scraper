            "answer_text": "In terms of absolute volume of goods traded and their economic value, not very. The overland trade routes of the Silk Road moved vastly less product than any sea-borne routes like those over the Mediterranean or around the Indian Ocean. Moreover, Europe was essentially an appendage to the Silk Road trade, which was primarily Asian. Europe was at the tail end of things, with only the barest trickle of goods coming in. Most of what the Silk Road moved was between China, Persia, India, and the steppes of Central Asia. Europe got what could be passed on at immense profit. Culturally, it wasn\u2019t even remotely important for China, but it was an underlying factor in key events in Europe. The trickle of insanely valuable goods which made their way to Europe over Asian trade routes (initially the Silk Road routes through Central Asia, but by the 10th century more likely over Indian Ocean routes) provided European merchants and navigators with an objective. If someone could circumnavigate the globe in either direction, they could make direct contact with the lands of the Far East, return home with holds full of silk, porcelain, spices, dyes, and medicines, cut out countless ranks of middlemen, and make an immense profit. And that\u2019s why, in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Europeans began their Age of Exploration. Because of goods and lands they knew about because of the Silk Road, Europeans sailed east, eventually establishing hegemony over India and much of the East. And they sailed west, accidentally running into the New World. It wasn\u2019t what they expected, but they didn\u2019t hesitate to take advantage. TL; DR: Over the Silk Road, China and Europe provided one another with a handful of luxury goods, but Europe took away from those dreams of wealth which eventually led to global domination. ",
