            "answer_text": "There are a few ways to look at this First, a figure who would play a part in the overthrow of a monarchy - Oliver Cromwell. He suppressed the Irish rebellion, and kept a working government after the execution of Charles I. The imperialist - Napoleon was a cultural imperialist. He set about toppling Kings and introducing the Code Napoleon, or the Code Civil (sometimes called Napoleon\u2019s civil code) which guarantees a number of French Revolutionary gains. Abolition of feudalism, secular states, and equal rights before the law. I don't know of an English parallel with this embodied in a single person. The military commander and leader is particularly hard to work with. While Napoleon lost huge battles (at Leipzig and Waterloo for example), generally the best way to fight Napoleon\u2019s army was a constant retreat. It served Russia well in the Russian campaign. Napoleon natural ability for war is near unrivaled in history. A few generals can claim supremacy, but it is disputed. While many modern historians equate him with Caesar, Hannibal, and Alexander the Great. Wellington gets a lot of the credit for defeating Napoleon at Waterloo but it doesn't follow that Waterloo shows Wellington a better general. He was a great defensive tactician, while Napoleon was always on the offensive and overwhelmingly successful. He even defeated the Russians twice in the spring after his retreat. I don't think there is an English general comparable to Napoleon in sheer talent in the making of war. But times change, and modern British generals grew up studying the Napoleonic Wars, as Americans have at the Citadel and West Point. Another item of interest is Napoleon\u2019s inability to combat guerrilla warfare, as he struggled as much in Spain as he did in Russia. The closest general to Napoleon to appear in modern times is General Zhukov, the conqueror of Berlin and Supreme Commander of the Russian war effort against Nazi Germany. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. That is a tricky one. The duke of Wellington was the british General who defeated Napoleon. Still I would go for two other men: Olliver Chromwell, being a minor nobleman at first, then protector (aka dictator) of England. He was victourius in the English civil war and conquered Ireland by force.William the conqueror, also known as William the bastard. He ensured his dukedom Normandy first, and then took the chance to invade England. Successfully. Making it from a bastard son to a king.EDIT: As Pedro Castilla stated, William was not English by birth but a French or a Norman. That is correct. Still, I would like to stay him on my list, first because in the early medieval ages, national ancestry was an idea just slowly evolving, and second because he was invited to take the crown of England.
