            "answer_text": "I'd recommend the following: Herbert A. Werner, \"Iron Coffins\" Herbert Werner served in u-boats from 1941 to the end of the end of the war, ending up  a u-boat captain in the latter stages of World War II. Werner beat the odds; he was one of only about a dozen surviving captains; about 70% of German submariners died in the war. \"Iron Coffins\" is his personal account of the war in u-boats from the \"happy days\" of easy victories to the being hunted. Clay Blair, \"Hitler's U-Boat War: The Hunters, 1939-1942, The Hunted, 1942-1945\" \"Hitler's U-Boat War\" is probably the most authoritative work on the war between the Allied navies and the u-boat. It's exhaustive, and to be honest, a bit exhausting. Its prose is uninspired and it covers the campaign in minute detail.  The wealth of detail in \"Hitler's U-Boat War\" would be a valuable reference if it had better index. The index in my first print is almost worthless. Michael Gannon, \"Operation Drumbeat\" and \"Black May\"  Gannon covers two periods of the u-boat war, Spring 1942 when the US first entered World War II and May 1943.  \"Operation Drumbeat\" covers the US's entry in World War II. The US was short of escort vessels and resistant to British advice on how to fight u-boats. The result was dozens of ships sunk - often illuminated by the lights of coastal cities which fought the imposition of blackouts. The slaughter could have been lessened but not avoided, there were simply not enough ships and planes to fight in the Pacific and to fight the u-boats. \"Black May\" covers the period when the Allied efforts against the u-boats finally came together and reduced the u-boat to a nuisance threat. Allied code breaking gave intelligence on where u-boats were gathering to attack, technologies like centimetric radar and high frequency direction finding could pinpoint u-boats as they approached convoys, long range bombers could locate and attack u-boats and escorts for convoys were finally plentiful and experienced.  Martin Middlebrook, \"Convoy: The Greatest U-Boat Battle of the War\" Shortly before Black May, the Allies were fighting huge convoy battles against the u-boats.  Middlebrook covers the fate of two separate convoys, HX 229 and SC 122 bound for Britain from the US that were attacked by three separate wolf packs pitting 41 u-boats against 13 escorts and 110 merchantmen in March 1943. U-boats sank 22 merchantmen for the loss of only one u-boat, an unsustainable rate of loss for the Allies. Dan Van der Vat, \"Stealth at Sea\" and \"The Atlantic Campaign\" \"Stealth at Sea\" is a general history of the development of the submarine as a weapon, though it spends a good portion describing the use of submarines in World War II.  \"The Atlantic Campaign\" covers fighting in the Atlantic during World War II. Since their were relatively few German surface ships, it focuses mostly on the war against the submarine. Van der Vat's great skill is to condense a complex campaign involving intelligence, technology and ocean warfare into a digestible, concise history. I'd rate it a better introductory history than Blair's \"Hitler's U-Boat War.\" John Keegan, \"The Price of Admiralty\" \"The Price of Admiralty\" is a series of studies of decisive naval campaigns (Trafalgar, Jutland, Midway and the Atlantic) that covers the u-boat campaign in one chapter. It is one of Keegan's best, which is to say it is a modern classic. ",

            "answer_text": "U-Boat Commander: A Periscope View of the Battle of the Atlantic (Peter Cremer, last published in 1984) is considered by many the best U-boat related book out there. I read it back in 2004 and it was simply amazing. Far better than Iron Coffins in my opinion. However it hasn\u2019t been re-published in 30 years now so you will have to find a used copy. Additional picks would be: Das Boot (Lothar-G\u00fcnther Buchheim\u2019s book which inspired the homonymous 4hrs movie, a must read even if you\u2019ve seen the film)Grey Wolf, Grey Sea: Aboard the German Submarine U-124 in World War IITeddy Suhren, Ace of Aces: Memoirs of a U-Boat RebelAnd of course what Andrew has already suggested. I found Operation Drumbeat particularly thorough and enjoyable. ",
