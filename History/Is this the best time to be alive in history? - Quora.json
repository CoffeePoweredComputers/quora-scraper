            "answer_text": "Absolutely. I can work at a variety of jobs simply unthinkable 100 years before now. I have access to information even the wisest scholar did not have before the past 2 decades. I have oppurtunities to interact with minds all across the world and get my thoughts, belief systems and ideologies upgraded based on the best and most rational systems. Medicine - I wasn\u2019t a healthy child and would have likely not survived the continuous maladies I\u2019d been exposed to (i\u2019ve survived pretty much every major infection over 30 years except for STD\u2019s, polio and smallpox) Smallpox - Yes, that\u2019s no longer an issue. Neither is polio. Travel - I can visit places that I wouldn\u2019t have known existed a few centuries back. Technology - Human knowledge had been on the increase over time. The more we know the more we improve our quality of life. Related to technology are recreational activities - 3d movies, video games, streaming entertainment - Should I say anything more? Bikes and cars - Pretty self explanatory. Better, less pollution, more efficient and cheaper. Dating - the good thing you can date a variety of girls in this era than before. You\u2019re not forced to marry the first woman your family selects, whether you two are compatible or not. Food - Arab, thai, Italian, Mexican, Afghan all within your city. Similarly, you have access to a wider variety of substances (illicit or not) if you so chose to imbibe. Culture - More access to any sort of culture, learning, languages, art than any emperor in history available to your middle class joe. Giving back - this has been the greatest time when a person with no great background can ascend the socioeconomic ladder. Look at sundar pichai, Bill Gates, Warren buffet, many self made millionaires who donate innumerable wealth to causes they believe in. HDI - literacy is at an all time high, poverty in percentage terms the lowest in the world, same for infant mortality. Enlightenment - this is the most enlightened generation of all time. We're less racist, less prejudiced, more humane than ever before. 200 years back, most people were racist, slavery still existed on a wide scale and humans were more nationalistic than now. People still are all that to a degree, but as more people travel and encounter humans online, similarities start to overcome ancient tribal boundaries. 1 Drawback of our lifestyle - human relationships have taken a back seat.

            "answer_text": "It is for me.  I nearly died as a child due to serve asthma attacks.  If I had been born even five years earlier, I wouldn't have had much chance of being here to answer this question.  People live longer now than ever before.  It's not just about me. Crime rates are among the lowest in history throughout most of the world, and they are still dropping.  That statistic alone says a lot. More interesting things are happening now than ever before.  We've had instrument landings on an asteroid and on a comet.  We have a spacecraft approaching Pluto, and we have one in orbit around Ceres.  The human genome has been mapped, and because of this and other developments we may be on the verge of better cures for more diseases.  We know more about healthy living than ever before, even if most people don't use this knowledge.  Advancements in materials science and other fields of engineering can remake the world into a much better place in the next few generations. Also computers haven't taken over yet (I doubt they will). We have the most generative instrument in history in the Internet, and so far corporations haven't been able to completely take it over. There is this big problem of climate change that could make the future not the best time to be alive, but there is still time to avoid the worst of climate change, and I think we will succeed, in spite of Congress.  It is one of the worst congresses in U.S. history, but such things go back and forth, and I don't think you're asking about a particular few years. Contrary to what is often said about today's youth (the same things that have always been said by older people about younger people), on the average they have really positive characteristics.  I know this as someone who taught and coached in various schools for over 40 years.  The students I've seen directly and heard about are really amazing people. Most of the things that people now complain about were a little worse to much worse in the past.  Climate change and college tuitions are possibly the major exceptions. I've experienced the 50's, the 60's and so on, and you can have them all.  Things are better now on the whole. ",
