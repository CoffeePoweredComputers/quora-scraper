            "answer_text": "I would have to say the United States has the most barbaric death penalty because we continue to knowingly execute innocent people. Over 150 people have been exonerated from death row since the 1970\u2019s. Those are only the erroneous convictions we know about. How many other erroneous convictions led to executions? Hint: more than zero! We will never know how man innocents have been executed but it is a statistical certainty that is has happened and will continue to happen as long as the USA\u2019s imperfect legal system continues to issue bad convictions. It is time for the United States to join the rest of the civilized world and end the death penalty. ",
