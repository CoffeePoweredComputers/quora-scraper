You always have to admire the presumption of a question starting with \u2018given that' followed by a supposition that we are meant to swallow without question. Although yours is nowhere near the worst I have seen, as it has a modicum of truth to it. Henry VIIs great grandfather, Maredudd ap Tudur, was a Welsh Lord from Anglesey who rebelled with Owain Glendwr. Maredudd's supposed son, Owen Tudor, supposedly the grandfather of Henry VII was one of many Welshmen who found favour at the English court after the end of Gyndwr's rebellion. He married Catherine of Valoise and she gave birth to Edmund Tudor, Henry VII father. Where Maredudd was a Welshman and Owen Welsh born, but lived in England, Edmund was neither. He was born in Hertfordshire, grew up in Suffolk and was Earl of Richmond. He married Margaret Beaufort, the daughter of the Duke of Somerset, but he died before Henry was born. Henry was born in Pembroke castle, which was an old Norman stronghold, as his mother has sought refuge there with her brother-in-law after her husband's arrest, but he spent most of his life in England and France. The Tudor dynasty played down the Welsh connection as it he died to undermine the rather shaky (read non-existent) claim they had to the throne. However, Welsh clergy and administrators did find favour in court appointments during the time. At the same time Henry VIII came close to losing the Welsh language for all time, as close as it has ever come, with the provisions of the 1536 Act of Union, far more dangerous than the Blue Book. His daughter, Elizabeth I's 1563 law to have the Bible and common prayer book translated into Welsh, the single greatest boost to the Welsh language until modern times. Under the Tudors many of the old inequities suffered by the people of Wales under the legal system were removed by the Acts of Union 1536 and 1542. ",

            "answer_text": "The Tudor Dynasty was Welsh in the same way that the current Queen is German - that is, they had Welsh ancestry but it had been a long time since the family had actually lived or had very much to do with their ancestral land. The first Tudor King Henry VII\u2019s father Edmund Tudor and his uncle Jasper were both born in England and were raised in England, and Henry\u2019s mother Margaret Beaufort was a member of the English aristocracy. Henry himself was born in Wales and spent time there as a child under the wardship of William Herbert earl of Pembroke - but in a household that in common with most Anglo-Welsh gentry - would have followed English customs, not Welsh. After Edward IV regained the throne in 1471 the 14 year old Henry fled to Brittany with the other leading Lancastrians. Hence he spent most of his childhood surrounded by the English or French. Henry\u2019s sons Arthur and Henry VIII were born in England to an English mother, raised in England and would have considered themselves English. Henry VIII\u2019s children Edward, Mary and Elizabeth were English (or in Mary\u2019s case half Spanish) - not Welsh. So the idea of the Tudor Monarchs as a Welsh dynasty speaking Welsh and deeply embedded in Welsh custom is completely incorrect. They were thoroughly English by the 1500s. It would have never occurred to them to try to introduce Welsh customs - with which they would have been entirely unfamiliar - to the English court. In fact, their main Welsh-related innovation was the 1535/42 Laws in Wales acts that formally incorporated Wales into England, and imposed English language and law. ",
