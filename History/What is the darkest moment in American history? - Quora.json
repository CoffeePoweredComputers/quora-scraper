            "answer_text": "The darkest hour of American history will be defined by our subjective value systems more than anything else, and this will leave us with many very dark moments covering many human rights, and ethics issues. For one person Roe v. Wade will be a shining moment of human rights and the protection of woman; and another will say that it is our darkest moment when the rights of the unborn were violated in favor of sexual freedom and convenience bringing about the largest death toll in American History. This is one moment which exemplifies how we will severely disagree at times. For another the appropriately aforementioned slavery issues, whether the actual practice of slavery, or the unwillingness to deal with it early ranks high, while another will see this as a greater world problem of which we were a part and a significantly dark part at that. The Native American ethnocide must rank very high, if not #1, but as seen by voting it has not yet ranked as #1, and so there are varying opinions on what ranks something as darkest. I can not help but wondering if the darkest moments have passed unseen. In decisions made behind closed doors, in votes made for or against deceitful politicians we should have known better about, in general cultural trends evidencing unconcern for important human rights issues, in things as simple as pepper spray use (whether it's Casual Pepper Spray Cop, or some sick lady using pepper spray to get the best Black Friday deal at WalMart), plastic surgery as a means of finding fulfillment, and magazine ads using sex to sell. Cultural trends and science could rank high: anorexia as a concern among our young women, the development of the atomic bomb, over-medication of our children as behavioral modification, and the lists of darkness could go on, and on, and.... Perhaps the darkest moments are not the big ones, but the little ones every day. Perhaps they don't reside in history, but in human hearts, and issues like greed, prejudice, fear, envy and hatred. If that is the case, the darkest moments for America are in me from time to time. And maybe they are in you too. ",

            "answer_text": "The darkest moment might not have been the most \"evil\" in itself, but it spawned more evil and division than almost any other.  It occurred when the Founding Fathers decided not to resolve the issue of slavery at the Constitutional Convention.  Instead, they compromised and postponed its resolution for future generations.  This decision led to more conflict and injustice than almost any other in American history. As a practical matter, this compromise manifested itself in several ways.  First, the Constitution allowed Congress to ban the African overseas slave trade, but only after twenty years.  Second, it set up a system that counted slaves, for electoral purposes, as three-fifths of a person each, a seemingly arbitrary number.   But from a broader perspective, the failure of the Fathers to devise a solution to the issue while the country was young allowed the institution to become more deeply entrenched in Southern society, and allowed the South's economic system to become even more dependent on slavery.  Thus, besides the inherent evil of allowing a crime against humanity to continue on American soil, this compromise inevitably doomed the United States to future conflict.  It led directly to the cataclysmic violence of the Civil War, which killed 620,000 Americans (more than any other war); it led to Jim Crow, lynching, and 100 years of oppression; it led to years of struggle and hardship through the Civil Rights movement; it led to years of official and private discrimination; it has arguably led to continued racial tension and disparity today. Pretty much our darkest hour. ",
