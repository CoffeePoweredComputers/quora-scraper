White, one of the Supreme Court cases on the subject, in their majority opinion said \u201cThere was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States.\u201d So currently there\u2019s 4 ways to secede from the Union at least. Non-unilaterally: Aka, not just walking away but getting permission first (the consent of the states). Through force: Winning a war of secession/rebellion/independence, and gaining a treaty signed by the US (or destroying that gov\u2019t). This was how the slavers rebellion attempted secession in the early 1860\u2019s\u2026 through a Civil War. Through an Amendment: Simply put, if and amendment is passed and ratified that allows unilateral secession, then it would become a legal avenue. A new majority opinion by the Supreme Court that overrides the existing one. A state passing a secession act, taking it to the Supreme Court, and the Court ruling in the states favor this time around. But currently there is no legal avenue (according to US law) for unilateral secession. ",

            "answer_text": "In Texas v. White (1868), the Supreme Court stated that: \u201cWhen Texas became one of the United States, she entered into an indissoluble relation. The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States. There was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States.\u201d Right there, the Supreme Court interpreted the U.S. Constitution to say that a state cannot secede and the Federal Government is obligated to prevent such secession. The only way a state can leave is through revolution or through the consent of the other states. So, in this fantastical hypothetical, if such a vote did occur and a state announced an intent to leave the Union one of two things must happen: Violent revolutionCongress must vote to approve the secessionNeither is plausible. No matter how much crazy rednecks might believe that their home arsenals are to protect them from a tyrannical government, that tyrannical government has drones, stealth bombers, fuel-air bombs, nuclear bombs, and many other ways to rain down fire and brimstone. There is no-win scenario in such a violent revolution for an individual state. Nor is it really credible that Congress would convene and agree to let a state leave, because before doing so, they would first have to agree to amend the Constitution to remove the part of section 1 of the 14th Amendment where it says: Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. I read that to say that no state has the right to make a law that abridges the right to US citizenship of its residents. Therefore a state can't really secede, because it cannot take away US citizenship from its residents. And the US can't allow the secession because it is obligated to defend the citizenship of any inhabitants of that state. As long as there are residents of that state that want to remain American citizens, the state can't be allowed to secede. ",
