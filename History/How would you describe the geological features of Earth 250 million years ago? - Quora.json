            "answer_text": "Hooray, you've landed us pretty close to the beginning of the Triassic Period! It's also the beginning of the Mesozoic Era -- the Age of Dinosaurs. The supercontinent Pangea has formed -- it will begin its long break-up in about 50-75 million years, as the basin that will form the Atlantic Ocean begins to open up. The Appalachian Mountains have formed because of the collision between Gondwana and Laurasia. Large sedimentary basins began forming in Europe, along with a lot of folding from the collision that formed Pangea. (Imagine a tablecloth that's being pushed along the surface of a table, and the folds that form as it compresses). My part of the world, what will later be Arizona, is located pretty close to the equator, and our western edge is pointing closer to north. Shallow seas have dominated Arizona for much of the previous (Paleozoic) Era, depositing sedimentary layers of limestone, shale, and sandstone. In the beginning of the Mesozoic Era, arid floodplain deposits and cross-bedded sandstone from extensive dune fields are being laid down over those earlier beds. But at 250 million years, the sea advances again and lays the Kaibab formation down in the area that will later erode into Grand Canyon. Here's a cool link: http://www.bobspixels.com/kaibab.org/geology/gc_geol.htm In the area that will later become Petrified Forest National Park, ash from erupting volcanoes is mixing with silt and musdstone to form the Chinle Formation. Silica from the ash will slowly replace the organic material in buried trees to form petrified wood. Here's another cool link: https://www.nps.gov/pefo/learn/nature/petrified-wood.htm The wind systems and ocean currents on Earth must be different, since we have that one giant landmass in the southern hemisphere and one giant ocean surrounding it (Panthalassa). Life is evolving to live on land, because most of the shallow seas that allowed marine life to flourish in warm, sunny waters have dried up. The dinos are about to become the head honchos of the world (for another 200 milli0n years). Entire books have been written about this Period. But I've listed a few of the geologic conditions from that approximate time. ",

            "answer_text": "Hi Nicole - the first thing I would do is check the geologic time chart to see about where \u2018250 million years ago\u2019 would fall - aha! Dinosaur time! I can also pretty easily find out the best information available for what the earth looked like then as far as continental masses and oceans - and where there were deserts and where there were swamps. Pangea-time! So there would have been one very large continental mass and some islands, with a correspondingly large ocean surrounding it. Otherwise - expect there to be scenery not too terribly different from today: mountains, deserts, forests - the air was breathable (which wouldn\u2019t have been the case earlier). Animal life would be different - with reptiles filling most ecological niches - this is the beginning or at least, early in dinosaur time, so they may not be extremely big dinosaurs on land just yet - this isn\u2019t my field (vertebrate paleontology) but the seas will be full of all sorts of life - and there might be SOME mammals, mostly small. Also some quite remarkable large insects! For a human, it would be a beautiful but dangerous place. ",
