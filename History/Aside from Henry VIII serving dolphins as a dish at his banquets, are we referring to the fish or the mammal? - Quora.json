It wasn\u2019t just aquatic mammals who resemble fish(such as dolphins) that got eaten and considered as fish-but also, for example, an otter. Though I am not sure if it was still the case at a lifetime of Henry VIII, aquatic mammals were eaten at his court and porpoise were favourite of his first wife. ",
