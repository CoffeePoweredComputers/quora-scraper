            "answer_text": "In the old days, Mongols used to use the ointment for a personal hygiene purpose which was quite similar to Eskimos\u2019 practices. They also used various oils to clean skin. Various oils of animal origin usually applied on the skin and massaged to get the dirt off. Even today such customs is still used but mostly for toddlers.  Some sources claim that a specially designed sheepskin was also used for an intense sweating purpose to clean skin. However, during the Manchu domination period, these customs were eradicated which triggered a belief that Mongols did not take a shower. I don\u2019t know the true reasons why Manchus decided to forcefully eradicate such practices amongst Mongols. According to some conjecture, it was aimed at wiping out Mongols through various diseases caused by unhygienic conditions. ",

            "answer_text": "Whereas i have nt come across any historical article on the subject, its presumed that the Mongolz never bathed or seldom bathed. I would imagine that must vebeen the case with all nomadic cultures. The availability of water abd toiletries must ve been limited to major urban centers. Take a relatively recent example _ deoderant. I dont know about others but I saw deoderant in the early 80s in my region. Except for those of us who were living in the west knew of it and used it, others had no idea. What did we do about body odor? Most of us dont even know or remember what we did before that. ",
