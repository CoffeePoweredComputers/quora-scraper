            "answer_text": "Some words to describe the Renaissance, Protesant Reformation, and the Age of Exploration are that these are all European events in the period 1450\u20131750. This marked a period in world history in which Europeans were getting \u201cawakened\u201d, which started from the Crusades which brought feudal Europe into contact with the Arab world, and in which they learned of the existence of sugar and spices. Nevertheless, here are some quick words to describe these events: Renaissance = Some important things include humanism and individualism. Flourishing of culture and literature, especially that of Latin. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t know too much about this topic.Reformation = The Protestant Reformation. It was an important event in Christianity. This guy, named Martin Luther, got tired of how the Church possessed so much power and money, and did things that he was against, such as issuing slips of paper that would grant access to heaven upon death if one paid a ridiculous sum of money. So, he wrote the 95 Theses on what the Church was doing wrong, nailed it to the font door of the church of the town he lived in and called for action. Because of the printing press, his writings and pamphlets could be widely distributed. All this led to the formation of a Protestant sect from the original Roman Catholic sect of Christianity, in which there were some differences such as the church personel like the bishops not having as much power and only being there to \u201cguide\u201d the people, and where things like selling indulgences (those slips of paper), were prohibited. This in essence was the Protestant Reformation, and set the stage for the creation of the many Christian sects we see today (all of them for lots of disagreements on various things)Age of Exploration = Ah yes, the beginning of this period. In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue. But yes, there\u2019s more to that. The Age of Exploration occurred because of the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of sugar and spices from the Crusades, and how they wanted more of it. To get to Asia to get those goodies, there was the way of going through the Ottoman Empire, but the goods would be heavily marked up. For example, Vasco da Gama found on a trip to India that the goods there were 20x cheaper than when bought in the Ottoman Empire. In addition, you would have to pass through the Italian city states. So explorers, funded by monarchs, sought a different way to Asia, and they thought they apparently could go across the Atlantic, and some went down the coastline of Africa. Regardless, this established the first global connections in the European discovery of America and set in motion the whole Transatlantic trade thing, but that\u2019s for later.",

            "answer_text": "Any attempt to reduce the Renaissance period\u2014from the mid-14th century to the end of the 17th century, which subsumes the Reformation, the Ages of Exploration, and also the rise of scientific rationalism\u2014to a few words is an exercise in reductive futility. I suggest going to something like Roberts\u2019 History Of The World and reading the relevant section. ",
