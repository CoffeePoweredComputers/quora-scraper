            "answer_text": "North east and TIBET as well is actually a part of Indian culture. If we go into the past then China didn't exist in history until that China wall made.In history we will find that before the BUDDHISM there is no tibet and all these area independent and rule by different local kingdoms.Many of them are HINDUS as there is no other RELIGION is there ( no Islam or BUDDHISM) .So naturally all the kingdoms are of HINDUS KING. So there is naturally they are attached with India only.Northeast part ,tibet, Pakistan , South East Asia are the influenced by Hinduism.After then BUDDHISM came the tibet and northeast part slowly became influenced by BUDDHISM but BUDDHISM is of India only.So naturally again the connection of all these states are from India.After the MUGALS these areas start to go away from India as they are not feeling any connection from India.And then after the British these area came under them and later given to India.Only tibet as its really of no use for they any one is made independent.Then China started it's expansion policy\u2026 And it snatched the tibet.And as China wants northeast too. Actuality the INTENTION of China is of whole EURASIA .",
