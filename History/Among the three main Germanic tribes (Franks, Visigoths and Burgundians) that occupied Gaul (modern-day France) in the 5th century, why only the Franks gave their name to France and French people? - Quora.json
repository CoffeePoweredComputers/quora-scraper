            "answer_text": "Because the Franks occupied what became the core of the French state. The Burgundians formed their own separate kingdom of Burgundy east of France, which lasted until 534, when it became the Duchy of Burgundy. This was a very powerful entity, which often in the Middles Ages acted almost as an independent state, and the Kingdom made a couple of short lived comebacks up until the 15th century. One of the Dukes of Burgundy negotiated the peace treaty between the French and Henry V of England, which gave Henry the inheritance of the French crown on the death of the French King Charles VI. In the event both Kings died shortly afterwards and the Hundred years war hotted up again. If Henry hadn\u2019t died there would probably have been a union between France and England, and European history would have been very different. The Visigoths also formed their own kingdom in what is now France, but this was much more short lived. The main arena for the Visigoths was in what is now Spain, where the Visigothic kingdom survived until the Muslim conquest in 711. ",
