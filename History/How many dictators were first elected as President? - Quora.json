            "answer_text": "This an interesting question but one that is extremely hard to answer, but I'll give it a try\u2026 Okay, so there are a lot of elected dictators throughout history which is why I'm going to focus on the most recent. Moreover, the elected dictators were elected under a myriad of different titles, some presidents some not. That said there seems to be around 15 democratically elected dictators in recent history including Adolf Hitler, Muammar Al Gaddafi, and Kim Jong il. I hope that answers your question:) ",
