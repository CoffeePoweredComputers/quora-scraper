            "answer_text": "Why was Psalm 15 written ? The Psalm has been taken as an entrance liturgy to the sanctuary. It was likely either an actual liturgy performed at the gates of the Temple, or simply a reminder of the requirements for admittance to the sanctuary (see also Psalm 24:3\u20136). In answer to the question \u201cwho can gain entry into the holy place?\u201d Psalm 15 describes a person of \u2018blameless\u2019 moral character and righteous action. But does this mean that sinners were prohibited from the Temple precincts ? Certainly not, because the law called on those who sinned to go to the sanctuary and offer sacrifices to show their repentance. Thus, to be \u201cblameless\u201d means to have a heart that is obedient, but when one sins, one repents and offers sacrifices in order to restore one\u2019s reputation with God. Repentant sinners who seek to obey God in the ways specified by Psalm 15 and the Torah were blameless. Of course once Christ had come, there was no longer any need for a holy place where God made his special presence known. Jesus is the very presence of God, the fulfillment of the sanctuary. Every place is holy. The Christian is a temple, indwelt by the Holy Spirit, as the sanctuary was filled with the presence of God. Nonetheless, people today are called to the same character and life-style described by the Psalmist. Like the Old Testament people of God, Christians sin, but when they do, they turn in repentance to Jesus, the only one who is truly righteous. Living by faith today means that we grab onto the righteousness of Christ. That we believe that his life by faith counts as our good-works, and that his death by faith counts as the death we owed, and that he was raised to life for our justification (Romans 4:25). We respond to God\u2019s grace by living our lives to his glory! Reference: Tremper Longman III, Psalms, Volumes 15\u201316 (TOTC) IVP Academic 2014, pp99f. ",

            "answer_text": "Psalms 15 appears to be a sort of poetically phrased listings of qualifications for the most ardent followers of the god that David worshiped, presumably Yahweh. This is a transcription of what it says, sourced from the NIV version. Lord, who may dwell in your sacred tent? Who may live on your holy mountain? The one whose walk is blameless, who does what is righteous, who speaks the truth from their heart; whose tongue utters no slander, who does no wrong to a neighbor, and casts no slur on others; who despises a vile person but honors those who fear the Lord;who keeps an oath even when it hurts, and does not change their mind; who lends money to the poor without interest; who does not accept a bribe against the innocent. Whoever does these things will never be shaken. Psalms 15, much like the majority of the Book of Psalms: it is written with the express purpose of offering poems and songs in veneration of Yahweh/Elohim. Consequently we know the Jewish people have a historical record of writing many hyms and prayers like this, besides the Psalms. The Psalms are attributed to King David, though as a historical figure his authenticity is debatable, add to it is is theorized by modern Bible scholars that the Psalms were written across a wide span of time, beyond and well before the life of David, some Psalms possibly even dating back to the time of Moses. It is likely that the Psalms were later attributed to David once they were actually written to paper, however I\u2019m not certain when the earliest complete version was written, though the Psalms, and the Hebrew book of Ketuvim in which you\u2019ll find it, was not considered canon until at least just after the Roman sacking of Jersusalem in 70AD.
