            "answer_text": "Vyshyvanka was politicized, so it is political. The people who belong to vyshyvaka/nationalism cults do like that. The people who don\u2019t belong to the cults could care less or don\u2019t like it. My parents were from Central Ukraine. My father had one, but never wore it. My mother had no vyshyvanka. Of my classmates none wore it, ever. Of my fellow students in the university none wore it, ever. I\u2019m of those Ukrainians who think that vyshyvanka is rather ethnic / rural clothes, and there is nothing special about it for a person of urban culture to give any special value to it. Like I say, \u201cMy grandparents ditched vyshyvankas to become working class men, whose holiday clothes was city costumes\u201d. The photo below is of my grandfather, my mother\u2019s father, the one I look alike to (compare to my profile picture). He is in his railroad worker uniform, and I believe that vyshyvanka is not what you want to wear close to any railroad.  Since 2006 nationalists and \u201cpatriots\u201d made vyshyvanka one of their symbols. Well, it\u2019s their belief, like their religion. But I don\u2019t belong to it. If people just want to celebrate their religion, that\u2019s fine with me. If people say that I must obey their religion, put on me restrictions because of their religion, and demand of me to wear their religion symbols, that\u2019s not what I like. So in general I\u2019m not fond of people wearing vyshyvankas. ",

            "answer_text": "Personally (as a Ukrainian-Canadian) I do not have a problem with anyone wearing vyshyvanka. I think it looks awesome and love seeing it on people. Please note that Ukraine promoted Vyshyvanka Day as the International Vyshyvanka Day, so I would assume there is an expectation that anyone can wear it. The one issue I *do* have is if some big fashion house copies it and starts marketing it to make money. Then it just becomes a detached fashion statement completely unrelated to Ukrainian culture any more. ",
