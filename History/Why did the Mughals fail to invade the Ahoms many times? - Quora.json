Jayadhwaj Singha, the king of Ahoms, lost the battle. His daughter, who was also niece of Lachit Borphukan, Ramani Gabharu, was married to Muhammad Azam Shah, the son of Aurangzeb, as Ahoms had lost the battle. She was renamed to Rahmat Banu Begum. But when Mughals entered their playground, rhe mountains, the lost bad. Just like Mughals could never capture Himachali Rajput kingdoms. Mughals tried around 17 times to invade Ahoms in the mountains. They failed. ",

            "answer_text": "Lazy attitude towards the Ahomese. The Mughals kinda did British boxing with Ahomese but that didn't work. Mughals never fought and won using British boxing. They won by getting Ahomese satrops to swap sides and open da eastern gates The Mughals are guilty of not devoting enough resoueces for this purpose when deviation psychology was at the core of all early Mughal successes. I guess once u become successful and establish, u become lazy. ",
