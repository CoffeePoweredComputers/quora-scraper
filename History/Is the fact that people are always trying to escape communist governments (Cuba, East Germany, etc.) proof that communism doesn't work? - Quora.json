            "answer_text": "Capitalist Russia is facing a massive emigration problem. Should we blame that on communism? Sorry, can\u2019t do it this time. Same thing with Latin American nations suffering from capitalism and the perils of free trade causing massive unemployment and they head North to the U.S. The idea that people moving from this place to that and the cause being socialism is nonsensical. It is simply pro capitalist religious dogma.  Speaking of capitalist misery. Not only does it bring misery, but it forces it on those who refuse capitalism. Deaths from U.S. sanctions in Venezuela between 2017\u20132018 alone 40,000Source: Economist, prominent UN figure blames American sanctions for thousands of deaths in Venezuela 2. Out of a total population of approximately 22 million, somewhere between 240,000 and 3,500,000 North Koreans died from starvation or hunger-related illnesses, with the deaths peaking in 1997. A 2011 U.S. Census Bureau report estimated the number of excess deaths from 1993 to 2000 to be between 500,000 and 600,000. North Korea depended upon the USSR to import grain. After the Soviet Union collapsed U.S. sanctions stopped relief efforts. The goal was to starve the people into revolt. To this extent, the U.S. has been claiming the sanctions were \u201chighly successful.\u201d Starvation was openly admitted to being used by the State Department in Cuba. Why sanctions on cuba.pdf 3.  4. Deaths caused by the introduction of neoliberal capitalism in Russia after 1991.   5. The Irish Potato Famine was made worse by the refusal of the government to interfere with the \u201cwisdom of the markets\u201d based on the belief in laissez faire capitalism. This exacerbated the famine, causing millions more to die. Capitalist markets are inherently unstable and cannot self correct once in a collapse. Similarly, President Hoover during the Great Depression refused to act and because he feared it would prevent the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d from working. It was not until FDR intervened that the suffering was alleviated, and WWII would pull it out of depression. Religious faith in dangerous capitalist dogmas of the \u201cwisdom of markets\u201d has proven deadly for over 150 years.  6. In the U.S. farm technology is so efficient that if farmers grew to capacity the grain markets would collapse from too much supply. So the government pays farmers NOT to grow food. It could pay them to grow to capacity and issue food stamps to hungry people, but this is not done for political reasons because conservatives belief that \u201cgetting free stuff makes you lazy.\u201d Therefore, school lunch programs for impoverished children and Meals on Wheels must be slashed, so these people can learn \u201ctough love and personal responsibility.\u201d    7. Millions of Americans die from preventable diseases due to the inability to afford medical care.   Republican governors reject the Medicaid expansion because \u201cObamacare is socialism,\u201d and hate the government. People die from this anti-socialist, capitalist ideology. These nations provide universal healthcare. There are no people that die from lack of preventable diseases due to cost. And there are no medical bankruptcies.  8. Despite there being more empty homes than homeless people, people die from hypothermia related to homelessness. Most of the homeless are people that would have previously qualified for addiction and mental health treatment in government hospitals. But Ronald Reagan cut these to give tax breaks to the rich, and mentally ill people were dumped on the streets. In Wisconsin, people die from hypothermia related homelessness. Many shelters don\u2019t permit pets, and others limit how many of your personal items can be brought with you. Others are simply too full.  9. Capitalism kills. We hear incessantly about how violent communists are, the reality is that capitalism is a hidden killer. It kills and we don\u2019t even notice it. Mark Twain on French Revolution and the Reign of Terror: \u201cThere were two Reigns of Terror if we would but remember and consider it. The one wrought murder in hot passion, the other in heartless cold blood. The one lasted mere months, the other had lasted a thousand years. The one inflicted death upon ten thousand persons, the other upon a hundred million. Our shudders are all for the 'horrors' of the minor Terror, the momentary Terror, so to speak. But what is the horror of swift death by the axe compared with lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty, and heartbreak?\u201d At least under socialism there were some protections.  ",

            "answer_text": "Tribal mongering question. The question assumes facts that are not in evidence. The earliest migrations and expansions of archaic and modern humans across continents and are believed to have begun approximately 2 million years ago with the out of Africa migration of Homo erectus. Obviously Africa, at the time, must have been under a Communist governmental system that didn\u2019t work? In 2012, Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin paid an exit tax of about $700 Million, and renounced his citizenship in order to \u201cescape\u201d the U.S. U.S. citizens renouncing their citizenship, and \u201cescaping\u201d to other Countries (including highly Socialized Countries) has increased by 500% since 2010. Clearly, this is proof that capitalism doesn\u2019t work? Somalia had no formal, centralized government for more than a decade. Many people \u201cescaped\u201d. Thus, even Anarchy doesn\u2019t work. The Country with by far the most people immigrating to it as a percentage of its native population is The United Arab Emirates. Does this mean that a Monarchy does work? Capitalism, Communism, Socialism, and other \u2018brand names\u2019 for theoretical systems of government are not inherently positive or negative in terms of helping or hurting the citizens living under these particular governments. It is the Humans tasked with overseeing these governmental systems that help or hurt, not necessarily the system itself. Moreover, none of these branded systems are, and never were, pure. Communism in China today is more like State dictated Capitalism, and Democratic Capitalism in the U.S. is best defined as a kleptocratic kakistocracy. These brands are nothing more than Tribes; an organized collective operating under some documented framework. Humans are instinctively hard wired for survival. As part of that mechanism, surviving is far easier for a collective than an individual. It is Human nature to affiliate ourselves with a group(s), or Tribe(s). In Psychology, this is known as Identity Theory. When we define ourselves, we do so in large part by asserting our loyalty to the groups to which we belong. Interestingly, Human individualism also plays a role. This is why Tribes splinter into sub-Tribes, or new Tribes are formed, or individuals seek refuge by \u201cescaping\u201d to other Tribes if they feel (a perception in relation to others within the Tribe) overly oppressed, and have the means, ability, and fortitude to do so. Humans have always done this. The flaws in the question as stated includes injecting a \u2018Tribal Brand name\u2019 in the place of just \u2018Tribe\u2019, that the term \u2018people\u2019 (some people? most people? A few people?) is too vague, and no directive of where these people go (Would a person escape Communist Cuba in favor of Communist China?). Different Tribes may work better for different individuals. Individuals \u201cEscaping\u201d from one Tribal system to another has no real bearing on the viability of that system. ",
