            "answer_text": "True and I agree in both a tactical and a strategical level (though the statement seems to solely focus in the tactics). I would say the nature of trench warfare which favored the defender was one of the most major causes of a stalemate, but the there should also be an emphasis on why trenches had to be established and what were the before and after changes in strategy. A Tactical Level : Weapon Development By the time WWI started there was a disproportionate development in weaponry. Since the 1880\u2019s and Hiram Maxim introducing his gas operated machine guns to the world, there was a fast development in rapid fire weapons for a specific tactical purpose: cutting down enemies in a long distance and was watercooled. The fact that machine guns were meant to be used in such way also lead to certain problems in mobility. WWII weaponry was a result of WWI trenches. In WWI, weapons having high potential of firepower had poor mobility and was fixed in certain areas. Light rapid fire weapons were never universal and would barely have shown until 1918, the year WWI ended.  Maxim 08, a typical example So there was a massive advance in defensive firepower, but not in offensive firepower. Yes, regular infantrymen were armed with magazine bolt action rifles and could produce substantial firepower, but the factor that it is a bolt action rifle was crucial. Lets say you are going over the top, sees an enemy infantry popping his head up to shoot somebody. You raise your rifle to the shoulder and shoot, but misses. Now you need to prepare a second shot so you pull the bolt. That would take more than a second until you can have your second chance, but during that second you will lay vulnerable having no ability to threaten the enemy. If a machine gun spots you, you are in great trouble. In WWII large introduction of submachine guns and later assault rifles gave soldiers armed with these weapons to have the equal mobility, but with twice or thrice the firepower. You can shoot without switching your aim until the target has fallen or is pinned down. The disadvantage in firepower for the attacker by far was a major factor. French generals in 1914 tend to ignore these tactical importance and technological importance of rifles, higher firepower, and these \u201cminor\u201d factors, that they had tactical inferiority when the war started. Rifles are not just rifles, machine guns are not just machine guns. These weapons can be key factors of an entire battle and that battle can be a huge contribution to the war effort. Strategical Level : Logistics and Supplies In WWI, wire communications and railroads were essential means of receiving live information from the front and supplying them. When a trench line is established, all military factors should be suited for that area and trenches are static. Therefore logistics originally aimed for a static goal.  2:55, there is exactly the information I need to tell you When an enemy trench is taken all logistical objectives should be shifted from the rear trench to the newly taken lines. How do you do that with all the stuffs already contributed for the previous trench? Well, you build everything from scratch. However, not only does the complication of these logistical factors hard to overcome (the supplying of millions), there are further obstacles as these logistical means should be lain on no man\u2019s land. This factor would further lead to a static war. Tactical Level : Recapturing a Trench A WWI trench battle is not a fight between one layers. It is not a success to capture one line of trenches, you need to capture a whole layer of firing trenches, communication trenches, supply trenches, and reserve trenches. These goals are often times impossible or at least blood thirsty objectives. Further more, as more and more static the war becomes each trench line further develops for a long term stay. Defenses would be reinforced, concrete machine gun bunks could be made, more and more barbed wires would be put. An early WWI was something like below (simple dirt ditches).  by the year 1916 trenches more looked like the ones below  and it would continue to be reinforced and strengthened. The Hindenburg line of 1918 could be seen as an ultimatum of how defensive a trench can develop. Conclusion The statement is for sure correct, but I would say there are more things to be added for a deeper and a more accurate, realistic understanding of WWI trench warfare and stalemate. -Jihoon Seo- ",

            "answer_text": "You could say that, sure. You could also say that the reason that a car had a flat tire is that the air pressure inside the tire went to zero. It\u2019s absolutely true and accurate as a stand alone statement, but it doesn\u2019t really tell the whole story of how the flat happened, now does it? Likewise, the statement you give still doesn\u2019t give the reasons for the trench lines, how they came about and why it took so long or so many resources and effort to eventually crack them. Case in point - trenches TODAY give defenders advantages over attackers and in a battle in which attackers have limited resources they are still quite effective. So why the stalemate? Especially when the trenches in the East weren\u2019t nearly as effective nor was that front a stalemate, even though it was fought with similar armies with the exact same technology. What was so different in the West? It turns out there were many factors, not all of which were readily apparent, even to the combatants at the start of the war. Density of troops in a given location, transportation resources, density of rail networks and the proximity of industrial output actually have more to do with the effectiveness of the trench lines as the war progressed, but the real culprit had to do with a key component of pre-war planning. No one brought enough ammo to the fight in the first few months of the war. They tried, of course, to plan for the output of shells, the numbers of rounds they expected to fire, how many rail cars of resupply and even the wagon loads of ammunition necessary to fight a mobile war. All meticulously counted, stockpiled and ready for the first couple of weeks of a short war. But even the most outstanding forecasts of necessary ammo fell well short of what was actually needed. And when the war took much, much longer than expected, the disparity between the war they expected and the war they were having to fight widened considerably. All those marvelous, modern field artillery guns? Absolutely perfect for a mobile fight, but practically useless if the enemy began to dig in, and both sides did once their shell shortages became evident. By the time new shells (and newer, larger caliber guns) were available? Those early trenches had improved well beyond any pre-war positions, and added a second and sometimes third and fourth sets of trenches behind them, all while ALSO getting more and larger guns to shoot larger and heavier bombardments to counter any attacking force. Both sides had short transportation lines, heavy industrial support, ever widening rail networks to support huge armies in a relatively narrow length of trenches that were ever improving in both strength and depth. By 1916 at Verdun, a single German division\u2019s worth of artillery shells used in a single day\u2019s attack filled two full trainloads - of the 38 trains that delivered shells to the front in a 24 hour period, during just about every single day of six-month battle. This was matched by both the French at Verdun and the British at the Somme during relatively similar periods of the war. The shell amounts used grew in 1917 and even more in 1918. Nowhere else during the Great War did opposing nations have such ability to supply those types of numbers to fighting forces as they did between 1915 and 1918 on the Western Front. This is what is meant by an \u201cAttrition War\u201d - when the opposing sides are relegated to simply winning by superior production numbers - weapons, ammunition, people. When the numbers for one side began to fall? That\u2019s when those lines were penetrated and mobile warfare began again. First for the Germans in the Spring due to soldiers released from the East and then for the Allies in the Summer as the available German reserves were exhausted and the American numbers became available at the rate of 100,000 per month.

            "answer_text": "Somebody else has given a very good and detailed answer to this. I agree that your statement is true but I also think that it doesn\u2019t really tell the whole picture. a bit \u201cputting the cart in front of the horse\u201d. None of the initial combatants set out to fight a war based on trenches. neither did they expect a static war. However the extremely heavy casualties suffered by all sides during the opening stages of the war meant that by 4 months into the war both sides, on the western front, had started creating networks of trenches. European armies had not fully grasped the killing power of modern (1914) weapons. The should have paid more attention to the American civil war , where trenches started appearing in the later part of that war and worked out why. Western European miliary tactics and training had not taken into account the leap forward in weapons technology. Tactics used in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 were not going to work in 1914. although it didn\u2019t stop the French from dressing in the same colourful uniforms. the trenches led to the deadlock or \u201cstalemate\u201d as you call it and both sides raced to the coast\u201d to secure their flank. However it should be remembered that the German -Russian front did not end in trench warfare and remained fairly fluid. As the attacker had to leave their defensive position, it gave the defender an advantage. Much of WW1 on the western front was a case of developing tactics to overcome the trench defences. Artillery bcame the major weapon and as the war became more industrialised, the logicistal side became more and more important. The number of arillery shells fired by both sides was unbeleivable (and are still being dug up today, as many as 25% didn\u2019t explode).  In many respects WW1 on the western front was a war of arillery. Who had the biggest guns and the most shells. then came the machine gun and barbed wire. The poor bloody infantry had to suffer the lot. The British developed the tank to overcome the stalemate. Although it has to be remembered that this was a completely new thing and the technology was not exactly reliable and it took a while for them to work out how to use it.   And as we approach the end of October, I\u2019d like to finish with this image.  ",

By early 1916 everybody, again but the Brits, had mastered the breakthrough, that is punching through the enemy frontline into the rear area. The true problem was the break-out. The attacker needed to march troops across no-man\u2019s land and the enemy trench system faster than the defender could move troops lateral by train behind the front. Neither artillery nor airplanes could reliable suppress those reinforcements. That meant that the attacker would attack against a never ending stream of reinforcements arriving faster than his own reinforcements. A losing preposition. The Allies \u201csolved\u201d that in 1918 by attacking all along the front making the shifting of reinforcements impossible but they still never managed to breakout. The famous Hundred Days, for example, achieved a leisurely mile every day or two. You can crawl faster than that. The problem of the breakout was only solved by airpower that was able to pin and interdict troop movements behind the front. The famous accusations of war crimes against German pilots for strafing roads were exactly that: shutting down the enemies ability to move troops over those roads. ",

            "answer_text": "Jan Meyer wrote an excellent answer below and I'm only adding onto it. I likewise don't entirely agree with the proposition. If it summarized the state of strategy in the West succinctly then I would imagine it to be the same in the East, but it wasn't. The Eastern Front lacked the same capabilities in operations and logistics because of the huge landmass over which the front spread and the rough terrain over which to traverse an army or army's supplies. Fewer trains, fewer roads, but further distances to cover and more ground to hold. The defensive capabilities of the militaries that fought in the East were of course little different from their Western contemporaries, but the distances covered in campaigns like the Brusilov offensive were comparatively massive. Why? Because, unlike in the West, bringing up reinforcements (especially on the limited resources of the Russian and Austro-Hungarian powers for example) was exceedingly difficult. It's not to say there wasn't at least a minor advantage to defensive capabilities, and that offensive actions could be severely costing, but it wasn't what decided the war. ",

            "answer_text": "There were several reasons for the deadlock on the Western Front, of which the trench systems, and the firepower of well-sited machine guns is one of them, as well described by others. The main killer of men was artillery, and all successful operations were backed by a sufficiency of effective artillery. Once an enemy position was captured, it was extremely difficult to drag guns up across devastated ground using horse and manpower to get the guns into place to support further exploitation. This brings us onto the other main factor, which was the relative ease with which the defender could move reserves into position, against the relative difficulty of the attacker doing the same. The defender could rush reserves and equipment to railheads quickly, and any retreat would be along lines of communication towards a railhead. The attacker was attacking away from railheads, and getting reserves, supplies and particularly artillery up was much more difficult. Essentially, the defender could move troops to meet an attack quicker than the attacker could reinforce. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not agree with the statement at all. The stalemate was caused by modern weapons, specifically magazine repeating rifles, machine guns, barbed wire, and breach loading, quick firing artillery. Military tactics and strategy had not anticipated modern weapons and trenches were the only way for infantry to survive on the modern battlefield until the tactics and strategy caught up to the scientific advances. That took about four years of trial and error (and twenty million casualties). The trenches were a stop-gap while the technicalities of the new weapons and how to deal with them were worked out. ",

The trenches did favor the defender however, in the event of a major push by the attacker and the defenders where overwhelmed that was when the horror really took stage for, in the narrow trenches it was but all impossible to use rifle with bayonet. The soldier's both defender and attacker devised makeshift weapons for use in close quarters such as clubs wrapped with barbed wire, clubs with long nails driven through as though they were spikes Short spears, ball and chain. It may have been the early 20th century yet, due the carnage one might think it was the medi-evil period! ",
