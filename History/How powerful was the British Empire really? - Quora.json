            "answer_text": "The British Empire was immensely powerful and quasi-omnipotent in the way which it oversaw and administered colonies, dominions and protectorates, and in the way in which it saw itself. John Cabot laid the foundations for the British Empire (1497) in his journeys to the New World. Cabot successfully claimed Newfoundland for England, but when he returned Henry VIII was uninterested in maritime exploration, which made England a late-comer to the imperial game when it began to develop a maritime empire to compete with eminent nations such as Portugal, Spain and France. The War of the Spanish Succession (1700\u201314) proved the test of English and Scottish (British from 1707) military power against the might of Louis XIV\u2019s France. The Battle of Blenheim (1704) was England\u2019s greatest victory on the battlefield since Henry V\u2019s victory at Agincourt. It can be said that the British Empire, which had flourished from the early plantations in America, earned its baptism of fire at Blenheim. It proved, undoubtedly, that England and Scotland were militarily more successful than France or Spain. The Acts of Union (1707) and the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain solidified this point. Great Britain gained swathes of new territories from the conflict and returned others, a cycle which would be repeated almost endlessly until the Pax Britannica (1815\u20131914). The War of the Austrian Succession (1740\u20138) tested British mettle once again; despite Britain being involved in fairly minor splinter conflicts such as the War of Jenkins\u2019 Ear (1739\u201348) which eventually merged into the bigger conflict, it emerged from the war triumphant and more determined than ever to build a maritime empire, having also faced Jacobite insurrection in Scotland (1745), decisively crushed at the Battle of Culloden (1746). The Royal Navy had also, by this point, become the mainstay of British power as a direct challenge to Britain\u2019s competitors. The rapid expansion of British power owed much to the fact that Britain was richer than ever before: during Pitt\u2019s premiership \u00a31 million was earmarked for the navy and a further \u00a31 million for the army, sums which had previously been unheard of. This meant that Britain was able to direct funds and resources to far-flung corners of the globe while the other European powers were bogged down slogging it out on the Continent. Whig historians attributed this astounding success to the Glorious Revolution (1688\u20139) and the Williamite Wars, as well as to the guiding hand of providence. The island, they said, was blessed by God. Whether God actually was a Protestant gentlemen or simply went on holiday, we\u2019ll never know, but the true foundations of the empire were laid due to British grit and determination to become successful, vastly more so than any other nation. Nevertheless, the British Empire is not without its controversy. The administration of the empire ensured that those who benefitted were not the ordinary Britons who had suffered during the conflicts and the Industrial Revolution (c.1750\u20131840), but the rich elite. This has created, particularly in Scotland, hatred towards what people see as exclusively English subjugation. Despite Scotland benefiting from the empire, the story is similar: the merchants and the landed elite benefited the most, while the vast majority of the population lived in abject poverty. The empire also committed hundreds of atrocities during its zenith, from the expulsion of the Aborigines in Australia to the brutal enslavement of Africans in the slave trade. The East India Company (1600\u20131858), Britain\u2019s main trading company, profited immensely from the trafficking of slaves and the deindustrialisation of India. It is estimated that a cumulative 20 million people died under British rule in India. ",

            "answer_text": "From 1815 to the 1930s, the British Empire was the most powerful in the world. By the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the French Empire was humbled, the Spanish and Portuguese Empires were exhausted and Britain bought the Dutch empire. The Russian Empire continued to be economically backward and not a threat (except in Afghanistan). Militarily: British navy + British Indian army was a force to be reckoned with! England had been a proud sea-faring nation since Henry VIII put cannons on his warships (think Spanish Armarda, Admiral Nelson). Britain had unquestioned supremacy of the seas until the naval race with Germany (1906\u20131914). The British Indian army (200,000 regulars in 1880) grew out of the British East India Company, which was nationalised after the Indian Mutiny (1857). Over 1.1 million Indians served in WW1, let alone Britain\u2019s other colonial armies. Economically: very. Britain was the home of the Industrial Revolution. Also, the British free-market network of trade, investment and population proved a real winner. The UK (not including its empire) had the world\u2019s highest GDP until the US overtook it in about 1890. It\u2019s very tricky to get GDP figures for the colonies. Politically: not nearly as much as you might think. The British government under Queen Victoria were primarily concerned about ensuring trade routes to the colonies and were very happy to work within traditional political structures (e.g. India). When it did take an interest, it wasn\u2019t always successful. For example, Australia demanded an end to transportation and got it in 1867. On the other hand, when Britain did get politically involved it could get into a mess (e.g. in 1881 Egypt they got embroiled in an Islamicist war with the Mahdi). For this reason, the British government resisted huge pressure to take political control in Argentina after the Baring Crisis (1890). The balance of power started to change in the 1880s. Germany had united, France had recovered, Russia was starting to industrialise and the US threatened to limit UK trade with Latin America. Britain was nervous that other powers were a threat to its economic, military and political power. Even though 1947 marked the height of its territorial extent, the British Empire had lost all but the semblance of power. With the economic devastation of the war (mainly in debt to the US), Britain ceased to hold political sway or command the armies of her colonies. Her sun had set. ",
