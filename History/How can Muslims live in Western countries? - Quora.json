            "answer_text": "Thanks Parham for the A2A! I think that every Muslim in the Western countries have different ways of living, this varies for each individual as it depends on the way they were raised and their different experiences with their families and friends. I believe that family and friends have a huge influence on a person, because if your parents have raised you in a way that they expect you to be, it determines which friends you will choose, however this can go both ways because sometimes the child can be rebellious and go against their parents beliefs and become peer pressured to do something which their parents don\u2019t approve of. This used to happen to me ALOT! but Alhamdulilah I have come to this relisation that in the end you are pleasing your God, which will ultimately be shown in your parents satisfaction of you, rather than for your friends sake. Don\u2019t get me wrong, its actually good to have friends but you just have to know that you are putting yourself in the \u2018right\u2019 crowd rather than throwing yourself to the others who will misguide you from the straight path. Another factor that contributes to the way of living is being faced with discrimination based on your religion, Islam. I remember during the time that ISIS had emerged when me, my brother, my sister and my mum were crossing the traffic lights and there was this man and another man that looked half drunk, they yelled out of the window \u201cyou Muslim bastards!\u201d. I didnt even dare to look at them and just kept walking. I will share with you a little story\u2026 Being a Muslim in the Western country is not easy, you see different sorts of stuff that makes you sometimes be one of \u2018them\u2019 especially if you go to a public school. For instance, I remember when I was in year 6, we used to receive stickers on our chart and if we have finished the whole chart at the end of the year, we were invited by the school to a party disco. I was so happy that I actually completed the chart and I received the invitation and I remember that I ticked \u2018yes\u2019 that I was going to join but I had to get my parents signature for them to allow me to go. I handed the card to my mum, she read it and she looked at me in the eye and asked me, \u201cWhy did you tick yes? Who gave you the permission to let you tick it without letting me know?\u201d. Although it was just a school based disco party with no alcohol or major drama issues, I didn\u2019t know what to respond because I did not have the knowledge of what Muslims are supposed to react to these certain circumstances, so I did not reply to my mum. When she saw me not reply, she explained to me the expectations of how a good Muslim is supposed to behave and how I should represent myself to others. This clearly shows that if you don\u2019t have parents that are always behind you on every step you take, you certainly can go down the drain, trust me the things that you see in public spaces has gone beyond what the eye can see. You just need to be smart in the decisions you make and keep your faith in Allah (SWT) strong because the process of realising the peer pressure that you get pushed to do is seriously not worth it. P.s I am very sorry for the late response, I already had the answer written up from before but I just kept doubting myself of whether it\u2019s worth the share but anyways let me know if you like it :p ",

            "answer_text": "Muslims living in countries which have liberal definitions of 'right conduct', must develop a deep seated tolerance for those who do not believe or behave as some claim that the believers of the Koran are required to do. They must not believe that somehow they can create a parallel legal system 'for them' and at points of difference, required 'their law' be held rather than the law of the land. There are also a large number of 'cultural' items that may not be directly addressed in the Koran, or other religious statements of Truth, such as what apparel, covering, type of 'entertainment', etc. that may be available in the culture, and for which the 'observant' muslim may object. Such behavior as 'honor killing' or 'child bride', can not be done in current modern polycultural states. Toleration requires a certain type of intolerance to intolerance. Another element which really goes for all forms of immigration... is that whatever conflicts existed in the 'home country' or in the 'spiritual home country', those conflicts are left in those places, and not carried over into the new country. Muslims, as well as any immigrant group, need to develop the identification with the 'new home' country, to the same level and belief that it is 'their home', first and last. If they view themselves as forever 'strangers in a strange land', they will be treated as strangers, and usually for the worse. ",
