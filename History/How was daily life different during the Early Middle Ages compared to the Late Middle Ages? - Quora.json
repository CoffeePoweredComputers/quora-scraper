            "answer_text": "This would have varied somewhat by country. Germany for instance had avoided Roman domination and took a while to be drawn into the institutions (like the Church) that grew out of it. The Brits had Roman rule, but drove it out. Their own structures developed before the Norman invasion of 1066 which completely changed the whole country (not least because the rulers became Francophone). I know France best, so I\u2019ll stick to that. France at the start of the Middle Ages was a Celtic country which had been ruled by Romans for centuries and gone from Roman and Celtic gods to a budding Christianity. When the Franks took over, Germanic gods joined the surviving Roman and Celtic gods, and Church canons are full of complaints about people worshiping springs, dressing up as stags, etc. So especially in the country you had a rich mix of religious belief and practice., with the Church slowly imposing its rule. Feudalism had not yet taken hold, so many people still owned their plots of land or at least did not have to dispute their use of it with anyone else. Also, hunting was open to everyone, so most people could eat meat readily enough. Farming was extremely primitive and there were several major famines. Most medicine for most people was folk medicine; any trained doctors would have served the upper classes. Once the Franks took over most of France, a relative peace existed, though conflicts between kings and lords could cause a lot of collateral damage to civilians. The country in general was very Germanic in the north, but remained very Roman (Gallo-Roman) in the south. There was only Gaul, no \u201cFrance\u201d. People either talked some variety of German or a corrupt form of Latin, as well as any regional dialects. Different people in different regions were under different kings and sometimes even under different groups (Burgundians, Visigoths, etc.) While some trade existed with other countries and even the East, in general local economies were dominant and few people were aware of much beyond their immediate region. Cities were in decline, but still active (often ruled in practice by bishops) and some traces of Roman infrastructure survived. There is no evidence of any trades groups or particular organization of artisans. Bread was generally just bread, distinguished by the grain - wheat, barley, rye or even oats - used. By the end of the Middle Ages, most people lived under one king in a place called \u201cFrance\u201d. French was an established language, even if regional dialects would dominate in places like Brittany and even Provence for a very long time. Only the educated now knew Latin. Farming had become far more efficient, far more land had been cleared, and the windmill, the horse collar and crop rotation all brought great advances in agricultural productivity. But the feudal structure had also become universal and arguably oppressive. Hunting had, for the most part, become a noble privilege, making a ready source of meat unavailable to many people. A very large part of the population worked the land to support either lords or monasteries. The Church was absolutely dominant and everybody was now obliged to observe a variety of fast days. In general, people lived a Catholic rhythm of mass, festivals, fasting, etc. For a time France was subject to Viking raids which caused great insecurity, though that was resolved by the end of the period. Cities were strongly revived by the end of the Middle Ages and the various trades groups had great power in terms of different trades. This had the advantage of regulating and controlling the quality of production, but also limited what people could do. Arguably, a healthy organization of artisans also helped the growth of the middle class, which existed in the form of the better off traders and artisans. At this point too the Crusades had brought a wealth of new influences to France, most of which affected the wealthy more directly, but some of which spread to other groups. Spices had always been available, but now some, like cinnamon, became more common. Verjuice, based on a Persian ag-gooreh, became a standard condiment. Ways of processing fish made herring, especially, widely and cheaply available. This is one reason fish became so closely associated with fast days (no such association existed at the start of the Middle Ages). International trade was far more active and a source of prosperity for many. Far more buildings were now made of stone. Castles were much stronger and sources of security for those who lived or could take refuge in them. By far the most common bread now was wheat bread, or, in the country, maslin (a mix of wheat and barley or rye). Different grades of wheat bread - light, darker, dark - now existed in most cities. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m afraid that this question, as asked, is unanswerable in a meaningful way. Life anywhere in any part of the Middle Ages, which is a vast period\u2014depending on where you like to draw your lines, covering late antiquity, roughly 400 AD or 476 AD (the fall of the Western empire) to 800 (the Coronation of Charlemagne), the early Middle ages, 800 to 1100 or so, and the high Middle Ages, 1100 to (depending on where you are in Europe) anywhere from the 1330s to the mid 15th century\u2014would depend on where you were. It also would depend when in either period you would be. Late antiquity and the early Middle Ages are often lumped together for a period of as much as 600 years, and conditions around the fall of the Western Empire would be different than in, say, the Ottonian period. For the high Middle Ages, conditions in 1200 would be quite different from the conditions in the late 1340s, during the Black Death. Generalizations are always dangerous, and the only way to answer this question without writing a library would to be to resort to generalizations which would be meaningless outside pf specific places and times.
