            "answer_text": "Disclaimer: I am going to be using pretty vulgar language in this answer. The reason why is because the pure awesomeness of this sword can\u2019t be contained in a PG way. Let\u2019s set up a scenario. You are a Roman Legionnaire patrolling Hadrian\u2019s Wall circa 130 AD. It is a peaceful day, not a cloud in sight. You look upon the vast forests spanning miles ahead of you. A terrifying sight, sure, but you find calm in the knowledge that no barbarian would dare challenge the might of the Roman Legion. Your captain decides to send you and a few of your mates to scout out the woods ahead, just as a precaution before calling it a day. You go into the woods. They are dense, dark. A sense of uneasiness overcomes you and your troop. When you are just about to wrap it up and call it a day, you hear an unholy sound that stands up the hairs on your neck. It\u2019s a Celtic War Horn. You turn around to see this running towards you:  You prepare for a fight and\u2026wait\u2026is that guy holding a sword with two hands? You smirk thinking he doesn\u2019t know jack about fighting, and that this is probably a group of village idiots trying to prove their worth. Then that same guy proceeds to mow down your whole troop with a few swings of his massive sword, handling it as if it was light as a feather. Then you die from the sheer awesomeness that you just witnessed. The sword in question is indeed the Claymore. WAIT! Hear me out. I know that the first Claymores started appearing in the 12th century. However, there is proof to suggest that the ancient Caledonians used, although rarely, similar weapons. With that out of the way, let\u2019s start with why I think this is the best sword of the ancient times. First of all, just look at it.  I haven\u2019t checked the specifications of the sword, but this baby is probably 1.5m large. This sword had two things going for it: Range and Force. Range It is a well-established fact of combat that if you can kill the other guy before he manages to get close enough to ruin your day, it is generally considered a win. The Claymore? It\u2019s the Sarissa of swords. This mean looking sword is the ancient version of flipping a middle finger and saying \u201cFuck off\u201d to anyone stupid enough to cross your path. Why, you ask? It takes less time to swing a 6 pound sword than to take two steps to even get close enough to be a threat with a short sword. And even then, someone who has a Claymore will just take an equal number of steps back and keep swinging until there is nothing left but bits and pieces of a once very brave and stupid person. Range is power in combat. And Claymore has it when it comes to swords. Force Just look at this beast. If you think that after a swing of that you will still be prancing around with your body intact, you are gravely mistaken. See, while the Roman Legionnaires did wear armor, and a strong one at that, auxiliaries didn\u2019t. Even in medieval times, armies consisted mostly of levies that would be better off wearing that sweater your grandma made you for Christmas. And having a Claymore would be like you brought a fucking M134 Minigun to a pillow fight. You are utilizing the power of 2 hands and a 6 pound sword. Not even armor is a problem if you know how to properly execute puncture attacks. Bonus: Fear factor In the medieval times, seeing Scottish Gallowglasses on the horizon meant one thing for you and your army: you\u2019re about get fucking decimated. Especially if you are a peasant/levy. I reckon there was nothing more pants-shittingly terrifying than seeing a 2m tall Scottish guy in full chainmail armor and a 1.5m large sword perched on his shoulder with all the motivation in the world to make you shorter for a head. And this was probably true in the ancient times. Information is scarce, but seriously, I think the reaction was the same for Romans as it was when they first saw War Elephants. They were most likely terrified. ",

            "answer_text": "Right- boring sword-based martial arts answer- Best for *what*? If we\u2019re talking pre-medieval history (which \u201cancient\u201d would suggest) we\u2019re largely considering weapons such as the gladius, the falcatta, the xiphos and other contemporary blades. And the simple answer is that there are too many factors to consider to choose the \u201cbest\u201d sword universally- you would need to consider who you\u2019re fighting, your build, your armour, your shield (or lack thereof), the conditions under which you\u2019re fighting, and what your primary concern is. For instance- for a well-armoured man on foot, using a large shield and fighting in formation, the gladius is an excellent choice- hence why the gladius developed for a culture fighting under those conditions (though to be more honest they adopted it, and the fighting model, from surrounding cultures). For fighting in a loose formation wearing little to no body armour, this sword is significantly less effective- especially if your opponents are using blades with a longer reach and significantly better cutting capacity. If I had to express a personal preference I would choose a falcatta, simply because it has a mix of overall utility and similarity to weapons I am already quite familiar with. Ultimately the best weapon choice is the one you\u2019re the most familiar with- and suits your other equipment. ",
