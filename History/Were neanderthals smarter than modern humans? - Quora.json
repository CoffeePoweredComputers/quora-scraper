            "answer_text": "No. They were certainly smart\u2026that is clear, just not as smart as sapiens. Basically, the average total brain size was larger for Neanderthals, but, skull scans, etc, found that the extra brain was dedicated to processing scent and visual information, and, motor control\u2026 \u2026 and that the areas dedicated to processing abstract thought, reasoning, speech, language, social skills, etc\u2026 what we consider intelligence typically, were smaller than ours. Additionally, the blood supply and infrastructure for the areas they had smaller areas for processing, were also less developed, so, even if the same size, they would not have worked as well, and so forth. Generally, as they evolved from early erectus, and we evolved from late erectus, we had the benefits of a head start, as well as being generalists. They were highly adapted to the forests of Europe, and close quarter grappling with big game. Isotope studies indicate their diet was almost entirely big game, over 90%. As Europe was changing, they were no longer adapted, and, by the time waves of sapiens were passing through, the Neanderthals were almost extinct. So, we know they had fire, religion, art, jewelry, sophisticated stone weapons and tools, but, no projectile weapons, clothing, but, no sewing (Denisovans had sewing, Neanderthals did not, they used ties to hold clothing on)\u2026 had smaller social structures, and, as a tendency, did not tend to innovate often, historically using the same tool/weapon designs for hundreds of thousands of years. One tool they invented though was the lissoir. Sapiens adapted the lissoir, and even uses it to this day. So, based upon the smaller, less developed abilities for processing abstract thought and reasoning, social skills, speech and language\u2026 and the tendency to \u201cstick with what works\u201d over change\u2026 even if changes would make what they did, better suited when conditions change\u2026 they went extinct instead. Genetically, we simply absorbed them. As sapiens/neanderthals could not successfully interbreed so as to create a hybrid species, due to excessive genetic drift\u2026 \u2026 we were analogous to a horse and a donkey\u2026 closely related, able to have offspring, but the male offspring, for example, were sickly and sterile, due to the genetic drift on the Y chromosome. The viable females though were then generationally diluted out of existence.  So, if you dressed a Neanderthal in modern clothes, cleaned him up with a nice haircut, etc\u2026he would pass for a weird looking person if he passed you on the street. Basically, they had enormous noses, giant brow ridges, sloped foreheads, receding chins, a lot of skull out behind the ears, and rather giant heads, considering they were about the height of Rick Moranis or so\u2026albeit a buff Rick Moranis. You would definetely consider him a human though. :D If you went to school with him, he\u2019d be a bit slow on the uptake, miss social cues, and have trouble with learning certain topics, but, not all topics, not be able to throw overhand well, but, on average, be able to do push ups/bench press like a champ\u2026and be a good sprinter. (They had evolved a different shoulder construction that limited overhand throwing motions, but optimized forward thrusting motions, such as spear stabs, etc.) All three groups that evolved from erectus that were specialized in persistence hunting techniques, as erectus was, but, the Neanderthals had, in practice, swapped to ambush hunting, due to the forest environment, so, instead of a long chase, they would drive game into ambushes, and then, rush in and kill it at close range with hand held spears. Denisovans and sapiens tended to just chase the game until it was exhausted, and, kill it at a distance with projectile weapons, including thrown spears, etc. (They would also drive it off cliffs/into ambushes too, but, on the savannah, cover was not as plentiful) So, hopefully, that provides some perspective about what our cousins were like. :D ",

            "answer_text": "I am intrigued by this question, because it sounds as if it should be impossible to answer, yet we have so many fresh lines of evidence to follow, as to suggest a definitive answer will come soon. First the basics\u2026 All animals can be excepted to have their own cognitive strengths and weaknesses. It seems counter intuitive that a useful one dimensional score could ever be extracted from the vast set of all potential cognitive abilities to enable such a comparison, but that is exactly what IQ scores are. Even stranger, the same concept that underpins IQ, has also been demonstrated to work over the whole primate order (see The evolution of primate general and cultural intelligence). Another major finding from comparative meta-analyses, is that most of the cognitive variance between primate species can be explained by just two factors: brain size, and dietary breadth. No significant correlation between group size and intelligence has ever been found. As we will see, this will be of use to us later. Anyhow, if we ever de-extinct Neanderthals, the OP\u2019s question should be soluble, yet science is advancing so quickly that we could find the answer less directly. That possibility is bolstered by several findings and near future possibilities, many of which I will outline below. Behavioural Evidence First there is behavioural data, such as sophistication of tool manufacture, and use of body decoration. This sort of evidence has been used for a long time, but, until recently, it contained a flaw. The comparison needs to be contemporary versus contemporary. For a long time it looked as if the Cro-Magnons (our ancestors) were significantly more advanced than them during a long period where they lived side-by-side. However, carbon dates in the relevant range are susceptible to distortion by the intrusion of traces of new carbon into old deposits. This bias has been eliminated by new techniques (see New Carbon Dating Suggests Neanderthals and Early Humans Didn\u2019t Mingle Much). After better measures, we are now certain that the overlap of the two species was brief in Europe, and it is very hard to tell which was the more advanced species during that window (see Neanderthals were not less intelligent than modern humans, scientists find). Not all new evidence is in favour of the intellectual parity of the two species. There are also hints that Neanderthals could have been far smarter than us. Below are two examples of such evidence. Neanderthals Defy Stereotypes \u2014 NOVA | PBS and Evidence Neanderthals made boats long before modern humans There are two other behavioural factors, of a more general nature, that also may prove important. Some traits have been postulated to be of significance in building primate intelligence over time. The greatest two of these are group size and dietary breadth. Both archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that Neanderthals moved in much smaller groups than Cro-Magnons. This indicates they were less social, and the Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis places the major evolutionary pressure for higher intelligence as coming from such group interactions. If that were so, we should have a large advantage, but current data does not back the use of group size beyond application to social skills. On the other hand, the effect of dietary breadth is well attested. As it turns out, we have an advantage there too. Both species are known to eat a wide variety of plants and animals, but the neanderthal diet is more specialist, being >90% meat. Cro-Magnon diet was around three quarters plant.  Physiological Evidence Then there is also physiological evidence. Their brains are significantly larger than ours, though published figures as to how much vary widely. This is partly because so few complete, or almost complete, neanderthal skulls have been found, and they differ significantly from each other. Their brain endocasts seem to be about three standard deviations larger than those of modern humans, and since IQ in humans correlates about a third with brain size, if we knew nothing else about Neanderthals other than this, our best guess would be a Neanderthal advantage of circa+15 IQ points. An old idea is that these figures would have to be adjusted for body size, but doing so for primates has been shown to produce very poor results. The Encephalisation Quotient only explains 14% of all cross-species variance, whereas unadjust brain size explains a massive 65% of it (see Overall brain size and not encephalization quotient best predicts cognitive ability across non-human primates).  Recently this evidence was joined by that of cranial blood flow. The brains of some primates are more tightly packed with neurons than others, and require proportionately more energy per unit volume. This time, the advantage goes to our species by almost 20% (see Fossil skulls reveal that blood flow rate to the brain increased faster than brain volume during human evolution). This would imply that we are the smarter, and since this might be expected to have an even more direct connection to intelligence the magnitude of it would translate to the order of -25 IQ points. An alternative reason for this low neanderthal blood flow is their proportionately smaller cerebellum, where most mammalian neurons are housed. The difference in this between our species is so extreme that it is still quite possible that their cerebral cortex might be more densely packed and \u2018hungrier\u2019 than ours. Many have postulated that the cerebral cortex is the true seat of cognisance, and since we can only measure the combined blood-flow to all brain areas, this evidence may prove misleading. To investigate further we must look to genetic evidence.  Genetic Evidence Even in the absence of any understanding of how neanderthal or modern human genes work we could still gather evidence, by looking at variation within any one ethnic group of modern humans, as long as the individuals within the sample have known proportions of Neanderthal DNA. In the better studied populations of Europeans and East Asians the Neanderthal proportion can vary in any one individual from 0%, to an unlikely theoretical maximum of circa 20% (see At least 20% of Neanderthal DNA is in Humans). If IQ shows a consistent trend within each group, (ie. average IQ scores trend in the same direction to the same degree as neanderthal DNA proportion of individual genomes increases within all ethnic groups), then we might still gain a clear idea of which species was the smarter. However, it looks as if we will be able to use much more direct evidence than that. Until recently, the only gene or domain that we knew to be highly correlated to IQ scores was DUF1220. Not only does the copy number of this gene domain correlate with human IQ scores, but it has also been shown to have a very high correlation coefficient when matched to the cognitive skills of non-human primates. Neanderthals have 350 copies of it, whereas we average only 278. If we judge from non-human primates, we should estimate a neanderthal advantage of around +15 IQ points, but if we judge them as humans it gets trickier. If we take Neanderthals as humans then the CON2 subtype of DUF1220 is far more predictive than CON1 (see DUF1220 copy number is linearly associated with increased cognitive function as measured by total IQ and mathematical aptitude scores). Unfortunately, our current Neanderthal genome data is not of sufficient quality to differentiate the two, but assuming they have the same ratio of the two to modern humans, then we may expect they have a +25 IQ point advantage. Late in 2015, came a far more comprehensive picture of how human genes relate to intelligence in normal healthy subjects. (see Intelligence genes discovered by scientists.) These findings have yet to be applied to Neanderthals but, when they are, you can expect a more confident estimate than any of the back-of-the-envelope figures given above. One way or another, science should find the answer soon. 2018 Update As of early 2018, the evidence looks to have moved in favour of a Neanderthals advantage.  Grasp of the Abstract The above figures were created repeatedly in European caves of the Paleolithic. Those abstract images are now known to have a minimum age that originates them at least 25,000 years before any modern humans entered Europe. ( for a commentary on this finding see Neanderthals \u2013 not modern humans \u2013 were first artists on Earth, experts claim ). However, to me, there is also considerable non-dating supporting evidence that these are all Neanderthal signs. Let me outline below the many other clues that this attribution is correct. Several of these symbols spanned the entire continent, sometimes appearing half a kilometer below ground. It was an ideological precursor to writing, yet it would have to have been a skill we completely forget for tens of thousands of years. The above 32 types of character were found across Europe at a time when mobility was low, so, to explain their distribution, these must have been conserved and passed down the generations for thousands, or even tens of thousands, of years. These symbols, and presumably their meaning, remained constant over a longer period than is typical for any human culture know to me. Such impetus for change can be seen, even in that era, in our stone age tool kits. By contrast the Mousterian tool kits of the Neanderthal showed greater stability, notwithstanding that they seemed harder to make than any produced by their Cro-Magnon contemporaries. It was as if Neanderthals were more resistant to the trends of fashion, only altering their ways when innovation provided advantage. Such Neanderthal-like stability is needed to explain that phenomenon. Another clue as to their creators comes from those 'positive hand' and 'negative hand' elements. For more than a hundred years something very odd had been noticed about the above hand stencils: their missing fingers. Missing fingers is, however, common among chimpanzees. This propensity to bite off another's digits is so ingrained in their nature, that it makes sense to place their fingers in another chimps mouth as a sign of reconciliation after a fight. To them it proves trust. Genetically speaking, modern humans are only just outside the chimp genus, yet, to us, biting off another's finger doesn't make the same natural connection to aggression as, say, punching does. By contrast, Neanderthals used their mouths in a greater variety of ways than we did. Such use is often described as vice-like, or like a third hand. Childhood Another piece in the puzzle is that Neanderthal childhood was most likely significantly longer than ours. This evidence comes from a study of the growth pattern of Neanderthals, reconstructed from a juvenile skeleton , published in Science. The longer the period, the greater the need for complex learning in order for evolution to favour this extended time of relative helplessness. For further explanation, I refer you to a popular commentary on the great importance of those differences called Childhood Made Humans Invincible - as it was written at a time when we were thought to have the longer childhood.
