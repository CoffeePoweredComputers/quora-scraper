            "answer_text": "Because Wars cost good money, and there isn\u2019t that much oil or gas south of the Rio Grande to pay for it. Bad joke, I know. The last time the US invaded land beyond its borders it had different results at different times.. When it invaded what is now Canada in 1812 the Redcoats repelled the Yankee invasion, and in return went into US territory, all the way down to Washington DC, setup the White House and Capitol building ablaze, along with many toowns along the way, in retaliation for the same from American forces in the current Canadian territory. When the US went to war with Mexico in 1846, it has a complete and decisive victory. It went in a matter of weeks as far south as Mexico City, 2000 miles south of the Texas border. It also occuppied and cut off the main porta on the country: Acapulco on the Pacific Coast and Veracruz in the Gulf of Mexico. It dealt a complete and devastating defeat to the Mexican defenders. Why didn't the United States want to keep most of the territory south of the Rio Grande? It had won the war in less than six months. It has absolute control of the country. It could have easily annexed it entirely. Quite simply, the US leadership at the time ( and most Americans) wanted expension territory to the West and access to the Pacific. With sparsely populated holdings from California thru the Texas western Frontier, it was a tempting target for colonizing and pulling the kind of stunt that Russia pulled on Ukraine with Crimea in the 2010\u2019s. What the US leadership didn't want with Mexican territories is the same reason they don\u2019t really want Puerto Rico as a state. You have puertoricans on it. Same story with M\u00e9xico. They want the land. They didn\u2019t want the Mexicans that came with it. So they kept everything nort of the Rio Grande. American invades kicked and dragged a good deal of descendants of Spanish and Mexican settlers. They conducted harrasment and sometimes out right stole the land from their rightful owners (although the same land may WAS taken away from Native Americans by the Spanish and Mexican Empires, and later the Mexican Rep\u00fablica, which was also criminal). But coming back to the XXI century. Why doesn't the US invade Mexico and just get it over with? The US has a labor forced of about 11 million undocumented immigrants. They work for 1/2 of the US minimum wage, usually pay into social security about 13 billion dollars a year, but dont get any benefits whatsoever. This why Immigration reform aint happening. Its a sweet deal for the Americans who employ undocumented, cheap and disposable workforce. Why mess a good thing?If you go into more populated areas of Mexico, down further south, three usually is more poverty. About 50 million Mexicans live at or below the poverty line. Once you become the landlord you are tasked with the problems with the tenants. The US can\u2019t even take care of 3 million Puerto Ricans, American citizens all of them. How is it going to take care of 126 million Mexicans?As you can attest from other ventures in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Irak, bombing the bejeezus and reducing a country to rubble is the easy part. The hard part become when you are perceived to be invaders. Then the problems start. Trying to manage an occupied territory is a nightmare in the best possible scenario. Think how little time and money it would take for an armed resistance movement to take shape. Read about France, the UK, Netherlands or any European colonial power to get an idea how that would go.Despite being the 13th largest economy in the world the Mexican economic and political system is riddled with social and cultural paradoxes to drive most Americans insane. Ask any former US embassador to Mexico. Ask any American that has lived in Mexico for more than 1 year. Yet, the country goes on. Once you invade a country, like the US did with Irak, the Collin Powell rule applies. \u201cYou break it, you own it.\u201d To call the Irak operation a fiasco would be the understatement of the milennia. Think how that would go over in Mexico.Lastly. You have a President, Secretary of State and Defense Minister, that don't even know there are more countries to the south of Mexico. How can you invade something that you can\u2019t even point to in a map, let alone name the place (I\u2019m looking at you, Mike Pompeo, Mike Pence and Mark Esper).",
