            "answer_text": "If the question is about genetics, Romanians are probably neither Latin nor Slavic. There were indigenous tribes in the region for many years before the Romans came, and their population was quite high, according to ancient historians. Some classical sources say they were red haired and blue eyed (highly unlikely, since these are recessive traits) whereas recent tests on fossils found that they were related in appearance to Mediterranean people (Italians and Greeks). Those Indo-European people were called Thracians, but there were many sub-groups (the ones in Romania\u2019s territory were called Dacians or Getae). There were also Iranian tribes (Sarmatii or Sarmatians) and other types of people in the region. Without going into too much detail, even back then there was quite some genetic and cultural diversity. Today there is somewhat of genetic kinship in the Balkans as well as through the Carpathian mountain range, which strengthens the theory about the important Thracian cultural and genetic substrate in the region. The Roman legions who colonized part of what is today Romania came from all over the Roman Empire, and it is attested that they were quite diverse ethnically - although culturally Roman. Many Slavs settled and intermarried with the inhabitants of Romania as well, but were not dominant enough to impose their language or institutions - except to a certain degree. There were so many foreign forays into what is today Romania (Mongol, Turkic, Polish, etc.) and presumably they all left their genetic mark on the region\u2019s population. In more recent centuries, there were mass immigration movements, such as Armenians fleeing Turkish reprisals, Jews fleeing Russian persecution, Russians fleeing anti-Christian persecution, and so on. It\u2019s impossible for them to have kept their genes separate from the rest of the population in the ages before easy access to contraception. Having said that, Romanians are genetically closest to their Balkan neighbors - the people living in the ancient lands of those indigenous Indo-European Thracian tribes I mentioned in the beginning.

            "answer_text": "The short answer is the ethnicity of Romanians is just that, Romanian and the names Latin and Slavic do not denote ethnicities, but language groups and to some extent cultural heritages. Linguistically, Romanians are Latin with Slavic influences and culturally they are unique, but do share similarities with other Latins as well as with their South Slavic neighbors. The \u201cethnic\u201d kinship the asker is looking for may be investigated genetically but the answer will not support a Latin vs Slavic division either.  The longer answer: Ethnicity Ethnicity is a social construct, based on common language, culture, homeland and ancestry.Historically, human individuals are socially organized in ascending order: family, clan, tribe, people, nation, supranational union.Ethnic groups can therefore be contained by a tribe, or a people. A clan may not be enough, while a nation implies more, such as a complex government and politics, legislature, judicial system, a state and one or more ethnic groups.Romanians all share the same language, Romanian, the same culture, the same geographical area as a homeland and common ancestry through intermarriages.Linguistically, the Romanian language is a Latin language with a Slavic influence and a pre-Roman substrate, similar to how French is a Latin language with a Germanic influence and a Celtic substrate. As with French, the linguistic adstrate has not been influent enough to change the language, and Romanian belongs to the Latin language family along with French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and others.Culturally, the Romanian civilization as a whole is unique, with traits descended from the ancient pre-Roman culture (customs, folklore), from the Romans (law, customs, administration, early Christianity), and traits in common with the Greeks, Albanians and South Slavs, especially as far as institutionalized religion and (historically) administration was concerned. This set forms a historical core.Then, to a lesser extent, the Romanian culture historically has traits in common with the Hungarians, Germans and Austrians, West and East Slavs and Turks and even less so with the Roma people (Gipsies), Ashkenazi Jews, Tatars and Armenians.And lastly from Modern times, there is a massive influence from the French, Italian and the German cultures, and to a lesser extent from Russian (Soviet) culture, the Anglo-American culture and the whole of Europe as the World becomes increasingly globalized.Homeland: The Romanians are a people who have created a nation in the XVIIIth and XIXth centuries, and of which most are citizens of a state, Romania, created in 1859, finalized in 1918 and currently separated from one of its territories, Basarabia, since 1944.There are Romanians living outside the borders of the Romanian state, such as in Moldova, Ukraine, Hungary, the Balkans or in diasporas farther away from the homeland, yet, as long as they share the common traits listed above, they are part of the same ethnicity and nation.Geographically and historically, the current Romanian homeland has been part of the Roman empire, namely under the provinces of Dacia and Moesia Inferior for the present-day Romanian state itself, as well as Moesia Superior, Macedonia and Dalmatia, and to a lesser extent Thracia, Epirus and Achaia for the Balkan Romanians. Since the Middle Ages and until present day, a significant part of the Balkan Romanians have lived more or less in the proximity of the current state of Romania, within South Slavic states, namely Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia but also West and East Slavic states, such as Czechia, Ukraine/Russia and Poland.AncestryWhile language, culture and homeland are easily verifiable, ancestry is less so, as it relies on genealogy and history, and more recently genetics.Genealogically (historically), the Romanian people today are the descendants of an ancient civilization (which included tribes of various origins, mainly Thraco-Daco-Illyrian, but also Iranic, Celtic, Germanic and Hellenic, all coagulated around the Thraco-Daco-Illyrian core) which was romanized beginning as early as 146 BC in Macedonia and as late as 106 AD in Dacia. The romanization was culturally and linguistically unitary, while ethnically diverse, with people from various origins within the Roman Empire. Upon the initial ethnogenesis, Romanians came into contact with various other ethnicities, Germanic, Turanic, Slavic, Turkic, Greek. From those, the Slavic element was the most numerous and the most compatible, yet still small enough to be completely absorbed into the Romanian ethnicity. This is not different from most of the other Romance speaking cultures of Europe, which are ethnically distinct. Similarly, most Slavic-speaking cultures belong to ethnically distinct peoples nowadays. The South Slavs especially, since they share similarities with Romanians, are ethnically the descendants of multiple entities, such as in the case of Bulgarians - Turkic Bulgars conquered Slavs who had in turn conquered Romanized-Thracians and all mixed together to create the distinct modern ethnicity of Bulgarians.Humanity currently encompasses only the Homo Sapiens species, the Sapiens subspecies. There are no other extant species of the Homo genus and the appearance of any new ones within a meaningful interval of time so as to influence the history of this humanity from now on is unlikely.However, as time goes by and our world grows ever denser and more connected, the human genetical makeup keeps evolving.The current human population all around the world is the result of multiple waves of the same subspecies (Homo Sapiens Sapiens) leaving their original cradle, in Africa, and spreading around the world, stopping along the way and dividing in further groups, which kept going their separate ways and kept dividing further. This process ensured the world was conquered step by step by small groups of slightly genetically distinct members of the same subspecies. Each time a group halted in a place and lived there for a long period of time (thousands of years) their genetic material mutated for a number of reasons, some of which were in order to adapt to their surroundings - the amount of time necessary for a mutation to occur is known approximately.To a lesser extent, a few other subspecies, now extinct, have contributed to our subspecies\u2019 gene pool.These slight genetic differences, the complexity of which we have yet to fully grasp, are the basis of present day human ethnogenetics, which deals with the adaptive structure of the gene pool of mankind based on human polymorphic genetic markers data - aka genes or DNA sequences on chromosomes which can be used to identify common traits in people. Thus by studying the DNA of as many people as possible in the World today, especially those that have stayed in the same place for many generations, we can map out the human paths as they came out of Africa in waves and expanded across the Earth. We take into account geography, known history and genetic differences, and the larger the differences between the genetic material of two random individuals, the farther back in time the separation between their ancestors into two groups, and the longer the two groups spent apart from each other.The main genetic markers in question are auDNA, mtDNA and Y-DNA.The Y-DNA genetic markers denote the Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups. A haplogroup is a collection of Y-chromosome inherited materials which all share a common ancestor with a single-nucleotide polymorphism mutation. What does this mean? The sexual Y-chromosome is transmitted only patrilineally - inherited only from the father - and only to boys. This means, when comparing this particular genetic material collected from two different male individuals, we can identify approximately how long ago they had a common ancestor and how many mutations have occurred on either of their lines in order to create these two individuals\u2019 genetic material. Based on these differences, scientists have divided the Earth\u2019s human male population in over 20 haplogroups, from A to R. In theory, when the majority native male populations of a certain territory have sufficiently similar genetic material that they are attributable to the same haplogroup, it can be concluded that they formed a unitary population and the approximate time when they broke away from their closest ancestors, as depicted below. Figure 1 - World Map of Y-DNA Haplogroups, Wikipedia In reality, when we look more closely, we realize that the \u201cmajority\u201d designates a small segment of the population, and that in many cases, at least four or five haplogroups are almost equally well represented within said population, as can be seen below in the Y-DNA Haplogroups Map of Europe from Wikipedia. In Romania\u2019s case, the following haplogroups are significantly represented in this study which has been deemed sufficiently extensive as to generalize for each country: I2a=20%=found most dominant in ex-Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, R1a=20%=most dominant in East and West Slavic countries, E1b1b1a1=19%=most dominant in South Italy and the South Balkans, J2=16%=most dominant in South Italy, the South Balkans and Turkey, R1b=10%=most dominant in South and Central Western Europe, I1=6%=most dominant in Scandinavia.Other studies yield somewhat similar numbers, such as I2a=22.2%, R1a=20.4%, E1b1a1=7.4%, J2=5.6%, R1b=13%, G=5.6% from khazaria.com andI2a=28%, R1a=18%, E1b1b=14%, J2=13.5%, R1b=15.5%, G=3%, I1=3.5%, I2b=2.5%, J*/J1=1%, T=1%, Q=0.5%, N=1.5% from Eupedia.The main haplogroups I2a and R1a are sufficiently similar, but the others vary considerably, which is probably due to the sample of individuals tested and the statistical generalizations made. One thought stands out, Romania is most similar genetically on the male line to its neighbors to the South and West. Figure 2 - Y-DNA haplogroup map of Europe, Wikipedia Another study has established the following, which interestingly enough would indicate a genetic difference similar to the ancient borders of the Roman province of Dacia, with R1b dominant in Transylvania, Banat and parts of Oltenia, overlapping the Roman colonized area, while the rest of the country is dominated by I2a, the haplogroup common to the Balkans area where the Thracians, Dacians and Illyrians thrived. This is a bit counterintuitive though, since one would expect Roman colonized areas south of the Danube to be at least as dominant in R1b as Dacia, since they were colonized for much longer. Figure 3 - Map of Dominant Y-DNA Haplogroups in Europe, Wikipedia  Figure 4 - Roman Empire at its Height, Wikipedia The most conclusive aspect of this genetic investigation is that the Roman and Slavic cultures didn\u2019t leave a clear genetic mark, which, due to further studies is explained by earlier and more significant genetic mixings which by the time of the Roman empire and then the Slavic migrations caused European populations to already be very mixed.

            "answer_text": "Neither. Much more. Romanians are one of the most diverse population in Europe. Conform Kurgan hypothesis, Indo-Europeans migrated in all directions from the Caucasus north region, especially between 4000 BC to 1000 BC. Two main directions were West, towards European continent and East, towards India of today:  The Western branch reached and settled in Central Europe, Carpathian basin and Balkans, by 2500 BC and in West Europe, by 1000 BC. Now, Romania seems to be inhabited by Caucasians, speaking an Indo-European language, since at least 2500 BC (4500 years ago). Being at a cross-roads between East European steppes (Ukraine), Pontic area (Turkey and Balkans) , Baltics (Poland, Lithuania) and West Europe (Germany. Austria), Romanian territory of today was a migration hub and melting pot of all Caucasians moving back and forth for around 3000 years (between 4000 BC and 1000 BC). If you look at the genetic map of Y-DNA (males, who travelled most) you may find all main European genes of today populations in Europe. Caucasians brought three main genetic groups to Europe: R1a, R1b and J2. West Europeans have as main gene R1b, Celtic. They are the Western branch of Indo-Europeans (Caucasians). Romanians have similar (15\u201320%) R1b genes proportion to Scandinavians and Central Europeans (Sweden, West Poland, Austria, Czech, Hungary and Balkans):  East Europeans have more R1a, from the ancient Slavic people. Romanians have similar proportion (15\u201320%) of R1a genes as other Balkan, German and Scandinavian people:  A very old marker in smaller proportion (8\u201315%) in Romanian population is the J2 Y-Dna marker, present again in similar numbers in: Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, part of Sweden, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria. One fourth of the Vlach people (isolated communities of Romance language speakers in the Balkans) belong to J2, considerably more than the average of Macedonia and northern Greece where they live. Quite a few ancient Mediterranean and Middle Eastern civilisations flourished in territories where J2 lineages were preponderant. This is the case of the Hattians, the Hurrians, the Etruscans, the Minoans, the Greeks, the Phoenicians (and their Carthaginian offshoot). Interesting is the fact that the highest concentration (30\u201340%) of J2 marker is in Caucasus mountains:  Now, about the older populations of Europe before Kurgan (4500 BC). North Europeans have I1-I2, Scandinavian, Sardinian, Dalmatian are two close genetic groups representing ancient populations from the North and South of Europe before the Indo-Europeans. They are the ones Indo-Europeans kind of destroyed all over Europe, during migrations. They are in higher proportion on the extremes North (Scandinavia) and South (Sardinia) of Europe. I1 evolved in isolation in Scandinavia during the late Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic periods, when hunter-gatherers from southern Europe recolonised the northern half of the continent from their Last Glacial Maximum refugia. I1 (North) earlier people, Hungarians have low percentage (1\u20132%), similar to French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanians, etc.:  I2 (M438/P215/S31) is thought to have originated during the Late Paleolithic, around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which lasted approximately from 26,500 to 19,000 years ago. I2 probably appeared in western Europe, although its exact region of origin cannot be determined since Paleolithic Europeans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Haplogroup I2 is the most common paternal lineage in former Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria and Sardinia, with percentage of 15\u201320% also present in Austrians, Hungarians and Ukrainians:  South-Mediterranean Europeans have E1b1a1, of North African origin. They were early migrations of agricultural and cattle grower people coming through Anatolia, but original from North Africa. Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Etruscans had a strong E1b1b marker. Romanians have similar proportion (10\u201315%) of E1b1b genes with most West Europeans (same as France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany), most Central Europeans (Czech, Serbia, Croatia, Hungary, Austria) and Ukraine. This is less than South Balkan and South Italian people (they have more, which is normal):  Whilst each area of Europe has only one, or two, main genetic groups, Romania and surrounding countries have around 15\u201320% of each of the five main branches. You can find all those four branches in a fairly balanced proportion in today\u2019s Romanian population. Similar genetic proportions exist in the neighbouring countries, such as Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Moldova. Slovakia and Ukraine have significantly more R1a, which is normal (being more Slavic). Conclusion is that Romanian population is a pretty balanced combination of all people that populate Europe today, less the recent migrations from outside of the continent. ",
