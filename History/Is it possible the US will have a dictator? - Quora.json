            "answer_text": "Absolutely it can and it gets more likely every year. There are several reasons that this is so. Executive Powers Since the founding of the USA, the system of checks and balances that we all learned about in high school have slowly and steadily been unchecked and unbalanced in favor of the president. The first and foremost reason for this has to do with the text of the US Constitution regarding the Presidency (Article II of the US Constitution), which is rather vague and unspecific, especially when compared to the text regarding the powers granted to the Legislative Branch (Article I of the US Constitution). The Founders were certain that the Legislature would be the most powerful branch of government. That\u2019s one reason the Legislature is bicameral and its powers so specifically limited in the text of the US Constitution. The Founders, therefore, were not as strict in limiting the powers of the President and the Executive Branch. Another reason is the powers that have historically thought to be inherent to the office of the President, though never specifically mentioned in the US Constitution. Such as the powers during times of National Emergency. The Powers of the President has gone mostly unchallenged by the Courts and the fact that the Attorney General is appointed by the President has essentially made the AG and the DOJ, Presidential lawyers. Without a doubt, the powers of the President will only continue to increase, unchecked and unbalanced. https://www.bu.edu/law/journals-archive/bulr/documents/marshall.pdf Shift on Executive Powers Let Obama Bypass Congress Erosion of the 2nd Amendment I am fairly certain there will be many answers here that will say that because of the 2nd Amendment, there will never be a chance for the President to take dictatorial powers. Unfortunately, they are most likely mistaken. Gun Owners have been lulled into complacency by the NRA and the supposed win of the Supreme Court decision Heller v Washington DC. Heller v Washington DC essentially made the first part of the 2nd Amendment, \u201cA well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,\u201d null. Leaving just, \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d The Founders intended the 2nd Amendment to be about National Security. They were wary of a standing Federal Army. Though in the end the Federal Government was allowed to raise an army, the States Militias were the Second Item in the Bill of Rights. The Founders did not invent Militias, they were part of every States Constitution prior to 1776 and in fact part of English Law. Essentially Heller v Washington DC changes the 2nd Amendment from being about National Security, which was the responsibility of the armed Citizenry to defend the nation from within and without, and redefined the 2nd Amendment being the right to self-defense, seeing it as a civil liberty. The problem is that the Founders were not unaware that people needed to defend themselves. But there was no need to enumerate the right to self-defense in the Bill of Rights because the right of self-defense is the Law of Nature, as old as the first predator and prey. They also understood that regardless of National Defense or Self Defense, people would be stronger in organized, coordinated, and practiced groups, Militias. Gun owners on their front porches with their personal arsenals could never be as much of a deterrent to any enemy as they would be with all of their neighbors, with plans and practice (regulated) in Militias. Individual gun owners, no matter how valiant their efforts, will be easily overwhelmed, subdued and disarmed by an armed offensive force the dictator sends, cops, soldiers, or mercenaries. The NRA is a lobby for gun manufacturers. It is no longer an association for rifle owners. It says that its legal battles; citing its troubles with New York State will bankrupt it soon. Though $10 million or so in executive salaries isn\u2019t the problem. The Biggest Lies About the 2nd Amendment Going Around in 2018 Erosion of the 4th Amendment In 1966 the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v Arizona, that the police must inform the person being arrested of their 5th Amendment rights. We all know it, \u201cYou have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for you.\u201d Hooray for the 5th Amendment and our right to not incriminate ourselves. Too bad the 4th Amendment has not fared so well. Let\u2019s review the 4th Amendment. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. Originally the crux of the 4th Amendment was to acknowledge that a \u201cPerson\u2019s house is their Castle\u201d, meaning that a person in their home is like a sovereign in their kingdom. That for anyone, including the government or any of its agents, to gain access without permission is forbidden except in very strict and specified circumstances. Technology like telephones and the internet have historically been included in thresholds to one\u2019s house that cannot be crossed as per the 4th Amendment. The War on Drugs in the 1970s and 1980s began the erosion of the 4th Amendment. Seizures of houses, papers, effects and almost any other personal property were allowed merely for drug charges, not convictions. Not just seizures but the forfeiting of all of the above merely for being charged with drug crimes. The War on Terror further eroded the 4th Amendment. The Patriot Act and the AUMF were interpreted to grant secret (not authorized by the court) wiretaps both domestically and in foreign countries, and the \u201csneak and peek\u201d searches without warrants. The AUMF gave the President, who can direct the military anywhere and anytime, the power to now direct it at individuals and groups of individuals (including US Citizens), rather than restricting the use of the Military against other State\u2019s (Nation\u2019s, Empire\u2019s, Kingdom\u2019s) military. Though Declarations of War and Authorizations of Military Force have been granted the President by Congress many times, the AUMF after 9/11 was unprecedented in allowing military actions against individuals and groups. What is the USA Patriot Web S.J.Res. 23 (107th): Authorization for Use of Military Force Surveillance Under the USA/PATRIOT Act Anti-Fourth Amendment Patriot Act https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL31133.pdf The Misuse and Overuse of Federal Conspiracy Laws The Industrial Revolution changed the world in many ways. The gap between the Industrialists and the huge number of people they employed made a lot of people angry. A movement called Anarchism became popular among the working class. Though none of the leaders of the Anarchists promoted violence, many of its members through frustration did resort to violence. From the 1880s through to the 1910s Anarchists were responsible for some of the first real terrorist acts. Examples include the Haymarket Riots in 1886, the attack on the French Parliament in 1893, the assassination of the French President Carnot in 1894, the assassination of US President McKinley in 1901, and the Bombing of Wall Street in 1920 were by Anarchists. The 20th Century also saw the phenomenon of the organized crime family, the Mafia. These families were becoming a powerful criminal force in most of America\u2019s big cities. There were also new types of Corporate setups that were complex and meant to disrupt fair trade. And hate groups like the KKK were of great concern. In the middle of the 20th Century, Congress passed the Federal Conspiracy Laws. Congress and the Supreme Court saw these criminal groups as far more of a threat to National Security than any individual criminal, and the Federal Conspiracy Laws were meant to be used as a tool by the likes of Attorney General, Robert Kennedy in combating them. All conspiracies share two elements; (1) an agreement, (2) between two or more people. The history of conspiracy in statutory law begins in 17th Century England. At that time criminal cases were not based on evidence, it was witness testimony that prevailed. A criminal conspiracy at that time was (1) an agreement, (2) between two or more people to bear false witness against an innocent person. By the time Congress enacted the Federal Conspiracy Laws, a criminal conspiracy became more general; (1) an agreement, (2) between two or more people to commit an offense against, or to defraud the United States or any of its agencies. In order to make easier for law enforcement to arrest and prosecutors to get indictments and take to trial, there is also an easing of evidentiary requirements in conspiracies that are not allowed in individual criminal cases. Circumstantial evidence and Hearsay are admissible in conspiracy cases. Anything any co-conspirator says can be used against all accused conspirators. Testimony made outside the court can be used, essentially giving no protection from the 6th Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. One does not have to commit an explicit crime, a person\u2019s guilt can be implied. Meaning associations with people and in places can incriminate someone in a conspiracy case. Conspiracies are considered ongoing. This means that there is no statute of limitations. One can find themselves accused of being part of a conspiracy of people they never met and years before they could have been involved. Essentially no protection from ex-post facto guaranteed by the US Constitution. Charges of Conspiring to do a crime and the crime itself are considered separate charges. Which means you can be tried, and sentenced to both the crime and conspiring to do the crime. Essentially no protection from Double Jeopardy guaranteed by the US Constitution. Obviously, there is a high factor that Federal Conspiracy Laws could be abused by federal law enforcement and prosecutors. So, Federal Conspiracy Laws were intended to be used by the FBI to investigate and make arrests, the Attorney General and federal prosecutors to bring charges in cases of criminal groups only with regard to national security. In 1986 Congress Passed Title 21 United States Code (USC) Controlled Substances Act. This act was an overreaction to the perceived crack-cocaine epidemic in the mid-1980s. This is the Congressional mistake that started minimum sentencing, meant to put away violent powerful leaders of drug cartels for a long time. What it actually did was to imprison for decades and sometimes life, the wives, girlfriends, associates and errand boys of those powerful drug lords. It is pretty much fact that it never caught, prosecuted, let alone sentenced any drug lord to date. The act also introduced conspiracy charges in the failed War on Drugs. Just like the general Federal Conspiracy Laws, Drug Conspiracy Laws had all the same easing of evidentiary requirements. Until 2001 the DEA only used these laws in cases and investigations of the aforementioned drug lords. After 9/11 with the Patriot Act, AUMF, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security; the DEA made general arrests on charges of conspiracy. Two cases in 2001 and 2002 set the precedent. Today the DEA no longer conducts criminal investigations, collecting evidence and vetting suspects. Today all evidence is circumstantial. People are being arrested and prosecuted for text messages that the DEA \u201cinterpreter\u201d says are code for amounts and types of drugs. Today individual drug addicts who deal for a fix are being arrested for conspiracies of distribution of vast quantities of drugs, though no actual drugs were found; merely implied. Federal Prosecutors in these cases force the accused to plead guilty. If the defendant chooses to go to trial the prosecutors threaten, and to date have called for maximum sentences if found guilty. Everyone who has gone to trial is sentenced a decade, sometimes two, that\u2019s ten to twenty years longer than those who took a plea. Let\u2019s just think about this for a second. You can be arrested and charged with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances with NO hard evidence, on hearsay, and then sentenced to decades of incarceration (don\u2019t forget there is no early parole in federal prisons) because you wanted to exercise your Constitutional right to due process, for something that is not an offense against or to defraud the United States, in fact in the vast majority of cases no violence occurred and there was NO VICTIM! https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://duckduckgo.com/&httpsredir=1&article=5765&context=jclc How Police Investigate Drug Conspiracies Federal Sentencing Guidelines: Conspiracy to Distribute Controlled Substance Cases - Dallas Justice Blog An Offer You Can\u2019t Refuse | How US Federal Prosecutors Force Drug Defendants to Plead Guilty https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao/legacy/2013/06/28/usab6104.pdf Federal Conspiracy Investigations | Jason Kalafat Attorney at Law 10 Acts Of Anarchist Terrorism That Shocked The World - Listverse Examining Robert Kennedy's War On The Mob Enron Chiefs Guilty of Fraud and Conspiracy 16th Street Baptist Church bombing | terrorist attack, Birmingham, Alabama, United States [1963] Title 21 United States Code (USC) Controlled Substances Act Militarized municipal police forces The War on Drugs has also led to the federal overfunding of municipal police force vice squads and SWATs and their acquisition of military-grade vehicles, arms, equipment, and tactical training. This has led to a general discord between citizens and local law enforcement. The Failed 'War on Drugs' Is Militarizing Law Enforcement, Fueling Police Violence War Comes Home Citizens United vs FEC This decision by the Supreme Court gave corporations all the civil liberties enjoyed by the citizens of the US. It essentially said that corporations 1st Amendment right of free speech could be interpreted as donating as much money as they\u2019d like, without disclosing their identity to groups that either promote or slam candidates. This went against everybody, including Congress, the long-time opinion that Corporate funding of any kind in federal elections should be limited and transparent. That the influence of unlimited corporate money to influence federal elections was patently unfair to the voters and citizens of the country. Historically corporations, partnerships, trusts and the like were given legal personhood. This was to limit the liabilities of stockholders and partners and the like and also allow the corporations etc to be able to buy land, sign contracts, and leases and carry out general business. I don\u2019t think anyone ever thought that this aspect of corporate personhood should be extended to include protection under the Bill of Rights. There is one glaring problem with granting corporations civil liberties, the one really important thing about them that makes them obviously not a person; THEY ARE IMMORTAL! Unlike you and I, they will never die. Which is a point that I hope is brought before SCOTUS and the decision is that in order to enjoy civil liberties, corporations cannot live past 90 years old!

The potential danger, of a despot with a desire for power, or a bored megalomaniac in peacetime, was a dark specter with a standing army, able to destroy their fragile new democracy. This included the Federalists like Thomas Jefferson. Almost two hundred years later, after two world wars, and continuing international military engagements, the standing army in peacetime, was comforting not frightening. President Eisenhower, at the beginning of a new decade, bade farewell to the American citizenry after his eight years in office and reiterated our need for that army to secure our precious liberty from the atheistic, evil, lowdown, pinko, commie threat. Then Ike started sailing on uncharted waters. Talking about what a full time, peacetime armament industry might bring. How technologies and inventions will be sought after by this arms industry. Which might lead to the nation\u2019s intellectuals and universities being bought wholesale by this arms industry. The possibility of a technocratic science elite without compassion in power. Where war, not peace would be the logical solution. To many Ike was warning us about Black Projects, suppressed technology, and ?.?.?\u2019s. But that\u2019s for another question. He was correct that most R & D and thus most new technology was financed and purposed first for the military; cell phones, internet, microwaves, computers, drones, and stealth. The Military Industrial Complex and the two longest, protracted wars in US history revealed less in technological advance and more a revamping of SOP (standard operating procedure) with contract military support, like KRB, a subsidiary of Haliburton. From supplies to personnel it seemed that everything was contracted out. This was new and different, just like the new SOP. The good old army hierarchical rank and unquestioned obeying of orders, MP\u2019s and tribunals were in abeyance to corporate executives, contracted people with non-disclosures and arbitration clauses. The wars became the source of high profits. The strategies left to hired guns. A soldiers valor replaced by a mercenaries pay. More appropriate a title would be the Contracted Military Industrial Corporation. Where does all our military spending go?

Then declare a National Emergency invoking martial law and direct the armed forces through contracted military operatives overseeing local police forces to disarm the general public. Though there will be some armed resistance, because of their lack of cohesion and organization gun owners will be easily and systematically overwhelmed, subdued, and disarmed. The Legislature and Justices of the Courts might be allowed to continue if they will agree to obey and follow the DOTUS without exception. ",

            "answer_text": "Certainly. In 1935, the great American novelist Sinclair Lewis (lived 1885 \u2013 1951) wrote a classic novel titled It Can\u2019t Happen Here. In the novel, a charismatic politician named Berzelius \u201cBuzz\u201d Windrip runs for president of the United States on a radical populist platform, promising to give every American family $5,000 a year. Windrip portrays himself as the champion of traditional American values, a true patriot, a lover of liberty and justice, and a pious Christian. He holds massive, energetic rallies. He portrays himself as a \u201cman of the people\u201d standing up for the \u201cforgotten men\u201d of the working class. He demonizes immigrants, minorities, intellectuals, and the press. He laments the decline of the United States and promises to restore the United States to her former glory. In chapter nine, he is described as follows: \u201cThe Senator [i.e. Windrip] was vulgar, almost illiterate, a public liar easily detected, and in his \u2018ideas\u2019 almost idiotic, while his celebrated piety was that of a traveling salesman for church furniture, and his yet more celebrated humor the sly cynicism of a country store.\u201d \u201cCertainly there was nothing exhilarating in the actual words of his speeches, nor anything convincing in his philosophy. His political platforms were only wings of a windmill.\u201d On the platform I have described, Windrip wins a landslide victory and sails right into the presidency. As president, he declares Congress an \u201cadvisory\u201d organization and strips it of all its powers. Any members of Congress who object are promptly thrown in prison. Windrip then creates, arms, and trains a paramilitary force called \u201cthe Minute Men,\u201d named after the militiamen who fought in the American Revolutionary War. Windrip\u2019s Minute Men work to enforce his agenda and force anyone who does not support Windrip into submission. Despite everything Windrip is doing, the vast majority of Americans continue to support him, insisting that everything he does is necessary for the restoration of American military power and economic prosperity. When confronted with the notion that Windrip\u2019s regime may be fascistic, they say, \u201cIt [i.e. fascism] can\u2019t happen here.\u201d You may notice some interesting parallels to certain contemporary politicians. Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize that Trump is not Buzz Windrip. They may bear an uncanny resemblance to each other, but they are still different. The character of Buzz Windrip was modeled in part on Adolf Hitler, who was at the height of his power when the book was published, and in part on the Louisiana Democratic Senator Huey Long, who was at the time running for president on a populist platform.  ABOVE: Image of an early edition of Lewis Sinclair\u2019s novel It Can\u2019t Happen Here The truth is, I think it is possible for any country on Earth with any form of government to turn into a dictatorship. No country is completely immune to the charms of authoritarianism, not even the United States. We may pride ourselves on our love of freedom, but saying that you love freedom means nothing if your actions do not show it. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to recognize authoritarianism when it rears its ugly head and it is certainly possible for even the most ardent believer in democracy to support an authoritarian figure. The only real question is not \u201cIs it possible the U.S. will have a dictator?\u201d but rather \u201cHow likely is it for the U.S. to become a dictatorship given the present circumstances?\u201d Just because the United States could become a dictatorship does not necessarily mean that it will. If our institutions are upheld and all the powers of the presidency are held in check like they are supposed to be, then we can avert dictatorship. There is nothing unrealistic about the United States electing a populist demagogue with authoritarian leanings; it has already happened. What I think is somewhat less realistic about Sinclair Lewis\u2019s novel is his portrayal of the conversion of the United States from representative democracy to dictatorship. This conversion\u2014if it does happen\u2014probably will not happen overnight. It will only happen after years and years of norms being flouted and institutions undermined. If the United States turns into an autocracy, it will probably happen a way similar to the Roman Republic. The Roman Republic was not overturned by one man; it took well over a century for the Republic to fully transform into the autocracy of Augustus. Furthermore, even as late as the reign of the emperor Diocletian (ruled 284 \u2013 305 AD), people were still pretending like \u201cthe Republic\u201d was still a thing, even though it really had not meaningfully existed in any sense for over three hundred years. For those interested in the history of the decline of the Roman Republic, the 2018 book Mortal Republic: How Rome Fell into Tyranny by the American classical historian Edward J. Watts is an excellent and startlingly contemporary history of that time period. On page 281\u2014the very last page\u2014Watts offers this brilliant paragraph, which feels as close to home as any news report: \u201cRome\u2019s republic, then, died because it was allowed to. Its death was not inevitable. It could have been avoided. Over the course of a century, thousands of average men, talented men, and middling men all willingly undercut the power of the Republic to restrict and channel the ambitions of the individual, doing so in the interest of their own shortsighted gains. Every time Cato misused a political procedure, or Clodius intimidated a political opponent, or a Roman citizen took a bribe in exchange for his vote, they wounded the Republic. And the wounds festered whenever ordinary Romans either supported or refused to condemn men who took such actions. Sulla, Marius, Caesar, and Augustus all inflicted mighty blows on the Republic, but its death was caused as much by the thousands of small injuries inflicted by Romans who did not think it could really die. When citizens take the health and durability of their republic for granted, that republic is at risk. This was as true in 133 BC or 82 BC or 44 BC as it is in AD 2018. In ancient Rome and in the modern world, a republic is a thing to be cherished, protected, and respected. If it falls, an uncertain, dangerous, and destructive future lies on the other side.\u201d  ABOVE: Cicero Denounces Catiline, painted between 1882 and 1888 by the Italian painter Cesare Maccari. If the United States ever falls into dictatorship, it will probably happen gradually. Over time, norms and institutions will be undermined until dictatorship simply feels normal and natural to most people. I must end this answer with a question mark. I do not know if the United States will become a dictatorship. If the United States does become a dictatorship, I cannot say how soon it will happen. It could happen a century and half from now or it could happen a decade from now. All I am certain of is that it will take time. Gradually, norms and institutions will be undermined until dictatorship simply feels normal and natural to most people. At first, few will even recognize it as a dictatorship, but the truth of the matter will be made clear by time. Unless, of course, we stop it from happening altogether. ",
