            "answer_text": "Yes, the chancellor is more powerful in the Bundesrepublik Deutschland than the president. While the Bundespr\u00e4sident (president) is the head of the state, the political power lies with the administration whose head is the Bundeskanzler(in) (chancellor) elected and thus more or less controlled by the Bundestag, the German parliament. As I explained here and here, this is a clear difference to the predecessor, the Weimar republic. See, after the First World War, when the Kaiser abdicated, many Germans missed the monarchy. So, in the Weimar constitution, they gave the Reichspr\u00e4sident (the president of the Reich, as the German state was still called at this time) huge powers as an replacement for the Kaiser (\u201cErsatzkaiser\u201d): He was the one, who appointed the Reichskanzler (chancellor) - not the Reichstag, the parliament! Also, the Reichspr\u00e4sient was able to pass laws around the Reichstag due to Article 48 of Weimar constitution. He also was the supreme commander of the Reichswehr. The first Reichspr\u00e4sident was Friedrich Ebert, a social democrat, one of the founder fathers and stron supporters of the democratic Weimar republic and he used the power of his office to strongen the democracy and to defend it against attempts to overthrow it. But after his death, the conservative monarchist Paul von Hindenburg, supreme commander of the German army in the First World War, was elected as Reichspr\u00e4sident. As long as Germany wasn\u2019t in trouble, he made no attempt to get rid of the democracy although he wasn\u2019t a supporter of that form of gouvernment. But when the Weimar republic got into a crisis due to the depression after the Black Friday in 1929, Hindenburg more and more supported right-winged anti-republicans or at least did nothing to prevent them from dismantling the democratic parts of the republic. And in the end, those national coservatives convinced him to appoint Hitler as Reichskanzler. So he paved nolens volens the way for the NS regime. After the Second World War, the founding fathers of the Grundgesetz, the constitution of the Bundesrepublik, were well aware of the role of the office of the Reichspr\u00e4sident in the construction of the nazi tyranny. So they decided to make the head of their new state a merely representive office with almost no political power and shifted the power to the head of the administration, the Bundeskanzler, who is elected by the Bundestag and can thus be controlled by the parliament. It is a mechanism to prevent a new dictatorship. ",

            "answer_text": "In Germany, is the chancellor more powerful than the president? Yes. In Germany the head of government (the chancellor) and the head of state (the president) are two different people to avoid concentrating too much power in one hand, because you know who, I even twitched a little to use the word \u201cconcentrating\u201d in that context. The president mainly has representative duties. The real power lies with the chancellor and his or her cabinet. Although they of course cannot pass bills without approval of the parliament. ",
