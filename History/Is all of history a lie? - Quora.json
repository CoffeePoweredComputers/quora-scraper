            "answer_text": " \u201cWiiners write History\u201d is a common phrase used to describe distortion of established historical events from the events that actually happened. No , not everything you read at your history book is the truth. The problem with history is, man can only know the narratives that had been written. If the \u201cbad guy\u201d gets to win the war and writes up that he is the good guy, maybe all the other future generations will know him as the good guy. That's why even simple habits of the Nazis become heavily criticised , all while ruthless and dark people like Columbus are hailed as visionaries.  Take the history of crusade as an example. The crusaders , in real life , were ruthless conquerors, who killed thousands of innocent Muslims and Jews for no apparent reason. But their narratives have been heavily romanticized.Then again , the Muslim narratives of the crusades are also deeply romanticized, but from a different perspective. But not everything you read on that History book is fake. There is truth too, if the history books only consisted of praises of the kings, that would've been bad news for mankind. So , my answer would be NO, Many things found in history weren't true, but not all. ",

Since we can only know what has happened in the past from people who lived back then or have done research which is supported by a number of people we can imagine that the information is truthful. There are people who do revise history according to their own agenda but there have been many reliable scholars studying the past. ",
