            "answer_text": "James IV, in 1513. England had gone to war with France in 1511, as part of the Holy League (the Papacy, Spain, Austria and Venice) which was contesting French control of Italy. The King of Scotland decided to declare war on England in support of his traditional ally, France. He sent a message to King Henry VIII demanding he withdraw his troops from the war; when Henry refused, James assembled a Scottish army and invaded England. On 18 August 1513 the Scottish army set off from Edinburgh. It was around 34,000 strong, with 17 of the latest secret weapon: cannons. The English were outnumbered because King Henry and his main army were in France, but he had left about 26,000 troops commanded by the Earl of Surrey to defend the northern border. On 24 August the Scottish army crossed the River Tweed and laid siege to several border fortresses. As the English army approached, King James waited for them on the hilltop of Flodden Ridge, just south of the Anglo-Scottish border. This was a strong natural fortress, difficult to attack. However, the Earl of Surrey began manoeuvring his army around behind the Scots. Seeing this move, in the morning of 9 September 1513, James decided he had to move his forces to nearby Branxton Hill, where they were in less danger of being surrounded, but abandoning his strong natural defences. At around 16:00 on that day, the Scottish artillery opened fire on the approaching English troops. However, the guns were largely ineffective, because it was pouring with rain. The English longbowmen likewise had little effect. Seeing this, King James then ordered the Scottish pikemen to charge downhill at the English troops. His attack was initially successful on his left flank, but Surrey sent in his reserves and prevented a collapse. James sent in his own second line, but they became bogged down in the wet ground, and their charge lost its impact. At close quarters, the Scottish pikes were ineffective and they had to drop them and draw swords. The English, however, were armed with bills rather than pikes \u2014 this was a shorter and heavier weapon like a curved axe-blade on a shaft, derived from an agricultural tool used for cutting hedgerows. The bills were more effective at close quarters, and the Scots started taking severe losses.  Re-enactors holding a variety of bills. King James then personally led his own reserve into the battle in an attempt to change the tide, but in vain. With the Scottish infantry now relatively immobile, the English archers were able to circle around behind them and fire their longbows at their backs, as the billmen cut them down from the front. It became a massacre. One third of the Scottish army was killed in that battle: over 10,000 men. English losses were about 4,000. Virtually every aristocratic family in Scotland lost a father, a son or a brother on the battlefield of Flodden. Worst of all, the king of Scots, James IV, was killed as well, at the age of 40. His son and heir was only 17 months old, leading to a long period of instability. James IV of Scotland was thus the last British king to die in battle, 28 years after Richard III was the last English king to do so. No king of Great Britain or the United Kingdom has ever died in battle.

            "answer_text": "James IV at Flodden Field. He invaded England in the time of Henry VIII but was routed by the Earl of Surrey. He died in a hail of arrows from one direction and soldiers with bills from the other. After death his body was taken to a monastic house at Sheen in England but could not at first be buried because James had been ex-communicated. Later, the Pope gave permission for the burial but Henry VIII could not be bothered giving a decent burial to his former foe; his decayed remains were stored away in a shed at Sheen\u2014and then forgotten, the head becoming separated from the body and reputedly used as a football. His end was not dissimilar to that of Richard III who died less than 30 years earlier, the last English king to fall in battle, including humiliation to the body, although Richard was at least interred within a few days in a place of sanctity, even though his grave was shallow, his hands possibly tied and no evidence of a shroud, and the grave-cut not long enough to fit his body properly.
