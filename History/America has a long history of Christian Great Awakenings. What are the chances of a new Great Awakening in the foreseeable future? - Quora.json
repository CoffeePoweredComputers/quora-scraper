            "answer_text": "I believe a great awakening can happen. Many Christians of different denominations want and pray and are working for an awakening. My opinion, though, is that one of the obstacles for such an awakening is the way many Christians go about evangelizing and spreading the Gospel. We all know that Christianity is declining in the United States. A report last month by Pew Forum revealed a 12 percent drop since 2009 in the number of Americans who identify as Christian, from 77 percent to 65 percent. It was even worse among Millennials. Only 49 percent of that generation now identify as Christian. Many Protestant churches, and even some Catholic churches, are attempting to reach out to young people using modern entertainment. They host rock concerts and parties, replacing the traditional ways of worship for \u201ccooler,\u201d more \u201cmodern\u201d ways, In the hopes that this will attract young people. I know that these people\u2019s intentions are good, but what they are doing doesn\u2019t seem to be working very well, does it? Christianity is still declining at a rapid pace, despite these churches attempts to be \u201ccool.\u201d Or maybe it is declining in part because of these attempts. According to Pew Forum, while Christianity has been on the decline in the U.S, Islam has been growing. Something about Muslim worship is drawing people. Muslims don\u2019t try to be cool, or to \u201ckeep up with the times.\u201d Their hold to their old traditions of solemn worship, and that kind of worship seems to be resonating with people.  I should also point out the according to the same Pew report that I mentioned above, while Protestantism and Catholicism are both declining, Protestantism is declining faster. The percentage of Protestants has dropped 9 percent since 2009, while the percentage of Catholics only dropped 3 percent. The Catholics generally have stuck to more traditional types of worship then Protestants. So my contention is this: Most people don\u2019t want \u201cmodern worship\u201d in their churches. If people want to go to a rock concert, they are not going to go to a Church. If people want spiritual guidance, they are not going to go to a rock concert. What people want is meaning in their lives. They want to know that what they are doing is worthwhile. They want substance. For evidence of this, look no further then the rise of Jordan Peterson. Like him or not, you have to admit that with his lectures about taking responsibility and living a meaningful life, this man has hit a nerve with young people today. What I am saying is that people want meaningful lives. And that includes meaningful worship. Not shallow entertainment. There is a time and place for that, and the place is not in the church. Like it or not, many Christians have let today\u2019s young people down. Unintentionally, of course, but nevertheless, they have. If we want a Spiritual Awakening, we have to return to meaningful worship. To tradition. Because that\u2019s what people crave, and that\u2019s what people need. ",

            "answer_text": "I think the next great Christian awakening is the realization that the Native American and this nation understood God far better than we have. Its amazing to me there are at least 4000 churches in every state in America but the nation is divided, classist, rascist, and greedy. Then you look at 500 Native American tribes who may not be benevolent in thier histories but with that many different concepts of God and stories of conception they can agree on the natural world\u2026its a paradox for all Americans.\u201dwe cannot eat money\"..I think that the next great American awakening is that God what ever name you call god\u2026God intended this nation and so many people togther for peace and harmony. You cannot see God from one perspective such as christianity because the picture and humanity truth loses balance\u2026if you read the 7 fires prophecy or hopi phophacey\u2026you see the nature of God\u2026whos hope that humanity choses its path\u2026togther... to live\u2026and that maybe the nature of God is an earth that though almost at exhaustion finds a way to turn the death man gives it into something to sustain life\u2026and that this Earth is so interconnected that the death of one rainforest starts the death of them all\u2026in essence the great awakening is that we are all realated\u2026and that this Earth is so intamate with the heart of man that the eyes of his heart literally bring sunshine, rainfall, peace or destruction\u2026what God would create something so interconnected and give it to the hearts of men to look protect? Is that a god that wants you to fear hell or look around at what you have? What's given? ",

That is one of 35 countries in a continent named America, which is roughly 10,000 miles long, and were one billion persons, of all races, speaking at least five major languages, live. About your expectations of a new Great Awakening, I personally doubt it. The world is running downhill, morally and ethically, including your USA, and perhaps your USA is an important promoter of decadence and loss of values. Just look around you. ",
