            "answer_text": "A few things to clarify here: The Abbasid Caliphate had been decline for almost 250 years where the provinces had broken up into autonomous kingdoms that paid nominal allegiance to Baghdad. There had been a revival of the political and military power of the Caliphs but that had led to the Abbasid influence extending over most of what is now Iraq.The Abbasid Caliphate did not really end with the sack of Baghdad. Yes, the sack of Baghdad was a catastrophic incident for the caliphate and the world. Primarily because of the loss of the great wealth and knowledge that happened after the sack of Baghdad. However, the Abbasid Caliphate was then established in Egypt by the Mameluk rulers there. Though, in all honesty the role became symbolic with real power in Mameluk hands. This lasted until the Ottoman Turks under Selim I took over Egypt and ended the Caliphate for good.So why did the Mongols not attack Jerusalem, Mecca & Medina? There was nothing of value in Mecca and Medina for the Mongols to attack and capture. The places had religious value for the Muslims but on their own did not have enough wealth to warrant the need to march through harsh desert with a horde.Jerusalem could have been attacked at some point but two things happened with saved Jerusalem. First, Mongke, the Khan at that time passed away just the Mongols were marching west so as per the Mongol law of the time, all the princes of the Khan had to return home to elect the next Mongol ruler. Hulagu had to return home as well being one of the potential heirs was one of them. He took back a portion of the Mongol troops with him to increase his chances of being elected as Khan. The death of Ogedei had previously saved Europe in similar circumstances. Second, at this crucial juncture, the Crusader states instead of allying themselves with the Mongols who were looking for an alliance remained mostly neutral and even allowed the Mameluks to march across their territory to fight the Mongols. The Mameluks under Sultan Qutuz fought Mongols at Ain Jalut and defeated them comprehensively. That eventually stopped the westward advance of the Mongols.",
