            "answer_text": "A2A. Several. Consider the fact that he was sent by his father Bindusara to quell rebellions in the Empire, to the provinces of Avanti and Takshashila. Also, after Bindusara\u2019s death, he probably spent four years battling his rival claimants to the throne and killed 99 of his half-brothers (an exaggeration of course, but the number is mentioned in the Ashokavadana). After ascending the throne, he expanded his Empire or rather, re-asserted his status as an emperor by several conquests, fought the infamous Kalinga War and crushed more rebellions from tribes residing in his north-western provinces (the modern-day Swat valley). Oh, wait. Did I forget to mention that Ashoka waged war through his Buddhist or maybe non-Buddhist populace where he exterminated numerous \u2018heretics\u2019 in his Empire (I forget if they were Jains or Ajivikas) by placing a bounty on their heads? There. I can\u2019t tell you the exact number of wars Ashoka fought but suffice it to say that he was very active on the battlefield. ",

But he fought that war in his 8th year of reign and after that he accepted budha religion and accept the path of non violence, but in starting 8 years of his reign he was very cruel so may be he fought some deadly wars in that 8 years also but for them evidences are not there.
