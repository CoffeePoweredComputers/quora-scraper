            "answer_text": "Honestly, most soundproofing tends to be terrible as an acoustic medium for recording. Its job is to prevent transmission of sound in or out of a room, but it doesn\u2019t really control sound within the room much. For good recording and mixing, there are really two things you\u2019re talking about: AbsorptionA lot of folks think that absorbers and soundproofing are the same thing. They aren\u2019t, although there\u2019s some overlap. An absorber, like rockwool or OC703 or Auralex or whatnot, is designed to absorb and control certain frequencies. It doesn\u2019t stop all sound or block all sound, but it prevents reflections within a space. There are many different kinds. Rigid fiberglass, mineral fabrics, closed-cell foams, etc. And there\u2019s the old stanbdby, eggcrate foam, which is downright AWFUL and terribly misleading - so don\u2019t use that.DiffusionThis one doesn\u2019t get talked about as much, but it\u2019s the secret weapon of a lot of studios. Diffusers are solid assemblies - usually wood or plastic - that reflect and scatter sound waves in certain mathematically-predictable patterns. They\u2019re useful for breaking up standing waves in a space and ultimately make the space sound \u201cbigger\u201d than it is. They tend not to be cheap, but they can also be DIY\u2019ed with a bit of lumber and some wood glue. There are also some manufacturers who make diffuser tiles for drop ceilings etc - I\u2019m not sure of the efficacy of those but they\u2019re probably better than nothing.There are some good discussions online regarding DIY room treatment. You can hack together a pretty decent broadband absorber using some cheap fabric and some panels of rockwool for only a few bucks (more if you want them to look nice). I\u2019m currently attempting to build a lightweight diffuser myself - all the previous ones I\u2019ve built from plans have been wood and incredibly heavy so I\u2019m in the process of trying to figure out how to reduce the weight.
