            "answer_text": "Death, as we all know, is a part of life. But it wasn\u2019t so for the first humans. At least not for nearly a millennium of human existence. It\u2019s easy to forget this as we read the Genesis stories of the Garden of Eden, the Fall, and the subsequent expulsion of Adam and Eve. It\u2019s easy because right there in the account of the temptation in the garden, Eve herself raises the possibility of death in her colloquy with Satan in Genesis 3. And, to modern readers and ancient alike, it seems that possibility is made a reality later in the chapter, when God decrees to Adam that \u201cFor you are dust, and to dust you shall return.\u201d But when does Adam actually die? Not in Genesis 4, when, after the fratricide of Cain, Adam and Eve bear a third son, Seth. We can assume that this new birth came at least about two decades after the birth of their first children, as Cain and Abel are depicted as grown men at the time of Abel\u2019s murder. And, in fact, Genesis 5:3, informs us exactly of when in Adam\u2019s lifetime he beget his third son: age 130. By this time, there had been enough humans for the founding of the first city by Cain (Genesis 4:17). Since that time, there had been five generations descended from Cain, which included the founders of the nomadic herders, the first player of the \u201clyre and the reed pipe,\u201d and the first forgers of \u201cinstruments of bronze and iron\u201d (Genesis 4:20-22). The beginnings of human civilization were well underway. It had at least one city; it had the arts (the lyre and the reed pipe); it had ancient technology (\u201cinstruments of bronze and iron\u201d); and it had already had economic variation, with some living as nomadic herders of lifestyle and others dwelling in cities. And Adam was still, in a sense, in the prime of his life: he was begetting children and had hundreds of years left to live. The death sentence to which humanity had been subjected had yet to be executed. Of course, there had been one death\u2014Abel\u2019s. But this was an unnatural death, occurring at the treacherous hands of his brother, as Jewish philosopher Leon Kass notes in his philosophical rereading of Genesis, The Beginning of Wisdom. Moreover, the possibility of death by violence seemed \u201cconfined to the line of Cain,\u201d whose descendent, Lamech kills a man for wounding him (Genesis 4:23), as Kass notes. If the line of Cain was doomed, perhaps Adam and Eve had reason to hope for a new beginning with Seth, Kass suggests. The first humans did not yet have any experience with death from natural causes. Perhaps the dire prophecy uttered by God lurked in the back of Adam and Eve\u2019s minds, but they would not have really understood it. \u201cAs I have pictured him, the original human being \u2026 lacks sufficient self-consciousness truly to understand this prophecy; a simple-minded soul could not know death. At most, \u2018dying\u2019 to him would convey some vague kind of badness, or perhaps just the absence or loss of everything present,\u201d Kass writes. Adam would go on to live another 800 years after the begetting of Seth\u2014presumably more than sufficient time to see a new line of descendants blossom, absent the murderous tendencies of those descendants of Cain, as Genesis records no murders from those descended from Seth. Then, the unimaginable happened. Genesis 5:4 records the event: \u201cThe whole lifetime of Adam was nine hundred and thirty years; then he died.\u201d This detail hardly surprises readers today. But, at the time, it must have sent shock waves throughout human civilization: this was the world\u2019s first death by natural causes. And, incredibly, it happened nearly a millennium into human history. Moreover, anyone who thought this a freak accident of nature was soon disabused of such notions. Within a century of Adam\u2019s death, his favored son Seth also died. (Based on the chronology of Genesis 5:6-7, Seth was 912 years old). \u201cThe deaths of Adam and Seth must have shattered men\u2019s expectations and sent them reeling,\u201d Kass writes. Then, suddenly, death is everywhere. It\u2019s easy to miss it because what follows in Genesis 5 is a series of genealogies\u2014the kind of sleep-inducing phonebook reading that usually makes one\u2019s eyes glaze over. But each mini genealogy abruptly ends with a harsh reminder of the new reality that has sunk in: When Enosh [son of Seth] was ninety years old, he begot Kenan. Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years after he begot Kenan, and he had other sons and daughters. The whole lifetime of Enosh was nine hundred and five years; then he died (Genesis 5:9-11). In fact, the phrase \u201cthen he died\u201d punctuates the genealogies of Genesis 5 six more times. As one Scripture scholar has written: \u201cNo reader of Genesis 5 \u2026 fails to be impressed by the recurrent phrase \u2018And he died;\u2019 which baldly and emphatically concludes the entry for each of these antediluvians. The whole movement of the regular form of these notices is toward death\u201d (David Clines, The Theme of the Pentateuch, as cited in Bibliotheca Sacra in July-Sept. 1991). Life now has an end point. And, notably, that end point is drawing nearer and nearer, adding a note of urgency to this \u201cgenealogy of death,\u201d as it has been called. Adam lived 930 years. Seth missed that by almost two decades and his son, Enosh, lived 905 years, falling short of his father\u2019s 912. Although some of the lifespans bounce back, the trend is downwards: by the time we get to Lamech, lifespans have been reduced to 777 years. The message of Genesis 5\u2014one that can be easily missed amid the genealogies\u2014is the reality of death that is a result of the first sin. But this isn\u2019t the end of the story in these early chapters. The darkness that broods over these genealogies is broken by one ray of hope. It occurs during the fifth generation from Seth and it involves an antediluvian named Enoch: When Enoch was sixty-five years old, he begot Methuselah. Enoch walked with God after he begot Methuselah for three hundred years, and he had other sons and daughters. The whole lifetime of Enoch was three hundred and sixty-five years. Enoch walked with God, and he was no longer here, for God took him (Genesis 5:21-24). As one Scripture scholar has noted, this genealogy does not end with the familiar obituary \u201c\u2026then he died.\u201d Instead, we are told Enoch, who \u201cwalked with God\u201d had a different fate allotted to him: \u201cGod took him.\u201d Traditionally, these verses have been understood to mean that Enoch was removed from this earth by God before experienced death, presumably to put him in paradise. But the reign of death continues. Enoch\u2019s son dies, as does his grandson. There is hope amid all this but it will take another, far more shocking death to end its reign and extend the hope of Enoch to all of us: the death of God Incarnate, Jesus Christ. ",

            "answer_text": "Abel seems to be the obvious answer here: Genesis 4:8 (KJV) - And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. It is also incorrect.  In a most interesting way, one could suggest that Cain was the first person to die in the Bible. James 1:15 (KJV) - Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. So when does this death take place? The NASB answers this best here: Romans 7:11 (NASB) - for sin, taking an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me. In KJV we read: Romans 7:11 (KJV) - For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. Notice that both of these verses are present tense as in this is taking place rather than the future tense of something that will take place. Did you catch how this death came about? Here it is again: Romans 7:13 (KJV) - Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. So the commandment brought about sin? What commandment? Jesus refers to it here: Matthew 5:21 (KJV) - Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: And it is seen for its completeness here: Exodus 20:13 (KJV) - Thou shalt not kill. We can sum this thought up right here: Romans 6:16 (KJV) - Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? Going back to our story we can now see that since sin actively brings death even before the grave, Cain was actually the first person to die. But that is still not the official correct answer to the question. This verse tells why: Romans 5:12 (KJV) - Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: So how did sin enter into the world? Genesis 2:17 (KJV) - But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. By the disobedience of the above verse as can be seen here. Genesis 3:6 (KJV) - And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. But the breaking of this commandment did not start with the eating of the apple but rather was kin to what happened here: Ezekiel 28:15 (KJV) - Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. Hard to believe that the above verse refers to Lucifer without a more thorough read of that chapter, but it does. So when was iniquity found in Lucifer? Proverbs 23:7 (KJV) - For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee. Which brings us right back to our answer. Genesis 3:3 (KJV) - But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. Eve was the one to speak those words to the serpent (aka Santa er uh, I mean Satan) right before she physically took, ate and shared with Adam. Therefore, if we understand death to be far more than what happens to the physical body we can conclude that Eve was the actual first person in the Bible to die. But I would like to end this with hope. 1 Corinthians 15:22 (KJV) - For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. That sounds good but this sounds even better. Romans 6:23 (KJV) - For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Please note whose the giver of the gift of eternal life. Then further note how humanity is able to gain access to that eternal life. And ask yourself this final question: How could a vengeful judgemental tyrant of a being give the most precious gift ever known to sinful disobedient humanity? ",
