            "answer_text": "well from what i have seen over the past half century with my own eyes, ide have to say without a shadow of a doubt, YES . he fought All and Everybody. Cant think of anybody that Ali did not fight when he was boxing.. Won against the best boxers at the time and it spanned into two decades, including the Golden Age as well. Lost a couple, but faced Everybody.. Nobody comes close. NoBody. Moore, Patterson, Liston, Williams, Frazier, Foreman, Norton.. I mean to add Lyle, Quarry, Foster, Folley, Ellis, Chuvalo, Bonavena and Shavers. .. Name anybody that has that in their resume. NONE. Nobody comes close. NOBODY.. Not even Sugar Ray Robinson Foreman was at the primest of his prime. . Liston just used Patterson as a mop twice. . Shavers was at his peak. . Jimmy Young was a masterful boxer who beat Foreman.. Ali faced All styles . All up and coming fighters. . All the Heavy Punchers, those that were feared and heavily favored to knock his ass out, he Beat. No catchweight, no rediculous stipulations, no 'home' arena and fans didn\u2019t have to wait years before the fight to happen.. That's Greatness. If you were chosen by the Universe to take boxing to Levels it's never been taken before with hand speed, hand eye coordination, the best footwork of All, better than any Heavyweight that came before or after and made it possible to earn million dollar purses for All fighters today, then you are the Greatest without even having to debate .

Joe Louis 11 years, 8 months, 8 days 4 270 days 3. Muhammad Ali 9 years, 5 months, 5 days 3 443 days What was it that M. Ali did that made people believe that he is the greatest? The stats for performance does not point towards Ali as the greatest boxer of all time. He might have been when he was the champion. His trash-talking would have made him even more popular and his popularity and the power to draw crowds for his matches and TV shows was phenomenal. Though he was a good boxer. Even the best when he was the champion, he is not the greatest of all boxers. There is no objective consensus as to who is the greatest boxer of all times. But certainly, M. Ali was good at PR and he \u2018is\u2019 perceived as the greatest just because of his PR skills and the reputation he built on and off his stage. \u201cMuhammad Ali's fights were some of the world's most-watched television broadcasts, setting television viewership records. His most-watched fights drew an estimated 1\u20132 billion viewers worldwide between 1974 and 1980, and were the world's most-watched live television broadcasts at the time.\u201d Who does qualify for the the list of greatest? Rocco Francis Marchegiano (September 1, 1923 \u2013 August 31, 1969), best known as Rocky Marciano (/m\u0251\u02d0rsi\u02c8\u0251\u02d0no\u028a/), was an American professional boxer who competed from 1947 to 1955, and held the world heavyweight title from 1952 to 1956. He is the only Heavyweight champion to have finished his career undefeated.His six title defenses were against Jersey Joe Walcott, Roland La Starza, Ezzard Charles (twice), Don Cockell and Archie Moore. 2. Wladimir Klitschko - Longest reigning champion 3. Vitali Klitschko (right) retired as champion in 2005. Following his retirement, the WBC conferred \"champion emeritus\" status on Klitschko, and assured him he would become the mandatory challenger if and when he decided to return Mohammad Ali may have been the best when he was the heavyweight champion, but the talk of being the greatest is just PR and there is no statistics to back it up.
