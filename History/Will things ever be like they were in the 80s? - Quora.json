Everything in the 80s was a lot less serious and more glamorous and im sorry but life needs to be taken very seriously and spending that much time trying to live a glamorous is time wasted. I nearly lost everything in the 80s including my life many times. I was 18 in Dec.1980 had enlisted in the army cuz I wanted to be an Airborne Ranger 2 weeks before I was to go to basic I destroyed my right knee. Then both my stepfather and mother died. I was twenty with 123,000$ and not a lick of common sense and it made sense to by lots of guns and several pounds of cocaine. Then a monster of a 4x4 and spend the next 6\u20137 years selling drugs and partying. Then as the 80s wound down it struck me that I had wasted 123,000$ and ten years of my idiotic life and that was my 80s so no I truly hope that nothing like the 80s ever rears its mindless head again!!!!

            "answer_text": "What goes around, comes around my friend. The right question would be, will I live to see, if and when exactly that happens :) From a political standpoint, the current nuclear arms race, the atmosphere prevailing in this regard is just the same as it was during Reagan\u2019s time. Conservative agenda in today\u2019s age, war threats, unemployment, wrecked health care system, to name a few. So, yes, this is kind of like the 80\u2019s. However, if your question comes from a pop culture perspective, then it\u2019s a divided opinion. Some feel it is nothing like the 80\u2019s when you had Michael Jackson at his best, Prince , Hollywood stars like Harrison Ford, Tom Cruise and many more just warming up to showcase their acting talents, and today, you barely have a lot like those.However, there are those who argue that today\u2019s age is built or, is a consequence of the 80\u2019s and hence to be seen as a continuation of it. So, it all depends is that you want to return from the 80\u2019s :) ",
