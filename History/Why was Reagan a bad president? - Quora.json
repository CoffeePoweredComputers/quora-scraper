            "answer_text": "Ronald Reagan never became an A-list actor in Hollywood. When his movie career sputtered to a halt, he moved to television, which in the early 1950s was a definite comedown in an actor\u2019s career. To supplement his income, he began making speeches. The titans of American industry liked his style and saw to it that he earned a good living on the lecture circuit, then sponsored him when he moved into politics. From those backers he learned a hatred of communism that was almost pathological. Unfortunately, it blinded him to the fact that right-wing dictators can be as cruel and corrupt as left-wing dictators. When Corazon Aquino challenged Ferdinand Marcos for the presidency of the Philippines and lost, she accused Marcos of rigging the results. Reagan\u2019s response was that there was cheating on both sides. No cheating on Aquino\u2019s behalf was ever uncovered. He criticized Jimmy Carter\u2019s decision to turn over control of the Panama Canal to the Panamanians, gloomily predicting that they would side with the Soviet Union and cripple U.S. shipping. The fact that Gen. Omar Torrijos, the leader of Panama, was a progressive who had seized power in a coup was enough of a reason for Reagan to distrust him, even though Torrijos seemed to be a nationalist rather than a communist. And Panama has never denied a U.S. ship permission to use the Canal. When Anastasio Somoza lost power to the leftist Sandinistas in Nicaragua, Reagan secretly supported the contras, a right-wing guerrilla army which fought the Sandinistas. Reagan actually committed an impeachable offense, violating U.S. law to supply arms to the contras. During Reagan\u2019s presidency, Americans overwhelmingly supported sanctions against South Africa for its policy of apartheid. But the South African government, which believed that apartheid was divinely ordained, said that Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid fighters were communists. That was enough for Reagan, who vetoed a sanctions bill passed by Congress\u2014which promptly overrode his veto. Instead of sanctions, Reagan advocated what he called \u201cconstructive engagement,\u201d which in practice meant doing nothing at all to end apartheid. Reagan was also the godfather of supply-side, also known as trickle-down, economics, one of the first politicians to say that making the rich even richer would benefit all Americans. Supply-side was nothing but the economic version of his anti-communist foreign policy: making right-wing dictators even richer would benefit their people. He never seemed to lose any sleep over the human-rights violations committed by the right-wing dictators. ",

He promoted the Trickle Down economic nonsense that plagues us to this day, and started the decades long decline of the US standard of living with his policies of economic voodoo. He was senile when elected to office, and his condition deteriorated while in office. So for most of his term, he had absolutely no idea what was going on, or why, He simply read speeches and offered memorized slogans. He didn\u2019t actually \u201cgovern\u201d in the sense that we expect from a president. He presided over one of the most corrupt \u201cadministrations\u201d the country has ever been cursed by, and for most of his time in office, had absolutely no idea about any of it. He was a \u201cbad president\u201d because he was incapable of being anything other than a shallow PR presence for the most corrupt band of criminals every to be in charge of the US Government. He was a \u201cbad president\u201d because of his Alzheimer\u2019s based incompetence in office.  ",
