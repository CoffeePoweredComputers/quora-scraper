            "answer_text": "As evil as Stalin was, his legacy has some positive points. He stabilized the country and the economy. When Stalin was taking over, USSR was still in the middle of post-revolutionary turmoil. Stalin stopped the chaos, he implemented a strong central government that ran the entire state top-down.He got rid of the trotskyists. The faction of the communist party led by Trotsky was convinced, that communism can not survive in Soviet Union alone, that it must be spread around the world by means of violence if necessary. Stalin put a stop to that and the Soviet Union embraced the fact that it is the only communist country.Stalin's reign of terror was a really horrible thing, but one could argue, that Stalin's reign of terror prepared the nation for the life or death struggle against the Nazis. Soviet soldiers and officers had more to fear from Stalin than from German troops, so they obeyed every order, no matter how suicidal.Stalin led the USSR to victory against Nazi aggression. Stalin made many mistakes, during this conflict and otherwise, but nevertheless, he led the country and the nation to victory.I think it was Churchill, who said upon Stalin's death \u201cHe took over a country of a wooden plow, and left it a nuclear superpower\u201d.

Folks, are you really thinking of a man who made the country he ruled a superpower could have one dimensional personality of a superhero comix villan? If it is the only way you can see the Historical figures, that is sad. ",
