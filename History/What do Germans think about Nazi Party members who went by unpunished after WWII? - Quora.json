            "answer_text": "It depends. Most of Germany today has a very critical view of the nazis. This however has not always been this way: Right after the war, many fervent nazis as of old suddenly wanted to be known for being these \"awesome anti-nazi resistance heroes\" that in reality they had never been. Disgusting opportunism. At the same time, quite a few of the REAL heroes of these years were very humble, often enough did not mention their selfless and very risky acts until they died, and only as of recently we learn about these things at all. So right after the war, there was a lot of lying about one\u00b4s own guilt, or simply attempting to \"killing the subject\" by a carpet of silence regarding anything that had to do with these matters. This took a drastic turn in the 1960\u00b4s, with students protesting against their often authoritarian professors at university, who as they had found out were regularly hiding a dark past as nazis.  The slogan \"Unter den Talaren - Muff von 1000 Jahren\" is a famous line from this time (in English: Underneath the robes - the stench of 1000 years\" [\"1000 years\" of course referring to the \"1000-yeared Reich\", the nazis had proclaimed]).   When you are interested enough in the subject, I recommend you to watch the AWESOME movie \"Das schreckliche M\u00e4dchen\" (in English: \"The Nasty Girl\"). Like no other, this film shows the \"social chemistry\" around the un-earthing of unpopular truths in the Germany of these important years, decades after the war, but with this unresolved topic as burning as ever. It was essentially the young generation that forced all of Germany to revisit this past, to look at weird cases, were LEADING NAZIS suddenly were in the highest political or legal positions in a new, democratic Germany, often enough with the crimes they had committed never having been properly investigated or persecuted. And this dynamic is ongoing, with for instance the owners of BMW, the Quandt family, only recently having been pressured to admit to their involvement in nazi slave labor and associated crimes, which only years ago they wrongfully denied ever existed. Today, we have some of the biggest problems with \"neo-nazis\" (= contemporary fascists) in the former communist part of eastern Germany. There, some villages are shockingly almost entirely in the hands of nazi organizations. There was a case where a sports-teacher was training little kids FOR YEARS while he was wearing a Hitler-moustache, and had the kids call him \"Mein F\u00fchrer\". Seriously! As this is already insane, what is much worse is the indifference and naive idiocy of too many locals, regarding this indescribably sensitive situation.  They play dead and show no initiative to change this. Now, of course, this is not EVERYONE in the east - there also is groups and also brave individuals who resist. But the overall situation is not leaving me to cheerful at all so far. My theory why this is a problem much more in the former communist part of Germany than in the western german states, is that these areas never experienced the sobering and educative effect of the youth-movement in the 1960\u00b4s. In communism, ANYTHING that did not come from the central government was forbidden, and a low-profile, submissive attitude was much furthered by the dictatorship. Of course, also in the West there is plenty of people who never learned from the nazi era. They may not be nazis themselves, but you can hear them say things like \"one day this topic should be over, and not talked about any more\". To me, this is almost as bad as being a nazi. The only way \"out\" of the terror of these times lies not in denying, but in ACCEPTING, and making the best out of it. But in general, the awareness is there, the vast majority I think beliefs that nazi criminals should have been persecuted or SHOULD be persecuted where they still are in the hiding. Maybe you noticed, that there were several prominent cases just within the last two years. One of them, that of John Demjanjuk, was being dealt with in the courts of my town, Munich. Another thing that is currently interesting, is how a group of neo-nazis had been murdering randomly picked foreigners over a timespan of 6 years. The group that was behind it only got exposed through sheer luck (they got trapped while robbing a bank), and this is now the ongoing development of s scandal, leaving parts of the german Verfassungsschutz (\"Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution\") not only look as complete amateurs, but also raises the suspicion that they had, if not supported, at least almost entirely IGNORED the rather apparent danger originating from these radicals. Just today, it broke news the Verfassungsschutz had at several occasions supported the nazi-group with money - allegedly \"to be able to trace them\", but people are really skeptical these days, also, because the truth about what happened only drips out in tiny portions. Makes everyone wonder what else is there to be found. In any case - the good news here is that for once, this group got stopped, and it looks like there will finally be some adjustments in our government, that so far seemed to almost entirely denied rightwing terrorism exists (as a matter of fact, it was claimed even AFTER these murders got public, that \"there is no new sign for rightwing terrorism\", even though what happened is THE DEFINITION of terror). Already now, institutions have been created working on getting a grip on rightwing extremism, and though I do not have any polls I could present to you, I think it is safe to say almost all Germans support these measures to be taken. I hope this answered your question at least a little bit. If there is anything left unclear to you, just write a reply to this post, or PM me. ",
