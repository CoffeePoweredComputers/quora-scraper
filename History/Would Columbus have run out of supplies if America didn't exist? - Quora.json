            "answer_text": "No, he wouldn\u2019t have ran out. Columbus\u2019 purpose by sailing west was to find a new route to the East Indies or South East Asia as the area is currently known. He was trying to establish a new route for Spain to reach the markets of Cathay (China), India, and Cipango (Japan) where he was heading first. However, he miscalculated the distance between Spain and Japan. He thought that the distance between Spain and Japan was between 1,864 and 3,107 miles sailing west. The distance is in fact about 12,428.00 miles. The distance between Spain and the American Continent is approximately 4,800 miles. If he was carrying food and supplies for a 6 month's journey (183 days), and it took him 37 days to reach the Bahamas, then he he had more than enough to cover the distance between Spain and Japan if the American continent wouldn\u2019t have existed. It would have taken 96 days for him to reach Japan. He would have had supplies and food left to cover 87 additional days to another destination from Japan. ",

            "answer_text": "The ships carried enough provisions for a year, at a time when two weeks at sea was a long voyage. Supplies on board included foodstuffs, such as water, dried fish, salt meat, live pigs and hens (to be killed aboard ship), rice, cheese, and figs; navigational instruments, including nautical almanacs, charts, compasses, magnets, hourglasses, and rulers; and trade items, such as glass beads, brass rings, knitted caps, gold, silver, pearls, and spices. I think they were ready for a long sail. ",
