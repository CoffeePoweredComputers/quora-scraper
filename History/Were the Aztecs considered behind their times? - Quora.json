            "answer_text": " The Aztec were not a backward civilization. Many technologies were equal or even were ahead (medicine) of Europeans. It was just another civilization. More Greeks divided the world into Greeks and barbarians. This division is in their (the Europeans) and others (the Aztecs) is a characteristic feature of all ethnic groups. Aztec Tools and Weapons. Even though Aztecs did not have iron or bronze they found creative ways to create effective weapons to use during warfare. Instead of using the common materials used to make weapons, Aztecs used obsidian, chert, copper, and stone. Some of the weapons and tools they made were drills, axe blades, the Atlatls ( Spear-thrower ), and the macuahuitls ( Macuahuitl ). Aztecs also made canoes that allowed them to carry goods through waterways in the empire.Aztec Calenders. Aztecs used two calenders, one was used to keep time and the other was used to be aware of the days to praise gods. The religious calender had 260 days, each day of each month was dedicated to a god. The time calender had 365 days and 18 months, the months consisted of twenty days. Because natural disasters usually occurred on certain days, five extra days were added to the end of each year, these days were known as \"bad days\". If a baby was born on a bad day they were named on a good day. The time calender is made of stone and it consists of symbols for each day of the month. The symbols were animals, elements, and objects, such as a crocodile, the wind, or a house. Aztec Medicine. Aztec's medical advancements were also an astonishing part of Aztec society. Doctors had cures for sickness and injuries and also had ways to prevent them. Some of the illness' and injuries that doctors treated were fevers, earaches, broken bones, and colds. Doctors even had procedures for women to go through when they were pregnant.Aztec agriculture - Chinampa . Because there was no fertile land available in their empire Aztecs created land for harvesting. They called their land chinampas. Chinampas were islands made with mud, silt, and decomposing food on a reed mat that was on top of water. Farmers planted many trees around the edge of the chinampas so that the roots would hold the soil and provide an infinite amount of water for the farmland. Aztecs grew an assortment of vegetables on the chinampas, plowing the food with only sticks and a hoe made of wood.Source: Aztec Technology - Meso America and Africa Before the European Incursion Inventions, Science, and Education. Aztecs made several important advancements in the domains of education and science. They were among the first societies in the world to make education compulsory for all children. This education also included basic military training for all male students. In the field of science, they made advancements in mathematics, medicine, and astronomy. Steam baths and a variety of herbs were used as medicine. In mathematics, they had their own number system which used 20 as its base. Among various other purposes, this numbering system was used for calculating taxes.Building and Structures. One of the most remarkable achievements of Aztec technology was in the domain of architecture and building of various structures. Some of their enduring feats include the stone carving, and the remarkable step pyramids. Proper care was taken about proportions and structure of these pyramids which served as the temples. Another example of Aztec technology in the domain of architecture was the city of Tenochtitlan which was divided into four parts each having its own architectural value. The Aztecs also built two large aqueducts which fulfilled the need of fresh water for bathing in the city of Tenochtitlan. Advanced Technology. The Aztecs had certain technological disadvantages against the Spanish invaders including the absence of iron, bronze, horse, and wheel. Despite these crucial disadvantages, Aztec technology had made impressive advances in various other respects. For instance, they had developed innovative methods for farming where the artificially made farming land over the swampy lake beds was used for farming. According to some observers of the time, the methods used by the Aztecs in their medicine were, in certain aspects, even better than the methods used by the Europeans at the same time.Aztec Technology Summary. Aztec technology made impressive advancements in various spheres of life such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine, education, agriculture, and the making of tools. They were among the very first societies in the world to introduce compulsory education for all the children. In the domain of farming, they invented new farming methods to overcome the problem of swampy land, in addition to making various useful tools. In astronomy, they used two calendars, one for keeping track of religious ceremonies and another one for measuring time. The Aztecs had their own number system using 20 as base which they used in the calculation of tax and tribute. Since they did not have horses and wheels, they used canoes as the primary medium of transport and dug up many canals for that purpose. Source: Aztec Technology Video about Aztec ",

            "answer_text": "Tenochtitlan was a huge city, even by Old World standards, so the Aztecs must have had some pretty good ideas on civil management and health to have the whole city not just blow up in violence or starve en masse. Besides that, they were unquestionably less technologically advanced than all the major civilizations of Eurasia. They never made metal weapons, didn\u2019t have gunpowder (which by the 1500\u2019s was used across all of Eurasia), didn\u2019t have any major labor saving machines (wheels*, waterwheels, windmills), oceangoing ships, or advanced navigational tools like compasses, among other things. *It\u2019s commonly argued that the Aztecs never needed wheels because they had no draft animals to pull them, but wheeled carts can help humans carry huge loads too. Especially in Asia, rickshaws and other human powered vehicles were extremely beneficial. ",
