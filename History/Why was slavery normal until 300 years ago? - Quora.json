            "answer_text": "Slavery wasn't normal everywhere 300 years ago. Infact enlightened Europe had given up slavery 500 upwards years ago. The Vikings had enslaved earlier. But it had disappeared from Europe. The Muslims however were huge slavers from the Ottomans stealing children to enslave. To Africans capturing slaves on industrial levels and using them for labour, warriors and even sacrifice. To most nations without religion like Christianity it was seen as pretty normal that the losers of a battle forfeited their rights. When Europeans arrived in Africa they saw this cheap source of labour and began buying from the African kings. Some European adventurers even made expeditions to capture slaves but this wasn't as efficient as just buying them from African themselves However christianity began to change this. Opinion in Europe began to change and people realised how wrong it was lead by the British who used their dominant position to eradicate slavery from stopping tribes like the Ashanti warriors in Africa to stopping American shipping transporting slaves. To persuading Portugal to stop transport. Even India to a lesser extent though Indians didn't want to give up slavery so easily. Scarily slavery is still practiced in many places, though maybe not seen as normal it's still rife in India, Africa and even hidden in some places in Europe where disadvantaged are used as slaves under the radar.

            "answer_text": "Due to wars and fights over territories and development of new found countries, instead of killing the prisoners of wars one employed them to help build up the countries that the prisoners had helped to destroy, Also to revitalise the human lose incurred by wars. by enslaving them. Also manual work was beneath the middle cases in this world and as there was no machinery to do the jobs slaves did it instead. With the new continents being developed, slaves were needed to help develop them so that how the world stood. In numerous countries around the world today it still stands with the anti slaving societies saying that there are still 40 million slaves around to day mostly in Africa and in India Slaving is still reported today in the Sudan where the Arabs there enslaving the black ( Dinka peoples) Africans, and also slaving is going on in S E Asia. Some of the slaving today is said to be forced and indentured labour but Shackled slavery is still alive and kicking . ",
