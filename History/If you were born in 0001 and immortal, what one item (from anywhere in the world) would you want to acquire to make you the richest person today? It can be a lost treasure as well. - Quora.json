Not only would the money make me money, I\u2019d have people owing me favors, I could have political marriages, I could control political marriages, being Eurocentric as I\u2019d not like pre Columbian Native American economies, I could have Kings, Emperors and Popes owing me. Pulling strings from behind the scenes would be the way to go and I\u2019d uses assorted people as my fronts so the heat would be on them. Machiavelli in Florence would be one of my people.
