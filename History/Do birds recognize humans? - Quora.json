            "answer_text": "I live just outside of Philadelphia and used to feed all types of birds from feeders in my backyard, however, I also scattered seed on my back patio area for the pigeons, cowbirds and other large birds that couldn\u2019t utilize the feeders. This, of course, meant I also fed the squirrels who helped themselves to the \u201cfeast\u201d dropped on the ground. What I never expected was to step out my back door one morning and find two mallard ducks\u2014a male and a female\u2014trying to scrape up the food from the pavement. They saw me and flew away. But the next morning, they were back. I kept up with the feeders, and sprinkling the seed on the ground, but now I also placed a bowl of seed as well as a bowl of water at the edge of the grass about 15 ft from my door. The ducks (I started calling her Momma Duck and never really gave the handsome, silky green-necked male a name) quickly learned the bowls were theirs and they came every morning. Then twice a day\u2014morning and evening. I had no idea where they came from since there was no body of water anywhere around that I could think of, but it became obvious, they weren\u2019t going away. They were my twice-a-day visitors and I found myself looking forward to their visits. As days and weeks passed, they let me get closer, and I found it both humorous and chivalrous that the male would \u201cstand guard\u201d while Momma Duck ate and drank and only when she was finished would he dine. Often, they would hang out in my back yard, pecking at the grass, or just \u201changing out\u201d for sometimes up to an hour before heading off to parts unknown. As cool weather set in, they finally departed and I wished them well, glad to have been able to spend time with them, however limited. Until the next summer, when they returned\u2026 and then the next\u2026 Although after the third summer I noticed the male was different and much more hesitant to approach, Momma Duck was the same and she permitted me to get within almost touching distance. Occasionally the bowls would be empty\u2014or too empty for their liking\u2014and Momma began coming directly up to my back door and quacking until I came to fill the bowls. Once I opened the door, she would waddle almost directly next to me toward the bowls while I intoned the words \u201cMomma Duck\u201d over and over so she learned to recognize my voice. If my husband or one of my friends tried to come out with me, both ducks grew nervous and backed away, but once I started the \u201cMomma Duck\u201d sound, she would come toward me and escort me toward the bowls. This continued for six or seven years and then, one summer, Momma appeared alone. I called her by name as I placed the bowls and she ate and drank, and then she was gone. And I never saw either of them again. ",

He also knows my voice, and will respond to it if he can hear me from the other room. He won't do that for other people. And oddly enough, my cough and sniffle. If I sniffle loud or cough while coming up the stairs to my apartment, he'll respond. Doesn't make a peep when anyone else comes up the stairs. Also, any time I fart in the middle of the night, he typically lets out a little chirp. That always amuses me in the middle of the night. \u201cbrrap.\u201d \u201cpeep!\u201d I also took some fledgling crows out of the yard to the Audubon society after one of them died and my roommate kept threatening to throw them all in the street.

            "answer_text": "At least some species do. Parrots, certainly. Pet parrots bond closely with their preferred human and will often exhibit jealousy when that person is close to another human, or pine if their person leaves or dies. It is also well known that the Australian magpie recognises faces. Some males of the species are known to attack people who stray too close to their nest during breeding season. This attack is in the form of dive-bombing people, or \"swooping\". People can lose an eye. There is even an online register of attacking magpies (not all the males do it). But the way to ensure your local magpie will not attack you is to feed him, he will not attack the person who feeds or befriends him. One family not far from me befriended a juvenile magpie; he visited them daily over a period of many months and became very close. He helped their recovery after major trauma; the story is now a book and I understand a movie may be filmed. He was given the name of Penguin, due to his smart black-and-white plumage. ",

The crows then for 5 years attaked people wearing the same mask in the area. It wasn\u2019t even just the crows that were abused, their offspring and other crows joined in too showing that they can disseminate information about individual humans. In a different experiment pigeons were fed by one person and then chased by another. Neither wore masks but after a few days they swapped clothing and stopped chasing/feeding them, to see if the pigeons recognized the clothes or the human wearing them. They ignored the clothing and were still friendly to the feeder person but vary cautious about the chaser. They can definitely recognize individual humans. ",

They also have favorite activities, such as going for car rides, and perching in the shower.
