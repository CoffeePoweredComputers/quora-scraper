            "answer_text": "Who would win in a fight between a tiger and a moose? Unless the Moose got very lucky the tiger would have plenty of food for about a week to ten days. Lets get real guys the Tiger is a predator, and in the areas where there are both Tigers and Moose (Siberia, Kamchatka?).. the Tiger Preys on the Moose. Now, what kills most wolves? I\u2019ll tell you the game that they hunt. When a Moose or Elk or Bison kicks you in the jaw or ribs and you have no support structure, no access to medical (veterinary) help you starve to death and die. That is just a hard fact of nature. If any of those big three kick you in the jaw it breaks your jaw. The Elk is the smallest of the trio, but it still packs a heck of a wallop. We haven\u2019t even talked yet about what if that big bruiser who weighs nearly a ton (Moose or Bison) what if it catches you on the ground stunned and comes down on top of your tigerish ribs or pelvis. Well, if it does something is going to break and you can\u2019t run very fast or leap very far with broken ribs or cracked pelvis. Guys, please understand that when these animals fight it is for survival. The Tiger needs food so it sneaks up near the moose and attacks when the Moose is not looking and it has the best chance of success. The Moose just doesn\u2019t want to be dinner. Being accommodating would ruin its life, and when you die from a Tiger It isn\u2019t clean like getting shot through the heart by a bullet. Oh no, you first get clawed when the Tiger catches you, then the Tiger grabs you by the throat and you slowly suffocate from a crushed Larynx. The Tiger\u2019s teeth aren\u2019t strong enough to rip your throat out, but they are plenty strong to keep you from breathing until you\u2019re dead. ",

            "answer_text": "Good question. Tigers have been reported to hunt Moose in Siberia, but their overlap is small and their interaction rare. I think it depends on the tiger and moose; the tiger\u2019s experience, size, and tactics vs the moose\u2019s size, gender, and time of a year. Gaur are a very good analogy: they are also giant ungulates; they have killed tigers, but a seasoned and fortunate tiger will take them as prey. I think a moose would far similarly. This tiger successfully used cover to get a throat bite before the prey could fight  This tiger was caught in the open and forced to flee  So I think a full grown bull moose in the summer would be impregnable in a head on fight, but a tiger can bring him down with cover. Wolves hunt moose in the winter; the moose lack their antlers, and can get stuck in the snow. Likewise, they prefer cows and calves. Tigers have the same preferences with the cattle they eat. ",
