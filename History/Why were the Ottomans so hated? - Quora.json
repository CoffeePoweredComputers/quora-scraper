            "answer_text": "In my opinion they were hated and have earned that hate because of their cultural and historic association with the Mongols. That is the first reason. Mongols are known to have been mass murderers who just killed people on massive scale. Ottomans were their allies and used the same tactics and strategy when they arrived to Turkey under leadership of Osman. They also looted and pillaged surrounding areas on fast horses and superior bows. Another reason is that they rather aggressively practiced abduction of and sale of slaves. Particularly from Eastern Europe. I want to not that they were not the only people who owned and bought slaves. But they were really into raiding and enslaving people. In combination with their violent tactics as borrowed from the Mongols, they also were Muslims whose ethical values and religious views were very different from Christianity practiced in areas they pillaged. Another reason is their constant attempts to capture land from lands where people didn\u2019t provoke them at all. Finally, what I can think of is that they are known to have mismanaged the lands they captured by installing governors who failed to develop the areas and generally left them poor and failed to produce wealth through their management It is very similar to Mongols as well who collected tribute from their vassal states and didn\u2019t spend it to build much infrastructure. I want to add that the Ottoman do not only have bad reputation from the Europeans but also from the other Muslim people whom they subjugated in middle east. ",

            "answer_text": "Some ignorants blame jealousy or \u201craycism\u201d. Actually, the answer is as simple as that, like in most of the questions about real life. Ottomans invaded their neighbors, with lots of cruelty. When they conquered Cosntantinople, they massacred 4000 bizantines, enslaved much more, impaled dozens of prisoners, plundered the city and turn a christian master-piece, Hagia Sophia Church, into a mosque. Imagine that happing in many more villages and cities. The same Mehmmet II who took Constantinople, conquered Otranto, an italian city, killing 12 000 inhabitants and enslaving 5000. 800 captives were beheaded for refusing to convert to islam. Muslim enemies werent very happy with them: Murad IV killed about 25 000 when he conquered Bagdad. Impaling was a very cruel and painful punishment, which the ottomans loved to use. Saying \u201cthe others were cruel too\u201d sounds a weak excuse to such a cruel system. Besides, they had no family values. Their sultans had the right to kill their brothers, sons and nephews to avoid fights for power. Selim, the Grim, killed 3 of his 4 sons. Mehmmet III killed 19 brothers and his late father\u00b4 10 pregnant concubines, etc. The Golden Cage was a jailed where many princes were isolated from the world. Their sanity and socialbility werent the best when and if they were released. Search about Murdad IV, the Cruel, a crazy bloothirsty tyrants, brother of Ibrahim, the Mad (he killed 280 concubines because he beleived one cheated on him and he didn know who).  Bloodthirsty tyrant loves red. Abdul Hamid II, the Damned, massacred hundreds of thousands of armenians and greeks.  And the Armenian Genocide, in 1915, committed at same time as the Assirian genocide? Turks still refuse to admit it. ",
