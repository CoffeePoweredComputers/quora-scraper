            "answer_text": "Attempts to identify Nimrod with an Assyrian or Mesopotamian king are like attempts to identify the figure of \u201cDarius the Mede\u201d in the book of Daniel with a historical ruler - doomed to failure. Speiser felt that Tukulti-Ninurta (1233\u20131197 BCE) was the most likely historical candidate because he enjoyed notable military success, conquered Babylon and ruled over both Babylonia and Assyria simultaneously. However, Speiser conveniently ignores the fact that the same can be said of many other middle-Assyrian kings. See: Assyria - Wikipedia List of Assyrian kings - Wikipedia Additionally, there are several reasons why the reign of Tukulti-Ninurta can\u2019t be identified with the figure of Nimrod described in Genesis: Nimrod\u2019s father Nimrod\u2019s father is Cush in Genesis 10. The Hebrew is literally \u201cCush begat (or \u201cbore\u201d) Nimrod\u201d (cf vv13, 15, 24 (twice) and 25). Although other sons of Cush are mentioned in a preceding verse, Nimrod is evidently singled out because of his special significance: more text is devoted to Nimrod than to any other character in this chapter. While Speiser attributes the dissimilarity between the names Tukulti-Ninurta and Nimrod to (a rather unlikely) abbreviation, it is difficult to reconcile the names and characteristics of their fathers: Shalmaneser I and Cush. The First Centres of his Kingdom Genesis states that the first centres of [Nimrod\u2019s] kingdom were Babylon, Uruk, Akkad and Kalneh, in Shinar [i.e. Babylonia]. Although Tukulti-Ninurta conquered Babylon around eight years into his reign, the first major military action of this Assyrian king was against the Hittite empire - quite the opposite of the picture painted in Genesis. Genesis also implies that Nimrod was of Babylonian rather than Assyrian origins. This hardly agrees with the actions of a king who scandalously plundered the temples of Babylon and carried the cult statue of Marduk back to his Assyrian homeland. Additionally, we know that no single ruler founded Uruk, Akkad and Babylon, and that these cities were established across vastly different time periods (mid-fourth millennium to early second millennium BCE). Assyria Building on the suggestion that Nimrod was of Babylonian rather than Assyrian origins, Genesis states: From that land [i.e. Shinar / Babylonia] he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah, and Resen\u2026 Genesis specifically states that Nimrod \u2018built\u2019 Ninevah - a settlement that dates back to 6000 BCE and had become a major cult centre by 3000 BCE - completely out of sync with the 13th century BCE reign of Tukulti-Ninurta. While many Assyrian kings of the late third and second millennium engaged in construction projects at Ninevah, in the relevant period it is Shalmaneser I who is known for work on the city rather than his son Tukulti-Ninurta (who seems to have focused his building activity on a new capital - Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta). Once again it was Shalmaneser - not Tukulti-Ninurta - who founded Calah. Of course, this is only a problem for those who read Genesis ten as history. If it is read as a folkloric, etiological account of national and tribal origins then one of the historical Assyrian or Babylonian kings may indeed have been a loose model for the composite, fictional character of Nimrod.
