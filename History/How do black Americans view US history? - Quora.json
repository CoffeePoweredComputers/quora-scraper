            "answer_text": "Black Americans are all through American history, its just that until recently the representation has been very low. Juan Garrido was born in West Africa around 1480. According to the historians Ricardo Alegria and Jane Landers, Garrido's notarized \"probanza\" (his curriculum vitae, more or less), dated 1538, says he moved from Africa to Lisbon, Portugal, of his own volition as a free man, stayed in Spain for seven years, and then, seeking his fortune and perhaps a bit of fame, he joined the earliest conquistadors to the New World. All the sworn witnesses to this document affirm that Garrido was \"horro,\" or free, when he arrived in Spain. Sailing from Seville around 1508, he arrived on the island of La Espa\u00f1ola, which is today called Hispaniola, the island on which the Dominican Republic and Haiti reside. He later settled in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Garrido is the first documented black person to arrive in this country, and he is also the first black conquistador. And like the other conquistadors, Garrido soon succumbed to the lure of wealth and fame in the New World. He joined Diego Velazquez de Cu\u00e9llar and the legendary Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n in the colonizations of Cuba and Puerto Rico, respectively. Then, in 1513, he joined de Le\u00f3n's well-known expedition to Florida in search of the Fountain of Youth, when he became the first known African to arrive in this country. On March 5, 1770, British soldiers opened fire on a group of unarmed American protesters, killing 5 (either 3 or 4 immediately, one dying later), an event referred to as The Boston Massacre, sometimes called the first shots fired in the American Revolutionary War. The first American gunned down was Crispus Attucks, a freeman of African and Native American descent. ",
