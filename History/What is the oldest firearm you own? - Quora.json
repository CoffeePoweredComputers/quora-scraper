            "answer_text": "Mine are practically state-of-the-art technology wise compared to the others I\u2019ve seen posted on Quora. I don\u2019t know exactly which of the two is the oldest, but I believe my Smith is, but I do know they\u2019re both from the late 1890s.  This is a Smith & Wesson New Departure in .38 S&W, double action only and with a grip safety. With its microscopic sights and long, hard, heavy trigger pull, one would be lucky to hit a very, very large man from even card table distance. It\u2019s perfect mechanically, although the picture doesn\u2019t show the pitting and rust it has on the finish, especially on its other side.  This is a Springfield Jorgensen-Krag in .30\u201340 Govt. It has a fairly low serial number, but have never been able to determine when it was made. It\u2019s got a lot of rust and pitting on the metal, but aside from a lot of dents and dings, the stock is in remarkably good shape. Given the fact that this old lady was designed with only a single locking lug on its bolt, I\u2019ve fired it only a few times, and then only after it was thoroughly examined by a superb gunsmith. Given the design, I don\u2019t want to tempt fate and wouldn\u2019t fire this gun much even if it were brand new and made from more modern steel. This rifle was owned by a great-great-great uncle who never got to Cuba and spent most of his enlistment in Florida. He also never had any offspring, so it was handed down to his nephew, then his son, etc. ",

            "answer_text": "Now you got me started! I am partial to old guns, especially those with military lineage, but I am a beginner as a collector. I do, however, have a few pieces I like to talk about. My oldest pistol is a .25 caliber Model 1920 Beretta made in 1919. I also have a .25 Beretta Jetfire pocket pistol of uncertain vintage. My best military pistol is a FN Model 1922 manufactured in Belgium during the Nazi occupation, attested to by the \u201cReichs adler\u201d and ordnance bureau inspector proof marks clearly stamped into the slide and receiver. The hearsay family legend accompanying it is that it came home from Europe with a soldier who got it from an Italian officer who surrendered to his unit, along with a well-worn original holster that lends credence to the story. Mosin-Nagant 91/30s are common and cheap, but some are better than others, and they all seem to come slathered in cosmoline. I was browsing through a rack of them in Virginia a few years ago and found a pre-WW II example manufactured in 1938 when the Russians were still using brass bands on the forearms and the machining was of high quality. Cleaned up, it turned out to be a beauty. I also ran managed to acquire a very good example of a Japanese 7.7 mm Arisaka last ditch rifle, complete with the Imperial chrysanthemum emblem. The parts\u2019 serial numbers match, so it is not a \u201cFrankenstein\u201d gun, and the metal parts are well above the quality of run of the mill last ditch rifles, but the stock and forearm definitely qualify it for that status. I just wish I had found it before somebody removed the wooden butt plate and put a rubber recoil pad on it. The dealer who sold it to me let me have it and the bayonet for the price he was asking for the bayonet. Its wood is ugly, but it shoots just fine. (I found some Hornady 7.7mm softpoint ammo for it at a reasonable price from Selway Armory, a great on-line source in Missoula, Montana, and look forward to hunting with it soon.) My 1944 Lee Enfield .303 Model 4, Mark I Longbranch rifle, made in Canada toward the end of WW II, suffers from insensitive abuse of its wooden parts by someone who recognized its value as a shooting iron but not its historical value. It is a really nice shooting rifle, despite having been \u201csporterized\u201d somewhere along the way. I am still looking for a set of military wood parts to restore it to its original state. I am struck by the way memories and stories surrounding family heirloom guns can bind generations together. When my younger brother (younger by 11 months and in the same grade in school) and I were boys, our dad had a Savage single barrel, break action, full-choke shotgun with a 28-inch barrel that he bought sometime in the \u201840s. It was a great squirrel gun, and his newer shotgun was a Stevens model 311A, with improved cylinder bore on one side and modified choke on the other. Both were in 16 gauge, and he gave the double barrel to me and the single barrel to my brother when we turned 12. His replacement was a Remington model 1100 (also 16 gauge) that went to our youngest brother when dad passed away. I am 66 now, so I have had my Stevens for 54 years and still shoot it. All three are still in the family, and I have carried my Stevens all over the country and even overseas during a long Army career. I must have re-blued it a half dozen times over the years, and I am still as proud of it as I was the day Dad gave it to me. ",
