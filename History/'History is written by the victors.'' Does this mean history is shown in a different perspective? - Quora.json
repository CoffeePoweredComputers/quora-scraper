            "answer_text": "Yes, History is written by the victors and their point of view is what goes by the name \u201cHistory\u201d. Nowhere does this one-sided view reflect more clearly than in the India of today. The reason for that maybe that the victors remained victors and managed to grab and stay in power for 60\u201365 long years and made no room for what the others had to say. The starkest reminder of this is the belief among the Indians that India is just 70 years old. Yes, Search any answer and you will find this underlying assumption in a majority of them as if this great land appeared from above on 15th August 1947 and everything was filth out there before. The truth is that the nationstate \u201cIndia\u201d came into existence on 15th Aug-1947 and India is more a civilization of 5000 years than a nation formed by drafting a new map and a centralised power centre. You will find trolls making fun of this point of view that India is just 70 year old and it was just a princely state of 550 rulers. True, but then I can\u2019t understand why the British named their company \u201cEast India Company\u201d some 250 years back. The real challenge to these view points come when the competing view points come to power and challenge their point of view by showing in new light the events which transpired. Beware when the great God lets loose a thinker on this planet, then all things are at risk and all family fiefdoms risk a mighty fall. In their version of History, there are unsung heroes whose efforts were wiped out. There are heroes who are shown as side-characters when actually they were at the centre. They wish Subhash Chandra Bose & Patel were of lesser stature so that they could have simply made them disappear from our text books. They already made out this freedom fight to be a very non-violent one while the real toll in terms of violence was huge. They did not give due credit to the violent armed struggle which was going on side by side the non-violent movement simply because they cannot bring a particular family into the centre of this narrative. So much for one family that the history of the oldest civilizations they tamper with. The glorious this civilization appears, the less glorious their leaders may appear compared to the likes of Shivaji Maharaj, Rana Pratap & Samrat Ashok. The glorious the pre-existing values and philosophy of India appears, the less appealing will the philosophy of foreign invaders appear.  The glorious the economy of the ancient country appears (richest country till 17th century with highest GDP), the lesser the credit for them to have moved them on the path of progress. Their strategy was - Be ashamed of your legacy you Indians ! Otherwise how will you realise how much good our leader and his family did for your country and raised it from filth to a rising power. So much for one family ! ",

If you have power to control the present, you control the past which in turn controls the future. Thanks for A2A. The quote stated in the question by Winston Churchill, the man who is held responsible (by some historians) for death of lakhs of Indians due to the virtual famine created by him. Such is the perceived personna of the person from whom these lines came. History is, in many ways, written by victors. Consider the example of great battles. World Wars would have been differently viewed if Germany had won. There would have been no references of genocides and atrocities done by Germans. Just like today we hear of very few war crimes of the victors such as USA, UK. Even in mythologies such as Hindu, the victor is always the Devtas i.e. Gods. But as some of the texts state that the demons or rakshasas are not entirely bad. Coming to the question, history is usually distorted by the ruling class. In India, the British Raj had very cunningly proved ancient and medieval India to be filled with despotism. It was much later that this theory of oriental despotism of India and China was debunked by Asian historians much later. Later the same historians created a pro-community historical base by giving emphasis on a specific section of the history.[1] In India itself, Hindu communal elements looked up and propagated the ideals of pre-Islamic era of golden ages of Guptas, and even the Vedic age for which not much proof is archaeologically available while ignoring the contributions of Islamic region in terms of art, architecture and other fine arts. If you look closely, history is often used as a tool of suppression, communalisation as in the above case. Even today we can see some of the politicians falsely using Manu Smriti,a text of ancient Vedic age of India to justify their actions. Let alone history, even the media in today's world is bound to be affected by the powerful people of the area. Many newspapers are biased in view towards one party or another. But whatever maybe the case, facts of history always remain for historians to clear out the myths and false information. The necessity of unbiased, neutral historical accounting can not be overstated. \"Traitors who prevail are patriots; usurpers who succeed are divine emperors.\u201d \u2014Gore Vidal, Julian Footnotes[1] Redirect Notice",
