            "answer_text": "Are you kidding me? You're wearing 70 pounds of metal, or more, if you're taller than 5\u20327. You're riding a horse going 25mph at another person holding a lance 8 feet long and heavier than you realized it would be, in to what is essentially a car crash. For honor. The \u201csafe\u201d lance was, if you visualize, a spear tip split into four tips; this was the \u201csafe\" version. Athletic wise these were the NFL players of their day. It was expenses to participate. You earned money and fame. All at the expense of serious injury. Most notably Henry VIII went forward in to a jousting match with his visor up. He was struck there. He suffered severe migraines as a result. Another time his horse collapsed on him and the weight of the horse and its armor, Henry and his armor, exacerbated his pre existing ulcers in his leg. A condition between it and the migraines naturally required opium some scholars speculate. I visited W\u00e4rtburg castle. The hall where the knights would dine every evening was complete with a large fireplace hearth and a heated floor; one would remove their probably wet socks and enjoy the heat underfoot. They were served pounds of meat, up to 8 pints of ale, potatoes, greens, baked bread. These professional athletes of their day, in many cases, were treated with the best facilities we see today in college football or the NFL. And the only reason this would have been done\u2026. To answer your question is yes. These men who were knights were very athletically capable and the resources spent on them speak to this truth. The gear they sported equals the equivalent of a brand new fully loaded Chevy Tahoe, some 50-60k per knight in todays money. This would hardly have been spent on someone incapable. We do know that size wise German knights were roughly 3-6 inches taller than their Italian counterpart and in Roman times used this advantage to smash through roman lines, sometimes but not always, to their advantage. Knights were very athletic. You could find knights between 5\u20336 and 6\u20334 during their era. All of them capable athletes in their day. You wouldnt take an NFL linebacker head on, nor would you take him head on riding a horse with a sword. These were sporting men who also played indoor tennis in their spare time as well as wrestling. I hope this leads you in the right track. ",

            "answer_text": "Never ridden a horse much have you?There are different types of athleticism. For instance a study was once done in the 1980's that showed Motorcross riders were some of if not the most fit athletes. Horsing around several hundred pounds of dirt bike is pretty taxing. I had a friend who did that and he was a stellar baseball player. I saw him run to the right field gap from center field, go horizontal about five feet off the ground to catch a line drive and end a tournament game we won. So a medieval knight had to be athletic to sit a horse and wear about 30lbs of armor. Then he had to couch a lance and aim it when necessary. And he had to swing a sword or other short weapon for long periods if necessary. Archaeologists can usually tell warriors from medieval remains from their musculature development. Muscle attachments leave impressions in the bone. These are called entheses or muscle attachment scars. The greater the muscle strength and size the greater the attachment scar. So by looking at skeletal remains, they can see unbalanced muscular development, say like overdeveloped muscle scars on the right arm of a blacksmith or on a right handed knight. By looking at these on the entire body, they can tell if someone had strong legs, stronger legs than average say, or broader shoulders or chest.Since warriors particularly knights were of the equestrian class they lived and ate better than your average farmer levy called up to fight. They trained more so they would be expected to be more heavily muscled. This is corroborated by battlefield archaeology and forensics. Needless to say the average knight did not look like your average employee at an IT company. I know I worked in that field for 19 years and most of my coworkers were pencil necks and never saw the inside of a gym. Out of around one hundred, I only saw two in the gym over nearly ten years.Research into European fighting systems show that not only did they learn how to use a sword, lance and other weapons, they also learned grappling techniques similar to judo, where the sword was used not only to cut, but to entangle, hook trip and strike the opponent with the hilt. So yes, I would say they were athletic. ",
