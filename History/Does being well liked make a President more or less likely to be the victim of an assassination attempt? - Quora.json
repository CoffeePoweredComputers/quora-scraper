            "answer_text": "Original Question: Does being well liked make a President more or less likely to be the victim of an assassination attempt?  Overall popularity probably does not matter. One could argue that a very popular President would be more likely to be the subject of an assassination attempt by a lone nut such as John Hinckley, jr., but we forget that in 1981 Reagan was still a very divisive figure and not nearly as popular as he would be in 1984. At the same time, nobody could successfully argue that Hinckley\u2019s assassination attempt on Reagan was politically motivated. Hinckley was clearly delusional and thought that assassinating Reagan would impress his celebrity crush, Jodie Foster. The assassinations of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley, and Kennedy clearly had a political component to them. Only Kennedy\u2019s assassination was likely to be purely political. Most of the assassination attempts have been by lone persons who suffered from diagnosable mental illness. One side note, the assassination of former Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak in January 1933 may not have been an assassination attempt on President-Elect Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It may have been directed at Cermak. Historians disagree over which is true. My dad however, knew a Chicago Police Officer who was on the force at the time. That PO said, \u201cThey had no trouble getting us to go to the funeral. We wanted to make sure the sonofabitch was actually dead.\u201d Cermak was not particularly well loved. ",
