In Tamil \u201cKadavul\u201d means \u201cGOD\u201d. Here \u2018Kada\u2019 means \u2018pass through\u2019 and \u2018ul\u2019 means \u2018inside\u201d. That is \u2018pass through inside\u2019. Everything is available there. Donot try to possess it. Don\u2019t rely too much on books for wisdom which is different from knowledge. Whatever possible to bring into a book only available. Start with J.Krishnamurthy\u2019s Truth and Actuality. ",
