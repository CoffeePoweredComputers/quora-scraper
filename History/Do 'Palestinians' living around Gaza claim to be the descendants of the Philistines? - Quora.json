            "answer_text": "Today - yes. But this was not the case. Between 1918 - 1948 (the time frame of the British Mandate in the region) economic growth was exploding - as a result of both the British investment and the prosperity created by the Jewish community. Hundreds of thousands of Arabs immigrated (mainly from Egypt and Syria), making the local Arab population larger by hundreds of percents. But then, in 1948, when the British left the region following the UN \u2018s(late 1947) vote for the establishment of 2 states, only 1 state was established: Israel. The Palestinians refused to set up a state of their own as long as Israel exists. They collaborated with armies of 7 Arab countries who invaded the tiny Israel in order to physically annihilate the Israelis. They failed. This created the \u201crefugees\u201d problem (most of them were Egyptians and others, but the Arab countries REFUSED to get them back so as to create international pressure on Israel). Until 1964 they were considered just \u201crefugees\u201d, not as a people. The Arab countries themselves did not see them as a people (Egypt controlled the GAza strip and did not treat them as a people; Jordan occupied the West Bank and did not treat them as a people). With time they understood that adopting history and identity is the best weapon, just as the Jews were proud to renew their ancestral holy land of Zion. This is how the legend as born. Truth is, of course, absolutely different. As for your question of the Biblical Philistines - they were Greeks who invaded the holy land, but since they has no special identity they were assimilated with all of the historic changes that the middle east went through. They do not exist for thousands of years\u2026 Again - the Palestinians are, by majority, descendants of Egyptians, Syrians and others, who immigrated to the holy land during the British mandate. Others are tribes that lived in the area, but no national identity ever existed (until the last 30\u201340 years where this is an excellent story in the UN). ",

NOT A SINGLE NATION LIVED THEIR OR CREATED CITIES . No tradeNo silk roadNo conquerorsNo nothing, it was simply EMPTY \u2026 2000 years \u2026\u2026\u2026 Although - miraculously- it links 3 continents ( Europe, Asia, Africa) \u2026 what about Jewish people?, Even will respected Jewish scholars admit that their is nothing called pure jewish nation, one most know is Shlomo Sand, the author of the most controversial study \u201cThe Invention of the Jewish People\u201d. Returning to the main question, Do \"Palestinians\" living around Gaza claim to be the descendants of the Philistines? Yes they do.why?Because they are the descendants of all the people lived there for the last 4000 years",

The Philistines were a Greek sea people, most likely Mycenian, who carved out a kingdom for themselves along the northern coast of what are now the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip and a portion of the southern coast of Israel, up to what is now Ashdod, more or less. This kingdom existed from around 1,200 BCE to the middle of the 8th century BCE, disappearing from history some 1,400 years before the Muslim invasion from the Arabian Peninsula. Any connection between the present day Arabs who call themselves \u201cPalestinians\u201d and the Greek \u201cPhilistines\u201d is a fabrication, not based on any archeological, historical, cultural or genetic facts.
