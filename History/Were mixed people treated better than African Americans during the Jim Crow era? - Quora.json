            "answer_text": "For clarification, I\u2019d have to ask, treated better by whom \u2014 African Americans or white Americans? Also, be aware that \u201cmixed\u201d people were considered black (or Negro or colored back then). In the black community, people with lighter skin tended to be more successful financially because of historical reasons. Because they were the ones more likely to be the doctors, attorneys, and other professionals, they tended to be looked up too. People doing manual labor, or the kinds of jobs that relegated a person to poverty and subjected him/her to the worst casual abuses by white bigots, almost always were darker skinned. This wasn\u2019t always the case, but generally, it was. In the white community, it also depended on the circumstances. Since mixed people were still considered black, the Jim Crow laws that applied to any other black person applied to them as well. But just as lighter skinned professionals were regarded highly by other black people, they were also sometimes treated better on a person-to-person basis by whites. I should add that the things that triggered the most abuse by white bigots was not the color of one\u2019s skin, but the intent or display of a person\u2019s desire to make things more equal for black people \u2014 to defy and/or overturn Jim Crow laws. For people who participated openly in the Civil Rights movement, it didn\u2019t matter how light or dark they were. They were equally abused. Now, to cloud the picture a bit, some lighter skinned black people were treated well by some white people because they were kin. My great grandmother, whose grandfather was a white Gamble, was recognized by other white Gambles in her home county as being one of them, even though they really didn\u2019t have to. They also acknowledged her children, to include my grandfather. ",

            "answer_text": "Yes, I believe they were. One reason for this is the practice of `passing` That is, looking racially ambiguous enough to get away with passing as a member of a another race to escape Jim Crow laws. One of the most notable men to do this was this guy. . .  Korla Pandit, an Indian musician who is, in actuality, John Roland Redd, a black musician who grew up in Missouri. He carried this persona until the day he died, and can be read about here. A considerable measure of his success can be attributed to the fact that people thought he was Indian. Situations like this are a pretty strong argument, even today for the difference of opportunity and achievement among black people and immigrants. How a Black Man From Missouri Transformed Himself Into the Indian Liberace There were also such practices as 9 to 5 passing, in which a black person of sufficient hue could pass as white to get better working opportunities, but returned to the black community at the end of the working day. I\u2019m not 100% sure on this and need to do more research, but it seems a fair conclusion to say that black people who passed were treated better by the white majority, at least in terms of employment. But all that went out the window if it was found out that they had black ancestry. It does say a lot about our nation that if you are perceived as an immigrant or mixed person passing as another race that you have more opportunities than a black person. A whole lot. Questions Welcome. . .Anything Untoward though. . .  Let\u2019s just say I\u2019m waiting. ",
