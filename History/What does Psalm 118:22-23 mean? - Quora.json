When the Priests and Scribes sought to trick Jesus as to the where the source of his authority came he applied this scripture ti himself at Luke 20:17 But he looked straight at them and said: \u201cWhat, then, does this mean where it is written: \u2018The stone that the builders rejected, this has become the chief cornerstone\u2019? Acts 4:10,11 confirms this: let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ the Naz\u00b7a\u00b7rene\u02b9, whom you executed on a stake but whom God raised up from the dead, by means of him this man stands here healthy in front of you. This is \u2018the stone that was treated by you builders as of no account that has become the chief cornerstone.\u2019 See also Ephesians 2:20 and 1 Peter 2:4\u20137 ",

            "answer_text": "During the building of Solomon\u2019s temple the stones were all cut at the rock quarry. The one directing the work of the building selected the stones and had them cut the proper size and shape needed. They were then delivered to the building site where they would be placed together without having to shape them any more. The one chosen by the \u201carchitect\u201d to be the chief cornerstone was sent to the building site long before it was needed. The ones assembling the stones did not know where it was to fit, so they \u201crefused\u201d it and set it aside. Later on they realized that it was the to be the chief corner stone. In the New Testament this stone is used as a symbol of Jesus. The One who was rejected became the Chief of God\u2019s building. ",
