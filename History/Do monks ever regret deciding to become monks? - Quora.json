            "answer_text": "An Ancient Story Two student monks were walking in a town, ages ago, far away. They were both handsome young men, but they were serious about becoming absolutely aware of their inner spirits. The monastery in which they lived and took instruction had very strict rules of behavior for its students. A hot rain had been falling all morning, but at last the sun had come out, and everything was glistening with a coating of pure water. The marketplace was filled with noise and bustle, and the streets were very muddy. Only under the woven thatched awnings of the storefronts of the streets were there any dry paths. They came upon a lovely lady attired in expensive clothing, holding a delicate hand painted parasol. Everything about this woman was refined and spoke of wealth and knowledge of the world and its many ways. It was obvious to the monks that she was trying to cross the road without getting her clothes dirty, but it was impossible. She stood there in a perfect moment as the sun echoed in thousands of small puddles from foot and hoof prints. Suddenly, the taller of the monks swept the woman and her beauty up in his arms and carried her safely across the road. Afterwards, they went back to their monastery rooms to meditate before the evening''s rituals. As they sat down together, the shorter monk finally spoke his mind, saying, \"I cannot understand your actions! We are monks! We do not go near females--especially beautiful women who are experienced with the ways of the life that we have put behind us. That was dangerous. Why did you do that?\" The taller monk settled into his meditative pose, and just before he closed his eyes, he looked at his friend, and said, \"I left the girl there on the side of the street. Are you still carrying her?\" Questions To Bolster Clarity: What do I hold on to? What do I cling to that obsesses me?What power does the past have on me? To what errors do I still give my precious attention? What thoughts do I run over and over again?If I cling to and judge myself by my past, what am I telling others in subtle ways to also do to me? How can I expect them to judge me as I am today -- now -- if I continue to judge myself by my past? Why would they treat me any differently?When I want to memorize something what do I do?When I think of something I did years ago, am I doing it again? Am I \"burning in\" the experience so that my nervous system can more easily remember it?When a memory happens to me, how much is that a voluntary action? What happens to memories in which I am not that much interested when they occur? Can I treat all memories equally? Must I have different rules for different types of memories?If I had a sudden attack of amnesia, how much time would that save me each day?If I met a perfect person, on what would that person's attention be placed when considering me, and what would I still be carrying in my arms?",

            "answer_text": "If you talk about Hindu Monks (Sannyasi), I\u2019ve seen a few of my friends (who were celibate from birth, never married) went to (what we call)world back. In most cases it was a wish to live happily, since you don\u2019t get many things to rejoice in monk-hood; or to have pleasure; or to help someone. Since, Hindu Monks are not very organized, they find it difficult to stay at a place(Ashrama, Matha, Monastery); since a person who only meditates or studies and eats, is useless for those places/organizations. They find it difficult to move constantly for ever, to store scriptures which they love, etc. with passing time. Some of my friends who studied Scriptures/Philosophy to become an orator, started earning money and then married some girl. So, yes they felt loneliness and lack of stable/normal/family life. Some of them were no more feeling the heat of renunciation, some were frustrated by corrupt behavior of other Monks/Pontiff/Guru, some were feeling that Philosophies were just words and can\u2019t quench the thirst, etc. Some were in contact with family, and when they knew that their whole family has collapsed and only old mother/relative is alive and needs help; they either went back permanently or helped them time to time. So, for different reasons they regret taking the vow for different period of time and that decides the path they choose for future. In old times and even now in traditional circle, a person leaving robes is not seen as a good person, and they have a special term for him ArUDha-patita, one who fell down after climbing. So, some of such monks never leave robes and either stay confused for whole life or spend life to find a way to cheat or they just evaporate for ever to live according to wish. ",

            "answer_text": "A question close to me and my life though I am not a monk. I am 40, unmarried till now (by choice), work in a more or less medium sized mining company that falls under the Govt. Sector, have parents (dad is 73, mom is 67, both retired from service with a comfortable pension). I have often had this urge, a hunger within my mind to know the Big Picture, I felt a communion with Nature, a deep call from the other side. I was good at painting, writing poetry, could sing well, a good sportsman. As I grew up, I faced several challenges, I was busy overcoming or trying to overcome my personal life challenges. All things said and done, the desire to marry never hit me, it was like\u2026I am ok being single. I often used to think of joining a monkhood order that is well known not only in my country India but also throughout the world, since it serves the society in ways like flood relief, old age homes, feeding the poor etc, and draws its inspiration from the iconic 19th Century Indian monk Swami Vivekananda, who left his indelible mark on not only America (Chicago speech) but also millions all around the world. But whenever I thought of joining the monkhood, I would feel concerned about - \u201cOnce I leave, who will look after my parents\u201d, yes, now they are ageing, and at least I can visit them taking leaves from my job\u2026\u2026 I feel, not all monks regret, but as far as myself is concerned, I would have regretted only for one thing had I become a monk.. Who would take care of my old parents once I go.. That's why though not a monk, I lead the life with minimum bare necessities, almost spartan. I don't operate Facebook, nor Twitter. I work hard, gym harder, run a lot. I try to meditste, somewhat now I can meditate better. I love animals, I feed many dogs on the street that are hungry, cats, cows, birds too. For me God speaks through all of them. This is my monkhood. ",

Most of them work through it, some of them suffer with it indefinitely, others leave the life for short periods of time, or permanently. A few, of course, have never wanted to do anything else and never regretted a day of it... Vive la diff\u00e9rence! Being a monastic is partly an odd sort of career and partly an odd sort of lifestyle choice, which makes it pretty much like anything else people do with their lives. Almost everyone reaches a point, sooner or later, where they get to the \"what ifs\" and question the choices they've made in life. For monastics those can be particularly rough moments, both because monastics sacrifice more than most people for their choices, and aim for far higher ideals than most people aim for. But that is life... ",

For most of them, they miss human intimacy, honest sexuality, and human contact in general.  The orders in all religions can grow against the heart instead of growing deeper in the heart.  Discipline for its own sake can be an obstacle to discovering the vast lightness of being which spirituality is all about.  It is a rare order in all religions these days which is growing genuine roots in the Divine garden within and not just putting people into another box of limitations instead of heart full freedom....
