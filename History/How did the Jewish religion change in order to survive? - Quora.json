            "answer_text": "Judaism is the only religion that has lasted as long (though there are few up there in longevity - the Chinese people and Zoroastrian) and has had such a huge imprint on today\u2019s and history\u2019s society. So the question is a good one. Judaism is based on the Tanach (the whole bible) and the talmud. We learn out from both that there are 613 mitvot - laws that guide our lives, decisions, our way of viewing the world. The Talmud though written down is continuously being updated, re-examined, and understood. It is not a black and white law book, but a fluid one. On the other hand, it isn\u2019t being changed, removed or discarded. Let me give you an example. It says clearly in the Torah (first 5 books of Moses) that on Shabbat one can\u2019t make a fire. There are actually 39 laws specifically against being done on Shabbat, but only fire is mentioned int the Torah and the rest is learned from different pasukim (sentences) that are explained int the Talmud. As electricity and cars became in use, it was debated by the Rabbis and it was brought down that turning on an electric light or starting a car actually broke 2 laws that are forbidden on Shabbat. 1. They both make a spark which is fire. and 2. They complete a full cycle which is also forbidden in boneh - building. Now that ledim are used instead of the old traditional lightbulb, it no longer actually causes a fire, but it still creates a circuit. Thus, it is still forbidden. The point is, the law is evolving since the world is evolving. But that evolution is a built in system from the beginning and no new decision can be taken unless it fits in to what has already been said and argued about. So many things, which we think we are so modern and way above the talmud is discussed already are have where to turn to in the Talmud. Artifical insemination, international banking and time differences and so much more. Thus like most things, if something is as balanced like Judiasm which is based on something ancient but already from the start is capable of breaking things down to their basic elements so anything in the future can be understood and interepeted for the now, will last.

            "answer_text": "In short, it made a bold move - the Rabbis invented a new Torah - the Oral one. THe move is truly brilliant, intellectually, theologically, and socially. It allowed democratizing the Torah and the tradition. Practically everyone (a Jew or a convert) could make up his own interpretations, both exegetical and Halachic, start his own school and argue with other Rabbis on everyone\u2019s views authenticity. This was a true Bolshevik revolution albeit a slow one. THey led to the destruction of the Temple, the stronghold of previous Jewish bourgeoisie - the priests, eradicated the majority of priestly Jewish texts and customs, abolished the existing calendar (how familiar), and proposed a new system of self-proclaimed, but supported by masses characters - the Rabbis. All of sudden the religion became very flexible, adaptive, contemporary, competitive. The arguments with opposing sects and within the Pharisee made it stronger and more ambitious, and the support from the Roman authorities made the Rabbis popular with the masses. THe problem with the existing approach was the lack of God\u2019s interaction, and it was practically impossible to know what it desires. Rabbis solved it elegantly, by not only making God irrelevant (see \u201cNot in Heaven\u201d) and taking exclusive authority for Judaism, but subordinating God to Rabbis\u2019 edicts and decrees. This was very welcomed as the masses longed for practical instructions for enhancing their well-being. As you might imagine the golden age did not come, but Rabbis blamed, of course, the people, who did not want to submit too much, so they executed some for transgressing Rabbinic decrees and let Romans execute others, so eventually the Rabbinic hegemony was established. Don\u2019t underestimate it - it held for almost 15 centuries (well, I attribute it mostly to the external pressure, but still impressive). Rabbinic authority allowed for constant changes and adaptation to the ever-changing surrounding and communal discipline and social cohesion provided an ideal ground for Rabbinic Halachic creativity and innovation.

            "answer_text": "Many times. It starts as a tribal confederation around the time of the Bronze Age Collapse, and as major powers either collapse, or withdraw from Canaan it allows the for the creation of Hebrew and other states in the Levant including the Philistine confederation along the coast. Up in the highlands the Hebrews reject all the deities of their former overlords and come to believe in the idea of a single unitary invisible Creator who requires both strict adherence to the Mosaic laws, and daily sacrifices of bulls and lambs. So for centuries sacrifices go on in Jerusalem in the Judean state, and at Mount Gerizim for the Israelite kingdom in the territory that later came to be called Samaria. But the latter was put to the sword by the Assyrians and taken in to captivity leaving only the Judean state with its sacrifices in the TEmple in Jerusalem alone for another 150 years till it too was destroyed by Babylonian successors to the Assyrians. With the first temple now in ruins and the Jewish elite now in captivity in Babylon a new class emerges called the scribes who now try to piece together the tribal stories and traditions and eventually come up with what now call the Hebrew Bible, or \u201cOld Testament.\u201d Now the Jews have a coherent book to refer to. Fortunately, the Persians take over the Babylonian empire and the Jews are allowed to return to a Judea in ruins. They start to rebuild the Temple to resume the sacrifices, but now they also have a book to refer to. The class of scribes eventually metamorphosize into what became sages and precursors to those who would eventually be called Rabbis or masters of the Law. When this rebuilt TEmple is once again destroyed by the Romans some centuries later on after numerous failed revolts against the Romans, eventually the Rabbis survived to become the de facto leaders and gatekeepers of the increasingly dispersing Jewish communities throughout the corners of the world. And their main point was NON-RESISTANCE and acceptance of their fate until a messiah comes to deliver and bring them back to their Promised Land. Meanwhile, prayers were created to replace animal sacrifices. Instead of contributing tithes and animals to the Temple priests, now it would be hours of prayer instead. Praying replaced sacrifices, and total commitment to the YOKE of the Law would be the life of a member of the tribe. ",
