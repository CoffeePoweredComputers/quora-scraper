            "answer_text": "\u2018Is Scotland a nation or a state\u2019? There are already some interesting answers to this question. Here\u2019s my piece. Firstly: sometimes google is your friend. Or even a physical copy dictionary or encyclopedia. Such as Encyclopedia Britannica, the oldest continuously published encyclopedia in the world, founded by 3 Edinburghers in the 18th century. It seems quite clear to me that the two concepts nation and state are not mutually exclusive. Hence the term nation-state. The United Kingdom is a nation-state, because it is internationally recognised as such. It has its own legally defined nationality and seats in international clubs such as the UN (which it helped found). Scotland is not a nation-state. It does not fit the criteria I just described above. It is, in common with the UK, however, a nation. The UK, as a nation-state could also be called a state. In this instance, nation-state and state mean the same thing. Scotland is neither. England is also a nation. In its own way, so is Wales and, perhaps, Northern Ireland is too. Northern Ireland is complex in a way that none of the others are so it is best left out of this answer from now on. The reasons for the nuances of nation-state, nation etc, in the UK are essentially down to the fact that Scotland and England used to be separate Kingdoms. In periods of their history, they fought each other a lot. In others, they got on pretty well. Anyway, the two Kingdoms merged in 1707. This Union is the main geographical and legal basis for the present nation-state of The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The history of the nation-state is more complex than that, as is clear from the name, but I won\u2019t go into that here. It is important to note that the Union of 1707 was agreed to by majorities in the separate Parliaments of England and Scotland partly due to provisions which maintained separate Scottish and English legal systems and churches. I remember being made well aware in adolescence and younger that in Scotland many people in 1706\u20131707, especially the church, were horrified by the version of \u2018incorporating union\u2019 which the Treaty posited. There would no longer be a Scottish parliament or an English one. Just a British one. It was presented to me that Scots of that time almost to a man hated the idea of any union with England. This was a simplification to an absurd degree, but I didn\u2019t know that then. Many Scots and some English had argued for union since 1603. These proposals were usually based on the idea of some kind of confederal union. Often this meant the continuation of Scotland\u2019s and England\u2019s parliaments with an overarching British parliament being created. A union devoid of confederalism was not popular in Scotland in 1707 and never was beforehand. Sentiments were exacerbated by the political climate brought about by the late King William\u2019s orders in the 1690s to his English Subjects to avoid any form of help for his Scottish Subjects in their endeavor to found a colony in what turned out to be a paradise for malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Indeed, Scottish proposals often cited the fact that the Royal Family was Scottish before it also became English. The English Royal family died out in 1603 and the Scottish King James VI succeeded as James I due to a somewhat close blood relationship with the late English Queen Elizabeth. Sometimes this was used to argue that the overarching British parliament ought to be composed of at least as many, if not more, Scots as English. That would have been quite something, but not an idea any English parliament would ever have agreed with! The Treaty of 1706 was the result of negotiation between English and Scottish Commissioners. Each side had 31. Most commissioners were from the governments of the two respective Kingdoms and largely favoured union of some sort. English Whigs dominated the English Commissioners - only one Tory was present. This is not surprising because English Tories were not normally supportive of Union. They voiced paranoid fears in parliament about being overrun by \u2018Scotch beggars if we enter them into our liberties\u2019 and spoke about how the \u2018abhorrent Presbyterians\u2019 would form an alliance with the English nonconformist Protestants against High Church Anglicans such as themselves (as had happened in a series of wars in the 1640s). Meanwhile, in Scotland, the Church of Scotland was the established church. It was Presbyterian (it still is and) had a long history of struggle with the Scottish Episcopalians. They both had periods of ascendancy in which they would persecute the other lot. The Episcopalians had and have a lot in common with the Church of England. Today the Scottish Episcopal Church and the Church of England are regarded as independent \u2018members of the Anglican Communion\u2019. At the time, the Scottish established church was nervous that the denominational majority in the new nation-state would seek to undo the recently cemented Presbyterian domination in Scotland. This had been achieved as recently as 1689 by the Scottish Parliament which included it in its terms for King William\u2019s accession to the throne to replace James VII. The Church of Scotland and the Church of England were promised that interference by one with the other would never be allowed to happen in the Union and this was guaranteed by the laws passed in England and Scotland which led to the Union. So there was considerable opposition to be overcome for the Acts of Union to pass in both parliaments, despite the obvious provision for English and Scottish autonomy within the new state as already set out in the treaty. Therefore concessions had to be made, or at least the governments had to argue that the Treaty offered a Union with security by merging the two parliaments and Kingdoms, but preserved traditional liberties (in some cases the privileges of notables English and Scots are really what was being referred to). Also, there was the small matter of English Government subsidies for heavily indebted Scottish politicians, who had invested in the previously mentioned abortive attempt at colonisation. The autonomy was unusual in one nation-state, rather than a ragtag collection of statelets like the Holy Roman Empire, at the time because the church and law were pillars of the state. In some ways in many nation-states they still are. I\u2019m being very simplistic here but you see, ever since 1707, Scotland has been a nation within a broader nation-state. As has England. Both the UK and Scotland could also be described as countries, which means essentially the same thing as nation. In origin, country refers to a geographic area and nation really refers to the people in it. But by now the usage is so overlapping that the differences are moot. If you were thinking of a state as in a state of the USA, then, unfortunately, the United Kingdom is not a federal nation-state. I say, unfortunately, because the British parliament maintains that it legally reserves the right to abolish the devolved Scottish parliament, like the Welsh Assembly, if it feels like it. This has the capacity for arbitrary usage by a British Government. The states in the US are very different because although 13 of them also came together to form a country, they have a very different level of importance within the nation-state. This is reflected in the name \u2018The United States of America\u2019. If the UK were more similar then it would perhaps be rendered \u2018The United Kingdoms of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\u2019. Note the use of the plural in that hypothetical version of the UK, unlike in the real one. Anyway, as always, I have rambled on but I think I\u2019ve answered the question. ",

            "answer_text": "The distinction between the two are mostly semantic but there is a distinction. A state can be generally understood to be a continuous polity under the control of a single central government or legislature in most democracies. A federal state is another distinction of this. Scotland does not meet that as it is the UK government and parliament that holds the ultimate source of law. Semantically Scotland is a nation. It is a landmass with a shared landmass and cultural identity. The only government on earth however that recognises Scotland as a country or nation is the UK government ironically as thats the only government that nationalists seem to hate. The EU recently demonstrated this when refusing to get involved in the internal affairs of the United Kingdom. Legally Scotland is not a nation or a kingdom but part of a larger Kingdom. Act of Union 1707 \u201cThe Kingdoms of Scotland and England will be united into the single Kingdom of Great Britain. Thats the constitutional legal reality of the past 313 years. I would call Scotland a country/nation as it is recognised as such by the UK government and has a devolved government granted power from the central authority. Which means it has recognised borders of that authority. Whether it is a state of not is of little relevance. It is not a nation state in the sovereign sense but perhaps broad parallels could be drawn with German or US federal states that exist in a larger constitutional framework. In conclusion it can be called anything with justification and the definitions tend to be fluid but the law is black letter certainty in the matter. No other government recognises anything except the UK and Scotland is present at all the main tables of the World as the UK. ",
