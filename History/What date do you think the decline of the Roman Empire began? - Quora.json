            "answer_text": "Since a Quora mod seem to have decided to not to like my historical credential AFTER there were more than three years of it being fully okay, here\u2019s what was written in a year book about my historical knowledge: \u201cOn time travel, we can rely on him\u201d  The starting point of the Roman Empires decline: It can\u2019t be said for sure when it really started, it can\u2019t be pinpoint to a single event. It rather was a process over more than two centuries. so let\u2019slook at some of the events and reasons leading to the decline of the classical Latin speaking variant of the Roman Empire and let us not to forget that the Imperium Romanum itself survived until 1453 as the Greek speaking Vasile\u00eda t\u014dn Rh\u014dma\u00ed\u014dn. The year of the four emperors which brought chaos to Rome.The Antonine Plaque. this plague, most likely a pest pandemic ravaged Rome and its empire during the late reign of Imperator Caesar Marcus Antonius and the earlier years of the reign of Commodus. It took a great toll on human ressources.The bureaucracy got more and more bloated, it wasn\u2019t the sleek administration still seen during the reign of the emperors Marcus Ulpius Traianus and Publius Aelius Hadrianus where the factual Rome was where the emperor was.Economic crisis following the Antonine Plaque, the early beginnings of the great immigration waves (The great invasion according to the Romans or the \u201cV\u00f6lkerwanderung\u201d = Wanderings of the Peoples according to the German historical viwpoint).Climate change, it gota bit colder, harsher, the harvests weren\u2019t as good as during thei height of the Roman Empire (26 BCE to 150/180 CE).Suceeding the Antonine Plaque, the climate change and other events the exercitus Romanus (the military) need to save money while at the same time allowing its commanders to continue with their often lavish lifestyles (like always, the richt tries to keep their riches). So, the equipment became less refined, the drill standards had to be lowered and more mercenaries became active in the Roman military.The rise of Christianity and the conflicts between the Christians and the traditional Romans.The rise of Christianity partially caused the Romans to gradually loose their ability to assimilate different tribes and peoples.And it was one of the reasons the Romans developed a dynastic spirit in their monarchy.The other inspiration came from foreign monarchies like the Persian Empire.Up to emperor Diocletianus reign, the Roman state still at least \u201con the paper\u201d kept the illusion of still being a kind of republic upright, it was the era of the Principate founded by emperor Caesar Augustus (who called the overall Roman state the \u201cRes Publica Restitutio\u201d).This principate still somewhat motivated the senate and other institutions to care about their dutiesEmperor Diocletianus publicly introduced the Dominate thus publicly stating that Rome long ago has become a monarchy thus diminishing the importance of the senate and these institutions whose traditions were the actual republican era of Rome.The new series of roman civil wars:The civil wars and the first albeit temporarily division of the Roman Empire into the Gallo-Roman Empire, the Palmyrene Empire and the remaining Roman Empire.The civil wars beween emperor Constantinus Magnus and emperor Maxentius and MAxentius own successors.The full shift of (the economic) power to the eastern parts of the Empire.The dynastic thinking of the late ancient Romans and the beginning of a more nationality oriented view to see peoples, tribes now took full effect and the late ancient Romans weren\u2019t as able to assimilate and Romanize the \u201cbarbarians\u201d. Remember Stilicho and Aetius, both of them capable to save the western Roman empire but as soon as they became too successful they got killed by their emperors.And the final nail in the coffin of the western Roman empire was the lack of interest to keep an additional western emperor by the eastern Roman emperors.Every single of these steps won\u2019t have threatened the existence of the Roman Empire ant won\u2019t have caused the decline of this one of the most influental empires in all human history. It was the culmination of all those steps I mentioned plus a smaller list of other reasons. Conclusions One might argue that the decline of Rome already started with the inability of Caesar Augustus to establish a similiar gifted successor who survived childhood diseases or a bit later with the reign of the (in)famous Caesar Nero. And don\u2019t forget, the ending of the western empire with the last emperor acknowledged by the eatern emperor Iulius Nepos and the child emperor Romulus Augustulus wasn\u2019t the end of the Roman Empire itself. It survived for another around 1000 more, had new heights of power like with the emperors Iustinianus Magnus or \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (=Basileos Bulgaroktonos). Since the decline of the \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1fec\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd (Vasile\u00eda t\u014dn Rh\u014dma\u00ed\u014dn) is part of another question, I\u2019m ending my answer here.

            "answer_text": "201 BCE. That\u2019s the year Rome defeated Carthage and took all its overseas territories, most importantly, Spain. Now, what to do with them? We faced a similar decision after the Revolution: what to do with all that land to the West. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance, which provided for the creation of new states. That concept was incorporated into the Constitution. So whether you live in Delaware or Hawaii, you have the same rights. Now suppose we\u2019d said, all those new lands were to benefit Boston and Philadelphia. We\u2019ll pass laws to govern them and they\u2019ll pay taxes for our benefit. Because that\u2019s basically what Rome did. Everything was for Rome, and new territories were to be exploited for revenue for Rome. The result was perpetual insurgency in Spain. Hitherto, Rome had raised armies for local defense and sent them home as soon as the emergency was over. Armies could not be raised for longer than a year. But they could hardly get to Spain before having to be sent back. So Rome created standing armies. Rome had been making lurching progress toward equality. The system was still loaded in favor of the wealthy , but when popular unrest reached the boiling point, there were reforms. Needless to say, there were no protections for conscripted soldiers, who were often dispossessed while serving. Wealth and power re-concentrated in the hands of the wealthy. The result was civil unrest, civil wars, Julius Caesar\u2019s coup and assassination, and the foundation of the Empire. Like a baby born with AIDS, the Roman Empire was infected at birth with what eventually killed it. ",
