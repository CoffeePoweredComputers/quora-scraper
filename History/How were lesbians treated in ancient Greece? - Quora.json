            "answer_text": "While male homosexual relations were accepted, female homosexual relations seem to be quite a taboo, at least in Athens. They are rarely mentioned in writings, and if they are, the writers seem hostile towards it. Women in Athens mostly had very few rights and were subordinate to their husbands, so the idea of them having any other desires then pleasing their husbands was quite unnerving for Athenians. According to some sources, things were different in Sparta, since the women of Sparta had more liberties. There are reports they formed homosexual relationships simmilar to those men did - an older woman being in a sexual relationship with a young girl and acting as her mentor in society.The story of Sappho (also called Lesbia, as she was from the island Lesbos) is a strange one. Historians still debate weather her poems confess erotic desire towards women, or platonic love between close friends. In fact, public speculations about her homosexuality didn\u2019t start until the Roman times. Greek stories described her as a woman who was unhappily in love with a man and killed herself because of that. If she is mentioned in a negative way in Greece, she is accused of having affairs with men (while she was married), not women.And one funny thing. Ancient Greek commedies show us that Lesbian women (women from Lesbos), did have a somewhat seedy reputation in Athens. But not because of homosexuality. It seems Athenians believed Lesbians were very keen on felacio. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, what we can deduce from our literary sources is simply that lesbian relationships did occur in ancient Greek city states, but we simply don't have anything that we could use to quantify just how often, I'm afraid. It's the usual ancient historian's pitfall: the almost complete silence of our sources. Apart from Sappho, there isn't any sources that can be without a doubt interpreted as portraying girl love in positive light (there's the other Greek female poet Corinna and one funerary epitaph where some academics argue seeing lesbian desire), and everywhere else the attitude is either that of disgust and condemnation. Or, lesbian sex is discussed erotically from a male point of view, like in Lucian's satire 5 (Roman era Greek author, though) where the reader is made privy to a tongue-in-cheek and titillating conversation between two prostitutes about lesbian sex. Even Sappho's potential homosexuality was explained away; later commentators say that she is sometimes 'slanderously' accused of having sexual relations with her female pupils and instead represent her as a sort of semi-mythical, heroic figure, a Muse rather than a human, who in one mythohistorical account tragically kills herself for a love of a young man, not woman. And, to be fair, there's really nothing that could confirm 100% that Sappho really was a homosexual or bisexual. The Greeks, like the Romans later, did not really have a term for homosexuality as opposed to heterosexuality; it was taken for granted that all humans could be attracted to both sexes, but, this did not mean that their view of sexual morality was genderless. That male homosexual relationships were cool was not even questioned, and could even be praised and lauded as more pure than male-female love (cf. Plutarch Moralia 751.4, i.e. the \"Dialogue on Love\"). The natural role for a citizen adult male was to always be the 'active' partner - i.e. the top, the one doing the penetrating, whatever they call it in slang these days. Anything else was disgraceful and effeminate. The 'passive' and 'submissive' role was that of young boys, slaves, and women. Which is why an equal homosexual relationship between two adult men was not a morally sound concept in ancient Greece; gay love was really only praiseworthy in the erastes-eromenos set up. Sex between two women was even more morally problematic. If two women had sex together, that automatically meant that at least one of them had to assume the 'active' role, which was seen as going completely against the nature, even described as 'monstrous' by later Roman satirists. The ancient Greeks and Romans had a huge complex and fear about women acting like men - there really hardly ever was a situation where it was not morally dubious and 'appalling'. A poem by Asclepiades of Samos (3rd century BC, so a bit later than OP's asked time period but still applies) pretty much summaries Greek attitudes towards lesbian relationships: The Samian women, Bitto and Nannion, are unwilling to followthe pathway set by the laws of Aphrodite,but desert to other courses, which are not beautiful.Mistress Cypris,look with hatred upon these fugitives from your bed. Other thing is that female sexuality was very much a taboo: respectable, matronly women were not supposed to enjoy sex or seek out sex (or love) and it was a commendable quality only in prostitutes who represented society's outcasts anyway. In a lesbian relationship sex can only be motivated by erotic desire, it's not just something a woman sheepishly submits to in order to please a man or conceive children. Also, there was a fear that if a woman was beautiful and promiscuous, she was more likely to take the 'active' role in the bedroom and therefore also have lesbian tendencies; therefore, Lesbos and Corinth, two city-states famed for their female beauty and prostitutes, were also often used as euphemisms for lesbian desire. Therefore, due to the massive societal disapproval towards lesbian relationships, there are no famous Greek lesbian couples or families that we would know of. The corpus for studying female homosexuality in ancient Greece is tiny, really, and hardly ever spoken of. To be fair, there is a slight chance that the disapproval of lesbian relationships was an especially elite thing; the same way that the strong ethos that women should be kept inside and not walk in public without a male guardian could never really apply to working class women, who had to be out and about to make a living. It's very unlikely that the lower classes of Greek society wholly approved of lesbian relationships, but it's possible that the ideological pressures on female sexual morality were more relaxed and thus lesbian relationships might have been more prevalent in some strata of society than in others.
