            "answer_text": "Allow me to approach this from a different angle although Patrick Ross gave a solid example of my thoughts and feelings as well. I\u2019ve somehow managed to date \u201cabove me\u201d almost every time. I\u2019ll probably marry \u201cabove me\u201d. Not all wealthy women are the same. But, in my opinion, most share the same traits. However particular person stands out. In that situation, not only was I a \u201cregular\u201d guy who was dating a woman from a very rich background, but I was also a \u201cregular\u201d black guy dating a white woman from a very rich background. It\u2019s funny. As a person who doesn\u2019t care about race at all and wants everyone to be treated fairly regardless of status or gender or skin color in can be quite interesting to see how people view you when money is involved. Racism is awful. Sexism is awful. But classism\u2026 that\u2019s something else entirely. Case in point, her ex was also black but was also from a rich family. Apparently, her family loved him or so I was told multiple times from various sources. I\u2019m from Brooklyn before it was hip to live there. The Brooklyn they talked about in 90s rap songs. Drugs on the corners, prostitution, gangs and the like. She was from Newton, Massachusettes, about 10 miles from Boston and one of the richest neighborhoods in the northeast United States. We were both 23 years of age. I had worked about 4\u20135 jobs by then. She had never worked a day in her life. I fought to get on teams and into clubs. She admitted that her dad would just make a donation and she could do whatever. With her, I truly learned just how effortless life can be when you have quite a bit of money to draw from. For example: Her car once \"broke down\" on the highway. I was with her. It was a 2 year old car. Having been taught some basics of car repair from an uncle I was able to determine that her axle was broken and needed to be replaced. A couple hundred dollars at best. The tow driver confirmed what I said and said it's wasn\u2019t bad. I thought she was going to get it fixed. Instead 2 days later she calls and asks me to accompany her to a call dealership to pick out a new car. I \"forget my place\" and object saying there nothing wrong with her car now and it's only 2 years old. I believe my exact words were \"why take on the payment?\". Her exact words back were \"what payment?\". She bought the new car in full with one check. I\u2019ve told this story for years. It still amazes me to this day. As a former NCAA athlete, she would always boast to her friends how athletic I was and how I \u201ccould kill\u201d anyone I faced in an athletic competition. I personally felt that was how she justified being with a \u201ccommoner\u201d. Like a medieval noblewoman being into a soldier because he\u2019s one of the best on the battlefield. Naturally, her rich friends (admirers) who were men, would always challenge me to do something athletic. Basketball, running, soccer, facing off against them was easy because I was used to tougher competition from the \u201cpoorer folks\u201d. One time, a friend of hers challenges me to tennis and straight up said \u201cYou can say no, I\u2019m not sure they play tennis in the hood\u201d. What\u2019s funny here is, people have claimed he was being racist here, and perhaps he was, but I always saw it as a class statement. Had I been white but from Mississippi I sure he would have said the same but in a different way. Anyway, he didn\u2019t know that I\u2019ve played tennis for years and my mom had saved for me to go to camps for tennis. So I was willing but didn\u2019t have any clothes. She went and bought me rackets, a bag, tennis clothes and shoes. It came out to little more than 400 bucks. I said that\u2019s stupid to buy stuff for a few hours use. She said she didn\u2019t care \u201cand was curious to see if I could win\u201d. I smoked him, she laughed uncontrollably when he lost and said she would have paid more to watch him lose. She also would say things like she can\u2019t believe how unathletic her last bf (remember, rich black guy) was. All her friends were amazed I could even serve the ball. We were once watching TV and some celeb was talking about her house in Puerto Rico (wasn\u2019t MTV cribs, but something like it). At that time I had never been. Neither had she. She didn\u2019t ask me if I wanted to go. She said we were going. Bought the tickets and hotel that same night to go the following week\u2026 for a week. I spent the whole trip feeling inadequate. I was also afraid I was going to lose my new job as I asked them for a week off about two weeks into it. She said don\u2019t worry about it, she had me if I lost it. The trip was more important. I dated her for around a year. What\u2019s crazy is I have countless stories like those three. The first tough part was not really being able to afford any of the things she wanted to do. Sure I could afford dates, but she didn\u2019t want to do dinner, movies, bowling, museums, sports, etc. She wanted to do getaways, weekend R&R\u2019s, high profile clubs and restaurants. We once had a breakfast that cost us 200 dollars. I ordered the cheapest thing I could. That was normal to her. It was insane to me. *I really learned to appreciate water and sitting on one drink dating her. I got to the point where I could make a Long Island last for 2 hours. I also once filled a gin an tonic with water after I finished in an effort to not pay more for a bill I was covering. (She would automatically order me another drink if she saw I was finished, without asking me). The second thing that made it tough was that I was looked at like property. 99% of her friends were rich white people, but there was this Asian woman who was her \u201cfriend\u201d (barely) who kind of woke me up. I feel like all she talks about is how fit you are or how you can do all sorts of things. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but that would make me feel like a circus animal or something\u201d. I realized that pretty much how she presented me. Athletic this, or super fit that. Some of her female friends would say they\u2019d like to \u201csee what it was like\u201d. She would always ask me to show off in some type of physical way. People she knew (old and young) would only talk about sports or fitness with me (or occasionally Obama\u2026fun) despite having knowledge, (in some cases much more) on other topics. She was great. But boy was that an experience. ",

            "answer_text": "I've dated one and I'll probably never date one again. Her family owns several businesses (tens of millions of dollars). I'm probably at the middle class range (I make about 6 figures). Long story short, I'm pretty confident we would still be together if it weren't for her family's wealth which had a lot of influence on her behavior. A couple things that stood out to me during our relationship: Her mom was a housewife that had no income of her own. Meanwhile there was a lot of suspicion that the dad was cheating but her mom couldn't really do anything about it because if she left him she would have no way of supporting herself. While she was explaining this to me, she also said that this is a pretty normal thing to happen to people like them based on what she hears from her wealthy friends. Because of this, her mom instilled a pretty hard work ethic on to her and emphasized that she should work on her ability to take care of herself and not to rely on other peoples money. Ironically by the end of the relationship, I found out her mom specifically told her not to date me because \"I was working class\" and said to stop wasting her time since I would not be able to maintain her lifestyle if we continued.Her last boyfriend was the son of a CEO who owned a private company that was apparently worth hundreds of millions/billions of dollars. Her mom wanted her to continue dating this dude but my ex didnt like how he partied all the time and didnt take care of his health/workout. She still kept in contact with him after they broke up because they both worked in the same industry. When he found out she was with me, he basically told her to let him know when shes ready to be with him again since there's no way I could take of her financially the way he could. During our final days together, she made an offhanded comment and asked why she couldn't find someone that was a combination of me and this ex which I pretty much took it as I was too broke for herKeeping up appearances was huge. I had a brand new wardrobe by the end of the relationship since she would buy clothes for me without asking. I do dress for the occasion but it was like I had to be on it every time I went out in public with her - I think a lot of her perceived value/social value came from how others saw her. If I dressed poorly and she dressed nicely, she said it was equivalent of me saying I didn't care if people thought about her. An example is if you're dressed like a hobo, other people would assume the people you're chilling with are also hobos.She lived in a huge house by herself (at one point she complained that her house was too big) while her family lived in another country so she was pretty independent. It definitely won't work out if you're clingy and trying to date a rich girl.She was smoking hot on top of being rich so she had a lot of guys orbiting her 24/7 with some of them being friends that have been trying to get with her for years. She would tell me stories about how she would go on dates with some of these dudes who end up trying to get her drunk and then confessing their feelings despite having girlfriends. She threw a lot of bomb house parties and guys would always be all over her or leave things like sweaters behind so they could come over a little later to pick it up when it was only the two of them around. Just imagine a constant barrage of dudes constantly trying to shoot their shot which includes dudes/friends sending half-naked selfies of themselves that she would show me from time to time. Long story short, a lot of her male friends hated my guts and would make a lot of passive aggressive comments when they saw me.The turning point of the relationship was when she went out of the country to visit her family/friends for a few weeks. Before she left, she was extremely affectionate and was asking me to move in with her. When she returned, her demeanor completely changed and she ended up saying a lot of fucked up shit that you can't really take back so we ended it shortly afterwards. I found out later that she spent a lot of time with her mom and they had conversations about how she was planning on maintaining her standard of living in the future if she continued to be with me. I'm also pretty sure her wealthy friends asked about me which would make things embarrassing for her since she explained to me that the culture of her home country/group of friends is extremely shallow and revolves around how much money someone has. I think the constant external factors chipping away and questioning her on her dating choice could have explained the 360 change in her personality when she returned. She told me she had an epiphany or 'woke up' to what we were when she was with her family/friends.Overall we got along extremely well together which was why I really didn't want to lose her friendship/companionship and was pretty hesitant to get in to a relationship with her myself at one point. It was pretty fun while it lasted but I don't think it was worth the drama, mental toll, and the amount of time I wasted since I straight up told her she had to be okay with me not being at her financial level otherwise I'd rather not risk the friendship we built. The worst part about this is I was really attached to her dumbass cat and miss not seeing him anymore. ",

            "answer_text": "I have a multiple interest in this question because I have been married to a VWW (very wealthy woman) and I also work with clients of both genders who have to face the challenges of wealth-disparity every day. The term \u2018poor little rich girl\u2019 is one that is usually applied in a derogatory manner but in truth it identifies a genuinely tragic outcome of the acquisition of great wealth. I strongly recommend that such women seek professional guidance on the issue so as to be made aware in a neutral manner of all the issues that can arise. In terms specifically of the question it\u2019s important to separate the behavioural issues (well-addressed by others here on Quora) from the underlying dynamic ones. It\u2019s also important to recognise that there are: wealthy women who created their own wealth,some (most?) who inherited it andsome who both inherited it and increased it.There are also major differences between two types of those who inherited it. Were they born once great wealth had been created by their family or were they there during the process of it being made? If they were born into it there are two things they can never know: What is it like to feel material need? andHow can I tell if this person likes/loves me just for myself or for my money and/or social position?The effect of these two unknowns is to make wealthy women extremely insecure. That\u2019s why so many have a history of multiple relationships, alcohol and drug abuse and other psychologically-related issues such as eating disorders, self-harming etc. As the male half of such a partnership, your first \u2018task\u2019 is to understand that this woman who seems so powerful to you with her money and influence is more likely to be deeply anxious underneath it all. This means that on some level she\u2019ll be looking to you to fill the security void that exists within her. Of course, we cannot fill voids in others: we can only help them fill the voids in themselves. So sooner or later you\u2019re going to be accused of not being good enough. Or, more likely, you\u2019re going to find her interest in you slowly diminishing without either of you understanding why. Then, of course, she\u2019s had demonstrated to her a thousand times that the way you fix things is through some monetary means, by buying more or giving more away. Anything to ease the pain of feeling unrecognised and unloved. Also, access to huge funds means that the capacity for self-distraction is similarly huge. And then there\u2019s the pre-nuptial agreement. Almost certainly in extremely wealthy families you will be expected to sign one. As a specialist in relationships I can tell you that a traditional pre-nup is one of the most damaging \u2018agreements\u2019 a couple can make. How come? Surely it\u2019s reasonable to protect the family assets in the event of a relationship breakdown? Yes, but not if the cost of it is actually to trigger the relationship breakdown. The problem with a pre-nup is that it is actually the first step in a divorce negotiation yet it takes place before the marriage has even been solemnized. It is rarely a collaborative act. It puts the man (in this instance) into the role of an inferior supplicant and reminds him on a daily basis thereafter that he\u2019s only worth the money he\u2019s signed up to. He, if he\u2019s a lot less wealthy and a typical male, will have put all his assets at risk so he\u2019s already making a bigger commitment to the relationship than his wife. This creates a huge power disparity just where it\u2019s needed least. Am I against pre-nups? Not at all. There are often very good reasons for them and they can actually enhance a relationship if collaboratively arrived at. Can you have a collaboration between one loving man and a team of lawyers whose task is to protect the assets not just from the prospective groom but from the loving bride-to-be who might be too eager just to give it all away for love? Clearly not. But when I\u2019ve worked with couples in this position they\u2019ve been able to determine what they want from a pre-nup in an open-minded and mutually supportive and dynamically-aware way. Then they can go to the lawyers with a joint commitment and tell them what they want. Enough. If you\u2019re in the throes of marrying a woman from a family richer than yours I\u2019d suggest you find a professional to talk to you about it. And if you\u2019re a woman who\u2019s wealth too often feels like a millstone round your neck, find a professional and you can do something about that, too. Good luck to all! ",

            "answer_text": "It depends if she has accumulated that wealth by herself or inherited it. If she comes from a rich family and her wealth is inherited, then it is very likely she carries the materialistic values as well. Most privileged folks of course do not like to accept this but as you date you can read between the lines and witness subtle signs, specially in their story-tellings and interpreting mediums like films, art, music. Because in such mediums ones interpretation reflects ones perspective and unfiltered thoughts. If this kind of woman happens to date you, it is possible you are much younger or very handsome or very intelligent. So by \u201chaving\u201d you she worths more in eyes of people alike who value having. The struggle is, you are objectified. Other people in her circle will interact with you as her-thing rather than a person you know as yourself. Some may even treat you as an intruder or the abuser who must be after what she \u201chas\u201d. If on the other hand she has accumulated her wealth, for example a self made rich business woman, then your challenge is to have a relationship with a woman who is very dominating and her priority might still be her business. If you are less successful or have financial difficulties then soon you will experience a different power dynamics. A woman who picks up the bill behaves very differently compared to a man who takes care of his girl friend. Also, no matter how rich she is, she will compare you with that richer guy out there who is a provider and can take care of her. So you must be ok to stand in her mind as a second place, a silver medalist at best. At the end, a poor guy dating a rich girl is like a talented man working for a big corporation. You are rarely welcomed for a true and long lasting partnership. You are there because you are offering something that she or they need, conveniently. It could be that you are a nice and smart guy who can safely transition their daughter thru college years. Maybe you are a young charming handsome dude who can cheer her up after divorce. Maybe you are a disposable guy who can give her a baby and then get lost. Maybe you are a financially desperate but ambitious enough guy who is willing to take risks, work hard and grow their wealth. Whatever you are, it is very unlikely that a rich woman or her family value you as an equal partner. They respect you because they respect their daughter and their wealth. ",

She couldn\u2019t utter more than a few words of English, and I know don\u2019t anything of Mandarin. She was very pretty and shy as anyone I have ever met. I graduated from law school a year earlier and my ride was older Honda Civic. Arriving at a huge palacious house by the lake to pick her up, I knew these people had money. Real big and deep pockets. My parents had money not as deep as them. We went out several times to dinner. It is hard to talk if a person is feeding themself. Did I tell you how we communicated? Have you ever travelled to a foreign country and use sign gestures and mouthing off words to see if the other person understood you? Yeah. That\u2019s me trying to converse with her. All the dinner we had was of my choosing because the poor woman didn\u2019t understand what I had said. I ordered my favourites: fettuccine shrimp alfredo, Mexican Carne Asada, porterhouse steak and baked potatoes with all the trimmings, Texas Bar-B-Que special combination plate. Not once I offered to treat her with an Asian dish of any kind. I didn\u2019t know if my budget for Asian cuisine was appropriate. It could easily run close to $200 bucks in a fancy place and that\u2019s not counting the funds for a nightcap. The scenic restaurants were too far of a drive. My parents insisted that we all go to a Karaoke restaurant. This included her sister and brother in law, my parents invited themselves, and the two of us. My mother\u2019s voice was sweet nectar and it rivals that of any Mormon tabernacle female soloist. My date and my mom was really the stars of the night. Everyone else was there to sample the food and beverage. My date sang several songs by herself beautifully and I was very impressed even though I couldn't understand a single word. She sounded better in person than on her CDs. In the back of mind, I was ready to run out of that place before I knew what was coming next. Yep. She requested me to sing a song. I obliged after several no. I belched, \u201c House of the Rising Sun.\u201d It sounded like someone has kicked a dog between the nuts and he was crawling into a corner to die. I thought all this time my singing skills in the shower were pretty decent. I guess the water in my ears during those inspirational symphonic belching was kinder to me than in real life. Yep, I impressed the hell out of that woman!!! In the end, we couldn't find a way to communicate and I had to stop seeing her. My loss I guess. She was shy, beautiful, and loaded. ",

            "answer_text": "Older retired woman with money here\u2026..almost always more money than the men i dated. They never knew. I never talked about money and I am not ostentatious in clothing or other preferences. It\u2019s workable to marry a man with much less money. I am in my 5th year of marriage. But you need to be sure he is marrying you for you and not for the money. And you need a prenuptial agreement just in case you find out that you were mistaken. A man who loves you for you will readily accept this out of pride if nothing else. As a woman of means, I always paid my own way on dates unless the man really objected, but refrained from going places that were an unnecessary burden financially on my date. That said, I met one man who did not have the means to do much of anything, and so I did not continue dating him because it would have lessened my ability to enjoy life and he was not in other ways that attractive to me either. The man i married is highly intelligent and good looking too. He has no wealth. I don\u2019t care. I can support us both, but I have final say on the decisions on what we spend on and there is an agreement that any expenditure over 1000 dollars must have a prior consultation. He has his name on all my credit cards but not on my accounts. He has a cash card for my checking. The real estate is all in my name as I bought it. This seems to work fine. Even if he were to turn rogue he could not do too much damage to me financially. I have a living trust that provides for him in the event of my death. But it can be changed at any time. He is now taking his social security and has his own spending money. This makes him feel much better of course. As my mother always said, \u201cIt is just as easy to love a rich man as a poor man\u201d and the same could be said inserting the word woman. But she also said, \u201cIf you marry for money you will suffer in comfort\u201d. She was right. ",

            "answer_text": "Marriage has, historically, worked because women had a perception that they had a place\u2014and a motivation to stay in it. That motive may have been love, but let\u2019s be honest, it was often security. Love may burn off after a while, leaving practical concerns at the center of a marriage. I\u2019ve been married twice, both working women. I\u2019ll never do that again. When a woman does not need a man to provide for her, she has one less reason to put up with any stresses, problems\u2014ok, let\u2019s admit it\u2014shenanigans, and/or abuse. Not that she should have to, but many a woman has remained alone in a drafty castle while her husband did as (read: \u201cwhom\u201d) he pleased. Today\u2019s woman is independent, but that adjective is commonly attached to the wrong gender, making it appear that independence is a quality she possesses. Let\u2019s say it: she is no longer dependent upon the man. Should she be? Yes\u2014if you want the marriage to work. Only the rare woman is able to balance job and family\u2014and nobody can be in two places at once. If the job suffers because of family, she is fired. If the family suffers because of the job, the family suffers. See the problem? I digress. Young people tend not to think ahead, but galavanting around town, bedding any and everyone who is willing is generally not a feasible, long-term plan. If you\u2019re not seeking marriage, her wealth is probably going to be an advantage, but ultimately you\u2019ll enjoy until the enjoyment runs out, and then be off for greener pastures. ",

I was also one among them. When i made my first initial move, Boom. she responded back the same. I\u2019m lucky right. (Off-course i\u2019m cute, come-on) ;) We exchanged our number and Normal texting started between us. (those days we did not even whatsapp exists) 100msg per day. Eventually we used to bunk classes and started to date and hangout. One fine day, It\u2019s her b\u2019day. at 00:00 i somehow managed to reach her house Terrance and gave a surprise. Guess what, I proposed her. she instantly accepted my proposal. (we were in our teenage guys, unsaturated mentality) Now she started to take me out. (all expenses is on her) she used to purchase me clothes(all branded and high cost)she used to pay my parking ticketsshe used to have breakfast. lunch, dinner in all expenses hotelshe gifted me N70 nokia cell phone.she used to take care of my fuel expensesshe used to give me 200rs per day just to smoke and hangout with friends.Huf, what not. list goes on!

            "answer_text": "One big struggle can be for some, is their ego can get hurt. You have to be a confident man to have a wealthy women as a partner. You will also have to bite the bullet and pick and choose your battles. Remember she can stand on her own two feet. Just because of her wealth. Another struggle is being able to keep up with her. She has a full schedule and you will have to learn to understand that. Basically, the common role of the bread winner is usually the man and it\u2019s now reversed. So you can talk to any woman whose partner is wealthy for advice. Watch out for the women who want to control you. No one should be in a relationship where one wants to control another. It only leads into a very bad situation and only one person is happy. Trust, you\u2019re gonna have to trust her from the get go. She\u2019s gonna get hit on. More so for her money than looks. But if she also has looks, it\u2019s a hard road to hoe. You have to show her you\u2019re okay with who she is and proud of her accomplishments. At the same time, you have to have the conversation about trust. She will also buy you things, be thankful and appreciative even if it\u2019s hard to swallow. Again, that\u2019s who she is. Stay away from politics with her whenever possible and at the same time keep your identity. Get to know her not her money. You will be fine, just be yourself. If she wants to dress you nicer let her. Because you will be in front of her peers one day and it will become a common thing. Good Luck ",

My understanding is that this question comes from concerns that you might have over your own judgment of the person,pressure from how other people perceive YOU in relation to said person,some other 3rd thing I can\u2019t think of right now. :PWhat I will say is this: you obviously are concerned about the money itself or the fact that this girl has a lot of money. (y) But I wonder how concerned you are exactly with the girl, herself? O.o I think it\u2019s time for you to make a decision about what\u2019s most important for yourself. #100% And remember; TIME IS MONEY $$! ",
