            "answer_text": "Everything is representational and virtualised within our brains, which makes \u201ctruth\u201d no more \u201creal\u201d to us than our imagination; and in many ways they are interchangeable. And our \u201cmind\u201d - as far as we know - is a construct of our very own as well, something that \u2018emerges\u2019 only by our very particular, introspective use of our brains. So when you ask \u2018What effects does truth have on mind?\u2019 you are really asking (I think) what goes on inside our brains when our beliefs are overturned. At its simplest you are initially confronted with a stark contrast and comparison exercise. You recognise any differences between what you believed previously and what is now presented. Your brain is good at such pattern matching, but the longer it chugs away, analysing the differences and trying to reconcile them, the more anxiety you will feel. Anxiety is uncomfortable but is part of anticipation. Again the brain and associated neural pathways are evolved to anticipate \u2018what comes next\u2019. If unresolved, you may to varying degrees enter what is known as fight-or-flight response. If they are reconciled, you feel better and the disparities are explained way; new memory traces are formed supporting your analysis and all is well. Of course most people reject any such new, confronting information. It\u2019s certainly easier than attempting to reconcile, resolve and update untold memory traces, but more compellingly it\u2019s also likely that in all probability the larger body of previously accepted \u201cfact\u201d is indeed \u201ctrue\u201d. If it worked for you countless times in the past, after all\u2026 then surely you should stick with it? Of course sometimes that isn\u2019t the case, and we may consequently enter what some (Freudians especially) may call a state of denial or perhaps confusion. Indeed we may begin a journey through many and various emotional states, including those of interest, acceptance, anger and even outrage, or whatever may be appropriate in the circumstances, each step having its neuro-physiological impact upon us. Cognition too gets a run in this, especially so if the new evidence is compelling. In turn we re-experience and revisit our worldview, and rewrite or expand upon our existing memory traces to incorporate new \u201cfacts\u201d. In this particular example (of Wayward Pines) the lead character \u201cthinks\u201d he knows who he is and has settled upon a personal World view or inner \u2018map\u2019 of where he fits into his world. And then he finds out that things are not as they seem. Far from it, in fact. He is totally out of time and place. Now from a \u2018neuroscientific\u2019 point of view your worldview is a many-featured, multi-layered and highly integrated memory map that you have built up over your lifetime. It\u2019s your personal go-to toolkit for just about everything you need in life. Indeed as you go through life and experience its ups and downs and twists and turns you build what are called \u201cSchemata\u201d, rationalisations or working guides that you use to reconcile yourself with your observed world. These are very \u2018sticky\u2019 things and hard to shift. You don\u2019t change your mind on such things easily, and not without good reason either. They work for you. In a sense they are you. Schemata are great aids in navigating our lives. If we had to think through every step of every complex action we ever undertake, we\u2019d never get anything done. And we\u2019d get eaten by predators before we figured out whether to stand and fight, hide or just run. Instead we develop these helpful habits that either work for us, or don\u2019t. If they work, they persist and get reinforced. If they don\u2019t, well, we get eaten. But in our modern lives we are often confronted with \u201cthe truth\u201d and for many of us - probably the overwhelming majority - it doesn\u2019t make us change our minds (as it were). We do what we always do - be it stand and fight, hide, or run. Luckily we don\u2019t literally die, usually, because of our beliefs. Sometimes, maybe. In general we have become abstracted from our world, more metaphorical in nature. Still we stick with what we know, believe and trust - our schemata. You see this with faithful behaviour of all kinds, including examples such as religion, brand \u2018worship\u2019, politics and, recently, climate change. In essence once you have been attracted to one side or the other (of a strong belief), it takes something big to shift us. Of course if the \u2018facts\u2019 are so plain to see that they can\u2019t be denied then at some point \u201cthe truth\u2019 will be adapted or adopted into our worldview. Everyone will vary in how they approach this. Some will just deny it and reject any change, of course, as I just outlined above. At all stages in this process your brain (and its underlying neural networks and regionalisations) is hard at work, retrieving information, looking for patterns and matches, finding discrepancies, analysing and building up a response. It\u2019s automatic, you don\u2019t even have to \u2018think\u2019 about it. You feel all of this neural activity emotionally, too. It may affect your whole body. You may shake, sweat or feel dizzy if the realisation or threat is big enough. All of this takes place or is initiated in your brain. And when the process is complete you will find yourself with new or modified memories, new associations between those memories and your emotions, and possibly even a new point of view. And that, of course, is analogous to \u201cchanging your mind\u201d. Hope that helps. Further reading: Robert K. Russell's answer to How are memories stored and retrieved in the human brain? ",

            "answer_text": "Truth, as far as a society or culture is concerned, is a consensus that typically is based on what the majority agrees is truth. Any opinion that does not conform to the majority truth is generally considered sickness or untruth. Different societies are more or less tolerant about the boundaries of truth and sickness. Even within societies, there are different groups of individuals and different individuals who subscribe to different consensuses about what the truth is. It think that truth only matters in a social sense to the degree that disagreements about truth cause harm to other individuals. If an individual has a different truth that society has, it doesn\u2019t really matter until that individual\u2019s behavior starts hurting others. Then, societies vary in terms of the threshold of pain to others that must be arrived at before they will intervene. The threshold can be set in a wide variety of ways. The threshold for social intervention can be set to be dependent on how many people are hurt, or how much they get hurt. There is some calculation based on severity of harm to individual and how many individuals are hurt. An extreme harm to a single individual is of more concern to society than a lesser level of harm to a single individual. Harm that affects more individuals is of more concern than harm that affects fewer individuals. The shock value of a harm also is a consideration when society determines whether to be concerned or not. So a mass shooting of a few individuals has a lot of shock value and deeply harms a few people and that garners lots of attention. Attention does not necessarily turn into a lot of action. In the US, for example, lots of harm can be done to individuals using guns, but taking away guns also is believed to cause a small amount of harm to a much larger number of individuals. These competing notions of harm to how many people and at what severity inform the public discourse about what truth is and what turning away from truth is considered sickness. In the US, not enough people consider death in mass shootings to be worth limiting access to guns for many more people enough of a benefit to pass gun access restrictions. Who understands the truth and who is sick is defined differently depending on where a given individual sees their own personal benefit. Making the other side face the truth is a matter of fierce debate and some violence that so far eludes national consensus on one point of view. I subscribe to the Buddhist notion of basic goodness. I believe that everyone tries to stick with the truth as they understand it given their personal situation. Everyone\u2019s situation is different, and so there will be variation in perception of or beliefs about the truth. People perceive the truth based on their perception of their circumstances. So to change someone\u2019s perception of truth, you can try to change their circumstances or try to change their perception of their circumstances or both. It\u2019s easier to change someone\u2019s circumstances than to change their perception of their circumstances. However, to change someone\u2019s circumstances, you usually have to have the cooperation of other people. This is why we usually leave it to a society\u2019s justice system to change other people\u2019s circumstances. Unfortunately, the main way that people think about changing other people\u2019s circumstances is by limiting their options. This is usually called punishment. It is also possible to change someone else\u2019s circumstances by offering them inducements to change or offering them education. This is generally referred to as a \u201csocial benefit.\u201d Education is a social benefit. Housing and health care and mental health care and roads and garbage collection and security and infrastructure are other social benefits typically provided by societies. Another, less visible social benefit is the development and enforcement of constraints limiting contractual agreements between individuals to those agreements that are considered fair by that society. The benefits society can provide to its members depends on that society\u2019s wealth and access to resources. These factors also help determine whether a society will lean towards punishment to prevent sick behavior vs incentives to engage in truthful behavior. All this changes on the individual level, where individuals harm mainly themselves with sickness, or the harm done to others is not believed to be deliberate or anything that society can do anything about without severely and unduly constraining individual behavior too much. There are many issues that society does not think it has any business intervening in. In fact, most human behavior is considered not beneficial enough for society to undertake an official intervention. Things like fidelity within a marriage or interpersonal communication or personal feelings are seen as areas where society should just leave decisions and remedies for harm up to the individuals involved. In areas like these, notions of truth are highly personal and highly dependent on individual circumstances, history and environment, but most of all, personal attempts at making meaning of circumstances. There may be patterns that are shared across many individuals, but society isn\u2019t concerned, because meaning making is so personal and there is no consensus about what truth is or what sickness is. Society leaves it to individuals to sort these situations out for themselves. The notion of truth and sickness at the individual level can be so much more varied. At this level, it is left to individuals to decide their own personal truths or determine, for themselves, if they are sick, and if so, what the remedy is. In most cases, if people decide they are sick, they can either figure out how to fix themselves on their own, or they can turn to other private individuals to seek help, but society never gets involved in any official capacity. It\u2019s just too much and too much difference of opinion for make it worth it for society to get involved in determinations of truth or sickness, much less intervene. In this area, truth and sickness are matters of individual opinion and discussion. The interventions are matters of what the individuals involved can muster. The responsibility for truth and sickness is a matter of discussion between the individuals involved, and society does not get involved. At most, other people who know an individual will get involved. Sometimes professionals get involved. But mostly, people have to sort it out for themselves. Even if the sickness is a mental illness, for the most part, people have to sort it out for themselves. Society might get involved in determining if the person is disabled, and then provide for that individual\u2019s financial security (or for food and/or housing), but society wants to be minimally involved in managing the individual\u2019s behavior as long as the only person they are hurting is themselves or other people beneath the concern of society. Of course, death is not beneath the concern of society, so if a person wants to kill themselves, society tends to get interested, although they rarely get involved before the person attempts to kill themselves, and even if they get involved afterwards, society has no clue how to intervene effectively. But anything other than death, severe physical harm, or theft of resources is not considered worth society\u2019s time or effort, so determinations of truth and sickness in these areas is left to individuals to work out privately as best they know how. Healing is such an area where it is up to the individuals affected. There is little that anyone else can do make a sick mind face the truth. It\u2019s up to the individual to figure out if they are sick, and if so, what to do about it. Others who care about that individual may want to help, but there\u2019s nothing they can do to get society to take an interest, so they are left to their own devices and understanding to do what they can. There is no social consensus about what to do in these situations. ",
