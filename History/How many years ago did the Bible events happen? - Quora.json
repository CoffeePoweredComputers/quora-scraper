            "answer_text": "Most of them as far as demonstrable historicity is evidentiary proven has never happened at all. They are mythologies and fairytales, make believe and not real. At best one can say they are just fictional writings. There is a vast difference between biblical writings and factual historicity and evidences of historicity. Many people really want the bible stories and such to be true..but this far actual literal demonstrable scientific studies in history and all other areas have thus far proven that most of the biblical events or stories have never taken place. There are somewhere just over 3000 actual given names if individual persons named in the bible,both old and new testaments. It if those 3000 plus names it is factually proven and backed by literal evidences that only about 65 of the 3000 actually and physically existed. There is absolutely zero evidences to indicate the others actually existed at all\u2026 You can not use the bible as evidences or the scriptures of these writings as evidences..these writings are the claims that such exist or hapoened..claims are not evidences. Please understand that the writings are the claim\u2026you therefore can not turn around and also say that the same writings are also proof or evidences.. they are one or the other.. are they the evidences?? Then where is the writings that claim that these people or events happened or existed?? You cant use the bible or scriptures to say that they are claims.. before evidences can be found there has to be a claim first.. there is no mention of any of these things outside of the scriptures or bible to start with..so that makes these writings that first mention all of it and them ..the claim.. so its established they are clearly and only the claim\u2026 So go outside of scripture and the bible and provide demonstrable evidences that any of them existed in reality.. There are none..absolutely zero. What you can find are outside sources that say these early believers claim tbeybelieved in these things or that they claimed that such people existed or the stories were true.. but those are writings about people who said they claimed they believed.. again only claims.. Claims are not evidences.. ",

            "answer_text": "The Bible details accounts over a span of about 6,000 -10,000 years. It was written over a span of about 3,000 years, between about 3,000 BC for Job to the last book of the Bible written by John around 95 AD. We have some specific dates for people and events in history. Here are a few: 2,000 BC. Abram (later Abraham) called by God.1,042 (or 1035)- 971 BC. Kind David alive.605 BC. King Nebuchnezzar of Babylon invades Judah.538 BC. Medo-Persian King Cyrus takes over Babylon. 440\u2013400 BC. Somewhere in this time, the book of Malachi was written, which was the last book of the Old Testament. New Testament is all within 100 years: About 4\u20136 BC (opinions differ), Jesus was born. Making Jesus\u2019 birth a fulcrum date in history was began in 525 AD, and at that time, they weren\u2019t quite sure of the date of Jesus\u2019 birth. Thus, ironically, Jesus was born \u201cBefore Christ\u201d which is what BC means. 27\u201329 AD. Jesus was crucified. 95 AD. John has his Revelation on the Isle of Patmos. Thus the last event recorded in the Bible happened almost 2,000 years ago. So, when you ask \u201cwhen did Bible events happen?\u201d, keep in mind that they happened over a wide range of time. I hope this gave you a decent start. ",
