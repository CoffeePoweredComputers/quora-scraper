            "answer_text": "To Dustin Rosemark, The term \u201cred cent\u201d does not have a racist origin; it has a metallic origin. Look at the reddish copper color of the American penny. There\u2019s your clue as to why it is called a \u201cred cent.\u201d I have lived most of my life in the States (except for a few years in various other countries), and have never heard this allegation. PRO TIP: Not everything has to be racist just because it includes a color (e.g., red) and some coincidental connection (e.g., American Indian/First Tribes) that somebody, somewhere could somehow claim is racist. This reminds me of M. Anonymous\u2019s question about whitewashing and racism. See Sarah Madden's answer to Why is the term \"whitewashing\" still openly used when it clearly has a pro-white meaning (white is clean, anything else is not)? The American penny was formerly almost 100 percent copper (now it is a mix of metals, and is copper-clad or copper colored), which still gives it a reddish hue. At one point, it featured an Indian Head, but in 1909, on the centenary of assassinated President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s birthday, then-President Theodore Roosevelt ordered a new penny to be designed, produced, and distributed. This is how the Lincoln penny came to be.  A copy of the 1909 Lincoln Head penny (source) \u2014Sarah M. 6/28/2018  ORIGINAL QUESTION: Does the phrase \u201cred cent\u201d have a racist origin? ",

            "answer_text": "Doubt it\u2014 pennies are made mostly of copper and are often considered red, as far as coins go. The phrase is usually only used nowadays in the phrase \u201ca/one red cent,\u201d which is considered a negative polarity item, which is a phrase that is at home in negated sentences, questions, and other downward-entailing or non-veridical environments. But it\u2019s weird or even uninterpretable in positive or veridical environments. That\u2019s why it\u2019s grammatical to say I didn\u2019t spend one red cent, but odd to say She gave me one red cent. In this sense, \u201cnot\u2026 one red cent\u201d means something like \u201cno money at all, not even one cent.\u201d give/spend one red cent is in the same family as expressions like sleep one wink, drink one drop, move an inch, give a shit, lift a finger, take a single step, and so on.
