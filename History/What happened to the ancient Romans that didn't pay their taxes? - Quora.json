            "answer_text": "Originally, Roman citizens did not pay taxes directly, but actually had a Universal Basic Income in the form of a grain allowance; this came from tribute from the provinces. Eventually, there was an issue here as the empire was pacified, and there was therefore less tribute seized. Tax collectors in the provinces continued strong arm tactics, and at times were quite abusive seizing property. The official property tax rate was 1 to 3%, I believe. The Roman army also sent home a lot of slaves (which eventually devalued citizen labor.) Romans also paid a lot of taxes on transactions, like sales taxes and customs. The customs taxes led to a lot of smuggling. There was a tax on the manumission of slaves; generally, the slave bought his freedom and paid the tax through his own labor. There was also a tax on inheritances. Generally, if you didn\u2019t pay the transaction tax, the transaction did not complete. As landowner, the Roman government expected a certain percentage of the produce of public lands; this would be seized if not forthcoming. There was room for misconduct here on the part of neighboring property owners. Under the emperors, taxes increased (collected by strong arm officials who could be executed for failure to collect enough), and eventually provincials began to prefer the less greedy German hordes.
