            "answer_text": "No. If they were vegetarian they\u2019d starve. Even the early agriculturalists hunted animals as a supplementary source of meat, although they practised farming. The ONLY reasons why vegetarians and vegans exist in our world is because we are: Civilised enough and have an abundant enough amount of food to think about ethics. If cavemen spent their time thinking about whether it was ethical to kill an animal for food (and hesitated to do so), they\u2019d starve because they are missing out on a usually hard-to-get source of nutrients.* Also, we have an abundant source of food (thanks to supermarkets, agriculture and globalisation), abundant enough to buy enough plant-based foods to last us a long time. Cavemen didn\u2019t. They had to eat anything edible.*Besides ethics, cavemen likely din\u2019t think much about cuteness either. If they found a little baby rabbit, they\u2019d kill it immediately rather than stop to marvel at it, as this is wasting precious time. (Just a point I added for effect.) ",

            "answer_text": "No.  In fact, living a purely vegetarian lifestyle, year round, is only something we have been able to achieve with the benefit of modern conveniences such as supermarkets and the ability to bring food sources from more favorable climates to us for our consumption.   In Prehistoric eras, humans exploited a wide range of foods.  Hunting was a big part of our ancestors lives, especially in certain seasons.  However, during favorable growing periods, they would also eat large amounts of plant foods. ",
