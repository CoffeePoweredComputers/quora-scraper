            "answer_text": "Two main reasons: Method of Colonization and Naval Power Method of Colonization: The French did not allow foreign nations to move to their colonies, they did not allow Huguenots to move to their colonies, they did not heavily encourage colonization, and they tried to import their mainlands social structure. All of these options had one over-arching effect, far less people in their colonies, for comparison New France had 60,000 Settlers at the start of the French and Indian war, British North America had over 2,000,000 this population difference alone was nearly insurmountable and was a main reason that France lost the war, causing them to lose their colonies. Naval Power: The British navy was an uncontested superpower after Trafalgar (1805), and prior to that their Navy was still one of if not the best in Europe, when you\u2019re trying to maintain colonies across a vast ocean, or fighting a war on a continent across the atlantic, Naval Dominance is the most important factor, shipping money, arms, and men while your opponent can\u2019t even leave his port tilts the odds distinctly in British favor.

            "answer_text": "They didn't have the Scots. They used to have the Scots but that alliance was kind of frittered away over several hundred years. They also didnt help themselves by exiling the Hugenots nor be ok with different religious faiths. Louis XIV managed to unite the whole of Europe against him, even the Pope, so there was not much sympathy there either. When Britain was formed in 1707, that was essentially the beginning of the end of French power as it was steadily whittled away over time culminating in Napoleon\u2019s defeats. Again the whole of Europe was united in trying to defeat Napoleon. France never really recovered after that but after the Scramble for Africa they managed to gain a bit of influence and power. Similarly they did have some influence in SE Asia, so it was not all bad but by that time everything had been \u201cdiscovered\u201d. ",
