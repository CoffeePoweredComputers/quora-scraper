Trump and his subordinates have repeatedly described the virus in racist and stigmatizing terms, calling it the Wuhan virus, China virus and Kung Flu.

The Trump administration has increasingly challenged China\u2019s assertions of sovereignty and control over much of the South China Sea. China has long been accused by successive US administrations of stealing American technology. Trump administration sharply limited the number of Chinese citizens who could work for Chinese news organizations in the United States. China retaliated by ordering the expulsions of journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal Trump administration has taken steps to cancel the visas of thousands of Chinese graduate students and researchers in the United States who have direct ties to universities affiliated with the People\u2019s Liberation Army.

            "answer_text": "The most likely possibility is a trade war. I would start by saying that the economic relations between China and the US is remarkably similar to the relations between Japan and the United States. Japan and China both are State Capitalist market economies with export orientation and \u201cstrategic\u201d use of Foreign Direct Investment and markets to improve economic growth. Both are heavily dependent on trade and are the chief Capitalist competitors to the United States. Both markets however, remain largely closed to domination by foreign companies. The United States had up until 1980's taken a fairly lax view on Japan's economic policy despite it's fairly negative impact on American economy especially it's Industry. Japan used Industrial policy to develop it's export oriented Industry that had created vast imbalances in form of excess savings in Japan, heavy trade surplus for Japan that made it one of the largest capital exporters in form of foreign direct investment in other countries, over investment and weak domestic demand. The US was becoming very critical of this as this entire policy depended on Japan being a weak country and the US being unquestionably stronger. It was becoming clear that this was no longer the case. The persistent trade surplus had as I mentioned earlier turned Japan into the world's largest creditor nation in 1985. The impact on the United States was the exact opposite. It had turned into the world's largest debtor nation with it's liabilities increasing from $81 Billion to $831 Billion. This was economically untenable. The Japanese had been the key exporters of excess goods and capital to their trading partners. Well, the Japanese were getting very worried that their core strengths were being recognized and that many people were learning too much of it's secret. Japan employed a trick that Russia would use later (as they did during the recent elections). Use American domestic agenda to influence foreign policy in it's favour. In case of Japan it was the stressing upon racism in American public whereas for Russia it is isolationist tendency on both left and the right. Whenever any article started occurring that stressed upon Japanese differences, the consulate of Japan would respond very quickly stressing that it was racist and exclusionary to differentiate them from the West. They criticized that \"revisionist\" writers who were \"Japan-bashers,\" a barely disguised euphemism for anti-Japanese racists. The local Japanese consul would keep on denying the charges and claim that there were no structural differences in Japan's economy.This campaign succeeded in silencing many critics. Japan even threatened to sell weapons to China and Russia and this worked until the mid 1980's. Nonetheless, the United States then forced Japan to strengthen the Yen (Plaza Accord) which proved disastrous for Japan. The Japanese Central bank cut interest rates which worsened the excess capacity and sent much of the capital into local construction industry and real estate speculation leading ultimately to the bubble burst from which Japan never recovered. Another important point. When the US stock market crashed in 1987, Japan directly assisted the US by buying a large amount of stocks stabilizing the financial system. This made the US implicitly dependent on the Japanese government. In 1995, the Japanese government succeeded in forcing the US to allow for weakening of yuan to boost it's exports. There was an implicit threat that Japan would pull out the support that it was providing the US by buying government bonds and other forms of investment. Japan's low-cost financing replaced America's virtual dearth of domestic savings and allowed the United States to run huge external deficits without paying any of the usual costs, particularly a catastrophic loss in value of the dollar, while keeping inflation low and American financial markets buoyant. The US agreed and that had a devastating impact on South Asia leading to the East Asian crisis because many of those countries had their currency pegged to US dollar and were also export dependent. Worse, they had carelessly liberalized their currency markets leading to a disaster. This relation was taken over by China which has replaced Japan as America\u2019s largest trade partner, biggest source of job losses particularly in blue collar areas, biggest investor in American economy in form of buying government bonds and just like Japan, it\u2019s companies are buying American ones which has raised eyebrows during the Obama administration. There is one major difference however, Japan was an American ally while China is becoming America\u2019s real competitor for geopolitical influence. China has been building very close relations with Latin America (including countries like Cuba) and Africa. This means the same crisis we saw in 1980\u2019s when there was a strong anti Japanese sentiment in the US (see the burning of Japan made cars), we have a strong anti China sentiment. The policy that President elect Trump is pursuing is in some ways continuation of President Obama\u2019s policy. They have recognized that the United States cannot fight all it\u2019s rivals i.e Russia in Europe, Iran in Middle East and China in Asia at the same time. Obama\u2019s attempt to improve relations with Iran was an acknowledgment of this and one of the reasons why the US has not taken a more muscular approach to Syria that France and Germany have been demanding is precisely because the American \u201cestablishment\u201d believes that China is a real threat. Obama attempted to solve this by supporting TPP which was an attempt to improve the competitiveness of American Corporations and business in Asia and Europe. Trump has changed this in some ways. He wants to improve relations with Russia so as to focus better on threatening and combating Iran and China better. His rejection of TPP leaves only the militaristic threat in the arsenal of the United States. It is in this context, we must view his phone call to Taiwan\u2019s President and \u201canti China\u201d policy. ",
