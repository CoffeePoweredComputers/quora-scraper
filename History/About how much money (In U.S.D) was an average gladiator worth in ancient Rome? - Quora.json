            "answer_text": "Well\u2026.this is an ambiguous question. A gladiator were slaves basically (some willingly joined.). They had their own trade unions and often didn't fight to the death because of the vast expenses of upkeep for the gladiators (employers had to make profits too y\u2019know.) We also have some accounts on what gladiators sold for in slave markets. An account from Suetonius told of the selling of 13 gladiators for 9 million Sesterces in auction. This would translate to very roughly 6.923 million USD per gladiator in this instance. It is impossible to set an arbitrary average as the Sesterces\u2019 values changed drastically over the years. Furthermore, due to the fact they were appraised in auction, each gladiator would be sold at different prices, which would be impossible to average with our lack of knowledge. However, it was possible for gladiators to earn freedom, which was considerably valuable\u2026 Hope this helps provide some context to a currently unanswerable question :/ ",
