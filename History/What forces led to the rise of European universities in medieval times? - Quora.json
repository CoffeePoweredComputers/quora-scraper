            "answer_text": "The need for trained clergy and understanding of Latin, the classics, theology, and Roman law, as well as new knowledge from Greek-Byzantine controlled Italy initiated many universities. Some of the first universities were in Italy and from the influence of Spanish centres of study and universities under some enlightened Muslim rulers. European higher education had been for hundreds of years in cathedral schools or monastery schools where monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century and even earlier in the Middle East and Egypt - the Alexandrian Classics and theological schools were famous and well known. So the earliest universities were developed under the Church by papal bull and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was not as widespread, with the University of Paris being an exception. Charlemagne the Great had a very famous school of scholars in Achen in modern-day Belgium from 800 AD and this influenced many other areas of Western Europe. Some scholars came from Greek-Byzantine areas and also England and Ireland, where some very enlightened Christian scholars lived and taught. Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Krak\u00f3w) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval time, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by clergy and theologians living together. Pope Gregory V11was key to promoting and regulating the concept of modern university as his 1079 Papal Decree ordered the regulated establishment of cathedral schools that transformed themselves into the first European universities. ] The first universities in Europe with a form of corporate/guild structure were the University of Bologna in Italy (1088), Paris (c.1150, later associated with the Sorbonne), and the University of Oxford (1167). These universities had a significant influence on the development of modern cities in Europe. The University of Bologna began as a law school teaching the Roman Law of peoples which was in demand across Europe for those defending the right of new nations against empire and church. Bologna's special claim was based on its autonomy, its awarding of degrees, and other structural arrangements, making it the oldest continuously operating institution outside of Muslim Spain, independent of kings, emperors or any kind of direct religious authority. Some records show the teaching of Emperor Justinian\u2019s 6th century codification of Roman law, the Corpus Iuris Civilis, recently discovered at Pisa. Lay students arrived in the city from many lands entering into a contract to gain this knowledge, organising themselves into 'Nationes' or ethnic groups. Elites from many \u2018nations\u2019 sent their cleverest sons to these early universities and this helped to unite Europe as a whole. Trust this helps as I enjoyed studying the origins of cities and universities when I studied at university. Obviously I did not study in the Middle Ages and I am not sure I would have wanted to - a lot of illness and epidemics. ",

It was the first institute of higher learning outside of monasteries. Soon other European cities founded their own universities. ",
