            "answer_text": "Gobekli Tepe in modern Turkey, about 12 km (7mi) from the city of Sanliufa.  It was founded about 11 500 years ago and abandoned about 9000 years ago. The strata of the site shows signs of activity from the early epipaleolithic period. This is the time as the last ice age. Structures have been identified with the following period, Pre-Pottery Neolithic A in the 10th millennium BCE. Only about 5% of the site has been examined. No traces of domesticated plants have been found in the site. Experts think the society that built it was hunter/gather but lived a villages nearby for part of the year. Evidence of residential use has been found. This site predates the discovery of pottery, metallurgy, writing, the wheel and the Neolithic Revolution (domestication of plants and animals). Some time in the 8th century BCE, it was deliberately buried. Why they were buried is unknown but this act preserved the site for future discovery. ",

            "answer_text": "We probably haven\u2019t found it yet. As sea level rose about 10,000 years ago, a lot of land was lost. Then, as now, most people lived not far from the shore. There are probably remains of ancient cities (stone structures, not modern high tech stuff) under a couple hundred feet of water on the continental shelves. We should look for them where rivers would have met the sea before the sea level rose. ",
