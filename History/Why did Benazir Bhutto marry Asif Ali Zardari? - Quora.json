            "answer_text": "Benazir had a lot of marriage proposals from known families in and out of Pakistan, but all of them wanted her to remain away from politics. One of the nawabs wanted Benazir as his daughter in law, but they did not want her participating in politics at all. Benazir was adamant that she leads PPP against Gen. Zia and Hakim Zardari (Asif's father) was for her participation in politics. Being a friend of Nusrat Bhutto (Benazir's mother), Hakim Zardari put forward the proposal and it was accepted though Benazir was reluctant initially. Source: T-Faz, Defence Pak ",

There were names like Faisal Saleh Hayat, a Punjabi, that were considered to have a hold in Punjab but eventually it was decided that Hakim Ali Zardari's son be wed to Benazir to have a political stronghold in Sindh. That decision shows till day when we see Pakistan Peoples Party still reigning without a strong opponent in Sindh province. ",
