            "answer_text": "On Assyrians YES, but not exclusively. Tamerlane dealt the largest single blow to the Assyrian Church of the East of any single leader with the possible exception of the CUP Triumvirate in the Seyfo (Assyrian Genocide during World War I). Tamerlane effectively crushed and destroyed all of the remaining Assyrian Christian communities east of the Caspian Sea which were already declining due to ill treatment during the reign of the later Chagatai Khans and the Ilkhanate, but were still rather numerous. Tamerlane also killed scores of Christians in historic Persia, especially in Samarkand and Isfahan. However, his real damage was dealt in the historic homeland of the Assyrian people, Mesopotamia. The largest single massacre was in the city of Tikrit, which was an Assyrian-majority city at that time. He first besieged it for weeks and when he broke through the walls, he slaughtered every inhabitant who could not flee. Timur continued to march northwards through Mesopotamia and plundered and murdered thousands of Christians on the way. When all was done, the vast expanse of Assyrian Christianity was left in ruins, with their Church of the East pushed back to the mountains in the north of Mesopotamia. Some of Tikrit\u2019s Christians returned, but the population was not sustainable and the city has not had a Christian presence at all in it since the 17th century. In addition to Tikrit, other cities with large Assyrian populations, like Baghdad, and smaller villages were all put to the sword. On Armenians They took a hit, but the Armenian Apostolic Church generally survived. Most of the Armenian people and independent Armenian states were in Anatolia, like the Kingdom of Cilicia or the bulk of the Zakarid Armenia (which also controlled modern Caucasian Armenia). Since a significant part of the Armenian community was outside of Tamerlane\u2019s chief offensives in Mesopotamia and the Caucasus Region, the Armenians were not hit as badly as the Assyrians or Georgians (who were only in the Caucasus region) were.
