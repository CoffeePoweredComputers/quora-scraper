            "answer_text": "Building upon Franklin's work, many other scientists studied electricity and began to understand more about how it works. For example, in 1879, Thomas Edison invented the electric light bulb and our world has been brighter ever since! But was Benjamin Franklin really the first person to discover electricity? In 1878, Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask, and the members of the Vanderbilt family. Edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in Menlo Park. ",

            "answer_text": "Because of it's very makeup and nature, electricity was rather \u201cdiscovered\u201d not invented, with its litany of brilliant contributors standing each others' shoulders and spanning centuries. There's a much misconstrued story that can be found in many American history books that credits Ben Franklin with the discovery in electricity. While he did not discover electricity, his key, kite and Strom experiment did prove that \u201clightning\u201d and \u201celectric Sparks\" are, essentially, the same thing. In 1831, Michael Faraday, the great British scientist, made electricity an integral part of construction of his electric dynamo--the first of it's kind. Closer to our times, the great Thomas Edison is credited with inventing Direct Current (DC) and Nikola Tesla is credited with inventing Alternating Current (AC). I hope this very brief answer helps.

One was very positive and the other was very negative toward the subject. After a short time, it was obvious they were rubbing each other the wrong way. It was a very charged situation. After a few moments of build up, the negative molecule lashed out at the positive molecule with the fury of his potential. Im sure it went something like that\u2026 ",
