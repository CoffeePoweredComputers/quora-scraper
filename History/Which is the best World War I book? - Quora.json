            "answer_text": "Amazon.com: The First World War: An Agrarian Interpretation (Clarendon Paperbacks) (9780198202790): Avner Offer: Books interesting look at the economics of the war. Britain was able to maximize industrial production by relying on overseas supplies of wheat, transported in British ships from Canada, Australia, Argentina, the US, and Russia. Safe passage guaranteed by the Royal Navy. German war planners recognized that would have serious agricultural weakness during a war with Britain, but never found a solution. Except maybe betting on a quick victory. What to think about Germany choosing to fight a war it could have avoided, knowing it had so little hope of winning? In fact, the German military, which was making the decisions, made bets on the future of the German people 3 times, each with no more than a 50% chance of success: 1 Attack west through Belgium towards Paris in 1914, inviting British participation in the war 2 Start unrestricted submarine war in early 1917, hoping to starve Britain before the inevitable entry of the US into the war. 3 Spring 1918 offense in France hoping for victory before the massive army of the US arrives. I guess that up to early 1918 Germany could have offered peace in by withdrawing to prewar boundaries in the west and offering reperations less than demanded by Allies at Versailles.. Whatever one things of the \u201c\"war guilt\u201d clause of the peace treaty, I, 100 years later, can pull up a little sympathy for the leaders of France and Britain which had seen a whole generation killed . I have never seen it, but understand there is a monument at the French Military Academy that reads \u201cIn remberance of the class of 1914\u201d I have been in England and seen many village monuments to war dead, often including several men with the same last names.
