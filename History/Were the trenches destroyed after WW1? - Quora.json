            "answer_text": "Some were naturally filled in with the passing of time. But with the help of Google Earth, they can clearly be seen in some areas, even if they cannot be from the ground. Also, it has to be said, that some areas were so littered with unexploded and gas-filled shells that they were abandoned for human use and forests have grown over them. So they can\u2019t be seen with Google Earth, although a forest in an otherwise rich agricultural region is often a sign that a major battle took place there. It is generally OK to wander through there and you will find craters and indentations showing whete trenches were, but do not pick things up or pull anything out of the ground. ",
