            "answer_text": "Those are two possible correct answers. But there are other answers that have just as much merit as those two. It depends on what your definition of the \u201cRoman Empire\u201d is. If I had to give one answer and stick to it, it would be 29 May 1453, the day that the Ottomans captured Constantinople. My reason for that is that a state entity had been in continuous existence since the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 BC, and that this state\u2019s existence ended with the fall of Constantinople to a foreign power. While the Eastern Roman Empire as it existed in 1453 held none of the territory of the old Roman Republic and was different in almost every way imaginable, it was still the same state. As for some of the other interpretations\u2026 476: On 4 September 476, the German general Odoacer took over the Roman government, deposed Romulus Augustus, the last \u201cofficial\u201d Roman Emperor in the West, and proclaimed himself the King of Italy. After doing this, he appeased Zeno, the Emperor in the East, by returning the Western imperial regalia and stating that the Empire needed only one Emperor, while asking Zeno to officially sanction his position. Zeno, who had enough problems of his own (he\u2019d just put down a rebellion by Basilicus that seriously threatened his position, and he\u2019d just concluded a peace agreement with King Gaiseric of the Vandals that stuck), agreed. 480: Even after the events of 476, the next-to-last Emperor, Julius Nepos, still held control of Dalmatia and reigned as Emperor there. No one paid much attention to him, because he lacked the military force to restore himself in Italy, and four years after taking over in Italy, Odoacer conquered Dalmatia and ended Nepos\u2019 reign there. (He didn\u2019t, however, destroy the last independent part of the Western Empire. That ended when Syagrius lost control of northern Gaul to the Franks in 486). Any interpretation of the end of the Roman Empire favoring 476 or 480 as its end takes the position that the \u201cRoman Empire\u201d ceased to be \u201cRoman\u201d when it lost Rome. I\u2019ve never agreed with this, for several reasons, including the fact that the Eastern Roman Empire was just as much a continuous entity connected with the Roman state, the fact that the official name of Constantinople was \u201cNova Roma,\u201d and the fact that the Eastern Empire later regained Rome, if only ephemerally, during the reign of Justinian. Did that make them \u201cRoman\u201d again until the Lombards took it away? 620: Culturally, this could be taken as the year that the Roman Empire ended. During this year, the Emperor Heraclius, likely in acknowledgement of the reality that the Latin Western regions of the Empire were lost forever, changed the official language of the court from Latin to Greek. Future rulers not only maintained this change, but also favored the Greek title Basileus over the old Latin titles Caesar and Augustus. 1204: On 12\u201313 April 1204, the army of the Fourth Crusade captured Constantinople and appeared to have brought the Eastern Roman Empire to an end. In its place, the Crusaders established a new state centered on the city, the Latin Empire, which remained in existence until the leaders of one of the surviving fragments of the old Empire, the \u201cEmpire of Nicaea,\u201d recaptured Constantinople on 25 July 1261 and announced the restoration of the Roman Empire. Whether or not the Roman Empire ended in 1204 depends on whether or not you consider Nicaea to be a continuation of the Empire, merely exiled from its capital, or a new successor state of the old Empire. This is problematic, as there were other states founded by nobles of the old government on other parts of its territory that weren\u2019t conquered by the Crusaders\u2014one of them, the Empire of Trebizond, always claimed it was the true surviving Roman Empire, and it outlasted even the Nicaean restoration in Constantinople. 1453: The Ottoman conquest of Constantinople from the Palaologos dynasty that had restored the Empire to the capital in 1261, as mentioned before. Usually regarded as the end of the Eastern Roman Empire, or \u201cByzantine Empire,\u201d if you prefer that silly anachronism that has polluted the history books for centuries. 1461: The end of the Empire of Trebizond, previously mentioned, which surrendered to the Ottoman Turks on 15 August 1461. This state was founded in 1204 by the Kommenos, another royal family of the Eastern Roman Empire, and was never reunited even after Nicaea recaptured Constantinople. If you accept their claim, which had some merit, that they were the true continuation of the Roman state in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, then the Roman Empire survived until 1461. 1922: If you accept Mehmed II Fatih\u2019s claim that he was the new Roman Emperor after he captured Constantinople in 1453, then the Ottoman Sultans continued the line until their rule was abolished on 1 November 1922. I don\u2019t accept this, because he militarily conquered Constantinople (and Trebizond, for that matter) and subsumed these states into his own, which had its own history, totally independent from Rome. But some do, because Mehmed assumed the ancient Roman titles for himself, and his successors used them as part of their official titulature until the end of the Ottoman Empire. ",

            "answer_text": "Q: Did the Roman Empire fall in 476 Ad or in 1453? First of all we need to acknowledge what the Roman Empire was and had become. The Roman Empire was \u201cfounded\u201d by Octavian after winning the civil wars among the Romans and defeating his opponents in the Republic.  Augustan era Aquila(Eagle), symbol of the conquering power of Rome, note the orbis in its claws. After the death of his adoptive father Gaius Julius Ceasar Octavian took up the full name of his adoptive father and was appointed Imperator by the Senate and given the new title \u2018Augustus\u2019 - the Holy. As a great propagandist he was elected consul repeatedly during his life in full republican manner. Octavian\u2019s vision of his empire was that it was entitled to conquer the world. In the same manner as Alexander the great before him and others after, like Attila, Djingis, etc. Another title Octavian was given was \u2018Filius Dei\u2019 - the son of God. His adoptive \u2018Father\u2019 had ascended to heaven, which was seen by everyone as a comet crossing the skies(all seven presumebly). Gaius Julius Caesar had, as pontifex maximus - high priest of Jupiter, been killed on the Ides of March(the celebration day of Jupiter) as a sacrifice to save Rome(his opponent whom killed him would partily dissagree, but would be enclined to see the symbolism\u2026) and by doing so becoming an incarnation of Jupiter himself. So from the day Gaius Julius Caesar was deified he was worshipped as equal to the highest heavenly God of Rome. The \u2018son\u2019 on the other hand was compared to the formost son of Jupiter, Apollo. The god of enlightment and the Sun personified. A god which was equal of his father. The insignia of Apollo was the radiant crown. After his death Octavian was deified. Most of succeding emperors was filled with the spirit of the gods and also deified after death. None of them comparable to the first ones but still protectors of the Roman \u2018genius\u2019, or the divine representation of the heavenly empire on earth. You can combine these three divine elements and draw your own conclusions. The Roman republic was transformed into a theocracy with the emperor as its leader and divine representation.  Octavian as Jupiter with the world(Orbis) in his hand And as a theocracy the Roman empire is still alive and has conquered the world in a manner which would make Octavian pleased. nudge, nudge Franciscus\u2026 476To understand what happened when the Goths took power in Italy we need to understand that these people wasn\u2019t foreigners or enemies of Rome. To most people I think the Gothic invasion of the Italian peninsula seems like an end to the western empire. But as others have shown Odoacer was recognized as king of Italy(not of Rome) by the emperor Zeno and Theoderic by the following Emperors. This since they acknowledged the emperor as their liege lord and payed tribute(taxes\u2026). 476 can be seen as the symbolic year of the official introduction of feudalism as ruling ideology by Rome. The Vandals was treated the same way. In Hispania, Gallia, Aegypta, Syria-palestina, etc the same principle was used. Pay tribute/hommage to the emperor and follow his church and the emperor. Your descent didn\u2019t matter. As long as you uphold the administration and beliefs in the Roman church you were an accepted ruler if you took power. Since 212 and the edict of Caracalla all free men living within the borders of the Empire was or could become citizens. A policy which changed the concept of what being Roman was in its foundation. So in the 4\u20135th centuries the previous foederati(allied tribes and neighbouring kingdoms recognising the supremacy of Rome) which had been forced inside the borders of Rome by the Huns, actually had become Romans. If not in practice being so before, since many Foederati men was enlisted in the Roman army anyway. The Gothic army which invaded Italy was not a separate entity of 50,000 men it was a part of the Roman army. They had been used against the Persians and Arabs of Mesopotamia just a decade earlier by the \u2018Magister militum\u2019 - four star general, and right hand of the Emperors, Flavius Aspar. A man of Gothic-Avarian descent, related both to Odoacer and Theoderic, which aspired on the imperial throne for himself or his family, but lost the political game to the Armenians. The Gothic invasion was a mean to regain power by a side stepped political party, and at the same time holding the empire together, and get rid of the competing emperors in the city of Rome. Why else this talk of the sufficency of one emperor(who also still was the divine representative on earth). The joint venture between the Lombards and the Roman commander Belisarius just 70 years later to get rid of the usurping Ostrogoths followed the same pattern. But this time the new vassals wasn\u2019t given kingship. The Lombard lords was installed as Dukes(Latin: Dux) of the several different principalities of Italy, all individually being vassals of the emperor. This didn\u2019t stop the Lombards or the Franks from proclaiming kingship over Italy when there was a new emperor in Constantinople. The imperial church though remained and as followers of the church all its subjects remained Roman. After all, the empire had been parted in two, three, five parts from the 3d century and forward. Constatine I divided the empire in three to his sons to rule each part. It had lost power over several regions and regained it both once and twice, it had abandoned parts like Brittania and Dacia beyond the Danube and Mesopotamia. Rome never was in a constant state, but all belonging to the imperial faith was counted as Romans. 800In my view the year 800 AD was the time when Rome became divided and stayed divided. Pope Leo annoited king Charles I of Italy as Holy Roman Emperor. The new Emperor of the west proclaimed Pope Leo as the divine representative on earth. From this day the Emperors and kings of Catholic Europe held their positions sanctioned by the Pope as \u2018King of God\u2019s grace\u2019. By doing so Leo and Charles took power over the imperial church and the military power in the western part of the former united empire, and efficently dividing the empire. This is the beginning of the Roman catholic church and its separation from the Imperial Catholic orthodox church. 1453In this year the Roman church as political institution lost its imperial power in the eastern part of the old empire. This is important as a symbolic year since this ended the christian theocracy of the east. The administrative legacy of the Eastern empire was carried on by the Ottomans and the religious legacy by the slavic, armenian, koptic and syriac churches. In the west, on the other hand, the Catholic church had reached its peak in Europe and protestantism crushed its 500\u2013800 year old influence on northern Europe, starting at the same time. The Catholic power increased in the world from this time also since it became the common ideology of south and middle America. The intellectual revolutions of the renaissance and the enlightment following, is what lead to the ending of Monarchy(as in King of God\u2019s grace) and the restoration of the Republic as idea. 1918\u201322At the end of what is known as the first World War(WW I) all the remaining parts of military imperial power in the west, east and south east was put to history. Only the catholic church remained. The double eagle was put to rest and instead the white (one)headed eagle of the Republic was reborn and has dominated the world by military means and ideological influence ever since. SummaryRome has since its beginning been as much an idea and vision of unity as it has been a political and ideological power. Its power hasn\u2019t been in the hands of actual Romans since the second century. But\u2026 The imperial, theological institutions of Rome still survive in the Roman Catholic church.The last renamnants of the military Roman empire fell in Europe in 1918 as the Holy Roman emperor of Austrian nation abdicated.The last renamnants of the military and ideologically eastern empire fell with the last Czars in Russia in 1918.The eastern empire as geographical entity fell with the Turkish coup against the Ottomans in 1922.The idea of the Roman Republic lives on all over the world and is by all means concretisized in the second oldest of the still remaining, United States of America.

            "answer_text": "I must disagree with my esteemed friend Mr. Tempest. Using the dates 476 and 1453 tells me that you know exactly what happened in those years. Good. Here is another date for you: 330 A.D. That was the year in which the (very Roman) Roman emperor Constantine the Great decided to administratively split the Roman Empire. In doing so, the Roman Empire now had two distinct capitols, for two areas of jurisdiction. Still, though, Roman citizens were Roman citizens in both, Roman laws were Roman laws, Latin was spoken in both. Unless someone is willing to go way out on a limb I've never seen traversed and say that in 330 the Roman Empire was cut in half, then Rome existed with 2 capitols from 330 to 476. After 476, and here is what's most important, the (still) Roman citizens and (still) Roman government in Constantinople continued on living as Romans, governing as Romans and calling themselves Romans as did everyone else. They even went and reconquered much of the old western empire's lost territory, including Rome. What's important here is that there was an unbroken line of succession of governance from 330 to 1453. The Ottoman sultan who conquered Constantinople in 1453 had no more right to claim to be the heir to the Roman throne then Harry Truman had to the Japanese Emperor's throne. Conquering someone doesn't make you their heir. It makes you their conqueror. Liken it to the United States today. If the United States became so unwieldy that a second administrative capitol was created in Los Angeles, and the dividing line for the two halves was the Mississippi River, would Californians cease to be Americans? Of course not. If all the laws remained the same, and you could still go from California to New York just as you can now, do Californians suddenly stop being Americans? No. If the languages remain the same, laws remain the same and customs remain the same, do Californians start becoming something other than Americans? Nope. If Washington DC is destroyed by roving bands of wild Canadians, and those Canadians end up settling in Florida, now are the Californians something other than Americans? Same flag, same laws, same government as when Washington DC thrived, so why are they now not Americans? They are. If over the course of, say, 300 years, Spanish replaces English in the lands west of the Mississippi River, and much of the old lands east of the Mississippi are retaken, does that mean a Californian wakes up one day to find he is not an American? His passport still says USA, he calls himself an American, and the government in Los Angeles ruled in unbroken succession\u2026.which is the point\u2026.so, yes, he is still an American. Now, if someone wanted to be really technical and super snide and ONLY accept a Roman Emperor living in the city of Rome and administering from Rome as the only conceivable \u201cReal Roman Empire\u201d, and everything else just some poor facsimile thereof, then here is your date: 286 AD. Emperor Maximian moved the administrative capitol of the western Roman empire to Mediolanum, modern day Milan. Oh wait, maybe the Roman Purist would more like to use the date 402? That's is when the Roman Emperor and his court went to Ravenna, and never came back to Rome. Obviously a Roman in 403 in Spain was still a Roman, regardless of whether or not the edicts were issued from Ravenna or Milan or Rome. Just like President Obama can sign a bill into law on a trip to Hawaii and still call this the United States of America. ",

            "answer_text": "In 1922, if you want to get really pedantic about it, when the last Ottoman sultan abdicated. Personally I\u2019d go with 476, but realise that this is purely an arbitrary choice. The Roman Empire slid slowly downhill to a collapse, it didn\u2019t just come to a dead stop one day. The year when the ruler of Italy, and thus the city of Rome itself, formally renounced Roman sovereignty seems like as good a date as any to give if you do need to set a fixed time. After that date, the Roman Empire no longer had any claim to be the universal state governing all the known world (except the barbarian-infested bits it didn\u2019t want) from the Eternal City on its seven hills. That didn\u2019t mean that there wasn\u2019t still a government over in the east still claiming to be the rightful Roman Empire; there was. But anybody can claim anything: and here\u2019s where the date of 1922 comes in. If we accept the claims of the Greek-speaking Christian emperors of Constantinople to be \u2018Romans\u2019, then there seems to be no reason to reject the similar claim of the Turkish-speaking Muslim emperors of Constantinople to be \u2018Romans\u2019. Because they did make that claim. As far as he was concerned. Mehmed II Fatih did not \u2018destroy\u2019 the Roman Empire in 1453; he took it over. He started using the title \u2018Emperor of Rome\u2019 alongside his other titles, and he preserved many Byzantine cultural and administrative traditions. Even the Orthodox Christian church flourished and expanded under Ottoman rule. Mehmed had just as much, or as little, in common with Augustus Caesar as Constantine Palaeologus did; so accepting the dubious claim of one to be a Roman emperor while rejecting the claim of the other seems odd.

            "answer_text": "Although it is quite complicated, with many twists and turns, the fact is the western part of the Roman Empire was given up in the 5th century because Constantine could no longer control the western regions. In 800 AD, the Holy Roman Empire was established under Emperor Charlemagne after feudal lands were loosely reconstituted under a centralized rule. The Catholic Pope co-ruled in many aspects of society at the same time. The Holy Roman Empire held great influence in Europe until Napolean shut it down in the early 19th Century. Though the empire in Constantinople is known by historians as the Byzantine Empire, both the emperor, the army and the people believed they were Roman in every sense, and they were the stongest political and military force in the region during this period. They even attempted to reconstitute the lands of the empire during it\u2019s early years. Finally, what was left of the fragmenting Roman Empire was wiped away by the Ottomans in 1453. The last vestiges of of the \u201cempire\u201d continued as the Papal States under a Pope until the late 1870\u2019s. Since then, it has been one tiny Papal state located in the city of Rome, an empire no more, with a greatly reduced role in society. The Roman Republic, followed by the early period of the Roman Empire, has left an indelible mark on western government and society that has lasted to this day with the formation of republics and democracies throughout the world and with many eastern states borrowing western ideas for government as well. Truly, only Britain, followed by the USA, have come anywhere near it\u2019s grandeur as it pertains to a lasting political influence around the world. ",

            "answer_text": "Sort of both, actually. In 476, the Roman Empire was divided into the eastern and western halves, each with a seperate ruler. Theoretically, they were both part of the same empire and unified. Realistically, they were very different; culturally, economically and militarily. The Western half fell, to the Goths and to infighting and power struggles, in 476, and the Eastern half re-invented itself into Byzantium, which lasted another thousand years until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. One could make the argument that it continued through the Ottoman empire until the end of WW1, but that\u2019s not my field of expertise. ",

A perspective which may surprise you. I will interpret this question as \u201cWhen did the Roman Empire ceased to exist as one unified Empire?\u201d. The answer to this question is the year 394. This was the year when Theodosius was the last sole ruler over a unified Roman Empire.  He was the Emperor who made the Roman Empire a Christian Empire and he was the last sole ruler of the Roman Empire. After his death his two sons couldn\u2019t work together. And so eventually the Roman Empire finally broke apart in the Eastern and the Western Roman Empire. This time for good. This spelled the end for the Roman Empire. However, the Western Roman Empire fell in 476 when Odoacer abolished the office of Emperor. The last Roman Emperor was Romulus Augustulus. The Eastern Empire fell with the fall of Constantinopel in 1453. There are excellent answers for those both cases out there. ",

            "answer_text": "The city of Rome was invaded and sacked several times through its history. The city of Rome ceased to be the center of empire in 476 AD, when Romulus Augustulus was deposed by the Germanic chieftain Odoacer. There had been brief gaps in the imperial succession before, but this one proved permanent (or,a t the very least, it lasted until Charlemagne had himself crowned emperor in 800 AD), so this is the date usually given for the fall of the Roman empire in the west. The eastern half of the empire survived for quite some time thereafter. This remnant is today called either the Byzantine empire or the eastern Roman empire, neither of which was used at the time. Byzantine/Byzantium was occasionally used in unofficial contexts to refer to Constantinople, while those who continued calling the remnant of the empire Roman never qualified it with the adjective eastern. That empire, which was Roman in heritage but hadn\u2019t included Rome for a thousand years, fell in 1453 to the Ottomans, so that\u2019s usually taken as the date of the end of that empire. The Ottoman sultans claimed to be successors of Roman imperial authority, but nobody outside of the Ottoman empire accepted that claim. ",

In my opinions, the ends of this questions is whether to include the fall of the Byzantine empire from the fall of the Roman empire, or exclude it. The reason why I think that we should include the Byzantine empire from the entire Roman empire, is because I think that the Byzantine empire was the connection for the Roman empire. It was the eastern continuation of the Roman empire after the western Roman empire fell. Also, because the Byzantines didn\u2019t call themselves the Byzantines. They called themselves the Romans, they called themselves the Roman empire. It was only much much later that historians tried to separate the period of the Roman empire by calling it the Byzantine empire. The fall of the Byzantine empire was a pivotal moment in world history. But we sometimes forget that part of the Roman empire continued on. Even though the western Roman empire collapsed, the eastern Roman empire survived as the Byzantine empire. ",

After that was a patchwork of Romano-Germanic successor states, with the 476 formal abolition of the Western Emperor title barely a blip. Fall of the Western Roman Empire notes 410 was called the death of Rome: Procopius mentions a story in which Honorius (emperor), on hearing the news that Rome had \"perished\", was shocked, thinking the news was in reference to his favorite chicken he had named \"Roma\".
