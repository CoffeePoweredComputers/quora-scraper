            "answer_text": "From historic facts, many references regarding Jefferson Davis has numerous errors. For example, one failed to mention Jefferson Davis allegiance to the CSA (Confederate States of America). Also, he did not command nor control the Confederate Army. He was President of the Confederate States of America, and Commander-In-Chief of Land and naval forces. The Confederate armies was not commanded by one individual, such as Grant Commanded the Union Army. Fact is, many of the smaller Confederate armies were completely independent and took no orders from Davis or Robert E. Lee. The commander of largest army, and the most well equipped and engaging was the Army of Virgina. The second largest was believed to be the Army of Tennessee. There were approximately 27 other armies, The few smaller armies (approx. 10) within the 27 were to some degree, privately funded and had no affiliation or collaboration with any other army. Little is known about the actual engagements with the enemy of many of these smaller armies. As many descendants of men who fought in these armies today claim more engagements with Union forces than the Army of Virgina.

            "answer_text": "There was no overall army commander until near the end of the war, when General Lee was made General-in-Chief in Jan, 1865. Before then the army was divided into field armies and military departments each under command of their own generals, these generals commanded the army and reported to the overall commander, the President. Examples of field armies include the Army of Northern Virginia under General Lee, the Army of the Potomac under Joseph E. Johnston (which later helped form the Army of Northern Virginia), the Army of the West under Earl Van Dorn, the Army of the Kanawha under Henry A. Wise and the Army of New Mexico under Henry Hopkins Sibley. Departments were concerned with manning installations such as forts, unlike field armies Departments were given a specified geographical region under their command. ",
