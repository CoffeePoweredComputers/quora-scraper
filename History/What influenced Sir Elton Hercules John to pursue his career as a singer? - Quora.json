            "answer_text": "Some of Elton John\u2019s earliest influences were Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis. He began playing piano at an early age. He played classics, and other songs that his grandmother taught him. But once he discovered rock n roll, that was all he wanted to do. He played piano in clubs and pubs. He joined a band called Bluesology, where he was a keyboardist and backing vocalist. But he wanted more. He knew that if he wanted to be more than just a keyboardist in the background of an average band, he was going to have to leave the band, and go out as a solo artist. But he wasn\u2019t actually looking to become a performer. He wanted to be a song writer. That brought him to Liberty Records, who introduced him to lyricist Bernie Taupin. Bernie would write lyrics, Elton (then Reg Dwight) would put Bernie\u2019s lyrics to music. They wrote many songs, but no one wanted to record or perform their songs. They learned that Reg would have to come up with a much cooler and more hip stage name, so he changed his name to Elton John. After a few years of writing and trying to come up with a hit, Elton and Bernie composed \u201cYour Song\u201d. The rest of course, is the history of Elton John, which most people know and love to this day. In a nutshell - it was Elvis and the early days of rock n roll that inspired Elton (Reg) to get into pop/rock music. That led to frustration of being a background keyboardist. That let him to writing with Bernie. That made him realize he needed to perform his own songs. All of this was the long difficult path that led him to become Elton John, who was turned out dozens and dozens of albums, with dozens of hit songs spanning almost 50 years. ",
