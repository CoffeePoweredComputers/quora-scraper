            "answer_text": "From my French Grandfather (Other nation\u2019s soldiers may have had a different experience): In the winter of 1914 ~ 1915, the cycle was 1 week in the front line trenches, one week in the second line trenches, and one week behind the lines. PS. My Grandfather was in the northernmost French unit on the line. The next unit north of him was a crowd of Scotsmen from a Scots unit of the British Army. They seemed quite warm, as opposed to his companions. Upon observation, he found that the Scots had: A set of woolen socks in their bootsAnother set in their haversacksAnd, a third set on a pair of knitting needles!To the day he died, my grandfather sat in his chair, knitting! There\u2019s nothing like a pair of clean dry socks in a dank, muddy, trench, he used to say! PS. His position was overrun in March 1915, he was captured, & sent to a POW camp in Germany. \u2026. The POW camp was run to support a local farm. After the war was over, he married one of the farmer\u2019s daughters! His wife (my Grandmother) always complained that he was a lousy farmer! ",

            "answer_text": "Sometimes a week, but it varied greatly, one unit once took 3 or 4 days to get to the unit they were replacing due to the mud in the trenches they had to get through to get to the front and lost a third of their unit on the way, there are so many similar accounts to research, war is nasty but even us who served in modern times with modern kit which includes boots and clothing just can\u2019t imagine the hell our forebearers went through.
