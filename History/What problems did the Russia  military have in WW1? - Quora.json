            "answer_text": "Lots of problems: 1. Remember it was still the Czar in World War I.  Very feudal, especially for the twentieth century.  Very few rich, lots of extremely poor. The Czar in particular was not interested in Russia being a military nation.  Prior to the war, he provided very few resources for the army, preferring to concentrate his efforts on local security. He was not well liked, at all.  No help for the peasants, lived in opulence.  I'm not saying he was unusually heartless, just that he was an old fashioned feudal King (Czar). 2. Very badly trained army.  Badly paid, badly fed, barely trained at all.  Bad leadership, political instead of military.  Bad equipment. Bad food. 3. When the war broke out in fall 1914, almost everyone around the world expected a four month war.  As huge casualties on all sides mounted, there were gigantic drafts of men.  In Russia, this was done quite forcefully and again, without any thought to choosing the best men, or provide training.  Just round up thousands upon thousands of guys and ship them to the front. 4. They did very badly in battle from the beginning.  There were on the allied side (British, French) against the Germans.  The Germans were invading Belgium / France and had a lot of esprit de corp, at least in the beginning.  Russia was supposed to attack Germany in the East to take the heat off the Western Front.  Huge losses and no progress.  Continued pressure from the British and French to do more. Doing more did nothing but lose more Russian lives. Remember that those that attacked were massacred by those who defended (all sides), but here it was Russia doing the attacking. 5. The war on all fronts was going nowhere.  Thousands of dead were lost to gain yards.  Initial breakthroughs were reversed for no permanent gain (by all sides).  The new trench warfare with machine guns slaughtered the old massed attack technique. There were draft riots in France.  Huge protests in Britain.  As causalities when from hundreds of thousands to Millions, on all sides, the regular people didn't want to continue to die for their country with no discernible gain.It was particularly bad in Russia where the peasant army had even less reason to want to fight, and no support for the current government (Czar). When the Russians protested, revolted;  they were met with extreme force.  Lots of deaths putting down the army insurrection. 6. There is some truth to saying that the 1917 revolution (after three years of devastation) came about because of the enormous failures over the war in Germany. ",

            "answer_text": "A lot, the entire thing : 1)Wrong & Absurd Army Tactic & Doctrine Russia army was using Quantity Doctrine, which mean they focus maintain large number army & using light artillery rather then Heavy Howitzer. Meanwhile they enemy, Germany & Austro-Hungarian Army maintain superior firepower & quality, that why Russia army was defeated during Austrian & German counter attack in 1915 2)Large Front In the eastern front, Russia army was fight in multiple front. Again Germany in the north, Middle Austria, South Ottoman. Meanwhile the central power divided they frontline make them more good supply line then Russia & Ottoman blocade to Russia in Black Sea cut they Grain Import, damaged they economy 3)Idiot General The reason Russia defeated because Commander in chief & Chief of Staff Russia army is Tsar Nikolas II, a idiot man that doesn`t know how to put crown in his own head. The Russia general staff is pretty good, such General Brusilov for his success in Brusilov Offensive in 1916 that nearly collapse the Austrian army. But the Tsar was who take control, he charge in everything., they general only listen to his dump tactic. Believe they can win with trench warfare & Quantity doctrine, meanwhile abadon Inflatration starategy that develop by General Brusilov & use in Brusilov Offensive. Meanwhile the German Army was lead by General Paul von Hindenburg & Lunderdoff, bothside was a war hero that has more experience then the Tsar ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A, Joseph Grenn. >>What problems did the Russia military have in WW1?  Russian poster describing Entente Cordiale. Quite interesting is that French and British didn\u2019t see the alliance this way as per wiki article. Actually, quite few: Poor counter-intelligence. This flaw was never overcame, especially in the Navy. While Soviets managed to change the situation in the army by 1940s, Navy was just an entertainment park for all types of saboteurs all the way till 1990s (i.e. while there was a navy to talk about) - at least two battleships were blown up in home ports [1,2] in 20th century , numerous rebellions both pro- and anti- Reds, atomic submarine \u201csunk\u201d etc.Low culture of radio codes usage in 1914 as well as low trust to the radio messages. This problem is connected to the previous one - a lot of technical specialists drafted in WWI in Russia were members of Red parties, secret pacifist, saboteurs and banal spies. Thus orders coming through the radio were sometimes ignored or not fulfilled in time. Most striking example of this problem was East-Prussian operation of 1914.Besides these two, all the other problems (\u201cold\u201d generals, lack of ammunition in 1914\u20131915, logistics issues, etc.) were common to all the participants of the war and Russia overcame them at the same rate or faster than others.

            "answer_text": "First and foremost, this one:   Nicholas II of Russia. An absolute monarch who saw his power as a divine right and not a little bit as a responsibility. With no military training, appointing and dismissing commanders on the basis of his wife social preferences, suffocating industry to keep the country \"Russian by soul\", unable to fight corruption, making decisions on the basis of anything but data and advice of the experts - he was a disaster.  Poor strategic command, as a result of the main problem. While Aleksei Brusilov was universally accepted as brilliant, he could only do that much. Most of the appointments had nothing to do with capability. I have to admit that the novels All Quiet on the Western Front and WW1-era English novels were quite a revelation to me, describing behavior of school-educated, reasonably intelligent soldiers at war, learning and teaching each other how to survive. Russia at the time was a 3rd world country with 1st world intelligentsia. While there were examples of brilliance, many soldiers were just uneducated crowd.  And of course the supply chain where at any step someone has to steal some part of supplies or money, and waste some. ",

Russia had the world's largest army.2. It had the World's largest Cavalry.3. But it also had the world's largest artillery, it had a lot of heavy artillery and howitzers. Its artillery was equal or greater in number to German artillery. Also the Military budget was equal to Germany (Germany in 1913 was the pre-eminent economic and military powerhouse of Europe)4. problem was - most of the country was illiterate, meant the quality of officers and nco's was terrible.5. The officer corps was top heavy with old generals many of whom could not climb a horse!6. Terrible staff work.7. Russia produced a lot of food pre-war, it was the largest exporter of food in Europe but mismanagement meant people in cities starved.8. Yes, CZAR was bad, but Lenin-Stalin were worse. ",
