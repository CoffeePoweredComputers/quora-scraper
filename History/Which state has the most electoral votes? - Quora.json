            "answer_text": "There are two ways of looking at this. Obviously, the most electoral votes go to the states with the biggest population. California, New York, Florida, Texas. But which state gets the most Electoral College power per vote? That would be Wyoming, whose voters get 3 times the weight of New York voters in the Electoral College. Also high up on the Small State Tyranny list: Vermont, Alaska, Hawaii, and North Dakota, whose voters get 2 to 2.5 times the power of Californians. It makes you wonder about democracy. ",
