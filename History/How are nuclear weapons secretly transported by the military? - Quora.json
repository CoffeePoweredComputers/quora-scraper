General civilians can\u2019t snoop sea and air transportation.Most of the time military moves weapons around country inside containers and vehicles that appears normal from outside.

Photo by Steve Jones CC By 2.0 It was during this production phase that the United States began to transport their nuclear arsenal across the country in what were known as White Trains. These trains were white and heavily armed, complete with sniper turrets, armor and armed guards within. The white trains were made to be inconspicuous, moving nukes across the states to silos without attracting much attention. The white trains would be in operation until 1987 and run by the Department of Energy. While the trains were a national secret, kept hidden to avoid enemy spies from taking notice of weapons being transported, eventually, the citizenry of America took notice. ",

            "answer_text": "The actual warheads are usually flown by the Air Force if they are American nukes. Wherever they need to go in the world. The easiest thing to do is simply load a bomber up with them as it would be configured for actual missions and fly them wherever they are going. They are safetied during transportation and can't detonate the nuclear core. The missile warheads rarely have to be moved off the base be that Navy or Air Force. However the bombs do have to be moved, and some are stored overseas in 4 countries in Europe. They have to be inspected and maintained periodically. Our primary nuclear bombs are the B-61 and B-61 Mod 12.   As you can see they aren't very big. They are a little over 11 feet long, 13 inches diameter, and weigh 700 pounds each. They can be adjusted over a wide range of yields up to 400 kilotons. The latest modification makes it easier for the F-35 stealth fighter to carry them.  Here they are in a loading rack. All buttoned up and ready to go. If need be they have been transported by both Truck and rail as needed. Anytime they are move it is of course a classified operation and they blend right in with other trucks and vehicles. You may have driven right by them and never known it. ",
