            "answer_text": "I supported the Vietnam War in the late 1960s and until it's end. Many Vietnamese wisely rejected the Communist beliefs of the North. The war should have been easily won by a far superior American military that was misused by one of the worst American presidential administrations to ever lead the nation. The Democratic Party leadership that followed after the death of President John Kennedy, who (along with President Eisenhower) got America involved in Vietnam, had not the same level of courage as Kennedy or Eisenhower. The Johnson Administration was timid and afraid of the Russians and Chinese. Thus, they withheld and misapplied the strongest options of the U.S. Military. Then and Now American forces could have run over the small communist nation saving the suffering of the long drawn out war and of the torturous reeducation of the defeated noncommunist Vietnamese at the war's end. Why support the war? A principled person should always resist and fight communism and it's underlying socialist philosophy in every way, as in all its forms (social democracy, democratic socialism, etc.) It represents one of the inherently evil forms of governmental control. Socialism is indefensible on any level because of an immorally flawed basis. The sinful (in the eyes of God) immoral belief system and the deceptive lies of its supporters and perpetrators are the reasons comments will be disabled in this answer. I can counter those lies that it's supporters might have laced their comments with, but have tired of doing so over decades. I will not give them a podium or pulpit and the opportunity to pollute people's mind's here. I personally have known too many of socialism victims over the decades, whose families and lives it has destroyed. As many did in Vietnam, and failed because of poor American leadership, honorable, principled people should resist socialism to their last, dying days. ",

Uriah Gandee at Trenton, Brandywine, Lexington, and Concord. William Alexander Company C 19th Va Calvary. Captured Moccasin Gap Va. Enlisted in Union Army. Indian Wars in Texas. My great uncle 81st Infantry WW1. KIA. My Dad in WW2, South Korea, and Vietnam. Me in Vietnam, Colombia, Guatemala Panama. Guatemalan Bronze Star. Sister graduated Annapolis and retired from the USMC. We were a military family. Everybody served. My time was after I graduated at 17 in Germany at Mannheim. I joined at Rhein Mein. USAF. I was deployed 179 days to Vietnam and the Philippines in 72 and at the fall of Vietnam in 1975 during Operation Babylift and Operation New Life. We as a family knew there would be a blood bath in Indochina if the region fell. So I went. I did not want to fight in bugs and the mud in what seemed to my family as a lost cause. Instead I repaired F4s and then C130 aircraft. Later the SR71 flying over Korea and North Vietnam out of Kadena. DaNang was Rocket City and not an easy place to live. Nor was the witness of the fall of South Vietnam. Apocalypse. Created by the USA essentially. Once one starts a war they should finish the damn thing. Not to mention the deaths of Americans. As a military family a house full of crying kids and their mom was not unknown to us. People we knew. In peace and war. The old recip aircraft were not reliable as the aircraft of today. My mom lost a husband in a training crash and an electrocution in a shipyard both in WW2 before she married my father. We served the country. ",
