            "answer_text": "Well\u2026 it\u2019s easy. There are two types of wars the US engages in: One where they\u2019re genuinely worried about allies, and one where they\u2019re most certainly just there to be there. Let\u2019s think about WW2: Led by Harry Truman, a moderate Democrat (still revolutionary for its time) who led the country to victory and internationalism. I know it isn\u2019t actually as concise as that, but, bear with me for a bit. The Korean War? Led by Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate Republican. While he most certainly did not help to \u2018fix\u2019 Korea, per se, he did keep South Korea in the fight. The Vietnam War? Intervened in by John F. Kennedy, the \u2018New Age Democrat\u2019. He could have done it right, but two presidents later, Mr. Nixon, a reactionary conservative Republican, would ruin the entire effort as a whole by even breaking law. Iran had Jimmy Carter. Progressive Activist. The US did little to nothing in that war except give Iran\u2019s people a lasting hate for the country and build a big reserve of oil\u2026 so yeah, let\u2019s skip it. Iraq and Syria? George Bush Junior. It was a disaster that was largely a publicity stunt by Bush in order to get a re-election - and one of the longest wars in recent history. What happened to the economy each time? Nothing. Most of these wars, with the notable exception of Iran, have had little to no effect on the US economy, because they\u2019ve never hit the US directly - just proxy wars or in the Middle East. So why do they invade? The first four I listed were some mix of securing allies, protecting interests, keeping up a reputation, and other factors. The last? A total shitshow (mind the language) of idiotic actions made to keep Bush and the Republicans in so-called \u2018power\u2019. Now you might be wondering why I\u2019ve left out many, most notably CIA interventions. That\u2019s because such actions were usually motivated by the CIA\u2019s authority, which during the 50s, 60s and 70s were highly partisan and while practiced with general American consent, not really with actual knowledge (which is to say they didn\u2019t know a thing about what was actually happening.).

            "answer_text": "Hmm.. After WW2 it was evident that the commies were up to no good. It was already evident prior to the war. So to counter them and learning the lessons of complacency and appeasement, the US and its allies tried to prevent the spread of communism and Soviet influence throughout the world, even going so far as to arming some Muslim-occupied countries. Little did they realize, which was also an act of appeasement and complacency based on forgotten history, that the Muslims they armed like the Afghans and Arabs were the West\u2019s and the whole world\u2019s true enemies. Also, some US politicians especially the pro-globalism, NWO ones are using the military as a racket. ",
