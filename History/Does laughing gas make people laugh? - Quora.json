            "answer_text": "Yes, for me it did. I was fifteen years old and had to get 4 wisdom teeth out so the dentist decided to have me get them done all at once. The operation began by them placing a small mask over my nose, and they administered the gas. The smell of it was not describable, but it was quite pungent. This was funny to me, and I chuckled a little. Then I began feeling the lightheadedness and sedation of the gas, which I though was utterly hilarious. I lost it. I was laughing historically, and for some reason I could not control it. With every large inhale I breathed in more gas only adding to the humor. The nurse humorously exclaimed \u201cWe got a laugher!,\u201d and before I knew it I was awake in a recovery room with my parents and a numb face. Apparently they gave me general anasthesia and didn't even know! So yes, laughing can can definitely help induce some serious laughter for some people. ",

I had a funny experience when I was a senior resident with this. We used to use Nitrous oxide in the delivery room, so it was always available. A nurse came running up, yelling, Dr. Bollmann, come quick. I entered the delivery room where there were 5 nurses surrounding an intern, who had decided to try the gas on himself. He was standing with his knees bent, trying to get up, but he was stuck halfway, not knowing where he was. Just sort of stuck there - not sitting, not standing. With a weird look on his face. ",

The second time I noticed that a small part of the light fixture above my head looked very much like the face of a mouse. It was grinning at me and had one eyebrow raised as if interested in my wide open mouth. Tears came to my eyes as I ordered myself not to laugh. I tensed every muscle in my body to fight the feeling. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d the dentist stopped and asked. I snorted and managed a nod. The snort hurt my nose which ticked me off at the mouse. I kept my eyes shut for the remainder of the procedure. Afterward I had to stay seated until the gas effects wore off. As normality returned I checked out the mouse. It was an adjustment knob for the fixture. I could still see how I found a mouse in it which was cute. ",

I have seen one or two giggle close to administration time, but not as an effect of the substance. The effect are drowsy and dissociative, so the physical act of laughing is made substantially more difficult and eventually impossible. However, it can for instance be a strange or even bisarre experience, with unfamiliar echo sounds, numbing of the face, etc. and that may be humorous and lead to smiles, and/or giggles afterwords if someone tries to explain what they just experinced.
