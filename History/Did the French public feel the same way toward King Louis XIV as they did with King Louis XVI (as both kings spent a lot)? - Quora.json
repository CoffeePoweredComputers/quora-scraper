            "answer_text": "A resounding no! While Louis 14th did spend ungodly amounts on his new capital city Versailles, money was pouring into France due to his victories in battle trusting the right generals and expanding the borders and prosperity of France. He also reorganized the gov\u2019t to help the people more after a scary moment happened to him when he was a child when he was captured by a mob in the Frondes uprising and almost was killed. He was used as a pawn in the game between the rich and the new middle class and I believe he learned that the French populous was powerful indeed. Louis 14th expanded schools, patronized the arts (he was a brilliant dancer himself) and helped the middle class emerge to have a place in Aristicratic society. By the time 1789 came and Louis 16th was weak, broke and in the middle of a horrible famine that rocked France. His solution was to raise taxes, but not on the Church and Nobles who had all the money, but on the 3rd Estate. It was this weakness that sealed his fate leading to the rise of the French Republic and age of Napoleon. Louis the 14th was bright and strong and when he was 18 he choreographed a Dance and invited his Regent Mother Anne of Austria who was the regent ruler after Cardinal Mazarin died, and in the dance a young boy comes of age to lead his family - a thinly veiled message that he was in charge. Yes, he believed in the Divine Right of Kings, but that actually works if the King has statecraft talent like he and not the bumbling idiot of his great-grandson Louis 16th. He only proved the need for elected gov\u2019t and the time of Monarchy to end. ",
