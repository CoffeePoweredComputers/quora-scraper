            "answer_text": "What an excellent question \u2026 To think this through, you need to think about how the data is going to work. When we think about rich and poor we are mostly thinking about consumption coming from income. It\u2019s almost impossible for either of those to come out as a negative number. So, they start at zero, but they then go out to something that may as well be infinite. Data like this isn\u2019t unusual, but we do have to think about it differently. Incomes are like this. So are home prices. And even stuff like home runs hit in your career, or number of dogs that live on a city block. With each of these, the bottom end is near zero, and there\u2019s a lot of observations around that low value. Most of the observations will still be positive, but they get really stretched out and spread thin. Examples will help. No one agrees what the richest and poorest countries are, but let\u2019s say America and Nigeria. Here\u2019s the thing, since income can go as low as zero, the poorest people in both countries will be living at about the same level. Now, America has about twice the population of Nigeria, but the sense in which America is richer is that it has far less than twice as many of those poorest people. In fact, it probably has less than Nigeria. But it doesn\u2019t have zero. No country does. What makes America \u201cricher\u201d is the higher proportion of people at higher incomes, and the highness of those higher incomes. So, the answer to your question is really easy: the richest in the poorest country are far richer than the poorest in the richer country.  But I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the question you really want answered. Again, some numbers might help. Maybe incomes in America are distributed like these 20 numbers: 0, 9, 9, 9, 9,19,19,19,19,19,19,19,29,29,29,29,39,49,69,999 Nigeria has half as many people, but its income look like this: 0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,4,39 So, the poorest people in the two countries both have zero, but there\u2019s more of them in Nigeria. And the richest Nigerian is doing pretty well by American standards, but America has more rich people, and they\u2019re even richer. So the poorest person on the richer country is at 0, and richest in the poorer country is at 39. That\u2019s consistent with the answer I gave above. But like I said, data like this is weird. A common thing to do is to drop some portion off the top and the bottom (which is where most of the unusual stuff is), and then compare what\u2019s left. Typically we drop off 10% off the top and the bottom. That\u2019s 2 off each end for America, and we get: 9, 9, 9,19,19,19,19,19,19,19,29,29,29,29,39,49 And 1 off each end for Nigeria, and we get: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4 And this corresponds more with how most people think about different countries, in that, the poor are worse off in the poorer country, and the rich in a poorer country aren\u2019t doing that well at all. This is the reality when we talk about what material things many poor people have in America \u2014 multiple color televisions, smart phone, air conditioning, and so on \u2014 and the material things that middle class people in poorer countries want but don\u2019t have yet \u2014 new cars, multiple bathrooms, and so on. None of this should be seen as making excuses about poverty. But, I hope it helps make clear that there are some really sticky data issues here that most people are too quick to ignore. ",
