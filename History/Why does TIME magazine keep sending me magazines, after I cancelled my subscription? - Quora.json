            "answer_text": "Why does TIME magazine keep sending me magazines after I cancelled my subscription? A magazine with such a large subscriber base may lag behind on this. In 2014 they had about 3.3 million in circulation. TIME has it\u2019s own department that deals with this part of the business. This department is called TIME Subscription Center. They collect all the names and addresses, handle funds, online and offline subscribers from various parts of the world. There are offices that deal with Europe, Asia, USA, Latin America, and Canada, even customer service locations I found in Australia & South Pacific Islands, as well as New Zealand. With this many gears going at one time, it is likely that your subscription may have been \u201cbacked up\u201d and then returned to the current mailing list from an old one. Or, they accidentally never deleted \u201cyour\u201d subscription in the first place. You can contact them through customer service closest to you. I suggest you do it each time you get an unwanted issue. Have the name, address, and account id code off the magazine mailing label for easier time getting them your accurate account info. Obviously they must remove your subscription address or change your status to \u201cinactive\u201d so no more copies will be shipped out to you. They offer this link to their return policy info\u2026 TIME Magazine | Returns Policy And this link for sending in the info by email\u2026 TIME Magazine Customer Services Good luck. ",
