            "answer_text": "I would say it more appropriate to ask: \u2018 \u201cWhy does Spain still exist\u2019!? After all, Portugal has been an independent country for 840 years, with 60 years of Spanish co-joined rule, due to Portugal\u2019s monarchic sucession crisis in 1600. As others writers already touched upon, Spain surely tried to invade Portugal numerous times, yet unsuccessfully. Many were the reasons, and some have already been mentioned, but then just as now Portugal was/is a cohesive, unified group of people, not Leonese, Castilian and no wish to be so; and honestly. to this day nothing has changed. Our will to be first and foremost, different, rebelious, independent and Portuguese, ruled our destiny and was the main reason for the countless battles between Portugal & Spain, where even our peasants joined the efforts of battle. Being Portuguese was the reason why we needed to exist then, and now. There were geographical and topographical challenges involved in a Portuguese invasion by Spain. Not so much now, but centuries ago it was not easy to fight, and win against Portugal on the ground, let alone in water, and if push comes to shove, a few Flemish & English mercenaries helped us do the job against Spain, too busy trying to keep other Iberian kingdoms under their control. Knowing this, Spain worried how we would react to another invasion, because Spain had problems in Morocco, and would have problems with us too; that was often enough to kept Spain at bay. To this day some Spaniards, still think it makes absolutely no sense for Portugal to be independent. We are just like them, (they say) and it is our silly, stubborn, rebelious streak that stops Spain from being the Iberian super state they feel they should be. Why can't Portugal be like Aragon, or Navarra, or Galicia? Simply, because we don\u2019t want to, and that to this day, many Spanish either do not understand or accept. Furthermore relations between the Spanish and Portuguese crowns also helped curb Spain's wishes for Portugal, even after the Monarchy being toppled in Portugal. During WWII Franco planed to invade Portugal in 24 hours. Of course, our PM Salazar dealt with him shrewdly. Franco put Portugal on the back burner. He had tougher \u2018fish to fry\u2019, post Spanish Civil War, and WW II was upon him. The last Franco \u2018attempt\u2019 at an invasion of Portugal was in 1975. He asked the USA for support for the invasion because he was afraid of \u2018danger\u2019, case in point, the possibility of a Communist government take over due to the Portuguese political instability after the 1974 Carnation Revolution. Supposedly, Spain felt \u2018threatned\u2019 being our neighbor but Harry Kissinger told him to go fly a kite. With the unrest in Catalonia, Euskal Herria, (Basque Country) internal terrorism and economic hurdles, Spain seems to have put a stop to their Portuguese invasion pastime, and let\u2019s hope it is forever. A Portuguese politician once cynically asked King Juan Carlos: \u2019Isn\u2019t time to think of an upcoming Iberian Union, your Highness!? The King\u2019s response: \u201cNo\u2026 what I am rather worried about is a Spanish Union\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks. Frankly your question could almost be considered hostile. I for one would never dare to ask why the UK, the US or any other country are still around, though sometimes I wonder if the present circumstances will not risk the unity of certain countries. Anyway, let\u2019s go on. Well that\u2019s easy to reply my friend. Portugal exists because the Portuguese people wants Portugal to endure. Believe me, our neighbours tried a number of times to destroy the Kingdom and were unsuccessful in doing so We have been invaded a few times and always have shown some kind of resistance be it active be it passive. We are frankly one of the very few real nation-states in Europe with a very strong national identity. The shift into a modern notion of centralized State (i.e. the one Jean Bodin describes) began very early in the 15 Century, though all through the middle ages our sovereigns were realy more than a \u201cPrimus inter pares\u201d. Several enquiries as to land and assets belonging to Church, Nobility and Local councils go as far back as the 13th Century. Several \u201cPragmatics\u201d against the Church abuses date as far back as our 3rd King resulting in his excommunication by the Pope. Attempts of a avant la lettre Gallicism, i. e. a proper national Church (though not separate from Rome) date from the country\u2019s inception. The official language is the Portuguese from 1290 as well as our first universities Our own Magna Charta dates from 1245 - the Oath of Paris by Alphonse III and the Avis dinasty relied heavily on Popular consent having realized 39 cortes (assembly of the 3 states) in John I reign alone, from 1385 on. We discovered almost all of the known oceans to men, whilst fighting in severall continents at the same time. We advanced nautical sciences and cartography whilst England and France were still at eachother\u2019s throats and rescued Europe from the dark ages. All that with barely more than 1 million of population. Our expansion was not privately lead as the English or the Dutch, but resulted from a State lead iniciative that entailed a national effort and is indeed one of the primary forms of State Capitalism. It is fair to say we set the foot for the first globalization, and others followed our lead. We have managed to be either trading, colonizing lands or at war on 4 continents at a time. For sakes we even had an adventurer made king of Thailand! And don\u2019t think we sticked with the 16 th century! Guess who was the first european to reach Tibet? You know the answer. So with all these credentials that make us very competitive in almost any criteria with other european states (Nations or not) you may understand why it is upsetting to be replying the same answers all the time. Cheers and a fabulous 2019! ",
