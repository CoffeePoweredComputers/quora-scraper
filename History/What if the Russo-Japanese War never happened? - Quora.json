            "answer_text": "Now there are several reasons why this war might not have happened, but since answers that take two hours to write, and ten minutes to read, aren\u2019t my definition of fun Quora reading, I\u2019ll keep this answer just to what would happen, had the Russo-Japan War not occurred. First, we\u2019ll look at Russia. Russia, up until the Russo-Japanese War, was seen as the Big Bear of Europe and Asia, nearly undefeatable in war. This would change as the failures of the Russian army during the Manchurian campaign in the war revealed the problems they faced, inability and incompetence of the officer corps, and how their soldiers were lesser equipped and trained. This knowledge would provide more incentive for nations like Germany and Austro-Hungary to start expanding their influence or challenge Russia\u2019s sphere of influence, most notably in Serbia. Now if the RJ War had not happened, the Germans might have been reluctant before challenging Russia, but they would still escalate during the First World War, as the German Army was considered the strongest on the European continent, so not much change there. However, one large change would be the 1905 Revolution, which would not happen without the war. Although the disdain, wishes, and plans for a revolution in Russia would still be there, the failure of the RJ war was what set the ball rolling for the revolution to happen. This would delay the revolution until either a) the revolutionary leaders became restless and launched the revolution, which would fail without enough popular support or b) until Nicholas II makes a bad decision that effects a lot of the common populace badly. Either way, if the 1905 Revolution happened later, this would be very bad for Nicholas II, regardless if he had to democratize like he had in 1905. This would show Russia is unstable or cause a loss of trust in the military once the First World War started, and might even accelerate the revolutions that happened in 1917 or cause an entirely new one. In this timeline, there is an equal chance of Republican, Communist, or even a Military Junta Authoritarian. However, the communists would still field a large popular support even if the war didn\u2019t continue to what it did. (Take everything I say with a grain of salt at this point, because right now there a lot of different variables that could change what happens.) Now for Japan, we\u2019d see an even more radical change in history. After the Russo-Japanese war, the Japanese populace was very angry with the large casualties, the economic recession that had occurred because of the war, and the lack of war reparations and territorial concession from the Russians at the end of the war. This is what is largely cited as the source for Japan\u2019s large expansion during the 1920s and 1930s in the West Pacific and East Asia. Without the war, this expansion might not have been as fast and great as it had been in history, but it definitely would have happened. Another thing that might change would be the world\u2019s opinion of Japan. Once they defeated Russia in Manchuria, Japan was largely seen as the Asian power. If not, they might have been underestimated in their expansion, but that is very hard to say for certain. So in summary, everything that happens historically still happens, just at different times and maybe in different ways. ",

            "answer_text": "For the Russo-Japanese War to not have happened, it would\u2019ve been because of either of two things: Tsar Nicholas II kept his word and withdrew all Russian troops from Manchuria by 1903. In reality, they hadn\u2019t done so, and kept troops there to maintain their sphere of influence. Obviously, Japan didn\u2019t want Russian presence in Manchuria, so close to the Japanese home islands. At the same time, Russia didn\u2019t view Japan as a formidable opponent, and so continued to extend their influence over Manchuria and Korea historically.Japan didn\u2019t see Russian presence in Manchuria as a threat, and made no attempt to counter Russian encroachment. This is the more unlikely of the two alternate scenarios, as Japan learned first-hand that might makes right after defeating the Qing Empire in 1895 in the First Sino-Japanese War. One major reason why Japan decided to make the first move against Russia in February 1904 was because of their alliance with the United Kingdom formed in 1902. This deterred other nations from interfering.In the first scenario, Japan would\u2019ve simply occupied Korea and Manchuria militarily, after pushing Russian influence back to Siberia. This would\u2019ve allowed Japan to establish her own sphere of influence without issue, and Korea would eventually have been annexed, like it was in reality in 1910. For the Russians, Nicholas might have had a slightly less bumpy reign, without an unpopular war fueling the discontent of his subjects, though it remains unlikely that he would have mattered for much longer anyway. In the second scenario, Japan would have had their influence restricted in Korea, and completely denied in Manchuria. As a result, their empire would not have been able to extend into Manchuria and Korea until the Russian Empire was toppled in 1917. The Bolshevik Revolution would\u2019ve been an opportune moment for Japan to take back what they felt should be under their control, though this would mean that Japan doesn\u2019t get to exert influence over Korea until 12 years after 1905. They might have focused on bullying the Qing instead, if confronting the Russians was not an option. ",
