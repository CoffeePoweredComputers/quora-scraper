            "answer_text": "My uncle was British, captured in Singapore and was a POW on the Burma Railway and in Fukuoka 17B coalmining camp in Japan. I can\u2019t answer this question fully. From my reading of accounts by ordinary Japanese army members, \u2018none\u2019 wanted to go to Singapore, Burma, Java or anywhere else to fight in WW2. After previous combat in other areas, they wanted to be home with their families. They thought it was madness and doomed. Even after the surrender, and having the ethos that surrender was shameful, my uncle described initial contact to be resonably civil - not as frightening and dreadful as expected. When he and his gun crew were rounded up, the Japanese were respectful, recognising though enemies, all men had \u2018just been doing as ordered, the same as those on the other side\u2019. And when Allies learned that bowing was expected and performed according to tradition, the Japanese bowed back to them (before taking any gold pens or watches). On the Railway, my uncle said that ordinary Japanese solders were brutalised almost to the same extent as Allied POWs - he was sorry for some of them he witnessed being maltreated. One Japanese guard hit a prisoner in the face and the next day apologised saying, \u201cIf I had not done that to you yesterday while my officer was watching, I would have been beheaded.\u201d \u2026So it seems to me that when the questioner says \u2018Japanese treatment of POWs\u2019, this was not a universal natural behavior of Japanese personnel, but a treatment devised and expected by those in the highest leadership positions. (Though some guards obviously did enjoy being viscious in carrying out orders, one possibly risked his own life in giving my uncle a fish he caught on a day off.) ",

            "answer_text": "The Japanese wanted to become a Western country and adopted a lot of the general values Western people had. They tried to become equals \u2026 and that backfired. After the First World War, in which Japan fought with the Allies, they were simply told they did not count in the eyes of the Western Countries. While they were given mandate areas and signed the Versailles Treaty, all Japanese attempts to get better immigration and visa conditions in Western Countries came to naugt. The American Immigration Act of 1924 was seen as a national insult in Japan. The attitude in Japan towards the West changed drastically from cordial to openly hostile. If the West considered them racially inferior, the Japanese would come up with their own racial theories in which they were the master race. By the time the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, the Japanese people were so indictrinated that they considered all non-Japaese as inferior beings at best, vermin at worst. ",
