            "answer_text": "Machu Picchu is a Quechua word that means \u201cOld Mountain\u201d or \u201cOld Peak.\u201d Broken down Machu means old or ancient and Picchu means peak. In contrast, the mountain that sits across from it called Huayna Picchu can be translated from Quechua to \u201cYoung Peak.\u201d Machu Picchu is an important archaeological site and was a very important spiritual site for the Inca Empire. It was so important that only the Inca Royalty lived at Machu Picchu while the Quechua common-folk would hike to the city to farm it. Additionally, Machu Picchu was an important spiritual site for the Inca. For example, an arrow-shaped stone at the top of Huayna Picchu points directly through the Intihautana Stone to Mount Salcantay, which was one of the most important mountains in Inca cosmology.
