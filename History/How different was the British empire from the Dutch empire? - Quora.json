            "answer_text": "Both Britain and the Netherlands were seafaring countries in north-western Europe. Both developed maritime empire the centuries following Christopher Columbus\u2019 \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the New World in 1492. Both Britain and the Netherlands established colonies in the Americas, Caribbean, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific (technically West Papua is part of the Pacific because the Papuans are Melanesians). Both the British and Dutch were motivated by overseas trade. Both countries established East India companies to export spices, cotton, silk, indigo, tea, and other commodities from Asia back to Europe. The English and Dutch East India companies eventually came to dominate trade in India and modern Indonesia. This became the basis of the British Raj and the Netherlands East Indies respectively. The real point of divergence comes during the early 19th century. Britain emerged as one of the leading European powers following the defeat of Napoleon. The Dutch didn't fare as well and remained a middling power in Europe. By 1914, the British had established the largest overseas empire in the world. They also established settler colonies which became the modern United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. The Dutch lost their colonies in North America and South Africa to the British. The Afrikaners are the descendants of Dutch colonists in South Africa. At one point, New York was even in a Dutch colony. The British also acquired Malacca from the Dutch and eventually Malaya became a British colony. By 1914, the Dutch empire was considerably smaller than the British. Their crown colony was Indonesia but they also had smaller colonies in the Dutch Antilles and Suriname. Since the Dutch were not a world power like the British and French, they had much more difficulty in recovering Indonesia after WW2. The Japanese invasion had undermined Dutch rule and invigorated Indonesian nationalism, led by Sukarno and Muhammad Hatta. Indonesia (particularly Java and Sumatra) achieved independence through a revolutionary struggle compounded by negotiations. The Americans and Australians exerted considerable international pressure on the Dutch through the UN to relinquish the East Indies in 1949.[1] The Dutch held on to West Papua after 1949, which led to a territorial dispute with Indonesia. The Dutch promoted West Papuan nationalism but Indonesia embarked on a policy of Confrontation against the Dutch. In 1962, the US brokered a peace agreement known as the New York Agreement which seceded West Papua to the UN. In 1969, Indonesia legally incorporated West Papua following a rigged referendum known as the Act of Free Choice.[2] By contrast, the British Empire was much bigger. There were several anti-colonial insurgencies in Malaya, Kenya, and Aden after World War II. There were also the Troubles in Northern Ireland as well to complicate things. Following World War 2, Britain embarked on a policy of decolonizing their overseas colonial holdings. Their tactic was to encourage the emergence of pro-Western elites in their former colonies who would maintain ties to the Commonwealth. The Asian colonies went first and most of the African colonies by the 1960s. Britain withdrew from the Pacific by the 1970s. They formally ceded Hong Kong back to China in 1997. Britain still has several overseas territories in the Caribbean, South Atlantic, and the Indian Ocean. They most notably fought a war to recover the Falklands from Argentina. The Falkland Islanders have voted overwhelmingly to remain British. Unlike the Dutch, British colonial influence has left a more visible legacy. Many former British colonies use English as a Lingua Franca. The emergence of the US as a superpower has also made English an international language. Many former British colonies use Common Law and drive on the left hand side of the road. The Commonwealth also helps maintain friendly cultural and sporting relations between former British colonies. Queen Elizabeth II serves as the head of state of the UK and 16 other Commonwealth realms including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Belize, Antigua and Barbados.[3] Though the Dutch decolonized Suriname in 1975, they still administer island territories in the Caribbean. Curacao, Aruba, and Sint Maarten are constituent parts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.[4] The Netherlands is much more integrated into the European Union then Britain due to geography. There were attempts to build a Dutch-Indonesian Commonwealth but that foundered in 1956 due to the West New Guinea dispute. The loss of West New Guinea and the unwillingness of the Anglophone allies to side with the Dutch led them to embrace integration into Europe. The Dutch are much less Eurosceptic than the British as shown by the recent 2017 elections. There are Indo Eurasians and Ambonese from Indonesia living in the Netherlands. Few Indonesian Muslims have migrated to the Netherlands in large numbers. Most of the Muslim population in the Netherlands comes from Morocco and Turkey. In short, the British Empire was a global maritime empire. It may have ceased to exist but its cultural, political, and economic legacy still remain. The Dutch were a middling European power with smaller colonial holdings. Their influence is not as strong partly because Dutch is not the international Lingua Franca.

            "answer_text": "Let\u2019s look at one scenario, how the Dutch East Indies - the home of my first father-in-law - became Indonesia: The Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, andthe Indonesian National Revolution.My in-laws\u2019 family were interned during WW2, by the Japanese. If you\u2019ve watched Tenko (TV series), then you will have an idea of just how unpleasant this was; the good news is that all the family survived, if a lot thinner and with various, tropical diseases (one of which became fatal at war\u2019s end). You might imagine, therefore, that with peace came liberation and good health. This was not the case: Indonesians were so aggressive towards the Dutch colonials that the Japanese army had to continue the camps to protect the Dutch. Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies Liberation of the internment camps holding western prisoners was not swift. Conditions were better during post-war internment than under previous internment, for, this time, Red Cross supplies were made available and the Allies made the Japanese order the most heinous and cruel occupiers home. After four months of post-war internment, Western internees were released on the condition they left Indonesia. Then it got serious. Pro-revolution demonstrations took place in large cities, including one led by Tan Malaka in Jakarta with over 200,000 people, which Sukarno and Hatta, fearing violence, successfully quelled. By September 1945, many of the self-proclaimed pemuda, who were ready to die for '100% freedom', were getting impatient. It was common for ethnic 'out-groups' \u2013 Dutch internees, Eurasian, Ambonese and Chinese \u2013 and anyone considered to be a spy, to be subjected to intimidation, kidnap, robbery, murder and organised massacres. Such attacks would continue throughout the course of the revolution, but were most present during the 1945-46 period, which is known as the Bersiap.[18] After the Bersiap in 1947 Dutch authorities attempted to retrieve the bodies of the victims and several survivors of the period provided legal testimony to the Attorney General office. Due to continued revolutionary warfare few bodies were found and few cases came to court. Around 3,500 graves of Bersiap victims can be found in the Kembang Kuning war cemetery in Surabaya and elsewhere. The Simpang Society Club Surabaya was appropriated by the Pemudas of the Partai Rakyat Indonesia (P.R.I.) and made into the headquarters of P.R.I. commander Sutomo, who personally supervised the summary executions of hundreds of civilians. An archived eyewitness testimony of the events of 22 October 1945 states: \"Before each execution Sutomo mockingly asked the crowd what should be done with this \"Musuh (enemy) of the people\". The crowd yelled \"Bunuh!\" (kill!) after which the executioner named Rustam decapitated the victim with one stroke of his sword. The victim was then left to the bloodthirst of boys 10, 11 and 12 years old. ...[who] further mutilated the body.\" \"Women were tied to the tree in the back yard and pierced through the genitals with \"bambu runcing\" (bamboo spears) until they died.\" On Sutomo's orders the decapitated bodies were disposed of in the sea, the women were thrown in the river.[19] One has to wonder: what was it about the Dutch that engendered such hatred? I think we can see them in full bloom in South Africa: Afrikaners Afrikaners are a Southern African ethnic group descended from predominantly Dutch settlers first arriving in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.[9] They traditionally dominated South Africa's agriculture and politics prior to 1994.[10] Apartheid era In South Africa, an Afrikaner minority party, the National Party, came to power in 1948 and enacted a series of segregationist laws favouring whites known as apartheid. These laws allowed for the systematic persecution of opposition leaders and attempted to enforce general white supremacy by classifying all South African inhabitants into racial groups. This all came to an end in the 1990s and the release of Nelson Mandela. So we are not looking at ancient history, but modern culture. The British and Dutch have different cultures and this was reflected in their colonies. ",

Both of them were ruthless and merciless and effectively built their empires from slave labour. Where they diverge is the British were better at it\u2026.and more conspicuous and extravagant in enjoying their ill gotten gains. The Dutch, however, were rather quiet about it and travelled the untrodden path; going to new, out of the way places and enslaving people to exploit their natural resources (spices and minerals). The Dutch tended to keep where their wealth came from as secret as possible and avoided confrontation with all the other imperial players. ",
