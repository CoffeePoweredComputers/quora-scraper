            "answer_text": "First of all, it is very widespread in some countries, such as Greece, Russia, and Ukraine. But the best answer is that it is an accident of history. Orthodox Christianity was the Eastern half of the historic Catholic Church. That church is sometimes called the undivided Church, but actually a few groups still surviving had split off much earlier; Coptic Christians are one such group. Anyway, there were ongoing stresses in the relationship between the Eastern and Western halves of Christianity. The East spoke Greek, the West spoke Latin, which made communication difficult. The bishop of Rome was considered to have a kind of primacy of honor, partly because Rome was the capital of the empire and partly because St. Peter had been bishop there and Peter and Paul died there. When the center of the empire moved to Constantinople, that became another center of authority in the Church, and there were tensions between them. Rome more and more exerted authority, which Constinople more and more resisted. There was a dispute over a phrase Rome had inserted into the Nicene creed, one which made theological sense in Latin, but not in Greek. 1054 when there were mutual excommunications over this issue is usually the date given for the split, but actually it occurred more gradually over several centuries. Meanwhile Islam arose and spread itself by conquest over much of the territory of the Eastern Church. It became a minority religion in its home territory. In 1453 Constantinople fell to the Moslems, and the great cathedral of Eastern Christianity, became a Mosque. While Western Christianity became the civilizing force in a previously pagan and tribal Europe, and then spread with the spread of Europeans all over the globe (whatever you think of that), Eastern Orthodoxy was mostly just managing to keep the faith alive under Muslim rule. It did, however, evangelize Eastern Europe and Russia. Much later people from Orthodox countries came to the US and established churches along ethnic lines. Recently these churches have been celebrating their beautiful liturgies in English and have won a significant number of converts, especially people from evangelical Protestant communities looking for a more liturgical Christianity more like that of the ancient Church. There are some very vibrant Orthodox parishes which have grown to the point where they had to found a new parish. Their numbers are smaller here because far greater numbers of people came to the US from historically Catholic and Protestant countries than from Orthodox ones. The historical reason why they are smaller worldwide, is, in one word, Islam. That continues to this day, as in recent conflicts in the near east, Orthodox Christians have been driven out of church communities which have literally been there since the time of the apostles. ",

            "answer_text": "It was an accident of history. in the Roman Empire there were five patriarchates, which were the centers of Christianity: Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria. All of these patriarchates engaged in missionary activities in the first few centuries after Christ, and in 500 AD all were vibrant. But then Islam arose and eventually conquered all of the patriarchal sees except Rome. Since Rome had more freedom to evangelize, they were the patriarchate that grew the most, although Constantinople did a decent job of evangelizing Eastern Europe. In time followers of the Roman patriarchates came to be known as \u201cCatholics\u201d and the rest as \u201corthodox.\u201d Since only the Catholics and the Orthodox associated with Constantinople had the freedom to evangelize, they engaged in a struggle for Europe and came close to dividing it evenly. And thus it stayed until the age of European expansion and colonialism. By the time Columbus set sail the west had become split between Protestants and Catholics, and the church pretty much followed the ship\u2019s flag. Latin America became mostly Catholic, North America and Australia mostly Protestant, with Africa a patchwork of religions (Islam in the north, Orthodox in Ethiopia and minority Orthodox communities in the rest of Islamic Africa, and colonialist religions from both Protestants and Catholics in the south). And finally when Orthodoxy was spreading into Asia through the Russians, communists took over and put a stop to missionary activity. As a result of these accidents of history, Catholics and (especially) Protestants have kept up a mindset of evangelism and expansion, while the Orthodox have been forced to look inward. As a result, the Orthodox churches in the west today tend to be divided by ethnicity instead of reaching out to the wider community, while Catholic and Protestant churches bring in people of all ancestries. These are just trends and there are exceptions, but by and large the Orthodox have been forced to look after their own community while Catholics and Protestants have been encouraged to evangelize. Evangelism not only made colonialism popular in the metropolis, it also often made for compliant colonial subjects. At least at first\u2026. ",
