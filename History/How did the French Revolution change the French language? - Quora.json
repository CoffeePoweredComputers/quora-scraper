            "answer_text": "On the eve of the Revolution, France was still the most populous country in Europe (26 million inhabitants) and one of the richest. But revolt was brewing. Peasants made up 80% of the population and paid the lion's share of royal taxes\u2014plus tithes to the Church and seigniorial dues\u2014while earning the lowest income. The middle class held almost all economic power, but was excluded from political power. Meanwhile, the nobility lived in idleness, and the Church owned 10% of the most profitable lands in the country. It is hardly surprising then that popular revolts erupted, particularly seeing how long the middle classes had been preparing them. The people were the ones who seized the Bastille on July 14, 1789, executed Louis XVI, and for all intents and purposes made the Revolution, but it was the middle classes who seized power and imposed their form of language. The revolutionary period stirred national sentiment, including with regard to language. For the first time, language was associated with nation. Language was a matter of state, for the state had to equip the \"united and indivisible Republic\" with a national language and raise the people up through education and knowledge of French. The very idea of a \"united and indivisible Republic\" whose motto was \"Fraternit\u00e9, Libert\u00e9, Egalit\u00e9\" (Fraternity, Freedom, Equality) was irreconcilable with linguistic fragmentation and differences between the former provinces of the monarchy. The revolutionary middle classes saw such fragmentation as an obstacle to the spread of their ideas, and declared war on the dialects. Bertrand Bar\u00e8re (1755\u20131841), a member of the Committee of Public Safety, led the fight for a national language. In a report \"on the idioms\" (regional dialects) he presented before the Convention on January 27, 1794, Bar\u00e8re stated his position thus: The monarchy had reasons for clinging to the Tower of Babel. In a democracy, keeping citizens ignorant of the national language, unable to control power, is a betrayal of the motherland\u2026 In a free country, the language must be the same for one and all. [\u2026] What money we spent translating the laws of the first two national assemblies into France's various idioms! As though it were up to us to maintain these barbaric dialects and coarse idioms, which now serve only fanatics and counter-revolutionaries! He was by no means alone in his thinking. One of the most famous members of the ruling class\u2014Abbot Henri-Baptiste Gr\u00e9goire (1750\u20131831)\u2014published his famous Rapport sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 et les moyens d'an\u00e9antir les patois et d'universaliser l'usage de la langue fran\u00e7aise in 1794. He denounced the linguistic situation in the French republic, which, \"with thirty different dialects,\" was still \"a Tower of Babel\" whereas \"for liberty\" it was \"a leader among nations.\" At the Convention, he stated, \"We no longer have provinces but rather thirty dialects that remind us of their names.\" With a certain dread, Abbot Gr\u00e9goire revealed in his report that French was spoken \"exclusively\" in \"about 15 departments\" (out of 83). It seemed a paradox to him\u2014and intolerable, to say the least\u2014that fewer than 3 million out of 25 million French people spoke the national language, while this language was used and unified \"even in Canada and along the Mississippi.\" On September 20, 1793, Abbot Gr\u00e9goire stated the following to the Public Education Committee: The local dialects, the patois of six million French people who do not speak the national language, will gradually disappear, because\u2014and I can't say it often enough\u2014it is more important politically to eradicate this diversity of coarse idioms, which prolong the infancy of reason and the age of prejudice. The term language began to be used exclusively in reference to French, \"our language.\" Everything that was not French was called a patois or feudal idiom, which for Gr\u00e9goire was Breton, Norman, Picard, Proven\u00e7al, Gascon, Basque, etc. He even spoke of \"Corsican Italian\" (Corsican) and German of the Upper and Lower Rhine (Alsatian), which he qualified as \"much degenerated idioms.\" He further stated that \"the Negroes in our colonies\" spoke \"a poor type of idiom\" akin to \"the Frankish tongue.\" No modern linguist could get away with statements like that today! Linguistic Terror Consequently, a need was felt to impose French via stringent decrees throughout France, something the English language never experienced. Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand (1754\u20131838), one of the great French politicians of the time, proposed that there be an elementary school for teaching French in each municipality: The language of the Constitution and laws will be taught to everyone, and this host of tainted dialects\u2014the last remains of the feudality\u2014will be forced to disappear. Circumstances dictate it. Then, the decree of 2 Thermidor (July 20, 1794) sanctioned linguistic terror. From this point on, local dialects were literally hunted down. This linguistic law, though it was repealed almost immediately because of Robespierre's execution (July 28, 1794), gives us a good idea of the revolutionary leaders' intentions: Section 1 From the day this law is published, no public document may be written in any language other than French in any part of the Republic. Section 2 One month following the publication of this law, no document may be registered if it is not written in French, even under private signet. Section 3 Any civil servant, public official, or government agent who, following the publication of this law, records, writes, or draws up minutes, judgments, contracts, or any other documents in idioms or languages other than French shall be brought before the correctional police court in his place of residence, condemned to six months of imprisonment, and dismissed. Section 4 The same sentence shall be imposed on all registration fee collectors who, from the month after publication of this law, register documents in idioms and languages other than French, even under private signet. But \"linguistic terror\" did not succeed in destroying the \"dialectal Tower of Babel.\" Not only did the population resist, but the secularization of ecclesiastical institutions led to the disappearance of most schools, which the state did not have the means to replace. Small village schools found it impossible to teach French given the lack of funds and teachers. Even in Paris, public schools were not up to the task, or scarcely so, given the lack of teachers (on account of low salaries, appalling recruitment practices, lack of training, etc.). In schools that did manage to operate, local officials preferred translating French into patois or dialects. A sense of realism and a desire for efficiency led to the continuation of this system of translation throughout the Revolution, even under the Terror. In short, contrary to most perceptions, the language policy of the Revolution was neither consistent nor uniform, and was not always repressive of regional languages.

            "answer_text": "The French Revolution is responsible for France being more or less mono-linguist. Up till La R\u00e9volution Fran\u00e7aise, during what has been termed l\u2019Ancien R\u00e9gime, France was a Tower of Babel composed by roughly two distinct cultures united under one crown, Langue d\u2019Oc in the south grounded in its Roman past (originally being populated by retired Roman legionnaires) and Langue d\u2019O\u00efl in the north with strong clan influences from Germanic and Frankish cultures. The culture of Langue d\u2019Oc basically made up for Occitanie where \u2018oc\u2019 was the word for yes. Proven\u00e7al, Languedoc and Gascon were the three major languages but there would be others like B\u00e9arnais, Limousin, Auvergnat not to forget Basque which has no romance roots. Langue d\u2019O\u00efl, where \u2018o\u00efl\u2019 and later \u2018oui\u2019 was the word for yes, constituted an even more composite landscape with languages like Berrichon, Gallo, Angevin, Orl\u00e9anais, Francillien, Couchoi, Normand, Picard, Chtimi, Tourangeau, Poitevin, Champenois, Bourguignon and Lorrain. Breton spoken in Bretagne (Brittany) is like Basque an exception being a celtic language. During l\u2019Ancien R\u00e9gime each region was governed in its proper language making it rather difficult for people to migrate to other parts of France let alone hard for the King to hold a proper grip on the territory. Once the D\u00e9claration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen (The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen) was passed by the National Constituent Assembly in August 1789, the principle of the single language in the new centralized R\u00e9publique gained foothold. By setting all French citizens alike this would promote and ensure that \u2018\u00e9galit\u00e9\u2019 was independent of your linguistic origin and thus facilitate both \u2018libert\u00e9\u2019 and \u2018fraternit\u00e9\u2019 as vehicles for the rights applicable for the French realm. As the members of the victorious revolutionary party, Les Jacobins, were mostly from the urbanized North, the language chosen came to be the Parisian dialect of Langue d\u2019O\u00efl, Francillien, which since then has evolved into what we now define as contemporary French. Some revolutionaries opposed the idea of the strong central state brought forward by Les Jacobins. These so-called Les Girondins opted for decentralization but not only did they lose their heads in the events, they also lost the battle of languages which is why the cultures of Langue d\u2019Oc - and Brittany - since La R\u00e9volution Fran\u00e7aise have been reduced to a secondary, provincial state of French civilization. Still, this is here one can find the true Belle France of today, and contrary to their forefathers all of the people now speak French. ",
