            "answer_text": "Without question. Those who use historical comparisons to figures such as Attila, Caligula, Nero, Hitler, Stalin, and Mao are forgetting an essential piece of context: they had institutions and structures that allowed them to exercise their worst instincts. Trump has to battle against a centuries old tripartite system of ostensible democracy with co-equal branches of power, each meant to work as a check on the other two. Without these three branches of American governement and their long history to entrench them deeply in the American psyche, Trump would have already destroyed the vesitges of whatever democratic institutions remained and formed a complete totalitarian dictatorship. And he would indulge the most abject evil to satisfy his essential sadism. Even now he openly and repeatedly calls for the jailing of political opponents, and he has contintually dog whistled suggestions for the death of others. Ample evidence exists in the plethora of book-length criticisms written by both conservatives, liberals, and even his own family members that reveal he has no moral principles whatsoever: in comparison, even so odious a figure as Hitler had principles (they were disgusting and evil, but he had an overall moral philosophy). Trump has none. He is completely void of empathy and morality. He is inarguably a sociopath of the worst order, with a toxic narcissism that allows him only one worldview: his own. He is swallowed entire by his own solipsism, and seeks to subsume every circumstance to serve his own twisted ego. He is an infantile megalomaniac, utterly ignorant, profoundly cruel, and wants entirely for any redeemable characteristic. His former Chief of Staff has called him the \u2018most flawed person I have ever met.\u2019 The writer of A Warning wrote on pages 148\u2013149 the following: \u2018We learned that, given enough time and space, Donald J. Trump will seek to abuse any power he is given. No external force can amerliorate his attraction to wrongdoing.\u2019 His own niece, a clinical psychologist, considers him the most dangerous man in existence. John Bolton, his former national security advisor, calls him naive and dangerous, and that he will not leave the office of the presidency peacefully. He is credibly accused to be a rapist, may have indulged pedophilia during his frequent stints with Jeffrey Epstein (Trump is quoted as saying that Epstein was fun to spend time with, and \u2018loved his women on the younger side, if you know what I mean\u2019) is undoubtedly a racist, and has continually cozied up to murderous dictators. He spews vile conspiracy theories because he believes they serve him politically. He has made many disconcerting sexual comments in relation to his daughter Ivanka, has viciously abused and cheated contractors and employees working beneath him, and has abused the legal and tax system in every way available to him to further his own selfish ends. He is possessed of an entirely vindictive, animalistic, carnivorous hate towards anyone he feels has slighted him, regardless of their authority or station. He is capable of the most base evil a human being can indulge. ",

            "answer_text": "I don't think he is a worst person. He is one of the worst leaders to have come to the world\u2019s stage. He is overly hyped. The conservatives are hell bent on making him the next messiah because they know this is their last chance to survive. Before the election, many republicans denounced Trump and his primary speeches. Democrats didn't take his message of hatred and divisiveness that effectively to the voters. People keep calling names and call him a narcissist, bigot, mysogynist and his supporters keep coming and negating those claims. It is these people who don't understand the damage that this man can do in the next 4 years. He is doing exactly what he told everybody during the primaries, so in a way he is doing his job right and should be praised for it. But, it is saying like Hitler has done a great job of attacking all the nations in Europe to help expand their empire, before getting decimated by the allies. The only thing that is not going to change is this world. And whether you like it or not, you will have to live through these tough times for the next 4 years. But, people should see through his work. Everybody knows the difference between right and wrong and all we can do it accept that some of us had made a mistake by voting for him. Thinking that he is going to change things, instead America looks even more divided. A great leader unites people. A great leader don't shy away from tough questions and crticism. Lincoln, Reagan, Kennedy and Obama are prime examples of it. These leaders got so much messed up America and they fixed it, they didn't complain. They didn't divide the country even more. They did their job. That is more important than attacking the media who is showing Trump\u2019s news every second. His administration has no plans. Every where in the world is you want to unite your country, you have to talk about all and not just one community. Not just about conservatives. Democrats were also guilty of this attitude. That is why people had to find other resorts. All of this can be changed if people who voted for him and those who didn't will challenge him enough. The media is right. Trump is wrong. ",
