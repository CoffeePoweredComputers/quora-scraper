[A] Background Fatah focused on Jordan when it became cleared, by 1968, that it would not be able to develop a full indigenous guerrilla base on the occupied West bank. This was the result of 1967 war against Israel which Jordan lost, and had to expel her forces from West bank which formerly existed within her territories. Faydeen were the Palestinian fighters who would later have strong hold in Jordan and use Jordanian soil to launch their strikes on Israel. Faydeen presence in Jordan was due to immense-combined pressure on Jordanian King Hussien by Egypt, Iraq, and Syria. King had to establish a semi-independant Palestinian territory in the city of Karameh. Israel, after being numerously hit by Faydeen and Palestinian refugees, decided to launch an offensive on Faydeen presence in Karamah. \u201cThe battle of Karamah\u201d \u2014 Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that the purpose was to destroy PLO militant camps at Karameh and capture Yassir Arafat as reprisal, however, it is also believed that it wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support to Palestinian fighters. Israel assumed the Jordanian Army would choose to not get involved in the battle, but the latter deployed heavy artillery fire. Both sides declared victory in the 15 hour long battle. Tactically, the battle went on Israel\u2019s favor. However it also resulted in the issuance of United Nations Security Council Resolution 248, in which total of 15 members voted in favor of Jordan including Pakistan.  Battle of Karameh - WikipediaUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 248 - WikipediaAfter the battle, Palestinian used this as a leverage and widely gained support of Arab and Muslim countries. The support also came in terms of Weapons. https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=GkbzYoZtaJMC&pg=PA481&dq=black+september+jordan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjGxP2TsIzZAhWPKFAKHSEpAs4Q6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&q=black%20september%20jordan&f=false [B] Growth of Terrorists in Jordan The battle was considered as a Psychological victory by Palestinians over IDF, this later served in growth of Palestinian Guerrilla fighters. Fatah reported that 5,000 volunteers had applied to join within 48 hours of the events at Karameh. By late March, there were nearly 20,000 fedayeen in Jordan. Iraq and Syria offered training programs for several thousand guerrillas. The Persian Gulf states, led by Kuwait, raised money for them through a 5% tax on the salaries of their tens of thousands of resident Palestinian workers, and a fund drive in Lebanon raised $500,000 from Beirut alone. The Palestinian organizations also began to guarantee a lifetime support for the families of all guerrillas killed in action. Within a year after the battle, Fatah had branches in about eighty countries. After the Battle, Fatah also gained control of the PLO in Egypt. NOTE: There are no sources that suggest Pakistan provided arms to Faydeen.During all this, Jordanian Police either stayed silence or became useless; started to feel herself losing control.  [C] Rising Tensions for the King The Wehdat and Al-Hussein refugee camps came to be referred as \"independent republics\" and the fedayeen established administrative autonomy by establishing local government under the control of uniformed PLO militants\u2014setting up checkpoints and attempting to extort \"taxes\" from civilians. By now Jordan started to notice government is losing her control over these territories. In early November 1968, the Jordanian army attacked a fedayeen group named \"Al-Nasr\" (meaning victory) after the group had attacked Jordanian police, this was also meant to send a clear message Jordan is still in power. Immediately after the incident, a seven-point agreement was reached between King Hussein and Palestinian organizations, that restrained unlawful and illegal fedayeen behavior against the Jordanian government. This was no becoming a state within a state which would later challenge the King. In response, King Hussien approached United State at the time under the leadership of President Nixon. NOTE: Pakistan was also an Ally of USAHe argued for Israel's adherence to United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, in which it was required to return territories it had occupied in 1967 in return for peace. Palestinian factions were suspicious of Hussein, as this meant the withdrawal of his policy of forceful resistance towards Israel, and these suspicions were further heightened by Washington's claim that Hussein would be able to liquidate the fedayeen movement in his country upon resolution of the conflict. By 1970, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) led by George Habash and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) led by Nayef Hawatmeh, began to openly question the legitimacy of the Hashemite monarchy, and called for its overthrow and replacement with a revolutionary regime. Other radical left-wing groups included the Syrian Ba'ath's As-Sa'iqa, and the Iraqi Ba'ath's Arab Liberation Front: these saw Hussein as \"a puppet of Western imperialism\", \" a reactionary\", and \"a Zionist tool\". \u2014(Via Wikipedia)  [D] WAR 1 - September for the second time in three months, triggering clashes between the army and the fedayeen in Amman up until 6 September. 2 - On 6th September 3 planes were hijacked by PFLP. 3 - On 9th September another passenger plane was hijacked by PFLP.  The PFLP announced that the hijackings were intended \"to bring special attention to the Palestinian problem\"  On 15th of September, in an emergency meeting with his advisors decided to attack the refugee camps. By the night of 15th September the attacks by Jordanian Army had begun. On 17 September, the 60th Armoured Brigade entered the capital Amman from different directions and shelled the Wehdat and Hussein refugee camps where the fedayeen were based with tanks, artillery and mortars. Jordan had two intervention during this offensive; one from Syrian side and one from Egypt side.  [E] Role of Pakistan Pakistan had no direct role in this war. Serving Brigadier of Pakistan Army was sent who was there only to provide training. Pakistani officer was not there to indulge in Operational duties. He aided the Jordanian military in operational strategy and allocation of firepower to achieve results the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan had laid out as a state.  While the Pakistani officer is said to have commanded 2nd Division of Jordan Army, which in turn proved crucial for King Hussein remaining in power. This came under the direct orders of King Hussein and the command was temporary. The duties that are carried out in foreign soil are commanded and directed by the host Nation, they do not operate under the Pakistan Army chain of command. That being said, there is no hard evidence which suggest Pakistan intervened. Two points were Noted which proves the criteria why Jordan accepted to call a Pakistani officer: (a) Pakistan was (and still is) an Ally to the United States. (b) Pakistan did not fund these extremists.

            "answer_text": "If you mean by the civil war in Jordan in 1970 then I will explain. The Black September in 1970 was a war fought between the Jordanian Armed Forces and the PLO, otherwise known as the \u201cFedayeen\u201d with the support of Syria, it ended in 1971 with a Jordanian victory. Introduction: 1968 Battle of Karameh A year after the 1967 Six-Day war, Jordan lost its control over the West Bank and the PLO was forced to relocate its headquarters to a village called \u201cKarameh\u201d (Dignity or Honor in Arabic). The PLO started to launch attacks on the Israeli-controlled West Bank, one of the most notable ones is placing a landmine that struck a school bus, killing 3 teachers and injuring several students. Israel, in retaliation, decided to invade Karameh in order to destroy the Headquarters of the PLO. The Israelis had two objectives, to destroy the PLO HQ and capture Yasser Arafat, when they entered Karameh, the Jordanians assumed that they will invade the Balka Governate given to the size of the force, so they prepared heavy defenses. The Israelis did not expect the Jordanian soldiers to fight alongside the fedayeen, so it broke out into a day long battle. At the end of the battle, the Israelis were forced to withdraw back to Israel, but even then they had difficulty in withdrawing. In this Battle, both sides rightfully claim victory, the Israelis fulfilled their objective of destroying the PLO HQ and inflicted a lot of casualties on the PLO (dead/wounded/captured), however their failure to capture Yasser Arafat and the relatively high amount of casualties they sustained, they were forced to withdraw, leaving behind equipment as well. For the Jordanians, their main objective was to defend the Balka governate from Israel(due to their assumption), the Jordanians were successfull at inflicting relatively high Israeli casualties and forced them to withdraw, and they were able to evacuate Yasser Arafat, however the Jordanians suffered more casualties than the Israelis. The PLO were able to take credit for the battle and saw an upsurge of support from many Arab countries, however things started to be bad now\u2026 Worsening Situation: The PLO\u2019s strength in Jordan started to grow and soon the PLO started to openly call for the downfall of the Hashemite monarchy, claiming it was a \u201cstate within a state\u201d, then the PLO started disobeying the law and do many bad things in general, they even attempted to assassinate King Hussein twice, which soon led to violent confrontations between them and the Jordanian Army. King Hussein at that time was in a very dangerous dilemma, King Hussein knew that he had to stop the PLO at one point but if he does, the PLO will use this as propaganda to prove that he is a \u201czionest tool massacring Palestinians\u201d, and he would isolate himself from the Arab world. On the other hand, if he doesn't react then he would lose the respect of the Jordanians and worst of all, the respect of the army, which is the back bone of the regime. King Hussein tried to reach peaceful resolutions but the peace-treaties didn't last long, and there was continuous violence which added more to the tensions. So it begins: The Black September The situation reached the boiling point, and in September 1970, the PLO hijacked three foreign planes and made them land in Zarqa, the PLO threatened that they would kill the hostages if demands are not met. All the planes that were hijacked were bombed, and at this point, King Hussein had enough, he ordered his army to make a massive crackdown on the PLO. Syria, under Salah Jadid back then, sent a Brigade to help the Palestinians in overthrowing Hussein, they captured Irbid but eventually were withdrawn after a successful Jordanian counter attack. Salah sent more Syrian troops to help the PLO but eventually Israeli Jets flew over them to scare them, but didn't engage them. All this led to Salah being overthrown in a bloodless Coup and taken over by Air force commander Hafez-Al Assad. The fighting continued till 1971 were the PLO were allowed to leave to Lebanon via Syria, some chose to surrender to the IDF however. ",
