            "answer_text": "I take it by the question, you are meaning professional sports teams. In which case, it's quite simple, they are companies and therefore have assets and value that can be sold or transferred like any other company. Few teams operating at the very top ranks of major professional spectator sports remain mutual membership clubs.  (Wikipedia has a List of professional sports team owners )  The only place I can think of that you'd find an example of membership clubs operating top flight professional teams is in rugby union where some professional sides are owned by the amateur club they stemmed from (rugby union only went professional in the mid 90s so remains slightly anachronistic). Most other top flight clubs either started out as private companies or at some point in their past transferred from being membership clubs to owned companies.  It could be that their members decided to swap membership rights for ownership rights (likely at a point where members were no longer likely to be players and/or when significant investment was required) so that the amateur club was entirely replaced by a company.  Or it could be (like in the rugby union example), that the first team within a membership club had become a professional side and at some point the membership club decided to create a company specifically for that first team to allow them to attract investors or sell it with the membership club remaining a distinct entity (and still possibly an owner or, more likely, co-owner of the professional side) The slight difference between most companies and professional sports teams as companies is that many professional sports teams aren't really sustainable and need owners or investors who are prepared to lose money.  Different owners will have different reasons why they are prepared to do so.  It can be passion (the sport or team they've always followed), vanity (what do you buy  the millionaire/billionaire who has everything?) or challenge (building up a small/faded club).  Although many buy teams they cannot afford truly afford to keep operating.  And the old adage \"how to make a small fortune, start off with a large one\" definitely rings true for sport. Examples of how wrong it can go are many.  Look into the history and current circumstances of London Scottish, London Welsh and London Irish (all rugby union) who have had their ups, downs, back-ups and back-downs over the course of rugby's professional era with various owners.   Rangers FC (soccer) is another astonishing example with so many basket cases of debt, financing and ill-advised owners going from being one of the two powerhouses of Scottish football with silverware and European football all but guaranteed each season, to bankrupt and in the lowest division.  London Scottish also provides a good example of how a club can recover sustainably from it (and they are now solidly in the second tier for the fifth season (4th as fully professional) having been demoted 10 leagues in 1999/2000).  Portsmouth FC (soccer) were bought back by their supporters a couple of seasons ago to become the largest supporter owned club after their previous owner had put them into bankruptcy proceedings. ",
