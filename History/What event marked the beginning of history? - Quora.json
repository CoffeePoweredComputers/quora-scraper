            "answer_text": "What are the earliest events that have occurred in human history? Once again, the answer depends on how one interprets the words in the question. I draw attention to this, again, because it is important for the questioner and the content of the answer; it is the way that deliberate misunderstanding and confusion is sown in society. In responding to the question, one may consider, from the intent of the question, that \u201chistory\u201d may mean for all of the history, however deduced, from the beginning of the H. sap species some third of a million years ago (some may take it even further, a few million years, to the start of the hominid line), history as deduced from anthropology and archeology (say a hundred thousand years or so), history from the first deciphered writing (some six thousand years ago), or the most recent history that dates to the invention of mass distributable writing (Gutenberg, some 600 years ago). The interpretation also requires a definition of \u201crecorded\u201d, because something may be recorded in the manner of dinosaur footprint of two hundred million years ago, or a petroglyph dating only a thousand years ago; or recorded, as in a manuscript or in print; or perhaps a record of a record, as in Homer. Since I can only deduce your intention, I shall consider all of human \u201chistory\u201d, briefly. And since one cannot find a confirmable record of our first quarter of a million years or so, that part of history may be regarded as my fanciful interpretation of some facts. In this case, the record is simply that we know it had occurred, because we still have either it, or its imprint or consequence, and so know that it must have been an event at some time in history, though we do not know when, nor how it came about, or precisely where and by whom. Consider, then, what the first H. sap would have been like, how he/she may have peen positioned with respect to the environment. We do know that some animals, especially monkeys and apes (from which the hominids diverged some 6 million years ago) use tools, although in a very limited way and sense. Animals also seek shelter, and some use natural shelter whether under a log or in a cave. We also know that hominids preceding H. sap, as well as our cousins Denisovans and Neanderthals, were not simply adopters of an existing tool (e.g. branch, stone, bone, etc.), but tool makers, art makers and probably fire users. Preventive medicinal usage is also an animal capability, so we cannot claim that credit as well. We also know that animals communicate, though lacking speech, the extent of their communication is limited. Animals also build shelters, and some form monogamous pairs (well, probably to an extent not much different than that of H. sap). So far, then, our species cannot claim to much invention, though it can claim to the development of that invention, on a rather fantastic, exponential scale \u2013 well, at least on the technological scale; we seem to be stuck in the ape period on the social scale. Our first claim then, is perhaps to our species ability to do \u201cmore\u201d with all the basic abilities bequeathed to us by our distant ancestors, whether in the matter of communication, or the use of tools and natural resources in every aspect (except their maintenance, it seems). Unlike animals, and presumably (but we do not know that, of course) to a greater extent than our cousins, we can think through issues to their basis (science, etc.; though that ability seems very much individual rather than universal). We may speculate, though we do not know for certain, that our first \u201cevents\u201d may have been the creation of efficient tools for some necessary tasks, such as clay containers for water; fiber nets or mesh for fishing and clothing; the capture of fire into a portable vessel, presumably made of clay; fire sharpened spears and obsidian glass or sharpened rock knives for butchery and defense. All of these would have been extremely useful, probably essential, to early people crossing Africa, as we now know they did, and even more so when they first left Africa, a hundred thousand or so years ago. And during those wanderings, having encountered different but attractive objects, the people would have conceived the idea of barter trade. As during the previous millennia, only minimal, slow improvements in these implements would have taken place subsequently, until some time around ten to fifteen thousand years ago, when a lot of \u201cevents\u201d seem to have occurred within a rather short space of time (relative to the preceding eons). These events consisted of the idea of sowing and reaping grain rather than finding ripe patches, and so the beginning of agriculture, and settlement. Once settled, but subject to raids, as well as needing supplies close by, people domesticated animals, wolves domesticated people (and the wolves that did so became dogs), fear and dominance games built walls, so we enclosed ourselves in cities. The need of the settlers to anticipate the change of seasons, so as to find propitious times for planting and herding, and the need of all, but especially the rulers, to count inventory, both possessions and debts, led to script for names and numbers, then to arithmetic and calculation, about 6000 years ago (Please note the accelerating pace of our technological knowledge), and with those inventions, a beginning of our recorded history, fragmentary though it may be for those early times. Now, being confined in large communities, under authorities that could enforce order, and presumably faced with an increasing occurrence of transgressions, it became necessary to invent codified law and set penalties, some 5000 years ago. It also became expedient, as small, wandering bands turned into increasingly large, settled communities, to codify (i.e. to standardize and expound, then enforce) the presumably diverse and chaotic explanations for all the natural events for which there was no known explanation (and there was then no factual explanation for virtually everything, only attributed but traditional fancies), thereby giving birth to systematic religion, and to all the evils that flowed therefrom, as well as a few good aspects, such as mercy and charity, continuity and preservation of records. And here one might end a recital of \u201cthe earliest events that have occurred in human history\u201d, unless we take the \u201chistory\u201d to mean written history, and so Mesopotamia, Egypt, Harappa and Mohenjo Daro, Crete and Tyre, Greece, Rome, China and India, and with them cities, wars, and inventions from the trebuchet and catapult, chariot and compass, to sail and bow, as well as the concepts of social cohesion (monarchy; republic; democracy; etc.), of a deliberate acquisition of knowledge (science), and of analysis and conceptualization (philosophy).

            "answer_text": "This answer will not be what you expect but I offer it as food for thought. My answer is based on the Bible lectures of Jordan B Peterson, Phd. Doctor Peterson is a clinical pyschologist and neuro-scientist who teaches university classes in Canada and lectures widely. He has a large presence on You Tube and his Bible lecture series can be found on his website. As explained by Dr. Peterson the story of Adam and Eve may be viewed as a metaphorical tale concerning the emergence of our hominoid ancestors into full homo-sapien self consciousness. In this view Adam and Eve are archetypes not actual people who emerge from a pre-human dream world (the perfect Garden.) Actual history begins with the very ancient story of Cain and Abel. These brothers are depicted as fully conscious humans who act in all too familiar ways. Until humanity moved out of the trees/jungle (the Garden of Eden) fully conscious, with language, history could not begin for it could not be passed down from one generation to the next. Dr. Peterson suggests that the beginning of history (oral history, later to be written down in the Book of Genesis ) was an account of one brother slaying another. With justification it may be said that this fratricide is the event that marked the beginning of history for it is one of the earliest if not the earliest record of the actions of real people. ",

            "answer_text": "Traditionally historians consider a record - to be a written thing and as a result Sumerians are often given he credit for creating the earliest recorded events. Most of these are not referring to a specific event , but are more a general record like a diary of daily life events and activity. A bit like a record of government. However a more modern historical and anthropological approach now would include artifact and the inclusion of evidence of early story telling in the form of cave drawings and the discovery or evidence of the use of tools. Timelines are actually becoming more fluid as we make new discoveries, reevaluate what we have all ready discovered and importantly our changing perspective on when we classify ourselves as humans in evolution.
