            "answer_text": "Q: \u201cWhy didn't Hitler hate black people? \u201c People simply do not understand that anti-Semitism is not racism. Anti-semitism is a hatred of the Jews alright, but as a negative ideal, not as a race. (A lot of the explanation for these sorts of phenomena have to do with \u2018idealism\u2019 - a variant of 'splitting and projection - and Hitler with the Nazis were \u2018idealists\u2019). Despite what some contributors would like to imagine, Hitler thought black people were inferior - remember the Berlin Olympics? -and he thought most other races (not all) were inferior, but that did not mean he wanted to exterminate all other races. You won\u2019t 'get it' if you apply logic, such as \u2018because the Jews were semitic\u2019, or \u2018because the Jews were bankers\u2019 and so on; it will just get you to some kind of \u2018rationalisation\u2019, which is the same place the Nazis would have been in. Rationalisation is when you explain something to yourself and to others using apparently rational arguments, when the true reasons are either beyond reason, or unknown to you - in this case they were unconscious emotional and psychological dynamics. For various reasons, a lot to do with a certain kind of exclusivity erected to preserve their culture in diaspora, but which encourages scapegoating, Jews have presented as vulnerable when folk wanted to disown their own darkest desires. The Nazis and Hitler had a lot of darkness to disown, and so did Germany after WW1, and this certainly suited the Third Reich. But this was not realpolitic; the darkness was genuine unconscious shit, and the effect of unconsciously perceiving your shit in another race, is what a negative ideal, and anti-Semitism actually is.
