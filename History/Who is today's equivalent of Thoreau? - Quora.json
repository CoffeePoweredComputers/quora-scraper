            "answer_text": "For today's equivalent to Thoreau, check out Wendell Berry, the Kentucky farmer and writer, or Gary Snyder, the Southern California poet. Berry is the rare writer who is probably equally gifted as  novelist, poet, and essayist. I began with his Recollected Essays, 1965-1980, which appears not to have been updated or expanded since. The Hidden Wound, a 1960's book on race, holds up well. Berry is quite prolific, so start anywhere.    Snyder, we are told, was the inspiration for Jack Kerouac's character Japhy Ryder in The Dharma Bums. Snyder won a Pulitzer prize for the poetry collection Turtle Island, and I have always liked the poetry in his less-known book Axe Handles. His essays in The Practice of the Wild are good reading. Both men have been involved in various kinds of social protest over the years.       A couple of other things worth a look, but from people I would not nominate for the full title of \"modern-day Thoreau.\" Check out Clifford Stoll's Silicon Snake Oil. I'm sure some of the material looks dated now, but Thoreau might appreciate the self examination and cultural critique in its pages regarding our use of technology.    One final, frivolous addition: Check out \"Repent, Harlequin, Said the Ticktock Man,\" by Harlan Ellison. Here, Ellison unpacks Thoreau's critique of imposed order in a fun, imaginative way.     (This illustrated edition is fun.) There are others, but I hope I've put you onto some good, inspiring reading! ",

            "answer_text": "Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, who wrote Freakonomics and Superfreakonomics. They have an understanding of the 21st century world that few are able to grasp. Their explanations and connections of the way things work in today's society are not only prescient, but written with an eloquence that is easily understood by most people.  Thoreau's life was so very different from the world we live in today, but I believe these writers could easily explain even the connections between a 19th century hermit-philosopher and a 21st century Wall Street thief. Personally, I think it comes down to manipulation of truths and beliefs, but I digress. Dubner and Levitt could have a completely different answer. ",
