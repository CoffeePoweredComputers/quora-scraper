            "answer_text": "The greatness of the US ended in January, 2017, and is now a second world disaster zone, with a crushed economy, the worst deaths from COVID 19 in the world due to a sociopathic, senile and incompetent president, the laughing stock of the world and very, very poor funding for education and health care. Add to that concentration camp style animal cages for migrant children who were kidnapped, and some who died\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.and the end of our Constitutional Republic including the end of our Constitution. Here is a reminder of when America Was Great Again after a major recession;  And our Greatest Leader (photo taken 2008);  But past historic greatness was around the many massive (and sometimes world wide) Empires that have been around for thousands of years. Those with the largest percentage of the human race were the Roman Empire and the British Empire, each with approx. 1/4th of the human race. China today is an actual empire made up of what were 6 countries with similar cultures, united 2200 years ago by the Emperor Qin Shi Huang. That empire within a country has 1/5 of the human population, and India is catching up. Here\u2019s a photo of something started 2200 years ago too; Yes, I had to climb up all those differently sized steps to get this photo in 2014.  Some empires were barbaric and some, more ethical (Emperor Cyrus of Persia comes to mind)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..but most were some of both. But \u201cGreat\u201d does not always mean \u201cethical\u201d as we look back on past history. ",

            "answer_text": "There will, be assured. Each great nation/empire has its time in the sun then fades. The great drivers are technology, character of its people and political environment. Where there is a political environment which allows/encourages entrepreneurs and the character of the people allows them to make use of the circumstances technology will be expanded/advanced and the country I\u2019ll move forward, often rapidly. That country will rise to eminence. Great wealth will be created and great jealousy with it. Some will call for restrictions on and redistribution of what they did not create. This is when danger arises. It would be a foolish man who argued against a measure of redistribution. It would also be a foolish man who didn\u2019t take great care to protect the systems which allows entrepreneurs to flourish and create wealth. Better 10% of a million pounds than 60% of A hundred thousand. Creation of wealth is the way to enhance nations, lift people out of poverty and drive forward innovation. Remember when the Soviets wanted a car industry they brought out the LADA, which was an old Fiat model, out dated in the west. Drop your preconceptions and think on the above. ",
