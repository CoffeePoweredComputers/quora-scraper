            "answer_text": "Obviously, mohammed. He is considered a \u201cprophet\u201d, and as such, the belief of muslims is that he \u201cvalidated\u201d all the previous prophets before him as well as their message. However, during his own lifetime, he simply was not very intelligent or knowledgeable about the other religions in question, namely Christianity and judaism. So, his own message was a drastic departure from both of them, and the stories he cites from the bible are often skewed and just wrong. Even in mohammed\u2019s day, people knew how to test whether or not he was a prophet of God, and in one account; The rabbis said, 'Ask him about three things of which we will instruct you; if he gives you the right answer then he is an authentic prophet, but if he does not, then the man is a rogue, so form your own opinion about him. Ask him what happened to the young men who disappeared in ancient days, for they have a marvelous story. Ask him about the mighty traveler who reached the confines of both East and West. Ask him what the spirit is. If he can give you the answer, then follow him, for he is a prophet. If he cannot, then he is a forger and treat him as you will.' The two men returned to Quraysh at Mecca and told them that they had a decisive way of dealing with Muhammad, and they told them about the three questions. \u201cThey came to the apostle and called upon him to answer these questions. He said to them, 'I will give you your answer tomorrow,' but he did not say, 'if God will.' So they went away; and the apostle, so they say, waited for fifteen days without a revelation from God on the matter, nor did Gabriel come to him, so that the people of Mecca began to spread evil reports, saying, 'Muhammad promised us an answer on the morrow, and today is the fifteenth day we have remained without an answer.' This delay caused the apostle great sorrow, until Gabriel brought him the Chapter of The Cave, in which he reproaches him for his sadness, and told him the answers of their questions, the youths, the mighty traveler, and the spirit.\u201d (Sirat Rasul Allah, page 133) So, we see mohammed thought for sure one of his companions would give him the info by the next day\u2026but none of them knew about these stories (and NONE of them are biblical\u2026for either jews nor Christians). The story of the 7 sleepers is widely known as they are considered martyrs during the reign of the emperor Decius\u2026so the time and number of them IS in fact known. The story of Zulkarnain is in fact that of Alexander the Great, a popular saga of the time. But the \u201canswers\u201d mohammed ended up giving after 15 days comes to, \u201cum\u2026.well, um\u2026you see, there\u2019s some story about some people in a cave\u2026but no one knows too much about it\u2026only God knows\u2026and He told me not to talk about it\u2026\u201d Buffonery. This story alone is pure proof that mohammed had no knowledge other than from those around him. Thus, he is the founder of the religion he began\u2026.and not God/allah. ",
