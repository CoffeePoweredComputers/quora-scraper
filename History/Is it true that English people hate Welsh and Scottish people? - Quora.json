            "answer_text": "I've lived in England my whole life but my Mother is Scottish and I actually fence for Scotland sometimes. I also go to Jesus college in Oxford, often referred to as the Welsh college. As a result I have a fair amount of experience with this. In general the answer is no. Most people don't care where you're from (unless maybe you're French). The general sentiment is you're British. There is an issue with accents sometimes, I have real difficulty understanding some of my Grandma\u2019s Scottish friends sometimes. In fact I genuinely can't understand my Great Uncle on the phone at all. In all honesty I really don't like the sound of a Welsh accent, but it doesn't really affect whether I like the people who have one. Plus it's not as bad as say a really strong Jordie (essentially northern) accent. There are, predictably, a fair few amount of insults traded. This however is generally amicable and done between friends, sometimes it's grounded in fact, sometimes it isn't. Just google \u2018Welsh sheep jokes\u2019 for plenty of examples of this There's also a very real sense of political estrangement at the moment, often the Scottish in particular have a different view of things than the English do. Things like the independence referendum, and the demands for another one don't help. But again, this doesn't really affect how people see individual Scottish people. ",
