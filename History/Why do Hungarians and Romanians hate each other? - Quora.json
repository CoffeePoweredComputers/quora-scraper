            "answer_text": "I\u2019m pretty confused too, my friend, since I was requested for this question but still, I barely know a bit of history and politics. So here\u2019s my guess. In Transylvania(the middle region of Romania, where there\u2019s a lot of Hungarians too), people are endlessly debating over Who Was First? there. Spoiler alert: they might never agree on this. And I can\u2019t properly answer this, since I wasn\u2019t even born in Transylvania. But I do study Medicine here. And in the past few months I\u2019ve met all kinds of Hungarians: students, teachers, kids on the street, retail workers or just random pantients at the hospital. Honestly, I\u2019ve seen quite a few signs of tension that didn\u2019t have anything to do with me directly. A few Romanians have something againts these people because of the fact that they live here and demand rights and jobs and so on. And on the other hand, I believe Hungarians in general might feel oppressed a bit and react on that. I\u2019ve done a few night shifts at the ER and many elderly patients barely knew a couple Romanian words, which wasn\u2019t really pleasing for some of the doctors who didn\u2019t speak the language and they always had to ask someone to translate. That\u2019s not easy to solve as a problem since I can\u2019t ask an 80 year old to start learning my language. But there\u2019s also this thing, that didn\u2019t happen to me yet(I just heard about it)with younger people who did not speak Romanian(or pretended not to)and whose services were needed at some point. There was this fuss on the internet a couple months ago with a Hungarian retail worker who was demanded food but couldn\u2019t serve the costumer because she didn\u2019t speak Romanian. Obviously, that was a new reason for people to fight pointlessly on the internet. I do think that, like in every political/historical issue ever, both sides are right and wrong. You cannot force a whole population to go back to their country and you can never know what really happened hundreds of years ago, since we all know the history in our text books is one good example of bullshit. Also I\u2019m not a fighter in general. I believe in that crap called peace. ",

            "answer_text": "Mostly due to disputes over Transylvania. The Hungarians claimed that they were first there and thus belongs to them (A fact reinforced later by some German, Austrian and Hungarian historians, to legitimize later take over of the region by the empire of Austrian and Hungarian people). Some of these false historians even claim that Transylvania was uninhibated when they came. Which is false. Dacian-Romans (the direct forefathers of Romanians) always lived beyond the Carpathians and so did their Romanian descendants. The Hungarians invaded and tried to colonize it with their folk. They ill-treated the Romanian people there for centuries. Like the Ottoman Empire was to Wallahia, so was the kingdom of Hungary. Unfortunately, there were also a few Romanian boyars and nobles such as John Hunyadi (Iancu de Hunedoara) who accepted Hungarian reign and who even enforced the ales of the King. John played a pivotal role in Hungarian politics and his son Matthias Corvinus would go on to become King of Hungary (the irony: One of Hungary's greatest and most well-known monarchs was a Romanian, whom I perosnally despise for abandoning and overlooking his true heritage). Matthias would in later time not aid Vlad III the Impaler against the Ottoman Empire (though he promised assistance in a letter) and would later betray and imprison him on false claims that the Wallachian Voivode was a traitor (even going as far as trying to forge a letter) or that he terrorized his people (Vlad never killed his own people, only a few boyars who were in league with the Sultan or were conspiring to usurp him). The Hungarians as well as Turk and German chroniclers (and a few traitorous boyars) claimed that Vlad had been a tyrant and bloodthirsty lunatic who was impaling (which was ine of the thousand of techniques which were actually invented by the Ottoman Empire to give Christian painful deaths; ironically Vlad would impale many of the invading Turks with their own device) ordinary people (A lie since we know Vlad was more benevolent to common folk than to boyars). Many of the lies and propaganda stories of Hungary, Ottoman Empire and traitorous boyars were the material that Bram Stoker would use in Dracula (which portrays him as the bad guy who tortured thoisands of people, correction Turks who wanted to invade all Europe and their agents in Wallachia. Everybody seems to forget Henry the VIII of England, Phillip the IV of France and the various Sultans of the Middle Age, each of whom tortured or killed people in various ways). Matthias released Vlad at Stephen of Moldavia\u2019s request. The Hungarians would continue to oppress the Romanians in Transylvania and years later so would the Austrians. Their empire considered Transylvania theirs (though it belongs to us Romanians from the beginning, even if Hungary denies it). The Szekely (Secui in Romanian), a people of Hungary voiced their desire to become their own state within Romania's territory during Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu's leadership and ill-treated and mocked Romanians (If you were Romanian and went to a store to but something, the Szekely would pretended that he did not understand Romanian and refused to cooperate). Even despite Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s attempt to make them accept that they were citizens of Romania and not their own state, they continued with the flag of their \u201cstate\" (and some even nowadays). I have met/seen many Szekely or Hungarian who continue with their claims that Transylvania belongs to them (you cannot reason with them, they deny the truth and end up in whole debates about how it is theirs rightfully). We Romanians have a lot of reasons to despise them (After the Gypsies who unfortunately plague our country), most of all the Szekely. Whoever says that that is not true is either ignorant of these fact or pretending for the sake of appearances. I preffer to express my opinion and speak clear. There is no such things as \u201clet us let bygones be bygones\u201d or \u201cpast is past\". If they could take Transylvania they certainly would without asking our Romanian goverment and ill-treat the local Romanians as they did in the past (the past often tends to repeat itself; quick example: a man who betrays one once can do it again). They were to our forefathers as much invaders as the Turks and Russians. The past is never wholly forgotten. ",
