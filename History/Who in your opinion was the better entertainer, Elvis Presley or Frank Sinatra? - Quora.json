            "answer_text": "Frank - and for those of you who talk about moving to Elvis. You have no idea how the bobby soxers reacted to Frank. They screamed, fainted, jumped up and down in their seats and in the aisles. In many cases at a theatre in the 1940\u2019s there would be an entertainer and then a movie and then the entertainer again. It would go on like that all day. Teenagers would line up around the block trying to get in, but most would never leave once they did get in. Many just peed in their pants rather than take a chance on loosing their seat. I saw Frank and Elvis. Frank was better. They both had \u201cit\u201d but Frank had \u201cit\u201d longer plus he didn\u2019t mess up his life with drugs like Elvis. If Colonel Parker would have let Elvis do more of what he wanted to do, Elvis would have been happier and might have grown as a singer and an actor. Frank had no one to stop him and he just kept going up! ",

            "answer_text": "Obviously though I love and am myself a huge die hard fan of both Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra , I have to say that it\u2019s Elvis Presley for sure by miles , a better entertainer / performer than Frank Sinatra (as I\u2019m even more of Elvis fan than a Sinatra fan). Elvis Presley is credited for initially starting the \u201c rock and roll \u2019\u2019 music revolution and popularity though later on The Beatles (rock band consisting of members : John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison , and Ringo Starr) successfully surpassed Elvis Presley on popularity in terms of influence , teenage craze , and US Billboard charts , Elvis however was a much bigger star than Sinatra in terms of influence , teenage craze , and US Billboard charts.
