            "answer_text": "By the US history? Yes. I heard the US history book still made him the tyrant of US war for independence and if those taxes are a form of tyranny then why not the british parliament? They put the tax and made the decision, the king? He was a constitutional monarch and yet americans thought it was still his fault\u2026also he has a mental issue? Porphyria was it? Possibly that was the illness but the americans ignored it, he was known to be a \u201cmad king\u201d, i think it\u2019s not because he has a tyrannical reign but he has a real mental illness and was almost insane! I felt pity reading about him, honestly. So in the US history? Yes, quite unfairly but in other history? I believe he is just regard as one of the many british monarchs, so outside of America they either will not know him that much, know he\u2019s one of the british monarch that\u2019s gone mad or just know him as one of Britain king and nothing else ",
