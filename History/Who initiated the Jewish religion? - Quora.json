            "answer_text": "Strictly speaking, it was Moses. The Jewish people only became the Jewish people officially when the recieved the Torah on Mount Sinai. God gave over the first 2 commandments of the 10 commandments (part of the revealed Torah) directly to the Jewish people, ie, all 2-3 million people at Sinai directly heard God speaking to them, but their souls left their bodies each time from the spiritual 'shock', so they asked Moses to pass on the other commandments, so to speak, as they'd had enough of dying and then being revived. BTW - as far as I know, Judaism is the only religion that God Himself introduced directly to 3 million people. Every other religion got started with one 'enlightened' individual having a personal revelation and then turning that into a creed. Rivka Levy Jewish Emotional Health Institute ",

Abraham, while the initiator of Judaism (as per definition) never declared himself or has anbody declared him a deity. In a polytheistic world, after much searching he discovered G-d and as a reward G-d promised to give his offspring the Torah. This promise was fulfilled when G-d gave the Jewish people the Torah at Mount Sinai through Moses (who was never deified either). Jesus, however, is a deified human being, an antithesis of core Jewish belief. ",
