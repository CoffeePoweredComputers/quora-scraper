            "answer_text": "IMHO here's what I took away from GG&S:1) Fates of civilizations are explained by geography to a large extent. For example the location of crops that were cultivated first, the animals that were domesticated early, how far these (crops & animals) would spread, all was determined by geography.2) Primitive hunter gatherers or tribals face many more challenges of existence, and hence the survivors are atleast as smart & knowledgable (about their immediate surroundings, flora and fauna) as more advanced peoples.o3) Spread and variation of languages are a way to track the spread of races/cultures across the globe, and help to localize the place of origin ",

            "answer_text": "The early development of what we call \u201chigher civilization\u201d in some locations rather than others was not based upon differences in human potential, but the ability to provide and store sufficient food that people could focus on things beyond basic survival. This in turn was impacted by geographical and climatic elements. The earliest \u201cadvanced civilizations\u201d all had access to a species of grain that could be stored dry for long periods of time, so that they could stockpile food, and had domesticated animals to assist with food production. That particular class of grain evolved in a specific type of ecosystem, and useful animals were more available in certain geographic areas. Put it all together and you have a fascinating theory for why human civilization developed so much earlier in some places than others. ",
