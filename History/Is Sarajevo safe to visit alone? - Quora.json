            "answer_text": "What you do not understand is following  -  hospitality in BosniaHerzegovina is a folk custom. No one will give you 1000 usd once they stumble upon you, but do not be surprises if one buys you a cup of cofee out of the blue.  Wars from 1990s were nonreligious wars, they were tribal wars between Serbs,Croats and Bosnians(Bosnian Muslims).  Sarajevo is a multiconfessional and multiethnic city where winter Olympics of 1984 took place. The only way you can get in trouble in Sarajevo is EITHER if you take sides with Serb,Croat,Bosnian nationalists OR if you meet drug dealer, prostitute, gambler. If you do not buy 3 prostitutes and forget to pay them, or if you donot start a personal-Crusade against muslims or communism or Russia or Vatican, youll be as safe as in Spain or Greece  IMHO - you are much safer in Sarajevo than in Belgrade, and you are far safer in Belgrade than in Paris or Brusseles. Im not mentioning London, since London is objectively a standard in terms of crime rate (in percentages probably not, but in absolute numbers and football huliganism and youth chaves it indeed is) ",

            "answer_text": "If you travel a lot and know how to keep yourself safe, recognize and avoid potentially dangerous situations and people, then yes, it is safe to come alone and explore all you want. We are having a large influx of tourists lately and it comes with usual problems, like more pickpockets and professional beggars (often both at the same time) who come here during tourist season from all over the region - so you need to be wary of that. Sometimes I see tourists having their wallets on display, like in the back pocket of their pants, half way out - I mean, it\u2019s calling for someone to take it. Some people will normally warn you of it if they see it. Other answers mentioned that some taxi drivers might try to trick you into paying more - but just make sure to let them know you know and you want that meter turned on. Usual price for a taxi from Sarajevo International Airport to Ilid\u017ea should be around 5 BAM (2.5 \u20ac) and to Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ija (Old Town) no more than 20 BAM (10 \u20ac). People are generally friendly and will go out of their way to help you. Welcome :) ",
