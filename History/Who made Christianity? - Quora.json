            "answer_text": "People who pick and choose Christ to believe, follow and do what He said, are Christians or Followers of Christ. The 12 handpicked apostles would be considered then as the first Christians who chose to follow Christ. Thus for Christianity to be based solely on Christ and His teachings He preached when He walked as a man in flesh, we can say that man made Christianity. Then came Paul, as a self-proclaimed apostle who was not among the original handpicked disciples, then Roman Emperor Constantine who embraced Christianity to further spread it, and other people who then created the various denominations of what we call as Christianity still. People who pick and choose Paul to believe, follow and do what he said, are not necessarily Christians, but Paulians rather. To believe in the entire Bible doesn\u2019t necessarily make one a Christian, and this can be seen among conservatives who take to the lifestyle of homophobia such that they choose to believe in other part of the Bible, but not Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm, are not Christians as they do not follow any teachings of Christ. I\u2019ve written intensively in most of my answers on Quora to show who they really are for them to have exchanged the truth for lies of false teachers instead. ",

            "answer_text": "So the consensus of responses seems to be that Paul invented Christianity. The only problem with this theory is that it has no basis in known historical fact. Saul of Tarsus was a young rising star in Judaism, having attended the best schools and using a combination of Greco-Roman education and Jewish rabbinical training to advance to the inner circles of power in Jerusalem. He was commissioned by certain leaders on the Jewish Council to persecute Christians. He was actively arresting and imprisoning Christians when He was converted to Christianity. Immediately after his conversion, Saul of Tarsus became the persecuted outlaw Paul. He began preaching an illegal religion which got him harassed, intimidated, threatened, beaten, driven out of multiple cities and eventually killed. So, how could Saul of Tarsus be persecuting a religion he invented? How could he arrest the followers of Jesus, when he was the one who would later invent their faith? That\u2019s an absurd contradiction. The better question to ask regarding Paul is what could possibly have so radically altered his life? What could have changed his career so dramatically? He claimed that it was an encounter with the resurrected Jesus on the Road to Damascus. More importantly, he maintained this claim even when threatened with death multiple times. It would have been so easy for him to recant, deny what he claimed to have seen and return to his earlier successful life. We have become so accustomed to seeing Christianity as the majority religion and a source of political power that we have forgotten than the Christian faith was illegal for almost 300 years. The apostles almost all died as a result of persecution for preaching the resurrected Jesus. So, who invented Christianity? I think the evidence points much more clearly to the resurrected Jesus than to Paul. Every key leader of the early church (including the men who wrote the Gospels and the other half of the New Testament) pointed to the resurrected Jesus as the founder and head of the church. The Resurrection of Jesus is a Real, Historical Event and Makes ALL the Difference ",
