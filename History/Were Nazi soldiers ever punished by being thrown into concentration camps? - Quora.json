            "answer_text": "One of my professors was a German soldier. According to him, after the war, thousands of German soldiers were herded into open top cattlecars and shipped to camps in France. Enroute, they were reviled by the French at every overpass. They were shat on and urinated on. If they made angry,insulting gestures in reply, the guards on the corners shot them. The bodies couldn't fall, because they were so packed in. At the camp, he was told he had been tried and convicted of crimes. He could join the French Foreign Legion, or be shot. They also let him know they'd already notified his family of his execution.  After fighting in the FFL for a few years, he was allowed to leave, coming to the U.S., where he had to enlist in the army to get citizenship,  and fought in Korea. After that, he wanted to get away from war and went to school,  eventually teaching at a Texas college.  So apparently, German soldiers did get sent to prison camps. He also said there was no SYSTEMATIC torture,  but guards had carte blanche to beat or punish German prisoners.This is not to condone or criticize the French, just to share the story. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a really interesting question! As other answers demonstrate, that did indeed happen on occasion, but it was a rather rare exception. Last year, traveling in Cambodia, I visited one of the Khmer Rouge\u2019s torture prisons. That was an eye-opening experience for me, because it was the closest thing to a death camp I\u2019d ever seen that hadn\u2019t been organized by the Nazis. The thing that struck me about the Khmer Rouge was that a very large fraction of the inmates had been party members themselves. Many prisoners had been prison guards themselves, even a former minister was tortured and killed in that place. That didn\u2019t happen with the Nazis. Why? I think this is an example of where the specifics of the ideology matter. There are undoubtedly parallels between the Nazis and the Khmer Rouge in terms of economic desperation and a violent vision of how to create a better society. But while the Nazis believed that the Germans were the good people and the Jews the bad, for the Khmer Rouge it mattered whether you were a communist or an anti-revolutionary. In the first case, it was - according to their ideology - a matter of \u2018race\u2019, ie. something that could be found out by looking at your physique and family history, hard facts that can fairly easily be known about you. In the second case, it depends on what\u2019s going on in your mind, which no one can ever know with certainty. Hence the paranoia of the Khmer Rouge. Hence the relative rarity of Nazis turning on their own. ",
