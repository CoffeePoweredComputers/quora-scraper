There is a very strong Viking presence in the Orkneys, Shetland and the North of Scotland and it has to be remembered that quite a few Viking princesses came over to be married to Scottish Chiefs. So they settled in the North and the Outer Hebrides. And they seemed to like us Scots cos they didn't seem to rape and pillage as they did down south! ;-} ",

I have always enjoyed the Icelandic Sagas so I\u2019ll now go back to the volumes in an attempt to reference 1 to 5 and seek others..? Decisions to settle on land without opposition are likely to be based on the following factors: on suitable land with closeness to the open sea or river access to the open sea - allowing them to leave if attacked or the settlement was unsuccessfulland where imported supplies could support a settlement in the first year or so of setting upland where precious metals, timber, goods, slave, and chattels could be taken, harvested or bought for trading purposes or setting up elsewhereland where the indigineous peoples welcomed an input of labour and/or leadershipland involved in marriage settlements, military agreements, etc",

This is what I surmise looking at maps of Norse settlements in the British Isles. I\u2019m happy to be corrected or confirmed. ",
