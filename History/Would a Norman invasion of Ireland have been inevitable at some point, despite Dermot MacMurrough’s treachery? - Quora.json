            "answer_text": "Would a Norman invasion of Ireland have been inevitable at some point, despite Dermot MacMurrough\u2019s treachery? Henry II of England, Normandy, Anjou, Aquitaine and Gascony was laying plans to invade Ireland in 1155, a year after he inherited the English throne. He hoped to grab some land for his youngest brother, William. On that occasion he was talked out of it by his mother, the Empress Matilda, who convinced him that it would be too difficult. But in preparation for this adventure he claimed to have got the Pope, Adrian IV (Nicholas Brakspeare) to issue the bull Laudibiliter*, which authorised him to take control of Ireland to reform the church there. So clearly Henry was very serious about his plans for the conquest of Ireland long before Diarmait ever set foot in Wales. By the time Strongbow\u2019s forces arrived in Ireland both William (1164) and Matilda (1167) were dead, but this made no difference to Henry\u2019s determination and at some point in the early 1170s he extracted letters from Pope Alexander III which reiterated the terms supposed to have been set out in Laudibiliter. On the basis of these he declared himself Lord of Ireland, and he and his successors never looked back. That said, however, subsequent Angevin kings of England didn\u2019t take much interest in Ireland until the last quarter of the 14th century: they had other priorities in Palestine, France and Scotland. So it is possible that if Henry had not been able to establish himself when he did, to the extent that he did, by 1175 English royal ambitions in Ireland would not have continued. But the Cambro-Norman lords who preceded Henry and accompanied Diarmait would still have been there. What would have become of them we can only speculate. *The authenticity of Laudibiliter is challenged. Some authorities believe it to be a forgery, and others think it was heavily edited by English clerics before it was published. ",

            "answer_text": "Let us start with the mistaken assertion in your question: Although Diarmait mac Murchada\u2019s importation of Cambro-Norman mercenaries in 1169\u201370 had catastrophic consequences for the Irish, his actions in no way involved \u201ctreachery.\u201d You appear to be looking at what Diarmait did through the lens of modern (19th century) nationalism. But this is an example of \u201cpresentism\u201d\u2014the tendency to interpret past events in terms of modern values and concepts\u2014and has no useful place in historical analysis. Treachery involves disloyalty or a betrayal of trust, and Diarmait did not betray any trust. His first loyalty was to the people of his tuath, the U\u00ed Ceinnselaig, who had elected him as their king in 1126 (at age 16) and whose interests he had zealously pursued for 40 years. His second obligation was the other tuaithe of Leinster, whose kings and lords had acknowledged Diarmait as their over-king and who had benefitted from his rule, especially in the ten years from 1156\u201366, when Diarmait\u2019s ally Muirchertach mac Lochlainn of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill had been high king of Ireland.  The five over-kingdoms are Leinster (blue-gray), Munster (green), Connacht (light blue), Meath (yellow), and the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill (pink). Public Domain. In 1166, however, Diarmait discovered that outside of U\u00ed Ceinnselaig itself, loyalty in Leinster was in short supply. The sub-kings of north Leinster had declared for Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair when he seized the high kingship following the death of Muirchertach mac Lochlainn, and they (along with the kings of Dublin and Osraige, who had also sworn loyalty to Diarmait), marched with Ruaidr\u00ed against Diarmait in 1166. But, you might say, wasn\u2019t Diarmait similarly disloyal to Ruaidr\u00ed, who, after all, was the high king of Ireland? Well, no. The high kings were \u201cfirst among equals\u201d in relation to the rulers of the traditional over-kingdoms. In order to successfully claim the high kingship, an over-king had to obtain the submission of a majority of the others. But it was not unusual for one or even two over-kings to refuse to submit, and indeed most of the high kings after Brian Bor\u00fama (d. 1014) were described by the annalists as \u201chigh king with opposition.\u201d In 1166, Ruaidr\u00ed had moved quickly to secure the submission of a majority of the other kings of Ireland, and marched against U\u00ed Ceinnselaig specifically to try to force Diarmait to submit. Diarmait refused, however, and (having dug into strongly defended positions around Ferns), made it clear that Ruaidr\u00ed would pay a steep price to oust him. Following negotiations, Diarmait agreed to step down as king of Leinster but retained his ancestral position as lord of U\u00ed Ceinnselaig. Ruaidr\u00ed solemnly guaranteed the safety of Diarmait and his family. But as soon as Ruaidr\u00ed had headed home to Connacht, his henchman and Diarmait\u2019s life-long nemesis Tigern\u00e1n Ua Ruairc joined forces with Diarmait\u2019s enemies in north Leinster, Dublin, and Osraige, and marched again against Ferns. Who was behaving treacherously here\u2014Ruaidr\u00ed in turning a blind eye to Tigern\u00e1n\u2019s breach of the guarantee of safe conduct given to Diarmait, or Diarmait in fleeing for his life, to seek allies wherever he could find them? Moreover, there was nothing treacherous about Diarmait\u2019s hiring foreign mercenaries to help him regain his crown. As I wrote in another post on Quora recently: It was not particularly unusual to hire foreign mercenaries. Irish kings had often engaged the services of Norse fighting men or had hired Norse fleets for use in wartime. Likewise, English kings had hired troops from Ireland. Diarmait himself had brokered a deal in which Henry II had hired the war fleet of Norse Dublin for a campaign against the Scots. Moreover, Diarmait\u2019s peers evidently did not see anything wrong with employing English troops either. In 1169, the king of Osraige lured the Anglo-Flemish knight Maurice de Prendergast and his followers away from Diarmait and took them into his service. The following year, Diarmait subcontracted a sizable [Cambro-Norman] force to his son-in-law the Ua Br\u00edain king of Thomond, who had rebelled against Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair. Finally, there is the question of the invasion of Ireland by Henry II in 1171, which flowed naturally from Diarmait\u2019s importation of mercenaries in 1169\u201370. But Diarmait never intended to involve Henry in Irish affairs. When Diarmait sailed to England in 1166, he seems to have assumed he could hire mercenaries as a purely private matter but found no takers among the Norman knights of the Welsh Marches. On the advice of his friend and host in England, Robert fitz Harding de Berkeley, the Reeve of Bristol, he then set out to seek Henry II\u2019s blessing for the enterprise, hoping that this might sway some of the reluctant knights. Diarmait eventually tracked Henry down at Saumur castle on the Loire, where he was occupied putting down rebellions by his French vassals. In seeking to win Henry over to his cause, Diarmait emphasized the treachery of the lords of Leinster who had rebelled against him rather than the actions of Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair. This struck a particular nerve with Henry, who became so agitated that he cursed the fact that he could not personally come to Diarmait\u2019s aid at that very moment, being tied up dealing with his own rebellious vassals. Diarmait hastened to assure Henry that there was no need for the English king to go to Ireland personally, and permission to recruit some of Henry\u2019s knights was all that Diarmait needed.  Diarmait died in May 1171 and Henry II invaded with overwhelming force later that year. His immediate motives included (a) the desire to forestall the establishment of a Norman kingdom in Leinster by the mercenary leader Richard de Clare (known to history as Strongbow), whom Henry disliked and distrusted; and (b) the desire to get away from France and England until the furore following the murder of Thomas Becket died down. But even if Diarmait had not put in motion the events that led to Henry\u2019s arrival in October 1171, it is quite possible that he would have invaded at some point anyway. Unknown to Diarmait, Henry had long harbored plans to conquer Ireland, first as a suitable kingdom for his brother William and later for his son John Lackland. He had gone so far as to obtain papal approval for such a venture in 1155 but had to shelve his plans at the time because of opposition by his mother, the Empress Matilda. Moreover, even if Henry had never invaded Ireland himself, one of his successors likely would have done so sooner or later. I believe it to be impossible that, over the many centuries of wars with France and Spain, the monarchs of England would have allowed the vulnerable backdoor in Ireland to remain open to French or Spanish mischief. The numerous re-invasions of Ireland and incursions into Scotland during medieval and early modern times attest to that. Thus, even if there was not a \u201cNorman invasion\u201d in 1169\u201371, it seems that later English invasions would have been inevitable anyway.
