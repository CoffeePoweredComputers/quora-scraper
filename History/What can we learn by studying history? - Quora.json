            "answer_text": "Studying history is a great opportunity to learn about events that have shaped the modern world and learn from the lessons of the past. More than that, however, studying history offers the opportunity to improve several skills that are very helpful in a number of careers. 1) First and foremost, history is an opportunity to hone research skills. Much of the work in a history class consists of finding information and understanding how it fits into a larger narrative. Figuring out what are the central themes and which details will help to paint a complete picture. I worked for a while at a start-up and I remember when they asked me to do market research, I realized just how applicable the skills from my history classes were. 2) A large part of history is to read between the lines and behind the text to understand why the author (or creator of any historical source--much of history consists of objects rather than books) is trying to make a particular point. History encourages people to understand the perspective that different people bring to their analyses and to understand why people interpret events in a particular way. This skill is very helpful and allows people to direct their skepticism in a particular area. 3) History also teaches people to be better writers and helps them to write persuasive arguments. An important part of history classes is to teach people how to synthesize pieces of information and turn them into a thesis (in this case, meaning a central argument, not generally the document that students write in order to graduate from college and other higher degrees) and then convincingly back up that thesis. History students should have the ability to present the strengths of their own case alongside the shortcomings of alternative explanations. This was incredibly handy when I was working on my company's business plan. Do all history classes teach these skills? Absolutely not. Is studying history the only way to acquire these skills? Not by a long shot. Can studying history be a valuable academic pursuit? Absolutely! ",

            "answer_text": "I started learning/reading History about 8-9 years back. Here are my personal observations and experiences:  One of the first things I noticed, is that there is so much that I don't know about. So much to read... so little time.Timelines: History to me is about a lot of stories (some short, some long) and each is bound to a timeline. Each event in history to me is like a coloured timeline, or to perhaps better phrase it, a coloured brush stroke. Some are short, some are long. Over all, they paint a mosaic of ourselves witnessing our past. Face Value: Now, I usually don't accept much on face value. I learned to check almost everything out.There is so much chatter in real-life and on the Internet (especially social media), where facts, background, relevancy, and timelines are just plain incorrect. People just don't read history anymore and because of that, a lot of incorrect and sometimes false information is afloat out there.Relevancy: Everything slowly starts to fall into place. You will understand, sometimes even appreciate why something happened in the past and for what reason it happened, but more so, how it affected the timelines.The notion that History Repeats Itself: is so true. If one were to read it, you can almost see us in some form of a loop. Sometimes, repeating the same mistakes over and over again.History has a lot of bloodshed in it - especially when you read about Wars, you will see how the Human race is just pinned in exacting revenge.Small Incidents: So many great events in History can be narrowed down to some very specific small event or incident. It is very interesting to read how a small event shapes the events to come. Think the snowball effect.Perspective: A majority of History (in my opinion) is just documented perspectives. So many subject matters will clash or contradict each other. It is sometimes difficult to draw the true picture out.History has to be read with the small picture and the bigger picture. Many small events will form a bigger picture which we often ignore or miss out on. Sometimes, it is just the opposite. We are looking at the bigger picture, but miss out on the interesting facets of life in the small chapters of History.Again in a personal capacity (read: opinion), a lot of the answers to our problems lie in History.It is not as boring as one thinks it is or is led to believe. History can be highly entertaining.",
