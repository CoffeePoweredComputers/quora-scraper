            "answer_text": "Until the end of the 1st Century AD the Roman GI (legionary) was paid about 225\u2013250 silver denarii per month. A Roman gold aureus was valued at 25 silver denarii, making their pay about one gold aureus per month. The denarius was regularly debased through the 2nd and early 3rd Centuries, leading to pay increases for the legionaries. At the time of Septimus Severus (193\u2013211) the silver content had dropped to about 50% and the pay level had increased to 500 denarii per month. In addition, legionaries were also granted extra \u201cdonatives\u201d to insure their loyalty to the emperor. In 193 AD during a period of civil war, Didius Julianus actually bought the Roman Empire for 25,000 sestertii (about 6250 Denarii) per legionary. He didn\u2019t last long, though. 66 days after his purchase he was beheaded. ",

            "answer_text": "Pay for a Roman soldier was not very good. But after twenty years of service, less if you received a crippling wound like loosing a thumb that would make it impossible to handle a sword, you got a retirement gift of enough land to live on, enough to produce food for you and your future family for the rest of your life. It was this gift of free land that was the primary motivation to Roman enlistment within their army. Initially this land came from Italy. Later, with Italy filled and barbarian threats all about the empire, the lands came along the borders of the Empire so as to post retired soldiers there permanently. ",
