            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve read a half dozen books on this battle and several other accounts beside. As respondent David Browne indicated, it was a very near thing, and even the victorious Duke of Wellington acknowledged that it could have gone either way.  (Marshal Bl\u00fccher takes a tumble at Ligny - by Clemens Otto Fikentscher) The battle could have been effectively won on Day 1, when the allied forces were split and Napoleon was dealing heavy blows to the Prussians at Ligny and Marshal Ney was confronting Wellington\u2019s badly prepared units at Quatre Bras. Had the Comte D\u2019Erlon\u2019s I Corps (French) actually joined either battle in a timely fashion (conflicting orders saw him marching his men back and forth throughout the day), either engagement would have resolved much more swiftly. Had he rushed to Napoleon\u2019s aid, the timely addition of 20,000 men would have crumpled Marshal Bl\u00fccher\u2019s remaining Prussian force and likely have created much more of a rout, thus making it that much less likely that the Prussians could ever rejoin the battle. Napoleon could have pivoted much more swiftly to Quatre Bras, rolling up the over-extended Allied lines, forcing the sort of ordered retreat that Lord Wellington was master of, but with less likelihood of stopping at Mt. St. Jean, where the fateful battle actually took place. Given Wellington\u2019s prior record, he was more likely to have tried to save what he could and simply withdrawn far from danger, keeping his lines of communication secure in the hopes of eventually regrouping with what was left of the Prussians. As it was, the lack of the I Corps when it was most needed resulted in a hasty retreat by the Prussians, but not a rout. By the time Napoleon was able to turn his attention to Quatre Bras, his army was caught in a late-afternoon thunder storm that allowed Wellington all the cover he needed to withdraw safely to Mt. St. Jean, a position he had already selected as adequately defensible.  (William Barnes Wollen\u2019s depiction of the fighting at Quatres Bras) Even so, had Marshal Grouchy with a third of the French forces had succeeded in either keeping pressure on the retreating Prussians (he had one job, and he didn\u2019t do it) or in rejoining the main body of the French army on Day 3, a French victory would never have been in doubt. Really, a series of absurdly unlikely things had to happen to keep the French from winning\u2014there are so many it would take a much longer answer than this one\u2014and they pretty much all happened. It is almost as if Napoleon was just not meant to win in the end. That is one of the most fascinating things about this pivotal historical event. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me put this in as simply as I can. Although most of Napoleon\u2019s cavalry was gone (Thanks Ney!), and most of his infantry was tired, Napoleon had crushed the morale of Wellington's troops, and had captured La Haye Sainte, a farmhouse which put him only 60 yards away from the Allied centre. He needed only to push onwards. Not a great victory by Napol\u00e9on, but victory nonetheless.  The capture of Plancenoit. Image credit \u2014 Wikipedia He did push onward with d'Erlon's I Corps, or whatever remained of it, but forth came the cry from Plancenoit. \u201cThe Prussians are here! Bl\u00fccher is in the woods!\u201d  Bl\u00fccher surrounds the French. Sorry for the small image. Credit \u2014 napolun.com Grouchy had failed to stop the Prussians from regrouping with Wellington's forces because he was stopped by a delaying action at Wavre, even though he fulfilled Napoleon\u2019s orders to follow Bl\u00fccher \u201cwith a sword at his back\u201d. This was where Napoleon lost everything. The Prussians funneled themselves into the French right and thus the French were cornered. They outnumbered the Imperial Guard forces (Young Guard and Old Guard) by a humongous margin, but the Young Guard under Barrois and the Grenadiers of the Guard held on at bayonet point. The Young Guard alone suffered 80% casualties. It was a slaughterhouse, since the Prussians did not care to take prisoners as they were maddened by the amazing French defense.  Prussians storm Plancenoit. Credit \u2014 Wikipedia Only an hour later, Napoleon\u2019s Grande Arm\u00e9e saw the Prussians marching out of the smoke and ruins of Plancenoit singing \u201cHerr Gott. Dich loben wir\" with their shakos on top of their bayonets and Gniesenau leading from the front. The morale of the whole French army collapsed. Soon, retreat turned to rout, and what was supposed to be a glorious victory leading to a victorious campaign against both Wellington and Bl\u00fccher, turned into Napoleon's worst defeat.  Napoleon retreats from Waterloo. Credit \u2014 Getty Images He came 60 yards and a bayonet charge close to victory at Waterloo.
