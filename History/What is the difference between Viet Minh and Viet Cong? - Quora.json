            "answer_text": "The war in Viet Nam for liberation began well before the US was involved. There was resistance to the French colonialists in Indochina pre-WWII, resistance to the Japanese occupation during WWII, and resistance to the French colonialists post WWII. The Viet Minh was formed in 1941, and fought the Japanese and the French, and defeated the French in the north in 1954. The 1954 Geneva Conference tried to settle the issue, but temporarily divided the country between the Viet Minh in the north and the French and their Vietnamese allies in the south. The French then basically withdrew. Neither the US nor the Vietnamese in the south agreed with the Geneva Conference plan. It contemplated an election to resolve control and unify the two halves, but it never occurred. By 1960, war had broken out between north and south. By that point, the Viet Minh no longer existed as a guerilla force fighting colonialists, but morphed into the regular army of the nation of North Viet Nam (the NVA). Its weaponry was also upgraded as the major communist powers provided it with military aid. The Viet Cong was formed in 1960, and consisted largely of southerners. Some former Viet Minh were southerners, and had either stayed in the south or gone to the north as part of the 1954 withdrawal to the north by the Viet Minh. They returned to the south to help form the Viet Cong. They recruited southerners who opposed the regime. The Viet Cong were guerillas and largely irregular soldiers, and were not nearly as tough or capable as regular NVA. They were largely under the control of the north, and served as an additional force in the north's effort to unite the south with the north. The Tet offensive in 1968 was undertaken largely by the Viet Cong, and decimated their forces. Its importance in the war was reduced after that. It ceased to exist in 1976 when the north conquered the south. ",

            "answer_text": "This is old, but I\u2019ll drop a few stones int the pond anyway The Viet Minh were a united front of various nationalists groups. I\u2019ll quote Sophie Quinn-Judge from her book \u201cHo Chi Minh; The Missing Years\u201d starting at page 246, as it will give you a better idea of why the Viet Minh/Viet Cong were the exact same organization: \u201cIn October 1940 Ho Chi Minh and his entourage moved to Guilin from Kunming. It was at this point that the communists abroad decided to use the mantle of the Viet Nam Independence League (Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi), Viet Minh for short, for their nationalist front. This was the same organization which had been founded in Nanjing by Ho Hoc Lam, Hoang Van Hoan, Le Thiet Hung, Phi Vn, Nguyen Hai Than and others in 1936. As it was an officially registered organization in China, it was structurally suited to Ho\u2019s purposes. At page 247, Quinn-Judge continues: \u201cIn late 1940 as a flow of refugees from the unsuccessful northern uprisings arrived in China, the Vietnamese nationalists moved south to Jingxi, a town just 65 miles (from Vietnam). Zhang Fakui, now commander\u2026 of (China\u2019s) Fourth War Area, sent the VNQDD member Truong Boi Cong to Jingxi to enlist the refugees in a \u2018border work team\u2019. There were already a few communists such as Le Quang Ba and Hoang Sam in this refugee group and Ho Chi Minh quickly sent three of his best cadres south to join them. These were Vo Nguyen Giap, Vu Anh and Cao Hong Lanh. They advised Ho that he should proceed to Jingxi to join them. When Ho traveled south, accompanied by Pham Van Dong, Phung Chi Kien and Hoang Van Hoan,he carried three pieces of identification, all dated 1940\u2026 issued under the name of Ho Chi Mnh. (the first use of that pseudonym). Page 248: \u201cHo Chi Minh and his communist core group continued to function successfully within a united front structure in 1941, while at the same time rebuilding links to the (Indochinese Communist Party) in Tonkin and Annam.\u201d Long Story short: The Viet Minh was organized as a United Front in the 1930s, when communists were using them as tactic in both revolutions and western elections. Hardly everyone in the Viet Minh was a communist, even by the time they had taken control of the organization. ARVN Colonel Tran Ngoc Chau\u2019s book \u201cVietnam Labyrinth\u201d makes that clear, So, the Viet Minh covered North, Centra, and South Vietnam up until 1956 and after. The Viet Minh was never the Vietnamese communist party, but a tool of it. The name was never changed by them to the Viet Cong. That was a RVN/US usage to identify who was behind the war. As in the French War, the Viet Minh war machine included Regular Forces (Main Forces in US parlance), Guerrilla Forces, and militias. But it also included the cadres who mobilized the resistance and auxiliary forces. The Viet Minh Regulars who mostly fought in the north during the French War became the elite divisions of the People\u2019s Army of Vietnam, the official name of the NVA. As for Vietnam having always been a single country, it might help to look up the terms Dang Trong and Dang Ngoai whose wars precipitated the Tay Son rebellion, which led to the defeat of the Trinhs, the fall of the Le dynasty, and the rise of the Nguyen dynasty, which created the conditions that led to French colonial rule there. The Cold War saw three such divisions, Germany, Korea, and Vietnam. But only one deteriorated into a long drawn out war, though North Korea may provide a worse example yet. As for the architects of the \u201cViet Cong\u201d, those were properly Nguyen Binh, the pseudonym of a former North Vietnamese VNQDD militant who later joined the communist party. He had been the successful commander of a liberated zone in North Vietnam in 1944\u201345. Faced with the post-war confusion and communication problems inherent in two distinctly different zones, Cochinchina in the South, and Tonkin and Annam in the North, Ho Chi Minh dispatched Nguyen Binh to the south to take control of the various anti-French nationalist groups, which he did with a ruthless efficiency. Ordered North for a conference with HCM in 1951, he was possibly betrayed to the French and killed by French advised Cambodian Army unit. He was replaced by another hard liner, Le Duan, and those two men, plus the Hanoi politburo, were the architects of our Vietnam War experience. ",
