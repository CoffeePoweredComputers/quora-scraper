            "answer_text": "Honest generosity and unrewarded civility. By nature, all people and indeed other lifeforms are totally dedicated to self-preservation. This necessitates eliminating every other lifeform in competition for the three necessities\u2026 sex, food, and safety. The old adage, \u201cIf it moves, mate with it. If you can\u2019t mate with it, eat it. And if you can\u2019t mate with it or eat it, kill it.\u201d This is the basis for every form of behavior, and sticking to just humans, it means envy, greed, lethality, and sexual prowess simply is the most efficient use of available time and resources. For a person to give without seeking reward is contrary to nature. This doesn\u2019t make it wrong, it simply makes it less dangerous to exist among others. Suddenly, it is no longer a threat to be around others. When several people gather into a mutually beneficial group, society is born. The creation of society involves acting in a manner contrary to self-preservation. this way, not every other life form is a threat, especially when one is a good hunter, another at finding or growing food sources, and another at recalling and telling stories so mistakes don\u2019t keep getting repeated endlessly. Now teaching, not just food sourcing is of mutual benefit. In the beginning, I stated that nature dictates that we must reproduce, eat or kill any threat. But as Katherine Hepburn\u2019s character \u201cRosie\u201d from the film \u201cThe African Queen\u201d says, \u201cNature, Mr. Allnut, is what we were put here to rise above.\u201d When a society becomes more advanced, the less it relies on competition to thrive. If my opinion is correct, generosity is, therefore, the most accurate measure of the state of advancement of any society. ",

            "answer_text": "History of modern sanitation started with the development of the protected water wells in the Neolithic times. ... The largest advance of early sanitation happened in Ancient Rome, where semi-successfully used latrines and sewage drains to divert the flow of sewage water from major cities. History of Sanitation - Water Supply and Sanitation Nineteenth-century movements to improve sanitation occurred simultaneously in several European countries and were built upon foundations laid in the period between 1750 and 1830. From about 1750 the population of Europe increased rapidly, and with this increase came a heightened awareness of the large numbers of infant deaths and of the unsavoury conditions in prisons and in mental institutions. The Public Health Act of 1848 established a General Board of Health to furnish guidance and aid in sanitary matters to local authorities, whose earlier efforts had been impeded by lack of a central authority. The board had authority to establish local boards of health and to investigate sanitary conditions in particular districts. Since this time several public health acts have been passed to regulate sewage and refuse disposal, the housing of animals, the water supply, prevention and control of disease, registration and inspection of private nursing homes and hospitals, the notification of births, and the provision of maternity and child welfare services. Advances in public health in England had a strong influence in the United States, where one of the basic problems, as in England, was the need to create effective administrative mechanisms for the supervision and regulation of community health. In America recurrent epidemics of yellow fever, cholera, smallpox, typhoid, and typhus made the need for effective public health administration a matter of urgency. The so-called Shattuck report, published in 1850 by the Massachusetts Sanitary Commission, reviewed the serious health problems and grossly unsatisfactory living conditions in Boston. Its recommendations included an outline for a sound public health organization based on a state health department and local boards of health in each town. In New York City (in 1866) such an organization was created for the first time in the United States. Public health - National developments in the 18th and 19th centuries ",
