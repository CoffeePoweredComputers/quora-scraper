            "answer_text": "A tyrant with an ideological agenda. The philosopher king is originally a concept of Platon. According to him, a philosopher king is a ruler who possesses both a love of wisdom, as well as intelligence, reliability, and a willingness to live a simple life. Such are the rulers of his utopian city Kallipolis. For such a community to ever come into being, \"philosophers [must] become kings\u2026or those now called kings [must]\u2026genuinely and adequately philosophize\" (The Republic, 5.473d) Unfortunately, road to Hell is paved with good intentions, and theories disintegrate when colliding with reality. In real life, politics is a dirty game where philosophers have no place (unless they have been born in purple) and which resembles the game of musical chairs more than anything. To be a successful ruler, the head of a state must have no ethics and no philosophical convictions. Yet politics is a battlefield of great ideologies, and Platon actually was the great-grandfather of Fascism. Giovanni Gentile formed the Fascist ideology and Italy on basis of The Republic, and for him, Benito Mussolini was the incarnation of the Platonian philosopher king. Niccol\u00f3 Machiavelli especially warns about philosophers as regents, saying they either are useless as statesmen (too idealistic) or the worst of all tyrants (they have an ideological agenda they drive with zeal), and gives Muhammad as an example. Later, Bertrand Russell and Karl Popper inspected the Platonian ideal and accused that in real life the ideal of \u201cphilosopher king\u201d did produce Adolf Hitler (via Hegelian dialecticism) and Josif Stalin (via Marxian philosophy). They claimed the \u201cphilospher king\u201d in real life means the same as \u201ca tyrant with an ideological agenda\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "It essentially goes back to Plato\u2019s understanding if philosophy itself and philosophers, best described in the famous parable of the cave. In essence, it is that philosophers alone see the reality of the world, where other men see only shadows, which they take for reality. Given this superior understanding, it is only natural that philosophers should govern other, lesser, men. Plato\u2019s philosopher king is an absolute ruler, not restrained by other institutions. For Plato, power may corrupt other men, but naturally would have no such effect on a true philosopher. The philosopher king doesn\u2019t attempt to make his subjects into philosophers, which presumably Plato saw as a level to which most could never aspire. He molds them as citizens, so in the Republic, citizens of the Republic are taught a set of myths which are intended to make them obedient citizens of the state. It\u2019s all actually pretty nightmarish, and you can, through philosophers like Hegel and Marx, draw something of a line from Plato\u2019s idea of the Guardians of the Republic to the Marxist Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Lenin\u2019s Vanguard party, as well as the theoretical underpinnings of Fascism.
