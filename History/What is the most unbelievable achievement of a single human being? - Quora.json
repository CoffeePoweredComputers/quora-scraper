            "answer_text": "Well, if Jesus had been a human being\u2014completely, not born of a Godfather\u2014and if he had resurrected after death, then that may have been the topper. There\u2019s a basis for dispute though. First, he raised Lazarus from the dead (and maybe even a little girl before that). So maybe he was third. Then again, maybe raising other people from the dead is the top achievement. True, doctors do it all the time, but not after four days, when you an smell the corpse actually rotting. Noticing that we never heard a thing about Lazarus afterwards, however, I wonder what condition he was in\u2014I mean, was he a person or a complete vegetable due to brain anoxia? We know the little girl got up and ate, for example. But Lazarus? He kinda stood there. Jesus is said to have done some spiritual things that gave all believers afterlife, but it\u2019s hard to evaluate that. It is unbelievable, which the question seeks in achievements. But, for one, it\u2019s off-earth. And second, it opened up hell. Are we going to name that an achievement? Some individuals caused the death of astounding numbers of people, led to the creation of whole empires. Are we going to count them? Then opening hell might disqualify our first candidate. Or do we want positive achievements only? Then there are all sorts of obscure individuals who found folk remedies and natural anesthetics, passing them only to future generations (free) who did the same for thousands of years, mitigating untold pain and suffering. There were ordinary farmers who came up with innovations saving thousands of lives from starvation, perhaps hundreds of thousands, Who is the first guy to invent the pointed stick, so humanoids could hunt? There are pioneers in logic and mathematics, ancient Greeks who are widely known such as Pythagoras who invented system that allowed later humans to land people on the moon, and within a few feet of where they targeted. Pretty impressive. Newton supposedly discovered gravity, Einstein discovered how it worked, especially in relation to light. (How influential were their wives in all of this?) Would the guy who invented the polio vaccine and gave it to the world for free, or the guy who invented the internet and gave us that for free count? There are so many parts to the achievement\u2014its impact on people, it\u2019s impact on a field, the genius or effort that went into it. People will rate the components differently, and so what counts as great achievement. I\u2019m tempted to say the the instrument maker who turned the viol de gamba into the modern cello did something sublime. Modigliani\u2019s colors, and the way Vermeer captured light. Jim Thorpe in the Olympics or Bo Jackson as an all-around athlete at game-sports. I don\u2019t know how hard it was to develop certain kinds of plastics that resisted heat, were rigid yet bent under certain temperatures, were also see through and did not discolor and now are preserving food \u201ceverywhere\u201d for easy carry. I think conceiving and carrying out the Marshall plan after WWII may have done the best thing in American history. Greatest relative to what? ",

            "answer_text": "Of the past, present and future I know, I think what most other answers lack is the person named \"Elon Musk\". Elon Reeve Musk started his journey with PayPal which was later acquired by EBay and Musk got $100 million from the acquisition. He invested a part of it in establishing his own Space Research Company, SpaceX and the other part in Tesla Motors, which produces electric cars and batteries. SolarCity became another successful venture under him.  \u200b The reason I nominate him is not because of the revenue and turnover of his companies (which amounts in many billion dollars), but for the vision of a better world with clean source of Energy, renewable and eco-friendly and his confidence on science and technology when he invested all his money for the welfare of American Society. All his products are at the highest standard of safety and the cleanest and cheapest source available. A single person developing so much is a very rare event in the planet and no wonder, why people call him a Real Iron Man. We all know a lot of Entrepreneurs who make a lot of money but we rarely come across personalities who have a vision for a better society with clean and eco-friendly innovations. His next plan is to develop HyperLoop which can run at 750 mph and will charge only $20 a customer, so cheap and fast public transport system, that too earthquake proof, again meeting the highest standards of safety. Watch this video where he launches Tesla Model X, a modern all Electric non-emmiting SUV with ummatchable performance and safety standards. Elon Musk launches Tesla Model X There are many more like this, just search for SpaceX, Tesla Motors, Tesla Powerwall and not to forget the \"Elon Musk\" himself and be ready to be amazed if you were unaware of this greatest personality in the history of Mankind.
