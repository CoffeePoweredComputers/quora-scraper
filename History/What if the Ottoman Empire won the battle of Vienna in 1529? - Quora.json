            "answer_text": "If the Ottomans had taken Vienna, they\u2019d just be killing themselves much faster than the course they were already on in 1529. This is in addition to creating some really interesting historical scenarios that would drastically alter the future of Europe had they occurred.  The actual goals of Sultan Suleiman I with regard to the Siege of Vienna are still very much debated to this day. Historians speculate that he didn\u2019t really intend to take Vienna, simply aiming to maim her beyond repair as he had at Buda in 1526. I\u2019m a believer in the idea that Suleiman was intending to take Charles V to town with his army, the two leaders had been fighting for preeminent position within Europe for their respective empires, and attempt to remove any Habsburg claim to Hungary to pave the way for Ottoman conquest. Vienna was meant to be the proactive act that would force Charles to meet Suleiman on the field of battle. This obviously did not occur and the Ottomans returned to Istanbul to celebrate his \u201cvictory\u201d which in reality was far from the truth. Suleiman's territorial goals mainly centered on his urge to conquer the Italian peninsula and he made several moves towards this goal. He played his hand with Francis I of France, nudging him towards the Franco-Ottoman Alliance when Francis was placed in the precarious position of being entirely surrounded by the Habsburg. Suleiman also heavily invested in his naval forces, attaining a strong position in the Mediterranean and effectively forcing Charles out of the theater entirely, unable to cope with the rise of the Ottomans and the rampancy of the Barbary Pirates. Suleiman attempted to secure a direct passage to Italy itself with his assault on Corfu in 1537 but this failed and was forced to take a new approach, defeating Venice in 1540.  Francis I of France and Suleiman I the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire painted separately by Titian in 1530. This alliance stemmed from the need to have a proper counterbalance to the ever increasing power of the Habsburg Empire and the threat it posed directly to Francis and Suleiman.  Back to your question, had the Ottomans successfully won the 1529 Siege of Vienna, they would have signed their death warrants far earlier than intended. The ability of the Ottomans to project power that deep into continental Europe was shaky at best and to hold onto Vienna entailed most likely invading upper Austria and Tyrol to secure the holdings. What reaches into the areas of historical speculation is just how much of a threat the Ottomans would\u2019ve been viewed as and what events would form out of those realizations. One particular event that comes to mind is the Counter-Reformation that was being undertaken throughout much of Europe at that point and just how an Ottoman threat would impact said movement. A majority of the nations bordering the Ottomans were Catholic and Germany in particular was dealing with a large wave of Protestant movements that were internally destablizing. France too was dealing with a large wave of Protestant flair and England was well on its way to becoming a Protestant nation itself. The ability of these nations deeply divided in religious turmoil to unite against the Ottomans was certainly in question. An interesting scenario would by the German Protestant Princes as they had the most to gain from Ottoman expansion. Christian rulers had long shown the willingness to abandon religious ideology for practicality when allying with the Ottomans if it served a purpose in overtaking their continental rivals, the Franco-Ottoman Alliance standing testament to this. It\u2019s not entirely out of the realm of possibility that the German princes unite with the Ottomans in an attempt to break the relative isolation they dealt with during the Counter-Reformation. Another scenario in this regard is the potential for a (temporary) compromise within Germany itself:  Martin Luther, professor, theologian, composer, priest, monk, anti-Semite, hater of the peasantry, and full blown religious radical. Had the Ottomans succeeded at Vienna, Martin very well could\u2019ve been welcomed back by the Church, at least temporarily, in an attempt to unite Protestant and Catholic forces against encroaching Ottoman forces. In 1529, Martin Luther had gone full blown radical in his attempts to really define the Protestant faith and had made enemies siding with the German princes against the peasantry during the Peasant\u2019s War. Despite this, Luther had shown a willingness to compromise with regard to the Real Presence and Hypostatic Union, two very important issues that defined the Church and Christianity as a whole. This at least shows that Luther was still able to compromise with the Church when it mattered most. Had the Ottomans taken Vienna, the fear of an Ottoman invasion would be very real and could potentially force Luther and the Church to reconcile temporarily to unify against the Ottomans. Charles V could put pressure on the Papacy to meet with Luther and his Protestant Princes in an attempt to form some type of union against the Ottomans as the Habsburg were at the forefront of Ottoman aggression and almost certainly would\u2019ve sold the house, the shop, and the kids to retain what they could. So we could see a compromise on a theological level smack dab in the middle of the Counter-Reformation, the impacts of which would change the world we know today had it actually occurred.  With regards to the Ottomans themselves, they would be opening a can of worms had they taken Vienna, their invasion of Hungary already sending shock waves throughout Europe. The powers that be in Europe had more than enough to gain in a united front against the Ottomans, Spain was already inching towards taking parts of North Africa, Germany was trying to keep itself stable during the Counter-Reformation, France, despite having somewhat friendly relations with the Ottomans, had substantial holdings in Italy and there was no discussion of just how things were to be divided if the Ottomans invaded the entirety of Italy. Suleiman would be kick starting an alliance against him if he pushed any further into continental Europe. His pivot to the Mediterranean was probably the best move he could\u2019ve made whether he had taken Vienna or not, France and Spain were busy duking it out in Italy, basically giving the Ottomans the entirety of the Mediterranean to have as their backyard, save for those pesky Venetians. I see only four immediate benefits to the success of the 1529 siege: The Habsburg, aka Charles V, are internationally humiliated as they had taken up the banner of stopping Ottoman aggression into Europe. This opens the door for more direct challenges to Habsburg supremacy and may force a faster dissolution of the empire.The Ottomans attain the mantle as the preeminent empire in Europe, winning their ideological conflict with the Habsburg, reducing their influence throughout Europe.The Protestant Princes in Germany gain immensely from the chaos that will arise out of the Habsburg losing Vienna, gaining more support for their cause.Hungary is effectively given to the Ottomans who have now pushed the Habsburg further into the interior of Europe and can no longer safely maintain Hungary. The rise of the Zapolyas will almost assuredly benefit the Ottomans in the long run. This is by far the biggest benefit.Aside from these benefits, the Ottomans are still overstretched to the point where their own military will be unable to hold their gains for very long. Like the Habsburgs, the success of the siege would most likely propel the Ottomans into a faster decline than they were on course for and led to a restructuring of the power bases throughout Europe and the Mediterranean.

            "answer_text": "Everyone on Quora makes such a big hype over the Siege of Vienna in 1683, mainly because of the epic charge of the Polish Hussars and how Tolkien based the Battle of Minas Tirith off the battle. What most people don\u2019t know is that had Vienna fallen in 1683, then at the very most the Austrian Empire wouldn\u2019t exist but the Ottomans had absolutely no chance of conquering any more major powers in Europe. By 1683, the Ottomans were already starting to show signs of stagnation and their empire would soon be doomed to one of the most slow and painful declines in world history. Vienna in 1529 held so much more importance to world history, because in 1529, the Ottoman Empire was at its zenith. It had squashed the Bulgarians, Serbs, Byzantines, Romanians and finally the Hungarians by 1529. The seemingly unstoppable tide of Islam had much of Europe, especially the Austrians in Vienna, panicking. They were led by none other than the greatest Ottoman Sultan, a brilliant tactician and conqueror, Suleiman the Magnificent. The stakes were never higher. In 1683, Christian Europe had the strength and unity to easily crush any further Islamic incursion had the Ottomans conquered Vienna and gotten further. In 1529, this was far from the case. Christian Europe was divided and fragmented by the ongoing Reformation, which was basically a Christian Civil War. Protestants and Catholics had begun their disputes a little more than a decade before the Ottomans reached Vienna and some of their disputes had turned violently this early into the conflict. Had Vienna, the seat of Habsburg power in Germany fallen, the Habsburgs would have probably disintegrated and Christian Europe might not have the unity to mount a counter-offensive, a crusade per se, to drive the Turks out.  Ottoman artistic representation of the Siege of Vienna in 1529. Plus the Ottomans had some strong allies during this era. Suleiman the Magnificent sought to recreate the Roman Empire, for he and his fellow Ottoman Sultans viewed themselves as the \u201crightful heirs of Caesar\u201d when they conquered Constantinople. Plus Venice, their major opponent in the Mediterranean, was situated in Northern Italy. The French King, Francis I, had formed an alliance with Suleiman and was indifferent to Germanic Christian kingdoms falling to the Ottomans as long as it strengthened the French position. The Ottoman juggernaut was no joke like it later would be. At Vienna, the Ottomans roughly outnumbered the Austrian garrison some 6\u20131, whereas a century and a half later the Ottomans would only slightly outnumber the entire Christian coalition force. While the Ottomans were very overstretched, with their supply lines literally pushed to the limit, they still possessed a highly trained, formidable force of Janissaries (Christian slave soldiers) and massive numbers of conscripts. They could have realistically taken the city if their Sultan had tried different tactics and made a far more determined effort to seize the city.  Ottoman Empire\u2019s expansion from the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 to the end of Suleiman\u2019s reign. So what if Vienna fell in 1529? First and foremost, the Ottomans wipe out their would be vanquishers, the Habsburg Dynasty. Emperor Charles V would face immense international humiliation and anger had he let Vienna, one of the crown jewels of the Habsburg Empire and valued European city fall to the Islamic hordes led by Suleiman. Panic would spread like wild fire throughout Christendom, especially in the Holy Roman Empire and Italy, as the largest German city and the Southern Gate into the HRE has fallen to the Turks. The destruction of Habsburg Power leaves no major opponent left against the Ottoman Powers directly to their Northwest due to the disunited status of the principalities that dominated the Holy Roman Empire. It is certainly possible that they would form a coalition to stop any further Ottoman aggression, but it is unlikely that they could maintain the cohesion necessary to check the Ottomans in that direction. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is our best bet, due to the fact that they are a relatively young but powerful status.  Alternate history map of Europe mere decades after the Fall of Vienna, circa 1550 In our timeline, the Habsburgs and the Ottomans effectively seesawed from Vienna, the edges of the Germanic states, to Budapest, the Hungarian interior. Instead, with a power vacuum leaving no major European power to oppose them to the West, the Ottomans solidify their rule in Hungary and Austrian Germany instead becomes the new battleground between the Christian Germanic Principalities and the Islamic Ottoman Empire. Venice might be far more willing to compromise and make peace with the Turks, especially since there is no Habsburg Empire left to defend their flank. The Ottoman-French Alliance will be far more powerful, as the Holy Roman Empire will be forced to go defensive against the Franco-Ottoman invasion forces. Italy might end up with some of its lands falling to the Ottomans. Franco-Ottoman alliance - Wikipedia So whose left to stop the Ottomans? As I pointed out, the Poles will probably be the only realistic choice left. Spain-Portugal-England are too focused on fighting France and the HRE is too weakened. The Italian states are too disunited and small. Russia hasn't even become a middle power yet. The Commonwealth is Europe\u2019s only remaining check against the Turks but fortunately the Turks are in no position to invade Poland by this point in history. Another good answer is here is this, answered a year earlier. Cameron Greene's answer to What if the Ottoman Empire won the battle of Vienna in 1529? Anyway to the conclusions, since Vienna\u2019s fall sends shockwaves throughout Christian Europe, what does this mean for the future? Habsburg power is effectively crushed, leaving behind a massive power vacuum in Germany that does not benefit Germany at all against Ottoman aggression in the first few decades after Vienna fell.Polish-Lithuania will have to take up the mantle of tackling Turkish aggression. We might see them aggressively expanding southwards to prevent any further Ottoman conquests and hell, if they are very succesful they\u2019ll be the ones liberating Bohemia, Hungary, northern Romania, etc.Ottoman advances into Europe are still checked for the most part. While they are extremely powerful, they struggle with power projection. The logistical strain of pushing a hundred thousand troops from the Turkish heartland to Austria is very difficult. They might be able to exploit religious/internal divisions and take over some minor Italian and Germanic states, but they\u2019ll be hard pressed to pull off another major offensive victory like they did at Vienna.The Christian Coalition will eventually form against the Ottomans, perhaps say the late 1500s and liberate Vienna before the end of the century. The Holy Roman Empire, the Italian Republics, the Spanish Empire and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth will all try to exploit Turkish weakness and try to destroy the Ottomans. They will probably be aided by Hungarian rebels and the Persians to the East.Most importantly for this question, the Reformation is much altered by Islamic aggression. Let\u2019s remember that Christendom has always feared the Crescent, hell the first thing published on the Gutenberg Press (first European Printing Press) was I believe something about Islamic aggression towards the Christian Byzantine Empire. Europe will enter full blown panic, with only the French not seriously considering mounting a crusade to drive back the Turks. Martin Luther was very much anti-Islamic, anti-Ottoman and despite his grievances with the Catholic Church, would be very much willing to compromise with the far lesser evil and unite Europe against the Islamic incursion. I\u2019m sure the Papacy would also be willing to compromise and concede on some issues to protect Christian Europe from the Turks. Martin Luther, father of the Protestant Church, might have ended up reforming Catholicism rather than trying to destroy it. It\u2019s entirely possible that Protestantism might not exist at all, or maybe the religious wars of the 1500s and 1600s between Protestants and Catholics would never occur at all or be delayed by decades.
