            "answer_text": "The \u2018average\u2019 look of a Hungarian might be hard to pin down, since Hungary is a very diverse nation ethnically. Located in Central Europe, over the last millennium Hungary has seen its fair share of migration and blending of different nations and ethnicities. As a result pretty much any European phenotype can be found in Hungary, so the \u2018average\u2019 Hungarian might look as blonde and blue eyed as a Swede, or might look dark enough to pass as a Turk. I googled some pictures of people of note from Hungary (actors, athletes, some ordinary folks), so get ready for a lot of visual data: Andr\u00e1s Csonka (actor)  Zolt\u00e1n Bereczki (actor)  Zolt\u00e1n Hujber (actor)  Erika Marozs\u00e1n (actor)  P\u00e9ter Rudolf (actor)  Eszter F\u00f6ldes (actor)  Dorka Gryllus (actor)  Gy\u0151z\u0151 Szab\u00f3 (actor)  D\u00e9nes Sz\u00e1raz (actor)  K\u00e1roly Eperjes (actor)  Laura Cserpes (singer)  Enik\u0151 Mihalik (model)  Barbara Palvin (model)  Katinka Hossz\u00fa (swimmer)  Bogl\u00e1rka Kap\u00e1s (swimmer)  \u00c1d\u00e1m Lang (footballer)  \u00c1d\u00e1m Pint\u00e9r (footballer)  Bal\u00e1zs Dzsudzs\u00e1k (footballer)  Attila Fiola (footballer)  \u00c1d\u00e1m Szalai (footballer)  Some people in folk costumes  Finally, a video of children singing:  Hopefully this will help you get an accurate enough idea. All in all, I\u2019d say we look like most Europeans and nothing out of the ordinary. ",

There are traces of small traditional ethnic groups who have specific traits (such as J\u00e1sz and Maty\u00f3 people) but it's only evident if you know what to look for (\"he looks like a J\u00e1sz\"), and it mostly just falls into \"generic white people\" for an outsider (I say \"traces\" because only a few people have J\u00e1sz or Maty\u00f3 identities). There are also present ethnic groups with different traits, such as gypsies (with most people also having it as an identity). They might be the source of your initial image, because they fit the description. ",
