            "answer_text": "I could be here all day giving you a college lecture about where Nazi racial ideology stems from, but to keep matters simple, when the Nazis were rising to power, they needed a scapegoat, and who better than the centuries long scapegoat in Europe, the Jewish people. Combine that from scientific racial theories developed in the 19th century and eugenics, and you have the recipe for Nazi ideology. Long before the Nazis rose to power, there were many German nationalists who talked about the Jewish people not just as a religious group, but a completely separate racial group in the 19th century. Because remember, throughout the Middle Ages Jews were hated on because they refused Christianity, but during this time the hatred shifted from theological to mostly racial. Jews were still seen as Jews even if they were to be baptized or integrated to European culture. I remember one document we read in high school, I forgot what it was, but it was a short essay essentially saw Jews as an \u201cother\u201d. They believed that Jewish people were not native to Germany or Europe, the Jews were foreigners from another land who lived amongst themselves for centuries, so they could not be classified as German peoples. During the time of this document\u2019s creation, there were other other anti-semitic hoaxes that spread across Europe like how they owned all the banks and businesses in Europe, this furthered the hatred for Jews. They found it unfair that these people got to enjoy more social mobility as many Jews were doing very well in business, law, and politics during this time, but everyone else did not like that. This developed the idea of the \u201cJews secretly control the world\u201d stereotype. During this time other theories of \u201cgenetic\u201d and \u201cracial\u201d hygiene also developed, which led to the rise of eugenics, which were slowly being applied to Jewish people as an inferior people who were compatible to live with pure Aryan Europeans. This idea was carried on overtime into the 1900\u201310\u2019s. During this time the mayor in the city of Vienna was spewing these ideologies, and we all know a peculiar person who was living in Vienna, good old Adolf, who began getting a lot of his ideas from the anti-Semitism that was happening in Vienna at the time. Then WWI happened. Germany lost and someone was to blame for this, and we all knew the obvious answer of why they lost according to our friend Hitler, he began spreading these ideas again when he joined a small group of people called the NDSP and the rest is history.

            "answer_text": "The Nazis didn't hate Jews from the start. After some time, they saw it as a very good means to unite the people, and also a way to control the people, because not all Germans were Nazis. Hitler used it very efficiently to unite the people, and also to draw attention to himself from the entire world, and so they discovered that hating Jews helps them. Also, they saw Jews as their competitors, because they thought that the Jews wanted to rule the world, and the Nazis also wanted to rule the world. On the other hand, they saw how Jews dominated science, philosophy and finance for thousands of years, and the Nazis also wanted to build their one-thousand-year Reich, and saw the Jews as people who have succeeded at it, and so it was as if their turn, to make eternal Nazi history in the world. Therefore, they hated and aimed to destroy the Jews, which eventually led to the Holocaust. Video: Why Did the Nazis Hate the Jews?  Video: Was Hitler an Anti-Semite?

            "answer_text": "Never having known a Jew myself, its hard to say. But I do know that Hitler had a damaged childhood with his cruel & brutal father. No doubt from childhood onwards, young Adolf was a bitter, angry young man, scarred for life by the traumas of his childhood. Its been said that all through his adult life, Hitler was a hate filled man. Even his years of phenomenal success had not placated the anger & hatreds within him. One of Hitlers well known character traits was his compulsion to find \u201cscapegoats\u201d for everything that goes wrong. My guess is that he came across a few Jews who upset him during his young manhood days, and then decided, from that point onwards, to blame Jews for everything wrong in the world, and that this hatred soon developed into a paranoid conspiracy theory of world wide proportions.
