            "answer_text": "This answer deals primarily with European cuisine. Foods that originated in the New World would be missing from the medieval diet. These include artichokes, avocados, beans (kidney and lima), black walnuts, blueberries, cacao (cocoa/chocolate), cashews, cassava, chestnuts, corn (maize), crab apples, cranberries, gourds, hickory nuts, papayas, peanuts, pecans, peppers (bell peppers, chili peppers), pineapples, potatoes, pumpkins, squash, sunflowers, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, turkey, vanilla, and wild rice. Meats would have a different flavor\u2014not because the meat was rotten, but because of the way the animals were fed and raised. For example, raising cattle on grass produces a gamier, more intensely flavored, less sweet meat than commercial beef. The whole animal would have been used, so there would have been many more offal dishes than one tends to find nowadays. Blood would have been used for puddings and sausages. Common people would have had access to chicken and other fowl, pork, and mutton. Beef was less common, and game would have been reserved for nobility. Seafood would have been a staple of people living along the coast. Herring and cod were preserved and exported, sometimes hundreds or thousands of miles. River fishes would be served inland. Cereals include many that we know today\u2014barley, rye, oats, and wheat, and later rice. These were prepared in ways we\u2019d recognize today, as bread, porridge, and pasta, and as ingredients in stews and soups. Seasonings that we take for granted were expensive and would be used for special occasions by those who could afford them. These included black pepper, cinnamon, cumin, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. Spices that we don\u2019t use much anymore include grains of paradise, mace, spikenard, and others. Sugar was treated as a spice; honey was more commonly used as a sweetener. Herbs were widely used for flavoring; these include such herbs as sage, mustard, parsley, caraway, mint, dill, fennel, and anise. Preserved foods would have been salted, brined, smoked, dried, pickled, fermented, or packed in sugar or fat. Salt was widely used as a flavoring and preservative. Pure, fine, white salt was expensive, while coarse salts with impurities were for the less well off. This has been reversed in modern times, with sea salt, coarse-ground salt, and colored salts commanding relatively high prices. Milk was not often consumed by adults, but butter and cheese were common. Drink included water, juices plain and fermented, wine, and beer. Mead was popular also, but is now a bit of an oddity. Vinegar and other tart liquids were combined with sweeter flavors and with spices and herbs to impart a sweet-and-sour character to many recipes. Almonds were very popular and were used in a variety of ways. Almond milk, made by grinding sweet almonds and mixing with water, was a common coking ingredient. Marzipan was used for desert. Medieval cookbooks include a lot of dishes in crusts. They tended to combine sweet and savory ingredients more than we do nowadays; for instance, pork and apples would be combined into a pie (it tastes quite good). Meats might be baked en croute, like modern Beef Wellington. Many medieval desserts would be recognizable today. Sponge cakes, custards and puddings, fritters, waffles, wafers, candied seeds and spices, fruit in sugar or honey, tarts, even sorbets and cannoli would grace the tables of the wealthy. An ingredient that we don\u2019t see much of nowadays are flowers, such as roses, elderflowers, and violets, candied or used as flavorings. It\u2019s a shame\u2014candied flower petals are delicious. It\u2019s worth trying to make some, if you can get pesticide free flowers. Chocolate was unknown. Contrary to stereotype, medieval people did not just throw food on a plate, especially not at a feast. Medieval Times gets this very wrong (which is okay\u2014it\u2019s really a horse show). Nobles hired professional cooks who took pride in their ability to put on a show. Presentation was everything. Dishes were brought in with great ceremony in elaborate presentations. For instance, a fowl would be stuffed into a larger fowl, into a larger fowl, into a larger fowl, which might them be stuffed into its skin. A dish (often inedible) called a subtlety or soteltie might be presented for its entertainment value. These might include elaborate models or live birds hidden in a crust (try that at dinner now)! Often, medieval food was eaten off a flat round of hard-crusted bread called a trencher. It would soak up juices from the food placed on it. After the meal, the trencher could be eaten, or it could be distributed to servants or the poor. The modern equivalent would perhaps be the bread bowl sometimes used to serve soup. ",

            "answer_text": "You'll get a lot of good answers on this. This one isn't one, but, it hits a main point that will otherwise be ignored.The main thing is\"Surprisingly Few foods are different\". There's not a bit of clothes, housing, entertainment that isn't drastically changed from 200 years ago. But food doesn't change so much. The main James Beard awards this year would have been entirely at home in the middle ages.Biggest difference is the difference between the royalty and the non-royalty food in the middle ages. Again, the James Beard winners were often trying for (and not succeeding) at being \"backyard grill\". Low class people. Grains (beer as main source of hydration), root vegetables, some cheese, some eggs, not much meat.Royalty a lot more meat, Mediterranean produce in season like oranges.And don't forget no new world products no peanuts, tomato, chili, corn, etc ",
