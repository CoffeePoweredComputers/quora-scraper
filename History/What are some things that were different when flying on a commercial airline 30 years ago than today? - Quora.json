            "answer_text": "Many things have changed, some for the better, others for the worse. My first ever trip by air was 47 years ago (I was 4 years old but can vividly remember many things from that first experience flying) but I will relate mostly to the experiences from the mid-eighties which I can remember with much more details. Aircraft technology Back in the 80s most flights were operated by aircraft types no longer in service like the Boeing 727, 737 (classic), 757 and even some in 747 airplanes, Airbus A300 (A320 was not born yet), DC-10, DC-9, MD-80, L1011 and some others I can\u2019t recall now. The smaller 727, DC-9 and MD-80 had low bypass turbofan engines which were very noisy compared to today\u2019s high-bypass turbofans. But they were tail-mounted so the noise in the cabin was not that bad compared to modern aircraft types. They also had seats that were more comfortable because airlines could afford to have a few less rows per airplane which not only allowed more leg room but also seatback padding was also bigger. Other than that, the inside of airplanes back then was a lot like today\u2019s airplanes. Newer airplanes make better use of overhead bin space and take advantage of newer technologies like LED lighting. In-flight entertainment\u2026.. hmmm what is that? \ud83e\udd14 In my first ever flight I don\u2019t recall any type of in-flight entertainment. But in the flights I had later they had projection screens in the bulkheads between cabin sections where a projector dropped from the ceiling to show a movie. Not sure if they were already video projectors back then or if they had an actual film. Not all aircraft types and not all airlines had them. Newer (at the time) aircraft like the 757 were beginning to use CRT screens every few rows that were stowed above the seats when not in use and dropped down for viewing a movie. Same movie for everyone, no selection. And to get audio you needed to rent a special headseat that plugged into the seat arm rest. Some airlines offered them for free in some flights. You could not use your own headset from home because they used some form of acoustic system, sort of like a stethoscope but having a tiny speaker hidden inside the arm rest. Your could put your ear to the port where the headseat was connected and hear the audio from the movie. The CRT screens were later replaced by modern LCD screens in the early 2000s. Interactive in-flight entertainment systems with multiple movies on demand, TV channels, music and games are a child of the 2010s. So back then people brought books (the paper variety), magazines, games, or simply took the opportunity to fully disconnect and enjoy the flight. Food!!! That chicken or pasta clich\u00e9 from the past was actually true. This food tray was from a flight I took in 2011, long after the time period we are talking about but it is about what you would find in your seat tray back then. This was a long-haul overnight flight and the reason why the food was so good compared to today\u2019s snacks and this was in coach. I once took the same flight in business class (a business trip) on the same aircraft type and same airline and they had an \u00e0 la carte menu complete with a selection of wines, cloth napkins and real silverware. But my work place paid 10 times as much as the other flight I made in coach on my dime.  Compare to a snack you would find on a jetBlue flight today in flights that offer them. They don\u2019t offer any snacks at all on flights shorter than 1 hour. Image from Google.  Security at the airport This is one of the biggest changes but it depends a lot on what country you are and even on the airport. In the US back in the 80s many airports allowed non-passengers to enter the terminal areas all the way to the gates. You could go wait for your loved ones arriving or say your goodbyes right at the gate. You had to go through security anyway but it was not nearly as strict as it is today. You did not have to show a boarding pass. You only went through a metal detector portal (similar to the ones in use today) and any hand bags needed to go through x-ray machines (bye bye undeveloped film) but they were not nearly as strict as today. This all changed after the 1993 terrorist attack in Oklahoma City. Many airports (still some do) allowed anyone to enter the baggage claim area and were not restricted to non-passengers. I have to make exception here in that airports in Puerto Rico (where I live) were more secure that their mainland US counterparts since terminals and baggage claim areas have been off-limits to non-passengers long before US airports started doing it. In the 80s you could not get to the gates in the airport in Puerto Rico if you did not have a boarding pass. Airplanes were secured but not nearly as much as they are now. The cockpit door was not secured like it is now. Food service had actual metal silverware. Something that went away after the 9/11 attacks. Having an undercover air marshal was probably not a thing and probably very few flights had them. I think that all flights have one now and you never know who they may be. I was on a flight a few years ago that had to divert due to an unruly passenger and someone in plain clothes got up to intervene. I think he was an air marshal. The experience at the gate back then was about the same as it is now. Most airports already had jet bridges back then so you no longer need to walk out in the open. Of course it depends on aircraft type and specific airport, just like now. They had the counter with the agent handling last minute changes, printing boarding passes, dealing with standby passengers (I was one of those once) and dealing with overbooked flights (more common back then). The main difference is they did not have barcode scanners back then, even less the ability to use your cell phone (which nobody had) as boarding pass. You handed the printed boarding pass, they ripped off the stub which they returned to you and kept the other part. If you lost or misplaced your boarding pass you were screwed if you could not get a reprint on time. Which then brings me to the last part I am going to compare. Booking a plane ticket You had to go to a real travel agent to book your flight or in the best of cases you could do it over the phone. I think you could call directly the airline to book a flight but I would guess you needed to pick your paper ticket at the counter in the airport. After you purchased your ticket, you got a paper ticket which you needed to have in order to fly. You went to the counter at the airport to check-in, get your boarding pass and hand over your checked baggage. You were not charged extra for extra bags and it was not unusual for some people to have 2 or 3 pieces of luggage. There was no check-in online from your home or your cell phone ahead of time. Some travel agents provided you a printed boarding pass but in my experience, the counter agent tossed it and gave you a new one not necessarily in the same seat you wanted. And there was no self-service kiosks at the counter area that allowed you to do check-in and identification process yourself and even affix the baggage tags. Next thing airlines will do to save money will be to make you put your bags into the cargo hold yourself. \ud83d\ude12 Back then if you lost your paper ticket or left it at home on the way to the airport you were royally screwed. You could get a reprint of your ticket but the airline would charge you for it. And before I forget, the travel agent or the airline counter agent asked if you wanted a seat in the smoking or non-smoking section. \ud83d\udeac People were allowed to smoke inside airplanes in specific rows at the back and during some stages of flight. Airplanes, even modern aircraft types, still have the \u201cnon-smoking\u201d indicator which never turns off, even in aircraft built after smoking was banned. ",

            "answer_text": "The most stark difference of all was the Eastern Shuttle, which ran hourly between New York\u2019s La Guardia and Washington National, as well as hourly between La Guardia and Boston Logan. From 7 am to 9 pm the jets left every hour on the hour and you did not need a reservation and no one knew your name. All you had to do was run through the jetway door by the stroke of the hour. And, you were guaranteed a seat! So, if you arrived one minute before the hour and the jet at the gate was full, Eastern would fly you ALONE on a backup jet. I have done that. I have flown with only one passenger. THINK OF THE TOTAL LACK OF SECURITY We did not know the names of the passengers. We did not scan their carry-on luggage. When the door closed, we had no idea who was on board or what they were carrying. We had ZERO problems. Imagine today pulling up in front of an airport two minutes before departure time, running to the gate\u2014which was strategically located close to the front door to facilitate \u201crunners\u201d\u2014and running through the jetway door at the exact departure time with a carry-on bag and a briefcase. And no one asks your name nor checks nor even asks what is in your carry-on items!! And you had no made a reservation. And you had not paid. And we didn\u2019t even know if you had the means to pay. TRUSTING THAT YOU COULD PAY During the flight, there was no service. I suppose that if you told a flight attendant you had a severe headache and you desperately needed a drink of water to wash down some pain relief\u2014well, I guess they\u2019d have brought you a cup of airplane water. You\u2019d have to have a really bad headache to drink what came out of an infested aircraft water tank! But some did. Right at level-off, the flight attendants pulled out their carts, which had credit card machines and a supply of the old-fashioned carbon, credit card slips. When they reached you, there were four options: CashCredit cardCheckDon\u2019t pay because you \u201cforgot\u201d to bring any means to payIf you used cash, then no one ever knew your name and there was no record that you ever made that trip. Do you think the Shuttle might have been used a few times for some nefarious trips? Maybe drug deals? People had a bag that no one had looked at and wouldn\u2019t check and no one knew your name? Go figure! If you used a credit card, they ran it through the carbon machine, you signed it, and that was that. If you paid by check, they brought it to the cockpit and the flight engineer would call the company and verify your ID. If the check validation didn\u2019t clear or if you chose option #4, then when you stepped off the plane you\u2019d be met by a couple of Federal agents. It was amazing that almost every single person who chose option #4 suddenly recalled during their meeting with the Feds that they did, actually, have some money but they had forgotten. Maybe in their shoe. Maybe in their underwear. They\u2019d pay and that would be that. Rarely, however, they had no money and would just laugh. Seriously, people would laugh and say something like, \u201cWhat are you going to do? I\u2019ve already made the trip!\u201d Sometimes it was a very young person who just wanted a joyride and, believe this or not, the agents would stay there and we would fly them back home. Honestly, that happened. Many kids got free roundtrip joyrides on a jet. But if they were older and the vibe was that they were out to fleece the airline, then they departed the area in handcuffs in the excellent care of a couple of nice Federal agents. At that point, I assume, their identity and the contents of any carry-on items quickly became known. ",
