            "answer_text": "Should European countries such as Bulgaria, Greece and Romania forgive the Ottoman Empire for colonising them? Or are you overlooking the fact that atrocities such as the Greek genocide were perpetrated by non-White countries? As sad as the truth may be. Countries have always conquered, exploited and committed heinous acts on other countries\u2019 people. This is in no way justification for the horrors perpetrated by the British and French Empires. Atrocities perpetrated by the British Empire e.g. the Amritsar Massacre, Bengal Famine and British concentration camps for South Africans during the Boer War were horrific. The same goes for atrocities perpetrated by the French Empire. What one has to understand though is that these things have always happened. Europeans were not excluded from these things. European countries have been invaded and occupied too. Ottoman invasions of the Balkans and Islamic invasions of the Iberian Peninsula etc. Europeans have also invaded themselves as well. In fact the British ruled France during the Hundred Year War, Joan of Arc had to force us out. So in conclusion, yes I very much think former colonies of the UK and France should forgive us. In fact I think all countries should forgive their former colonial masters provided a formal and complete apology is given as well as relevant/appropriate reparations are paid. Unfortunately this is not the case despite Britain and France meeting the two aforementioned criteria. Both Britain and France have extensively made formal apologies over the last few decade and they have also paid copious amounts in foreign aid for the last few decades too. Deep wounds are still felt in former colonised countries. It is not just former colonies of European countries which haven\u2019t totally forgiven their former rulers. Even in Korea and China (colonised by non-White country) a lot of people haven\u2019t forgiven Japan for their actions prior and during World War Two. Unfortunately anti-Japanese sentiment is still commonplace in those countries. I really wish that we could all forgive each other for previous events. There would be a lot less contempt and conflict in the world if we could forgive each other. ",

            "answer_text": "You question is in several parts and inaccurate. First part. Should former colonies forgive Britain and France. It has been so long ago that it is water under the bridge. However the issue of compensation has nothing to do with it. Both Britain and France as well as all colonizing nations are what they are today, from the wealth aquired from the colonies. You took something by force. You have to pay for it. We know it will never happen. It would collapse the economies of these nations. Is United Kingdom and France responsible for the actions of their colonial past? Yes. The courts say they are. Britain to compensate Kenyans for colonial-era torture Another thing is the amount of control they have in there governments and affairs of their former colonies. They still had not left and still trying to control. This is what people from the colonies are against. The neo colonisation. For example. When were two NATO countries in a proxy war with each other? One even taking sides with the USSR? Yes it did happen. Nigerian Civil War - Wikipedia look at the list of who was backing whom and it would shock you. Britain vs France. With France backing Biafra which borders their old colony of Cameroon. There fighting for territory never ended with independent. Whoever won would control the Nigerian oilfields . USSR,UK and enemies vs France, Israel and enemies. Neo colonialism at it's best. Even their alliances did not stop the grab for oil. Second part. Given that they have played in saving every country been overrun by Axis powers (and then by USSR) Here is where it is inaccurate. First of all. The USSR played a leading role in the defeat of Nazi Germany, a bigger role than most colonists. So using your sense, it was the USSR mostly saving the colonies from the Axis. In what way do you think that the way the Germans or Italians treated their colonies was worse off than the way the British and the French treated theirs? Will give in my opinion the worst as example. Belgium fought with the allies. This is what they did to the Congo 10 Horrifying Facts About The Genocide In The Congo Free State - Listverse . The life of the African in what is now Namibia was not worse than the life in Kenya. (See above) Yet People were taken from the colonies , often by force to fight other colonial masters and colonies. In a war that had nothing to do with them. If Axis won. The life in most colonies would not have changed. BTW it is the colonial countries that should be grateful to the colonies for helping them win the war with resources and man power. Then by the USSR? The USSR played a major role both directly and indirectly in the decolonisation of Asia and Africa. It funded every struggle for independent in these countries. So it was USSR that saved the colonies from France and Britain and not the other way round. Let me remind you. Nelson Mandela was called a freedom fighter and the ANC was backed by the USSR for decades before it became cool. During that time Britain and the U.S. called him a terrorist and helped in the hunt for ANC. ",
