            "answer_text": "Antisemitism is nothing if not a complex topic. Discussing why it exists is therefore going to take a while (this answer is pushing about 7000 words), and there\u2019s no simple answer. However, boiling it down to its crux: people hate Jews because they choose to do so. A slightly longer answer can be found by skipping down to Part VII, but for the full historical context, well, you don\u2019t have to read this all at once. Part I: Judaism and Christianity There are, in general, two ways of how people hate Jews. The older of the two ways is hatred of Judaism, which is to say, hatred of the people due to their religion. Scholarship usually refers to this as \u201canti-Judaism,\u201d although the term \u201creligious antisemitism\u201d also pops up in literature. At most, anti-Judaism goes back about two-and-a-half millennia, mostly because Judaism itself \u2014 or at least, Judaism in a form recognizable to modern-day Jews \u2014 only really came to be in an Exilic[1] and post-Exilic context. One can also make an argument that, insofar as modern Judaism is descended exclusively from Pharisaism during the Second Temple Era, anti-Judaism can only date back about two thousand years. Anti-Judaism predates Christianity. The works of Josephus, a first century Jewish general and historian, include Against Apion, a critique and refutation of an anti-Jewish text by a Greek pagan named, unsurprisingly, Apion. However, it was generally not a significant force during that time, with most negative feelings towards Jews being political in nature, resenting the Jewish state that existed at the time, the Hasmonean Kingdom. Even during subsequent Roman rule, anti-Judaism was a weak force: Judaism and the Roman state cult may have been incompatible, but participation in the Roman state cult was only desired by the Romans insofar as it demonstrated loyalty to Rome, and so long as the Jews proved themselves loyal in other ways, Rome generally did not care about the difference in religion. The reason anti-Judaism came to be as powerful as it was \u2014 and to a lesser extent is \u2014 was not actually external to Judaism, but rather, internal to it. In the first century, a small apocalyptic cult-cum-reform movement centered around a Nazarene itinerant preacher started gaining traction within Judaism. At the time, this wasn\u2019t a particularly interesting development, because apocalyptic cults were actually quite common during the Second Temple period. The interaction between the adherents of the new branch and the various other sects of Judaism at the time was generally, and unsurprisingly, hostile. We frequently see this sort of thing in world history. As an example, the Protestant Reformation saw Protestants and Catholics declaring each other servants of the devil. Thus, it\u2019s unsurprising that even the holy texts of Christianity, composed when it was still a Jewish sect, contain some fairly obvious potshots at mainstream Judaism. In particular, when we look at the Gospel of Matthew, the text refers to Jews as Israelites until the crucifixion, at which point they are referred to as Judah-ites. This difference in naming is important: the name \u201cIsrael\u201d was given to the patriarch Jacob by a messenger of the Almighty, and therefore symbolizes the special relationship between Jews and the Almighty. By stripping the Jews of the name Israelite, therefore, the author of Matthew was stating that, in taking the responsibility for crucifying Jesus,[2] the Jews had abandoned their relationship with the Almighty. Putting it more simply, the author of Matthew states that mainstream Judaism is not true Judaism, and that only Judeo-Christianity counts as such. This being said, it would be difficult to claim the author of Matthew to have been anti-Jewish, as he was himself Jewish \u2014 we don\u2019t claim Martin Luther to have been anti-Christian for having written scathingly about the Catholic Church in the sixteenth century. The author of Matthew was scathingly anti-Pharisee \u2014 as were the authors of Mark, Luke, and John \u2014 but not anti-Jewish. Within two centuries, however, the differences between \u201cPharisee\u201d and \u201cJew\u201d had essentially disappeared,[3] with Pharisaic Judaism being the only surviving sect of Judaism from the Second Temple Era. Thus, texts written in the context of an intra-religious feud were now considered holy by a separate religion, and the intra-religious feud morphed into an inter-religious feud. This was not a battle Judaism could win. Pharisaic Judaism \u2014 now called \u201cRabbinic Judaism\u201d or just plain \u201cJudaism\u201d \u2014 required adherence to both the Written Law (the Torah) and the Oral Law (what would subsequently be compiled into the Talmud). Judeo-Christianity also required this adherence in the early stages, with Jesus and the people who knew him being observant Jews. However, the Apostle Paul began a push within Judeo-Christianity to reject the Law, or at least, aspects of it. This position made evangelism among gentiles significantly easier.[4] The result of this was that Christianity grew in a way that Judaism could not. However, rejection of the Law and the growth of Christianity through conversion precipitated massive changes within Christianity. Certainly rejecting the Law led to differences in practice between Rabbinic Jews and Judeo-Christians, but the religious rationale for such a rejection also essentially mandated theological differences to arise. Additionally, without the Law existing to enforce some sort of Overton Window of theology, the new converts changed Christianity significantly on their own. St. Augustine of Hippo, for example, introduced elements of Neoplatonism and Manichaeism that would almost certainly have been rejected in Judaism, but proved foundational to Christianity. By the time of Emperor Constantine I, Christianity was clearly a separate religion from Judaism,[5] and a far more popular one. However, the legacy of internecine fighting within Judaism remained, and would continue to have a significant impact on Jewish-Christian relations for centuries to come. Part II: Judaism and Islam Anti-Jewish sentiment during the Early Middle Ages was a largely disorganized affair. This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, as virtually all entities during the Early Middle Ages (500\u20131000) were highly decentralized, with the dominant political system being feudalism. In the Byzantine Empire, the integration of Church and State meant there were discriminatory laws on the books, although persecution of Jews tended to be rather less severe than persecution of other groups, such as the Manichaeans. Instead, it\u2019s more interesting during this time to look at another Abrahamic religion\u2019s relationship to Judaism. Judaism had a significant presence in the Hejaz, particularly in the city of Yathrib,[6] starting from the Second Century. There were also Christians present in the region, and as one would expect, the two groups didn\u2019t get along. Another important player in the region was the pagan religion native to it. Starting in 610, a man named Muhammad, who lived in Mecca, began preaching a new religion. Thanks to his teachings not being written down and compiled until after his death, we don\u2019t know exactly what he preached,[7] but it certainly bears non-incidental resemblances to both Judaism and Christianity \u2014 and a few grabs from local paganism.[8] Like what had happened with Jesus some six hundred years earlier, the local authorities did not much care for the disruption in the social order \u2014 unlike what happened to Jesus, Muhammad fled rather than die. Specifically, in 622, he and his followers ran to the city of Yathrib.[9] Muhammad\u2019s early position towards both Jews and Christians was one of respect. However, he was not met with any particular warmth or respect, and most Jews remained Jews.[10] His attitude toward both Jews and Christians therefore hardened, and eventually culminated in open warfare between Jews and Muslims in the city, as well as forced conversions to Islam following the military defeat of the Jews.[11] This being said, most of early Islam\u2019s antipathy towards the Jews appears to have been rather weaker than Christianity\u2019s. Islamic empires would subsequently lump Jews and Christians into the category of dhimmi \u2014 second-class citizens responsible for paying a tax called the jizya \u2014 but most Islamic empires were otherwise tolerant of their Jews, and generally spent far less time and effort in degrading them than Christian societies did. This being said, second-class citizens often engender feelings of contempt in the first-class citizens, and these feelings had centuries to harden. Discussing anti-Judaism in any other context besides a Christian or Muslim one really isn\u2019t all that interesting. The overwhelming majority of Jewish people lived either among Jews or among Christians, and those who forged communities elsewhere \u2014 most notably India and China \u2014 experienced little to no hatred from the surrounding society. Part III: Anti-Judaism\u2019s Horrific Peak In general, documentation from the Early Middle Ages is scarce, hence the epoch\u2019s former name of \u201cthe Dark Ages.\u201d The era was one of great decentralization, with local warlords exercising most of the power, and weak trade networks. What this means is that, for the most part, displays of hatred of Jews were, as much as they could be, banal: the structures in place disadvantaged Jews, but virtually all incidents were small, contained, and unremarkable. However, the decentralized state of affairs started shifting in the 800\u2019s, and by the year 1095, France, England, and the Holy Roman Empire were certainly in the process of consolidating power, and feudalism was generally in decline. However, the centralization of power required vast sums of money, and frequently more than tax income alone could provide.[12] Modern states and institutions use bonds and other similar securities for a quick infusion of money. However, a thousand years ago, there was neither a bond market nor any conception of securitization of debt. What these kingdoms, baronies, monasteries, bishoprics, et cetera, required was a moneylender. However, Christianity at the time strictly forbade charging interest on loans, and Christians at the time did not find ways of skirting that law as Muslims did with regards to Islam\u2019s strict prohibition on charging interest.[13] Of course, nobody was about to loan thousands of marks without the potential for profit, as that would constitute significant risk without any, let alone commensurate, reward. Had Europe been strictly Christian, feudalism would have taken much longer to die than it actually did. However, because Judaism does not forbid its adherents for charging interest on loans to gentiles, Western Europe had a viable lending system. To be clear, most people had little-to-no interaction with Jewish moneylenders. The peasantry would have had no need of it \u2014 the home mortgage didn\u2019t yet exist, and small businesses were \u201cyou work on a farm, keep working on the farm.\u201d However, aristocrats and churchmen did interact with the Jews so as to secure otherwise unavailable loans. The potential for profit here was gigantic, to the point that the richest man in twelfth century England was Aaron of Lincoln, who, at his death in the late twelfth century, was owed no less than \u00a315,000.[14] He was not the only Jew to get wealthy off of this business. In 1095, Pope Urban II launched the First Crusade, and things went to hell for Jews in a big way. Transcriptions of Urban\u2019s address that November don\u2019t agree with each other. However, the transcriptions do share common themes, and what most of the speech boils down to is a call for Christians to stop killing each other in Europe and start killing the infidel in the Holy Land. The way the peasantry in Europe seems to have taken this, however, came out to \u201ckill the infidel\u201d \u2014 and the nearest ones were their Jewish neighbors, who also happened to be wealthy (or at least perceived to be). The result was tragically predictable. About 8000 Jews were murdered during the Rhineland massacres of 1096. There had been massacres of Jews in western Europe prior to this, but the Rhineland massacres dwarfed them in scale. It took until the Holocaust for the Rhineland massacres to be displaced in the Jewish cultural memory. The massacres also seem to have set off a wave of other attacks on Jews. The blood libel was invented about fifty years later. This was a pernicious lie that stated Jews killed Christian children to consume their blood \u2014 it may have come about from deliberate misrepresentation of stories of Jews committing suicide and killing their own children rather than being forced to convert or being even more gruesomely murdered. And while the blood libel was a horrible lie, one can at least try to argue that had it been true (and it had not been), massacre of those responsible may have not been completely inappropriate. The same cannot be said over the numerous Jews murdered over rumors that they had tortured communion wafers. There were essentially two different groups acting in the massacres. The peasantry, for the most part, would have been religiously motivated: centuries of telling people their neighbors are responsible for murdering their god has that sort of effect. However, in the case of the petty aristocracy, arms and armor for going on a Crusade weren\u2019t cheap, and many borrowed money to be able to afford them. Killing their creditors would release them from debt, or at the very least, interest payments.[15] For the most part, those higher up in the totem pole tended to protect Jews in these situations. Even in cases where monarchs expelled Jews, they usually granted safe conduct out of the country, as with England\u2019s Edict of Expulsion, or France\u2019s expulsions of 1182, 1306, and 1394. In cases beyond expulsion, protection of the Jewish community was roughly equivalent to protection of the finance sector: while the ruling class almost certainly held the same anti-Jewish views as the peasantry, letting the moneylenders be murdered en masse and also have their property be appropriated by the rabble hardly constituted self-interest. This protection wasn\u2019t always effective \u2014 the Jews of Worms were massacred in 1096 despite the protection of the local bishop \u2014 but it was frequently proffered, even if only from naked and obvious self-interest and usually not from the simple moral truth that murdering people is wrong. As the section header for this part points out, I consider the Rhineland massacres and most of the murders of the High Middle Ages to be the fullest flowering of anti-Judaism. This is far from a universally held opinion, but insofar as the majority of the massacres were explicitly religiously motivated and as the victims were usually offered a way out through conversion to Christianity, religious-based hatred is the obvious culprit here. This would change with the dawning of the modern era. Part IV: Alhambra, the Zaporizhian Sich, and the Birth of Antisemitism Up until this point, we\u2019ve explored anti-Jewish sentiment almost entirely through a religious lens. Although there were economic considerations in play during the mass murders of the High and Late Middle Ages, without the religious hatred, they wouldn\u2019t have occurred. This becomes significantly less true when we look at the incidents of the Early Modern Period. On 2 January 1492, the last Muslim enclave on the Iberian Peninsula fell, bringing over seven centuries of Muslim rule of Al-Andalus to a close. Less than three months later, the rulers of Christian Spain, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, signed the Alhambra Decree, expelling the Jewish population. Christian Spain had been virulently and, to be frank unusually, hostile towards Jews during the late stages of the Reconquista, and after an especially massive wave of violence against Jews in 1391, roughly half the Jewish community of Spain converted to Catholicism. Throughout most of European history to this point, those conversions probably would not have been heavily scrutinized. Of course, in most places in western Europe, the Jewish community was somewhat dispersed. This was not the case in Spain, which had a large Jewish community of about 200,000 before the conversions. As the conversions were forced, there were legitimate questions of their sincerity and durability \u2014 forcing a conversion when there isn\u2019t a large community of other forced converts (called anusim) is more likely to stick simply on the basis of effective isolation from the old community. Even though a century had passed since the 1391 conversions, the Spanish state still believed there were many crypto-Jews among the conversos. These crypto-Jews, who faked adherence to Catholicism and practiced Judaism in secret, are now frequently known by the pejorative marrano, a Spanish word meaning \u201cswine.\u201d The presence of crypto-Jews in Spain enraged Isabella, leading to her choosing to expel the openly practicing Jews from Spain. This seems like another case of anti-Judaism, but there are enough differences here that we\u2019re actually looking at a somewhat different type of hatred of Jews. Specifically, when we look at the Jews who converted to Catholicism rather than move, things look very different indeed. Traditionally, Christianity has not made a distinction, theologically or doctrinally, between a new convert and someone descended from generations of Christians. Following the mass conversions of 1391, however, Spain started making those distinctions, creating tests of limpieza de sangre \u2014 the purity of blood. So-called \u201cNew Christians\u201d were considered to have tainted blood, and were subject to various legal restrictions on rights. Documentation regarding one\u2019s blood purity became important in Spain and subsequently Portugal. Any convert to Christianity in one\u2019s genealogy going back four generations (to one\u2019s great-grandparents) would be enough to make a person a New Christian.[16] This isn\u2019t anti-Judaism. Anti-Judaism\u2019s prejudices end should a Jew convert, but the Inquisition was enforcing discrimination against New Christians decades after their forefathers had died, let alone converted. This, combined with a formal concept of blood purity, points to a hatred of Judaism that transcends religion. This is a race-based hatred, and this is what we talk about when we talk about antisemitism generally: the sneaky, cunning Jew blood will eventually out. For the other massive shift in antisemitism in the early modern period, we have to skip over to the Rzeczpospolita \u2014 the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Jews only started moving to Poland in appreciable numbers during the First Crusade. Poland had, at that point, only been a Christian state for slightly more than a century, and it would not be until the thirteenth century that Catholicism would become the dominant religion in Poland. As such, there was no history of anti-Judaism within Poland, and it was a safe place for Jews. The problems came from the success of the Rzeczpospolita. The Rzeczpospolita ended up expanding into Ruthenia (what is now Ukraine), but the absorption wasn\u2019t on equal terms, and the Ruthenian nobility of the area was generally crapped on by the Polish and Lithuanian nobility. Additionally, the nobles who owned property in the area were frequently absentee landlords. Combine this with the religious differences between the Ruthenians \u2014 who were Eastern Orthodox \u2014 and the Poles \u2014 Roman Catholic \u2014 and there was a decidedly unstable situation. Violence exploded in Ruthenia in 1648. Led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky, the Zaporizhian Cossacks rampaged through the region, massacring large numbers of people.[17] Jews in particular were targeted, but not for any religious reason: the aforementioned absentee landlords usually used Jews to manage their properties, including collecting rents.[18] In other words, the slaughter had nothing to do with religion and everything to do with class. However, even after the mass murder ended and the social structure of Ruthenia stood permanently altered, the resentment and hatred of the Jewish population remained. This modality of hating Jews hadn\u2019t previously been a massive phenomenon. Again, previously, most hatred of the Jews was religiously based. But in moving to class- and race-based hatred, Europe was giving birth to modern antisemitism, a phenomenon both intimately concerned with and completely unrelated to Jews. Part V: Antisemitism from the Eighteenth Century until the Mid-Twentieth Starting in the eighteenth century, Europe started asking what would come to be known as \u201cthe Jewish Question.\u201d[19] Jews had spent most of the preceding centuries in Europe essentially being a nation within other nations, but in the aftermath of the Thirty Years War, the general European adoption of the idea of Westphalian sovereignty, and the blooming of liberal thought in the Enlightenment, the idea of the nation-state came to the fore, which also had the effect of making the nation-within-nations state of affairs seem suboptimal. One of the more commonly proposed answers to the Jewish Question was emancipation: the elimination of discriminatory laws targeting the Jews, and the enabling of Jewish integration into society as a whole. For poorer Jews \u2014 in other words, the overwhelming majority \u2014 this would have been a highly attractive option, but for the wealthier court Jews \u2014 those who had served as financiers to church and aristocracy \u2014 emancipation was actually undesirable as it would strip them of privilege.[20] It\u2019s this privilege we have to discuss. As mentioned in Part III of this answer, the relationship between the state and its Jews was often a paternalistic one in Western and Central Europe: the state provided explicit protection against the remainder of the population to its Jews. This identified the Jew with the state in the mind of the population, including the Jews. There were obvious exceptions \u2014 Russia, for example, had virtually no Jewish population until the eighteenth century, and therefore did not go through the same process as the rest of the continent \u2014 but this identification was common. What this also meant was that, as Hannah Arendt describes in The Origins of Totalitarianism, gentile Europe\u2019s view of Jews was strongly correlated with its view on government. The Prussian aristocracy prior to Napoleon freely associated with Jews, but when the state became a French puppet, this association ended, only to be restarted after Napoleon\u2019s defeat. This state of affairs continued even in post-emancipatory states. France\u2019s Dreyfus Affair, for example, took place from 1894 to 1906, over sixty years after full emancipation of the Jews. Dreyfus was an army officer framed for espionage and convicted by a kangaroo court. Within two years, an investigation turned up the actual culprit. Rather than exonerate Dreyfus, the military exonerated the guilty party, then tacked more charges onto Dreyfus. French society split over whether or not Dreyfus was guilty. Specifically, liberals usually fell into the Dreyfusard camp and conservatives usually fell into the anti-Dreyfusard camp. When we talk about fin-de-si\u00e8cle France, the term \u201cconservative\u201d does not map to the ideology of, for example, Les R\u00e9publicains of today\u2019s electoral politics. France was less than three decades out from having been an empire, and only about a half century out from having been a monarchy. The Third Republic was still quite new, and conservatives disdained it. Bonapartism and monarchism (in both Legitimist and Orl\u00e9anist forms) were not fringe movements at the time: the French had almost reformed the Bourbon monarchy in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u20131871. Thus, when we say that opinion on Dreyfus correlated with views on the government, don\u2019t think Democrats complaining about Trump or Republicans complaining about Obama, think people who don\u2019t trust democracy. In particular, think the Catholic Church, the aristocracy, and the military. This is not to say antisemitism was a strictly conservative phenomenon, because it wasn\u2019t. For example, identification of the Jews with the Weimar Republic brought the NSDAP to power in Germany and destroyed the republic. Left wing antisemitism was also common. Emancipation of European Jewry bred resentment among the lower classes. Where before emancipation, the social and legal structures of Europe had made even the lowliest Christian the superior of any Jew, emancipation ended that state of affairs. It didn\u2019t matter that most Jews were not particularly wealthy, nor did it matter that the ruling classes hadn\u2019t changed: Jews were the target of hatred. It is for this reason German social democrats often said \u201cantisemitism is the socialism of fools\u201d: from a socialist perspective, the left-wing antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was a thoroughly misguided attempt at class consciousness. The sudden improvement in social standing for Jews bred resentment among the lower classes, and resentment can be lethal. During the Second World War, the USSR occupied part of Poland, including the town of Jedwabne. The Soviets reshuffled the ruling order there, putting communists in charge, many of whom were Jews. When the Germans seized the town about two years later, the Polish population \u2014 without prompting from the German occupiers \u2014 rounded up the Jews of Jedwabne, locked them in a barn, and burned the building down. In towns nearby, such as Vilna (now Vilnius, Lithuania), where Jews had not been placed in positions of power, the Nazis had to do their own dirty work. In Jedwabne, where Polish Catholics saw Jews (not even the whole population) rise at their own expense, the Nazis only had to stroll into town. It\u2019s resentment in particular that explains the rise of antisemitism in the Islamic world. Again, Jews had almost always been held in contempt in Muslim societies, with low-grade violence occasionally flaring up. However, with the beginning of waves of European Jewish emigration to the Levant in the nineteenth century, the image of Jew as pathetic, helpless, forsaken, impoverished target of derision became increasingly unreflective of reality.[21] Unsurprisingly, antisemitism within the Muslim world increased with the establishment of the British Mandate of Palestine (which destroyed the legal superiority of Muslims), the 1947-1948 War (which permanently weakened the image of the Jew as weak), and the 1967 War (which utterly destroyed that image). Part VI: Racism and The Holocaust I have, to this point, briefly alluded to the Holocaust, but if we're going to discuss antisemitism, we're going to need to take a deeper dive into its most horrific incarnation. National Socialism is sometimes portrayed as a confused ideology. It is not. Although there is much National Socialists are willing to compromise on, including many issues other political philosophies would not view as incidental, National Socialism is a race-based political theory. The only consideration National Socialism views as non-negotiable is race. This explains, among other things, why trains kept going to the death camps even as the resources expended in making those runs could have been put to far better use in defense against the Soviet Union. It also explains why Warsaw was demolished, even though the enemy was at the gates. In Part IV of this answer, we saw the birth of a racist antisemitism in the Spanish Inquisition. However, the Spanish approach to race had been quite simple: define race as of a particular time, and go from there. So yes, there was a racial hierarchy in Spain and its colonial possessions, but this was largely facilitated by comparatively recent contact with both Amerindians and with non-Maghrebi Africans, and also the pragmatic approach of not going back too far in history to search for Jewish ancestry. Nazi racial theory, however, sought to subdivide further, including races within Europe itself. There was precedent for doing this, although only about a century of it. While linguistic, religious, and cultural differences between various European ethnic groups had always been acknowledged, they weren't seen as anything deeper: Germans were different from the French because they spoke a different language, not because of blood. Starting in the mid-nineteenth century, this view changed, largely thanks to the work of a Frenchman named Artur de Gobineau. Gobineau was highly conservative and saw France as being on a downward spiral, and he sought to explain it. His thesis was that France was, in fact, composed of two different races. The nobility were descended from the Germanic tribes that had conquered Rome, while every other Frenchman was descended from the Romans' slaves. Centuries of interbreeding between the two races had weakened the stock of the aristocrats, leading to their decline in prestige and power. Gobineau's formulation proved popular among the French upper classes, but also among German liberals, who wanted to unite Germany under one banner. The Germanic race (and yes, Gobineau used the word \"Aryan\") being superior, and they themselves being that race's modern-day descendants, created a degree of romantic nationalism that had not previoulsy existed within the Germanophone reaches of Europe. This would later be fused with Darwin's theory of evolution to create \"scientific racism.\" \"Scientific racism\" is a contradition in terms. There was no evidence to suggest Gobineau's conception of the French people was correct, and the identification of the Germanic people's superiority similarly had no evidence to support it. However, these theories were excellent for \"scientifically\" and \"rationally\" justifying irredentism, colonialism, and antisemitism. In other words, Gobineau's race theories were devised not to explain, but to justify, the heinous abuses and attitudes of the day. By itself, this would have been pernicious, but race theory is a particularly degrading worldview. While Marxist thinking can easily lead to abuses, class is a fundamentally mutable state: the proletariat may ascend to the rank of the capitalist, the capitalist may descend to the rank of the proletariat, and in the event of a revolution, the capitalist can share in the resulting society as though he had been a proletariat all along.[22] Race, however, is immutable, so that someone born a Jew will never have a place in a Germanic race state, even if she were to abandon her religion and attempt full assimilation. Thus, to a race theorist, the only possible answer to the Jewish Question is exclusion. The first choice of these race theorists was the exile of the Jews from Europe. Famously, the NSDAP considered a plan to relocate all of European Jewry to the African island of Madagascar; less famously, the Polish government had previously examined a similar policy for its own Jewish population. By the same token, Jews were allowed to leave Germany prior to the start of the Second World War, albeit with Germany robbing them blind first. However, the start of the Second World War made displacement of the Jewish population impractical, leaving only one option for the race theorists in the Third Reich: wholesale murder. To say this is depravity is, of course, understatement. However, if one (abandons all pretense of humanity and) accepts the premises of National Socialism's race theories, wholesale murder is a logical consequence. If one rejects these theories, tying up resources to murder one's own population rather than defend the realm against an invader is lunacy, but if one accepts these theories, these murders are necessary for there to be a realm to defend. According to the warped moral calculus of National Socialism, one cannot leave the people of this race alive within the borders of the state, for it is within their very blood to bring about the corruption, decline, and fall of the National Socialist state. These theories are hogwash, but they are continuous with attitudes toward Jews in Europe before that time. But while these race theories were intimately concerned with Jews, they were also curiously completely indifferent to them. Hatred of Jews as a class may be irrational, but it is at least somewhat grounded in some conception, or misconception, of what Jewish behavior is. Anti-Judaism cares deeply about actual Jewish values, Jewish behaviors, and Jewish beliefs. Race theory is unconcerned with all of this, for race theory views behavior, values, and beliefs as natural consequences of blood. The hatred here is pure, for the only supposed crime the Jew has committed to earn this enmity is existing. However, what we ought note now is that, while other antisemites may claim more sensible grounds for hatred of Jews, this is almost never true. The Third Reich was openly and nigh-mindlessly antisemitic, but it was also honest, and under it, antisemitism practically became an ouroboros. Part VII: Psychological Mechanisms of Antisemitism Antisemitism, as Jean-Paul Sartre wrote in his 1946 essay R\u00e9flexions sur la question juive (literally translated to \"Reflections on the Jewish Question,\" and more commonly translated as \"Anti-Semite and Jew\"), is first of all a passion. It is not an opinion, and it is not a conclusion drawn from evidence. It is a premise, one irrationally adopted and then equally irrationally defended. However, what Sartre also pointed out was that this irrational defense was conscious. In an early passage of the essay, Sartre relates the story of a classmate of his who failed an entrance examination, while a Jew passed. The classmate freely admitted he had not studied for the examination, but also stated the exam was rigged, for how could an Ashkenazi Jew understand French or Latin better than a Frenchman? However, there were twenty-six people who had scored better than Sartre's classmate, fourteen of whom had failed, and only one Jew had passed. Simply, either Sartre's classmate was a great fool, a description Sartre does not give, or else he was aware of the contradictions in his claims and did not care about them. Indeed, antisemites are usually aware of the contradictions in their worldview, and not only do not care, but are actively amused by them. Because antisemites have given themselves over to not being bound by rationality, attempts to rein them in using rationality can only serve to amuse them, in the same way watching a man try to dig holes for fence posts using a dessert fork is humorous: the wrong tool for the job is being employed. Antisemitism thus often goes hand-in-hand with some form of irony.[23] These contradictions are obvious and easily found. The antisemite may value intelligence generally, but should a Jew display it - and antisemites will freely grant this is common - \"intelligence\" will be renamed \"cunning,\" and will be derided. The antisemite may be cheated by a Jewish haberdasher, but will only feel resentment towards Jews generally, not also haberdashers generally. The antisemite may bar the Jew, either formally or informally, from \"respectable\" positions, and will then deride the Jew for engaging in \"disreputable\" ones - and Heaven help the Jew should she make a grand success of that career.[24] Again, we must conclude the antisemite either a fool incapable of walking and chewing gum at the same time, or else consciously unconcerned with rationality and sense. In other words, antisemitism is a choice people make. Because of this, we may once again quote Sartre in saying \"if the Jew did not exist, the anti-Semite would invent him\" - if there were no Jews, there would still be people inclined to bad faith and hatred, and they would need a target.  [1] \u201cExilic\u201d here refers to the Babylonian Exile, a fifty year period when the Neo-Babylonian Empire relocated a significant portion of the population of Judah to Babylon. Archaeological finds dating back to before and after the Exile show that the theological effects of the Exile were huge: a polytheistic religion turned into a monotheistic one. [2] An incident that almost certainly did not occur \u2014 the idea that the unquestioned dictator of Judea could have been forced to crucify a man he wanted to pardon to is laughable, and there is no evidence outside of the Gospels that suggest a tradition of granting one prisoner clemency during Passover. [3] This statement assumes that the Samaritanism is not a branch of Judaism. Arguments can be made either way on this point. [4] If I\u2019ve learned nothing else from eating with gentiles, it\u2019s that they sure love telling Jews just how much one misses out on by not eating pork and shellfish. By the way, if you do not keep kosher, please, please, please, please, please do not do this. It\u2019s not that the person who keeps kosher will likely be tempted to eat the bacon in question, it\u2019s just that this got old for them a very long time ago. [5] Although \u201cJudaizers\u201d would continue to maintain a significant presence in Asia Minor, the Levant, and Egypt until at least the fifth century. [6] Now called Medina. [7] Oh boy, am I saying some controversial stuff right here. As should be fairly clear by what I\u2019ve written so far, I am not a Muslim, and therefore do not believe the Quran to be of divine origin. It is undeniable that the Quran was not written down until after Muhammad\u2019s death, and with that being the case, at the very least, transcription errors were likely. Indeed, considering the very order of the text was not settled until after the time of Muhammad\u2019s successor\u2019s successor (legitimate if you\u2019re a Sunni Muslim, usurper if you\u2019re Shi\u2019a), the chances that the text of the Quran perfectly matches what Muhammad said is fairly small. This is not to say that the Quran isn\u2019t a perfect transcription, only that to say it is requires faith few (if any) non-Muslims have. Comments that take me to task for not having this faith (or any other faith, for that matter) will be summarily deleted. [8] Although the historicity of the so-called Satanic Verses incident (qissat al-gharaniq) is an open question, the Kaaba and the Black Stone were both important elements in the Meccan pagan religion. Islam states that neither were originally pagan artifacts and were simply corrupted by paganism, but there\u2019s no archaeological evidence of this being true. [9] This journey is called the Hegira, and the Islamic calendar reckons time based on how many years before or after the Hegira something occurred (BH and AH). [10] A common enough occurrence: it\u2019s not as though Joseph Smith or L. Ron Hubbard were taken seriously by their contemporaries, either. [11] Another common enough occurrence, with Martin Luther being another great example of \u201cI was nice enough to you, you didn\u2019t convert, screw you.\u201d [12] Taxation at this time largely involved going one rung lower than yourself on the social ladder, figuring out how much you could squeeze out of them all without them rising up to kill you, and then doing that. However, since this was before auditing and bureaucracy, the process of figuring out the sum was highly inexact. [13] Discussed further here: Harold Kingsberg's answer to How did Muslim traders raise investments given Islam's prohibition of usury? (Harold Kingsberg's answer to How did Muslim traders raise investments given Islam's prohibition of usury?) [14] It is difficult to compare this to modern prices. However, we do know a footsoldier in the English army would earn 2d per day, and there were 240d per pound. A private in the modern British Army gets paid about \u00a335 13s (yes, I\u2019m going with pre-decimalization schemes here for purposes of comparison, I said this was difficult) or \u00a335 165d. Assuming the value of the daily wage has not changed \u2014 which is a crap assumption, but that\u2019s all we\u2019ve got \u2014 this translates to \u00a315,000 in 1150 being worth about \u00a364,000,000 now. This still understates Aaron\u2019s wealth. Putting it in less mathematical terms, when Aaron died and the crown took over his estate, the crown opened up a new branch of government just to deal with it. [15] With interest rates frequently being in excess of 30% per annum \u2014 much of which would then be paid to the crown as tax \u2014 eliminating the obligation to pay interest was just as much worth murdering over as eliminating the obligation to pay back the principal. Which is to say that it wasn\u2019t worth murdering over at all, but did it anyway. [16] The concept of blood purity was far from universally accepted, and Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, who was to Spanish what Shakespeare was to English and what Ferdowsi was to Persian, made hay of mocking and deriding the idea in his writings. [17] Khmelnytsky is a controversial figure in world history. In general, he is viewed positively within Russia (for bringing Ukraine into the Russian sphere of influence), negatively within Poland (where he is often viewed as a traitor), positively within Ukraine (where he is on the 5 hryvnia bill, which is worth about $0.20 USD), and as a murderous, if not genocidal, scumbag by Jews. If you\u2019re looking for an unbiased account of the Khmelnytsky Uprising, I\u2019m not the person to ask, since I usually have to stop myself from spitting when I hear his name. [18] Property management is easier when you\u2019re literate and numerate, and Jews were usually both, while also being explicitly limited in potential growth of social status. [19] The term dates back to at least the mid-eighteenth century. [20] See The Origins of Totalitarianism, by Hannah Arendt. [21] Something similar also happened with the Armenians. The Armenian Genocide did not begin purely because of the subsequent resentment, but it only could have occurred under those circumstances. [22] Not that this has usually happened in large-scale communist revolutions. Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War and Paris during the Commune are examples of how this can work, but the GULAG, Cultural Revolution, and Kampuchean Killing Fields are bloody examples of this theory not being remotely adopted in practice. [23] This is why the \"ironic antisemitism\" on display in such forums as 4chan is something to be taken seriously. As genuine antisemitism is often couched in ironic terms, \"joking\" antisemitism, regardless of what the denizens of those forums might claim, is essentially identical to it. [24] Motion picture production, for example, was considered most disreputable in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Jews entered the business because they could do so free of discrimination, and founded most of the major Hollywood studios in the process. This, of course, was warped by the antisemite into \"the Jews control the media.\" ",

            "answer_text": "First we must ask ourselves, what makes someone Jewish? You either: Convert into the religion, or be born to parents who converted before you were conceived.Have a Jewish mom. Even if you are not religiously observant, you\u2019re still considered as a Jew according to the rules.Jews are an ethnoreligious group, as mentioned above. I don\u2019t understand why people still have a hard time wrapping it around their heads, it\u2019s not that hard to understand. Think of it as a tribe; if you\u2019re born into it or taken under their wings, you\u2019re a part of that tribe. Now then, why do antisemites hate Jews? Well the reasoning has always been varied throughout the times, as Antisemitism is both pretty old and often contradictory. By contradictory I mean, the various reasons antisemites hate them have been, well, complex. Most likely, you\u2019ll see it in the comment section. For many that subscribed to the abrahamic faiths like Christianity and Islam, the reasons for hatred were: Because the Jews were religious.Because the Jews were secular.In the eyes of the working people, reasons were: Because many were poor.Because many were wealthy.During the rise of ideologies, the reasons were: Because many were capitalists.Because many were socialists/communists.Even now between the battle of the political spectrum, reasons generally boils down to: Because the Right sees them as non-whites.Because the Left sees them as Whites.Antisemitism isn\u2019t something that can go away, sadly. It\u2019s vastly difficult to kill something that has survived for so long and has learned to adapt to whatever political environment it\u2019s thrown into. But that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t do anything about it. Educating is always a good tool to help debunk any false accusations or claims. There\u2019s also the classic \u201cmake friends and form very strong bonds\u201d with others. Well, hop on board as we watch hell unleashed in the comment section. grab your drinks and butter your popcorn, cause it is going to be one bumpy ride. ",
