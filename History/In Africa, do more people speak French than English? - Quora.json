            "answer_text": " Although not 100% accurate, this map shows that slightly more countries speak French than English. That is, you'll randomly end up in a French speaking country than an English speaking one. But in terms of the number of speakers, I think you'll find more English speakers than French speakers in Africa. By my rough estimation, we should have about 400 million English speakers in Africa compared to about 340 french speakers in about one billion of Africa's total population and this is because of the massive Population of Nigeria which is an English speaking country.
