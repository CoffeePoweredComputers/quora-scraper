            "answer_text": "First of all, blanket disclaimer: Romans wouldn\u2019t have known what you meant by the idea of being \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cstraight.\u201d They did not consider people to be homosexual; only behavior was homosexual. Second, there was no stigma against adult men \u201cplaying the active role\u201d, aka being the penetrative partner, in sex with another, usually younger man. (Sometimes so young we would now consider it criminal, but that\u2019s another matter.) In fact, it was considered entirely normal to do so, particularly during your younger years. To \u201cplay the passive role,\u201d on the other hand, was shameful for anyone not a youth. It seems that many men, maybe most, openly engaged in what we\u2019d consider gay sex at least a few times in their lives. One ancient history describes the Emperor Claudius as a \u201cpervert\u201d because he only had sex with women, never with men. That was what the Romans considered shocking! With all that groundwork laid\u2014there is no historical suggestion that Augustus preferred to have sex with men. He may or may not have had sex with men, but there\u2019s no reason to think that it would have been kept out of the ancient histories if he had; they would not have considered it some shameful secret of his. What we do know is that Augustus married his third wife Livia (with whom he lived for decades, until his death) out of love, not for property or political gain as was more common in the aristocracy at that time. Also, he was known to have many, many affairs with women both before and during his marriages. So his sexual interest in women seems definite. Whether or not he had sexual interest in men too is impossible to know at this late date. ",

            "answer_text": "No, at least, not \u201cgay\u201d in the classical sense of the word. It is entirely possible he was into men, but he lived over two thousand years ago, so it\u2019s kind of hard to know for sure. One thing all writers agree on: Augustus was very much into women. Though his womanizing was not nearly as well known as that of his uncle, Julius Caesar, he was known to have had many mistresses over the course of his life, many of them slaves. He also had a daughter Julia and in for that to happen, he would presumably need to have sex (of course, without DNA testing, the identity of the father was much more mysterious in roman times, so we don\u2019t know for sure that Julia was his daughter, but we\u2019re fairly certain). It has been suggested by several ancient sources - namely Suetonius, who was one of the more credible of the ancient writers (as opposed to, say, Plutarch) - that the only reason Julius Caesar named Augustus (then Octavianus or Octavian) as his successor was because Augustus/Octavian played the submissive in Caesar\u2019s sexual advances. Even Suetonius, however, admits that there is a strong possibility that this was just part of Marc Antony\u2019s BS slander campaign against Augustus. ",
