            "answer_text": "Short answer = Communism. I will explain, during WWII after the Nazis destroyed Moscow, a Russian soldier told a German POW, \u201cThis is what Berlin will look like\u201d. They didn't lie. An even known as the rate of Berlin scarred Germany but has been kept out of most history books. East Germany was assumed under communist rule, and Communism has tons of flaws socially and economically but we will only focus on the single person aspect. Communism is a Sociopolitical ideology with a Facism like aspect, now Google may tell you Facism is Right wing, but Facism shares no political ideology. Facism was developed by Giovanni Gentile who decided that Facism mixed with socialism would be the ultimate form of society because you have control. Facism was used by Socialist Italy and Socialist Nazi Germany because it offers maximum control. Facism means a bundle of sticks bound so tightly together they cannon be parted or broken. This means all the power goes to the government. In Soviet Russia and East Germany, rarely does a single person get heard who isn't a leader in the Communist party. And if several people speak up they get shot at, or thrown in a gulag for staging a riot. They had no say and little freedoms. When the Soviets rebuilt East Germany, there was cheap Soviet architecture, and a communist economy. There was no reason for someone to work hard or produce more, there is no higher wage to earn. Regardless of what your work is, you get paid the same as a janitor. This created waves of people sneaking into west Berlin. West Germany was capitalist and democratic at that, people could be heard. West Germany had capitalism and a hierarchy, that means people have something to work for. They produce more and work harder because they get paid according to success rather than possibly having to forfeit money to give to other people to make everything \u201ceven and fair\u201d. A communist society doesn't make things fair, remember that, someone is always losing money. West Germany had a free market and easily got new technology whilst East Germany relied on the KGB to smuggle in ideas. West Germany developed economical models that beat Europe today is GDP. There are several reasons that East Germany could not live up to it's neighbor on the west. When there is no reason to even work and low freedom or personal luxury a disparity like that happens. There are more examples of this. North and South Korea. West Germany is superior in many ways, but North Korea is crippling and shows tourist almost fake facades. Communism doesn't help the citizens or the thinkers. It's hard to innovate in a capitalist word and that's why Communism has basically only produced guns. Communism unfortunately also fails the government it's self, because the lack of labor because people don't work very hard makes your bad products hard to sell. The main problem? Karl Marx was not an economist, thinking that everyone should be paid equally no matter what is terrible. He believed people were oppressed, and that was the way to liberate them, but one thing he didn't understand was that capitalism has brought more people out of poverty than any other system. I try not to bash Communism, but you need to understand it's not a good way to run a country, and some people say Communism sounds good on paper but to be fair, it doesn't, it's terrible for hard workers or innovators. Germans are hard working organized people man, they thrive in capitalism. ",

            "answer_text": "West Germany did better than East Germany due to the fact that East Germany, also known as the DDR, was under the control and influence of communism. Communism is a poorly functioning political system and is very flawed. For one, it oppresses it\u2019s people. Communism does not tolerate free speech. Idea\u2019s are often suppressed and if they happen to be successful, you\u2019re still making as much as the guy mopping the lobby downstairs. Secondly, it does an awful job at maintaining it\u2019s economy. The military may be strong, but it\u2019s people are starving. It ultimately ends with the country falling, and a bunch of rattled excuses coming from the politicians. It also lacked a substantial amount of nationalism or even patriotism. A survey showed that people living in south and southwest Germany are more likely to have pride in Germany than their eastern counterparts. It\u2019s kind of difficult to run a successful nation without any motivation or pride in it. Otherwise, you\u2019re just going to be a very miserable person. You\u2019d also be more likely to make poor decisions. After all, what do care of the effects your political decision made if you don\u2019t care about your country? It\u2019s very self centered. On the other hand, West Germany was much larger. Therefore, it was much more powerful. Not only that, but it was also backed by the United States. The United States gave Germany plenty of supplies and a sense of pride. The Germans there loved the Americans. They got along and treated each other with respect. Meanwhile, the Americans indulged and admired the German people, culture, and traditions. In East Germany, that didn\u2019t happen\u2026 ",
