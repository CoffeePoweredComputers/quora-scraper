            "answer_text": "Yes I am living with AIDS I was diagnosed in 1995 at which point I had a CD4 count of 17, over the next few month I was hospitalized for PCP three times. I have since then been able to bring my CD4 back from its all time low of 17 to its now 350 count and have not suffered from any oppurtunistic infections since getting my count above 100. I have lost 15% of my lung capacity due to the PCP created scar tissue, I have a diagnosis of COPD, have extreme peripheral neuropathy pain which can be caused by HIV or caused by the side effects of the ARV drug Zerit which I took for years. I am fully disabled due to the neuropathy pain, the COPD, PCP lung damage, constant ARV drug caused diareaha and the fatigue caused by HIV. I take four Different ARV drugs due to having been under treatment for so many years it takes an additional drug to keep HIV at bay in my body. I take sleeping pills to sleep, narcotic pain medications to treat the neuropathy pain, cholesterol, high blood pressure medication. There is less stigma and the more public understanding about HIV now then there was in the 1990's but stigma is still a real issue for those of us who are dealing with HIV or AIDS. The biggest problem I see is that many Gay men think life on ARV drugs turns HIV into a minor issue and they are less concerned with being safe due to that false perception. ARV drugs increase the rate of general aging by increasing the rate of hart Diease, high blood pressure and diabetes. ",

            "answer_text": "I do not lhave HIV. I do highly endorse Gary's answer. While not every HIV infected person will have the same outcome as Gary, he is very very correct in his statements about the long term effect of the ARVs, and the much more rapid progressions of things like heart disease, heart attacks and other chronic complications.  I also completely agree with him about HIV stigma. We continue efforts today to end it, but there are multiple complications. Think of the uproar against gay marriage, and you must know HIV is still today incorrectly associated with homosexuality. So stigma continues. You dont hear about HIV on tv much, and even medical practitioners often fail to consider it when checking for other STIs. My opinions are from my experiences having been a nurse fir 24 years working in ER, ICU, Urgent Cares, and HIV . Working HIV I had to notify those newly infected and get them into care providing personalized patient navigation. Often I did the same for those who fallen out of care who had been positive for years. Many of those I helped became my close friends. I hope this helps. And Gary, keep the faith-love you . Matt. ",
