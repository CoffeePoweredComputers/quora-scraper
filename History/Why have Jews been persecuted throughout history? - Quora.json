            "answer_text": "There\u2019s a few answers to this, and different cultures have persecuted them for different reasons. I won\u2019t bother mentioning anything during classical antiquity because the persecutions of that era tended to be more matters of subjugation gone wrong than it had anything to do with their religion. The Romans brought violence upon on Jews with the same justifications that they used on the Germans and Celts. The Greeks saw them as a group of sedentary people who weren\u2019t being nomadic enough during their conquests to \u2018nomad\u2019 the hell out of the Levant when they were conquering it. The real persecution of the Jews is historically a Christian and Muslim issue. Both the Romans and the Greeks and even the Persians were extremely tolerant of outside religions and that is evident in the surviving art of the period that celebrated a more pantheistic time when appropriating the beliefs of one\u2019s neighbor wasn\u2019t consider the blasphemy that the monotheistic world we know best sees it. First, some Christians hold to the belief that the Jews, and not the Romans, were the ones who killed Jesus by being hostile to this young man in their community who was claiming to be their messiah. Since the enlightenment, this is probably the least often seen brand of antisemitism and exists mostly in independent churches in the US today. The US being one of the most tolerant countries in history towards the Jews, this is the one you won\u2019t generally see as a modus operandi for modern crimes towards them. Second, throughout the middle ages, Christians were outlawed from practicing usury; the act of loaning money for interest. When societies had a demand for this service, Jews were invited to their cities to fill that role so the Christians wouldn\u2019t be the ones committing what they considered a sin. In doing so, Jews who lived in these cities quickly became more wealthy and affluent than the native populations. They were able to educate their children in trade crafts, and because they were generally ghettoized, their communities were very tight knit and built on supporting each other. Inevitably, the natives got restless seeing the success of a minority group during their periods of stagnation and in a jealous rage, expelled them from city after city. This kept pushing the Jews eastward until they hit places such as Poland, Lithuania, and Russia. Poland and Lithuania were fairly accommodating, and for a period Jews flourished in cities like Warsaw. Though Cossack culture was continually at odds with them and would wage periodic pogroms when the opportunities struck. The Jewish population in Poland would still persevere until the Nazis and Soviets invaded and put an end to their presence there. After the war, many opted not to return and their descendants now live mostly in Israel and the US. Different situation in Russia, seeing that they had a severe influx of refugees, allowed them areas we now refer to as the \u2018pale of settlement\u2019 (see: Fiddler on the Roof). The Tsars of Russia tolerated their existence in the less useful and sparsely populated areas, but being an absolute monarchy\u2026 the whims of the Tsar changed from one to the next. Some were lukewarm towards them, like Alexander II, and some were overtly hostile, like Alexander III. When an unfriendly Tsar was in power, their lives weren\u2019t as good and they continually saw their available settlements dwindle until the 20th century when the lion\u2019s share fled overseas to the United States. Even after the Monarchy was abolished, the Soviet Union continued the practice of revoking their lands and in this case - outlawed the practice of their religion outright. So as the diaspora moved around, every set of locals had their own set of rationalizations for persecuting them. Lastly, whenever you have a minority group living anywhere, the children of the predominant group will be quick to believe superstitions about them. Not all these children grow out of those superstitions and some grow up carrying them around. Many urban legends that one would think only a child could believe are firmly believed by many adults to this day. The concept of \u2018blood libel\u2019? You can go to YouTube and see 1000s of videos by people who actually believe these things. In fact, simply googling \u2018blood libel\u2019, this is a video that shows up in the search results:  Sadly, YouTube puts negligible effort towards policing the antisemitism that exists on their website, and it is myriad. As you can see, this video was produced in Syria. Which brings up the question of why Muslims are so unbelievably hostile towards them; because superstition in their culture at large is a dominant factor. What is fringe groups, like Neo-nazis and the KKK and such in Europe and the US? The notions those groups hold are the same notions that the seats of power in Muslim-majority countries hold. When the authority figures are encouraging the youth to hold these superstitions, more often than not they\u2019ll see it through to adulthood and a very ugly feedback loop is created. Long story short, though, they\u2019ve generally been a minority population wherever they live and it\u2019s too easy for the uneducated and underprivileged members of the majority to find someone else to blame for their own shortcomings.

            "answer_text": "They have not. They have been persecuted by the Christian world for approximately 1,000 years. In non-Western societies where the Christian narrative never took hold, such as India and China, anti-Semitism never existed. Anti-Semitism is a western thing, because its roots are in early Christianity, itself one of the greatest cases of \"fake news\" in history. We have to go back to St. Paul (Latinized form of Saul, his name was Saul of Tarsus) He was Jewish, born around the time Jesus was executed (30-40 CE). As his name indicates, he lived in Tarsus, a major port city in modern day Syria). Initially he was known for his anti-Christian views. Christianity was at that time a small Jewish sect trying, and mostly failing to attract their fellow Jews in significant numbers. At some point he changed his mind, and began to support this new Jewish sect which claimed that Jesus was the Messiah, and had, by his death redeemed the world of sin (Mashiah, Hebrew word for Messiah means redeemer). He then had an epiphany, realizing that Christianity's destiny was not to take over Judaism, but the entire Hellenistic world, which was increasing drawn to the idea of monotheism. Problem was that the Jews refused to accept pagans interested in adopting the Jewish faith, insisting they have to join the Jewish nation as well. Considering that Rome had just defeated Judea, the idea of joining a defeated nation did not appeal to the victors. Paul realized this, and reinvented Judaism as a universal faith based religion, divorced from any specific nationhood. This was Christianity, a new monotheistic religion that would allow Roman-Hellenistic pagans to have their cake and eat it, satisfy their spiritual yearning for a monotheistic faith without having to join the Jewish nation. Jesus never claimed he was the son of God, this was Paul's spin, to make the faith more attractive to pagans whose Greek-Roman mythology was full of Gods and their children. He was successful beyond his wildest dreams, and within 2 centuries Christianity had gone from persecuted sect to official religion of the Roman Empire. This however meant having to create a false narrative in which it was not the Romans, but the Jews who would bear the blame and responsibility for Jesus' death. Hence the evolution of the official Church doctrine blaming the Jews for having forced the Romans to crucify Jesus. This led to a deicide narrative in which the Jews were blamed for killing God, or rather his son. As this narrative got ever deeply embedded onto the Christian psyche, it nurtured anti-Semitism, which became so rooted in the Western psyche, it evolved from a religious to a national and eventually racial hatred (Jews were considered a separate non-European race in 19th century Europe). This is the main reason for anti-Semitism. The Jewish tendency to be somewhat stand offish didn't help mitigate matters any. Jews tended to avoid mixing and socializing with the people among whom they lived. This made them mysterious, and it's very easy to fear what you don\u2019t know, and then hate what you fear. ",
