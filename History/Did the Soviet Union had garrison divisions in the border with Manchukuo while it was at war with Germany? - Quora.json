This Siberian Army was the source of troops that captured Nazi 6th Army in Stalingrad . Once Japan attacked Pearl Harbor , Stalin felt he could afford to send Siberian Army to fight Hitler as Japan would be too busy fighting USA to attack USSR as well. Once he kicked Hitler's ass , he transferred millions back to Siberia to invade Manchuko and Japanese islands in August 1945 . ",

            "answer_text": "Russia did have a great deal of concerns at the border with Manchuria and Siberian against Japan throughout 1930\u2019s. After a successful campaign in the Russian civil war, Stalin was able to keep his eye militarily on Russian far Eastern front. He deployed about a million troops to prevent the invasion by the Japanese. Although the outcomes of multiple conflicts border conflicts (vs Japan) favored Russia ( the biggest border war was the Battle of Khalkhin Gol , close to 40,000 casualties on both side combined ), Stalin never let up the defense of the far Eastern front. In October1941, Stalin finally got an assurance by a very capable Russian spy Richard Sorge from Tokyo who stated the Russian far Eastern front was stabilized and safe. This information led to transfer a part of the Russian far Eastern forces to face against the Germans in increasingly desperate struggles at Moscow and Stalingrad following year. Even then Stalin never took his eye off this front during WWII. ",
