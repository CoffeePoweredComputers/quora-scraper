            "answer_text": " Wilhelm Piecke, leader of the East German Communist Party, and Otto Grotewohl, leader of the Social Democratic Party in East Germany, stage a show of unity marking the unification of the two parties. (Source: Deutsche Fotothek, Wikimedia Commons) Throughout its 40-year existence, the German Democratic Republic (DDR), popularly known as East Germany, undertook a protracted but ultimately unsuccessful struggle to secure legitimacy among its people and the global community, all the while competing with another German state, the Federal Republic of Germany, commonly known then as West Germany, which was widely perceived not only as more democratic but also more materially successful. Complicating the DDR\u2019s challenge was the fact that the formation of this state was achieved through one of the most brutal conquests and occupations in history. An estimated one-million German women suffered rape at the hands of Soviet conquerors. Adding insult to injury among the defeated Germans, the Soviets ultimately removed a third of the region\u2019s industrial capacity and extracted an additional $10 billion from its industrial and agricultural sectors as war preparations. The Soviets came to view East Germany much in the same way that Britain viewed India during the colonial era: as the crown jewel of its empire. While, from time to time, Soviet leaders actively considered allowing the eastern sector to merge with western Germany, they eventually concluded that their sector was too vital a geopolitical asset, safeguarding vital strategic interests in the heart of Europe. The Soviets reasoned that maintaining hegemony over this region of Germany, which compromised much of historic Prussia, greatly reduced the risk of a unified Germany ever again constituting a serious geopolitical threat. All of these hard realities presented the Soviets\u2019 satraps, the DDR communist leadership, with a host of challenges. Socialism in One Occupation Zone The Soviets\u2019 initially expressed post-war goal was a re-unified Germany, albeit a neutral one. Yet, after repeated disagreements with the Western powers, the Soviets undertook the transformation of their sector into client state, much like Poland or Hungary, though one that evinced many of the attributes of a Western-style democracy. After all, the Potsdam Agreement called for building democracy in defeated Germany. The Soviets were willing to perpetuate a public perception of democratic state-building, but only so long as these efforts culminated in the establishment of a Marxist-Leninist state. As as part of this strategy, they dressed up much of this state-building in liberal democratic trapping, which was reflected in a number of symbols and flags.  Flag of the Christian Democratic Union of East Germany. (Source: Wikimedia Commons) Virtually from the beginning of their occupation, the Soviets staged elections, inviting several \u201canti-fascist\u201d parties - Christian Democrats, Liberal Democrats and Peasants - to participate. Remarkably, at Stalin\u2019s request, the East German leaders even organized a National Democratic Party to accommodate former Nazi Party members and former Wehrmacht personnel. Moreover, the Soviets, having concluded that the Communist Party was incapable of winning a democratic majority of its own, forced a merger with the far more popular Social Democratic Party. They staged a joint conference of the two parties and at its culmination the party leaders - Communist leader Wilhelm Piecke and Social Democratic leader Otto Grotewohl - rose to shake hands to affirm this unity. This merger (or, as it were, forced unification) came to be known as the Socialist Unity Party. But despite the name, it essentially amounted to a front party that ultimately would be transformed into a de facto Marxist-Leninist party. A graphic depiction of Piecke\u2019s and Grotewohl\u2019s clasped hands become the symbol of the party rather than the iconic Hammer and Sickle, which was far more commonly associated with Marxist-Leninist parties.  The flag of the Social Unity Party of Germany. We see a pattern emerging: The long-term East German practice of using rather ambivalent symbolism to project to the rest of the world the illusion that East Germany functioned as a Peoples Democracy - not an exclusively one-party state like the Soviet Union but one in which the vanguard party, the Socialist Unity Party, maintained dialogue with other anti-fascist parties. These collaborating parties, which came to be known as Bloc parties, were afforded seats in the East German parliament, known as the Volkshammer. The same strategy was employed with the East German Youth Movement. The East Germans initially invited young people from other anti-fascist backgrounds to join the movement, though eventually, all these elements were folded into a movement that took on an increasingly Marxist-Leninist ideological hue.

What could be accurately described as graphic ambivalence came to distinguish other symbols of the DDR. Very few looked explicitly communist, as they did in the Soviet Union. Like their counterparts in the western sector, the East German leadership settled for the distinctive Weimar Republic tricolor, distinguished by three alternative black,red, and gold horizontal stripes - remarkable, considering the strong liberal roots of this flag, which was designed and displayed during the bourgeois Revolution of 1848.  Both East and West Germany employed this design for their respective national flags until 1959, when East Germany defaced it with its distinctive coat of arms, a considerably more conspicuous Marxist-Leninist symbolism, featuring a workers hammer placed over a compass, bordered by a wreath of barley, though bound in the liberal national colors of black, red and gold.  Yet, all of these attempts at fusing liberal democratic with Marxist-Leninist symbolism to create the appearance of a constitutional democracy never seemed to have much effect in engendering loyalty for the regime. The flag of the Revolution of 1948, which East Germany embraced as its national flag, flies over a unified Germany, though one that is capitalist and liberal democratic, not Marxist-Leninist. And surveys of citizens of post-unification Germany have expressed happiness that this tricolor is bereft of the distinctive hammer and compass that symbolized the rather peculiar German experiment with Marxist Leninism known as the German Democratic Republic.
