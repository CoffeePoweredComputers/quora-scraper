            "answer_text": "TL, DR: they provided Austria-Hungary and Germany excuses for wars they wanted anyway. They didn't cause it completely, but they played a part.In the early 20th Century, Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece and Montenegro had imperial ambitions in the Balkans. Austria-Hungary saw these ambitions as threatening its internal stability. As a result of the Balkan Wars, Serbia became much larger, and Austria-Hungary became determined to destroy it. But this was impossible for Austria-Hungary to do alone, because Russia would move against it if it did. Enter Germany. The Germans saw Russia as a threat, and wanted to conquer or cripple it. Germany also wished to dominate Europe. Even the most anti-war German socialists were anti-Russian. The only people really anti-War with Russia in Germany in the years before WWI were the Navy (who didn't want a war till the Kiel Canal was deepened), and the Kaiser, who didn't want one at all. The Kiel Canal deepening was finished in early 1914. When Prinzip killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne, Austria-Hungary wished to use that as an excuse to destroy Serbia. In Berlin, the Kaiser was persuaded to leave on his summer vacation, after which the Chancellor and Foreign Minister contrived to fool the other powers into thinking Austria-Hungary would not invade Serbia, and to get Russia to make a move that could be used as an excuse for the war with Russia that Germany wanted anyway. When Germany declared war on Russia, France came in because of its treaty with Russia, and when Germany invaded Belgium, Britain came in. Note, though, that on August 5th, 1914, Germany was at war with Russia, France, Belgium and Britain, supposedly in defense of Austria-Hungary, but none of those countries was at war with Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary declared war on the Allied countries because Germany ordered it to do so, on pain of not receiving any aid from Germany if Russia attacked it. ",

Even, there was seen a sharp increase in the nationalism and the nationalism had ramped up the tensions among the different nations of the Balkan. It can be said that nationalism was responsible for the Balkan Wars. So, Instability in Balkan nations was one of the causes of the outbreak of the First World War. Balkan nations were sandwiched by the four seas namely the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, Adriatic Sea and Aegean. Although the Balkan nations had scarce natural resources and were not an economic powerhouse, most European nations were desired to control them because of its strategic geographical location. Its geographical location present between the three major European nations that include the Ottoman Empire, Russia and Austria- Hungarian empire. For centuries it had acted as a passageway between the East and West as cultural and mercantile exchange. In the 19th century, most of the Balkan nations were part of the Ottoman Empire. Things got worse when the Ottoman Empire was started crumbling. When the Ottoman Empire was, many European nations showed its strong interest in the Balkan nations. It led to confront the many European nations to one another. Finally, various Balkan nations came into a brawl and led culminated into the Great War of 1914.

And this was the Empire in the early 19th century  And the map above the situation is from around 1900 And Serbia was certainly no exception. So the Serbians turned hypernationalist and started to hate to the point of excession. The newly independent Principality, much later Kingdom of Serbia was a very labile country.  Two Native Serb dynasties who had been guerillaleaders under the Ottoman yoke fought each other like robber barons for dominance. Finally one dynasty triumphed, murdering the other royal family.  Austria-Hungary, the Liberal Autocracy, was doing economically fine but the many nations within the Danube Monarchy were not of one mind and often quarelled, weakening this gigantic Switzerland replica that even more ressembled modern Belgium.  Although the several gouvernments honestly tried the Emperor-King was old and tired. The Crownprince Franz Ferdinand was a robust youngish man, married to a Czech Countess and a born reformer. He thought about reforming Austria-Hungary drastically by especially pleasing its Slavic nations: mostly the Croats and the Serb minority in the Monarchy. This was a public secret. In Serbia existed a sort of counterpart of the IRA, called the Black Hand, which wanted to unify all Serbs and possibly the Croats as well.  Symbol of the Black Hand A couple of ministers of the Serb King had ties to this underground movement that was a continuation of earlier anti-Ottoman movements. Even the Crownprince had donated..So they saw the Archduke as a threat and one of their members killed the Archduke and his Consort..  For the Austrian government which had disapproved of the Royal Serbian bloodbath in 1903 this was the last straw and they were forced to declare war on Serbia! ",

The Treaty of London (1827) decided the creation of an independant Greece. The weird thing in that history is the enduring presence of the Emperor, the Hapsburg. The spanish branch was removed from the 7 north Low Lands by the merchands of Amsterdam ( the 80 years war ) and got naturally extinct in Spain, the austrian branch rule was removed from Boheme ( religious wars ), from France ( french bloody revolution ), from Rhenanie by Napoleon I ( the end the Holy Roman Empire ), from Belgium pacifically in 1815, and from north Italy ( the terrestrial extension of the Adriatic sea ) first from Piedmont by Napoleon III and then from Venitie Lombardie by Bismark What is Italy's Geopolitics?. The major 6 ( france, uk, russia, austria, prussia, italy ) met in Berlin in 1879 once again to organize a new wave of dissolution of the sick man of Europe. So the Balkan war with the restoration of Greece with the help of Russia during the greek revolution, and the help of France in the Peloponese ( Mor\u00e9e )the italian war in Tripolitan and Cyreanicthe \u201cBalkan coalition\u201d of Montenegro Bulgaria Serbia and Greece fighting against the Ottomans in Albanie, Thrace and Macedoniaall of these wars were in total conformity with the Berlin plan. The weird thing in that coalition of the major 6, is the presence of the austrian Hapsburg, their rule was fought internally in Europe but they were associated in the coalition against the Ottomans. WW I occured when the Hohenzollern and the Hapsburg decided to impose germanization with a simultanously annexion of Belgium which triggered the wrath of France and Britain and of Serbia which triggered the wrath of Russia. The major 6 exploded with the war of the Alliance against the Entente, Italy did not know what to do and an exhausted Russia by a terrible internal revolution left the war. The victors abruptely dissolved the Hohenzollern, the Hapsburg and the Ottoman Empire using a political tool called Nation. Hitler who was autrian did not like the Hapsburg but he tried again to impose a germanisation program, he was a gambler, he surfed on the stupidity of the french allies What are the worst \"Oops!\" moments in history? and succeded to restore the Hohenzollern war machine How was Hitler able to rebuild Germany so quickly?

            "answer_text": "The Balkans was a region of geographical and ethnic variation comprising modern day Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro whose inhabitants were broadly known as Slavs. A large part of the Balkans was under the control of Ottoman Turkey. The spread of ideas of romantic nationalism in the Balkans together with the disintegration of the Ottoman empire made this region very explosive. All through the 19th century the Ottoman empire tried to strengthen itself but in vain. One by one, its European nationalities broke away from its control and declared independence. The Balkan peoples based on their claims for independence or political rights on nationality and used proofs from history that they had once been independent but were later subjugated by the Turkish. Hence the rebellious nationalists in the Balkans thought of their struggles to win back freedom. As the different Slavic nationalities struggled for independence, the Balkans became an area of intense conflict. The Balkan states were fiercely jealous of each other and each hoped to gain more territory at the expense of the others. Matters were further complicated because the Balkans also became a scene of big power rivalry, which would soon lead to the first world war. During this period, there was intense rivalry among the European powers over trade and colonies as well as naval and military might. These rivalries were very evident in the way the Balkan problem unfolded. Each power - Russia, Germany, England, Austro-Hungary was keen on countering the hold of other powers over the Balkans, and extending its own control over the region. This led to a series of wars in the region known as the Balkan Wars and it finally led to the First World War. ",

Because of the assassination, Austria-Hungary was very split between German and Russian supporters. Now, because Russia and France were allies Germany felt threatened and between a rock and a hard place. As a result, they begin the war with the idea to take out France before Russia can mobilize and come to their defense. The rest is history. ",

            "answer_text": "My semi-educated response is that not a single European power could foresee / calculate that the Ottoman Empire would lose the First Balkan War so miserably. Most prominent statesmen of the time, including Germany\u2019s Bismarck, could foresee that the Ottomans would lose against the coalition of Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro, but they did not foresee that they would lose so badly. As a result of this heavy military defeat, Ottoman Turkey lost its entire European territory (with the exception of a small hinterland surrounding Istanbul). The victorious nations occupied and eventually annexed these territories. The largest chunk Ottoman Macedonia became part of Greece, while the region including Skopje and Monastir (Bitola) became part of Serbia. The victorious countries thus became larger overnight, and started ruling over hundreds of thousands new subjects, who were not always necessarily friendly to their new rulers. Hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians, for example, became Serbian or Greek subjects, because Bulgaria\u2019s territorial gains from the Ottomans were much smaller that those of Greece and Serbia. Consequently, the new conjecture which emerged after the First Balkan War practically ended the Ottoman rule over Balkans, but it did not end the inter-ethnic rivalries between (and within) the victorious countries. Especially Bulgarians, who fought valiantly against Ottomans on numerous fronts, remained disappointed (and angry) because most of their newly conquered territories were ceded to Serbia or to Greece. Since Great Powers of that time, i.e, Britain, Germany, France and Russia, could not deal with this sudden redistribution of power and territory in the Balkans, they were also unable to broker a deal which would be satisfactory to all involved parties (with the possible exception of Ottomans). Unable to be part of a new European deal, those Great Powers started to part of the new Balkan problem, and started to support one Balkan nation at the expense of another one. As a result of this new Balkan conundrum, Serbia approached its traditional protector Russia, while Bulgaria (and to a lesser extent, Ottoman Empire), started to enjoy Germany\u2019s support and sympathy. Eventually, when a Serbian militant assassinated Austrian archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, all Great Powers were willing (if not enthusiastic) to change the balance of power in the Balkans by force.

Romania decided to get in the second to stop Bulgaria (who was beating severely the other two) and to become the Balkan power! Awful decision, shameful campaign (no fights, Bulgaria was having the troops on the SE borders, but thousands of deaths from cholera!). Overall the Balkan wars were a regional business, caused by greed and misbehaviour from all parties instead of open negotiations and diplomacy. ",

Germany knew that the Balkans could induce Austria - Hungary to join in a large war against Germany\u2019s enemies. You see, Germany\u2019s last powerful ally was Austria - Hungary, and it was weakening. Germany wished to take advantage of what would be a meaningless Balkan war and start a world war. Germany had been preparing for this for a long time. Definitive war plans date back to 1905, because Germany was so anxious to expand and prove it was more powerful than France and Great Britain. The First World War started in the Balkans because Germany, France, and Great Britain were wiling to stoke the flames created between Serbia and Austria - Hungary. ",

As a result, almost every Ottoman conquest in Europe is captured and divided among the Balkan combined states. This incident also led to the establishment of an independent Albanian state. Despite winning, Bulgaria was dissatisfied with the division of territory in Macedonia, which started the Second Balkan War. ",
