            "answer_text": "When you ask a question means that you wonder about the truth. But by asking a specific question like that with two countries compared it means that you have done your homework before that. What it is ment here is that it is understandable if the question compares two ancient countries like India and Greece, or China and Greece. It is worth like to wonder what it makes somebody to ask a question that on the one side of the wording is mentioned one of the most famous and ancient cultures of the world as the Greek and on the other side of the question to mention a country that became established in the begging of the 20th century. The only source on this planet that can give and idea of how old is Greece is the Greek mythology. !!! The rest that it can be called as supplementary source are copies or translations from the Greek Mythology and plain Greek history! (Some times the Bible can be an original source). So in the Greek mythology the reader can read for the first ever time the name Pelasgos and the name of his father Palehthon. Both words are Greek with a lot of meaning and we know that both lived for the first ever time in Thessaly Greece. From there they spread to Peloponese in Arcadia, in Caucasus(with the Argonaytes) and from there some of them came back to north west Greece called today Albania(a Greek geographical name original pronounced as Alvania and situated in Caucasus ). The last years and especially after the Hodja period in Alvania the Albanians wants to identify their selves as Pelasgians even if they have been moved from Alvania to these modern places. If this is not enough adequate then some times they take in use an other argument based again on Greek name and sources like the Greek mythology , namely the name Illyrians. Even those have Greek origins from Kadmos and Harmonia. The answer is an easy and obvious one to the keen readers but complicated and unlogical(not rasjona) to the Albanians nationalists that use their fantasy and imagination to get an identity that is suited to them. *** The Illyrians in their majority were dragons/snakes something that can be explained only through the Greek mythology.

            "answer_text": "We don\u2019t really know; don\u2019t think we ever can. The Illyrian tribes that Albanians regard their ancestors were nomadic by nature, warlike, but utilizing oral tradition. They did not write things down. The Hellenic tribes/civilization which are the predecessors of Greeks were stationary in contrast, and literate, though they also valued martial prowess. Because the Greeks wrote down everything, their experiences have survived until today so we can access them; we just know far more about them. As to who is older, its hard to say. ",

The Albanians appeared in historical records in the 11th century AD, that is 2700 years after the Greeks, although some Albanian nationalists claim that they are the descendants of the Illyrians, but that hasn't been confirmed.
