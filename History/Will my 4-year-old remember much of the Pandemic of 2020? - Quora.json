            "answer_text": "There was a movie a few years ago where a man and his son were in mortal danger through most of it because of war that required them to hide, pretend and otherwise suffer. The father is determined not just to survive but to make the primacy of his and his son\u2019s relationship the most important thing during all the things he had to do to survive. To that end, he made things into a game, so that the little boy wasn\u2019t frightened and was actually in good spirits. I realized then, that as resourceful as I am, I would never be that confident or positive enough to pull this off for myself. It was a great move and I wish I could remember the name of it as it won awards for the leading man. I think children take their attitude from their parents in everything, and if you make the situation to be normal, then that will be their recollection of the time, not grief and anxiety. Tall order indeed. I remember on the day the Twin Towers fell, how panicked we all were in the DC area, knowing that we could be the subject of more attacks because our proximity to the centers of power. We were raising a grandson at the time, and so we had a lot of young friends. Since we were home, we picked up a lot of children whose parents were having trouble getting home from work. Many main arteries were actually closed for security purposes. We had a house full of four and five year olds. We played games and dress up and walked in the woods, and made a lot of noise. I began cooking, and over the next week, we had several young families eating with us, frightened because they were expecting another child and wondered what kind of world they were bring their children into. We ate together every night, and it was comforting to feed all these families who drew comfort from each other. The children were allowed to go into the woods behind our house as it was visible from our deck, and the kids stayed out late playing. Maybe 10 years later, our grandson was reminiscing about this time and saying that he remembered such a happy time with his friends and their parents and wondered why we didn\u2019t do it all the time, as he said the parents were nicer, and allowed more silly play. He wondered what that was all about. When we told him the circumstances, it shocked him, as he realized how the adults protected the children from fear. He realized then how love transformed something horrible and frightening into a time of joy for the children. I think that is what we have to do now, telling the children that we had people working to fix the problem, and we just had to do our part of staying away from other people until it was over. I hope people realize that if this was a virus that was killing children quickly, that our national leaders would have responded much faster as people would have demanded immediately action. That didn\u2019t happen, and now that we need to protect our older citizens, there are people who are acting like lives don\u2019t matter, only the economy. That says a lot about the kind of people we are, and that the economy has become our national god. ",

            "answer_text": "Memory is a funny thing. I can remember one snapshot from my early childhood - I am in a stroller, being pushed along a gravel footpath and I am gazing across a wide open space at a row of towering cypress trees. I could not have been older than 3. This to me is a genuine memory, because: a) the open space with the row of tall cypress trees still exists, b) I lived a few streets away from this place up until the age of 3, and c) when I told my parents about it one time, they looked at me blankly. They couldn\u2019t remember this event (and why would they? It would have been just another walk around the park with the toddler to them). But the fact that my parents don\u2019t remember it means that this memory wasn\u2019t implanted in my brain through repeated telling, so it must be mine.  Blagdon Road Open Space, New Malden, Surrey, England. The avenue of trees appeared a lot more impressive when I was a toddler! (Photo: \u00a9\ufe0fGoogle Maps 2020) I could tell you three dozen other memories from my early childhood, most of them of the \u201ccute at the time, embarrassing now\u201d variety (apparently I used to say repeatedly, \u2018I am the cleverest of all!\u2019 - classic narcissist-in-training stuff). But these are not my memories, they are the anecdotes I have heard a thousand times, the events I know took place only because others told me that I was there. It\u2019s likely that your 4-year-old will have some memories of this time, but it will likely be of events which are important to the child, rather than global events. They might be deeply offended by not getting the exact toy they requested for their birthday, yet not understand the link between this outrage and current shop closures. Or they may remember feeling frightened by the sight of an elderly neighbour watching the road from behind a curtain, with no concept of self-isolation and the reason for the fear in the neighbour\u2019s eyes. They will be told all this, of course, and will hear about it from the news and other sources for years to come, so the memories will become a part of them, but hopefully with a sense of detachment from being so young now, and (hopefully) largely unaffected by the fear and worry that we grown-ups have to shoulder. From my experience as a parent, kids are simultaneously completely obtuse and microscopically detail-orientated. They spy things I miss completely, such as a tiny, blurred cat in the background of a photo. And they can be extremely particular about a certain item being placed just so - while oblivious to the fact that the rest of the room lies in chaos. They are not \u201cbigger picture\u201d people at four. Their world barely extends past the tips of their fingers (and that is completely healthy and acceptable at this age). I wouldn\u2019t worry about your child being adversely affected by the current global situation, as long as they and you remain healthy and safe, and the important people in their life can maintain a reassuring level of \u201ccarrying on as normal\u201d. As long as they don\u2019t have to experience or witness any traumatic events, they probably won\u2019t remember too much first hand. For the record, my 7- and 5-year-olds think that missing school is brilliant, but that \u201cMum school\u201d is a total lifeforce drainer. They have marveled at the empty supermarket shelves (before we self-isolated, of course), yet they do not worry if we are going to have enough toilet paper when required. They love having Mum and Dad home full time, and they don\u2019t give a stuff that our business is temporarily closed, and we have no other source of income. To them, it\u2019s all a bit of an adventure, and that\u2019s how it should be. I hope your child feels the same. ",
