            "answer_text": "In any court, the jury needs to look at the charges against the defendant, witness testimonies are needed and for a conviction proof beyond reasonable doubt is needed. The defence will try to point out flaws in any witness testimony eg How can you absolutely certain that that was the time? Did you conveniently happen to look at your watch just then? The Charges Anne Boleyn, Queen of England and second wife of Henry VIII, was accused of treason under statute 26 (Henry VIII c.13), a statute which had actually been brought into force to protect her and her daughter, the future Elizabeth I and also with slandering the royal issue (statute 25 Henry VIII c.22, March 1534). The indictment accused Anne of: \u201cdespising her marriage and entertaining malice against the King, and following daily her frail and carnal lust.\u201d According to the indictment, she had seduced the five men who were also charged with treason and had plotted the King\u2019s death. It was claimed that: \u201cOn 6th October at the palace of Westminster\u2026 and on various other days before and after, by sweet words, kissings, touchings, and other illicit means\u2026 she did procure and incite\u2026 Henry Norris\u2026 a gentleman of the Privy Chamber of our lord the King, to violate and carnally know her, by reason whereof the same Henry Norris on 12th October\u2026 violated, stained and carnally knew her\u2026\u201d Anne was also accused of committing adultery with several gentlemen of the court- Sir Henry Norris on 12th and 19th November 1533, with Sir William Brereton on 16th and 27th November, and the 3rd and 8th Decemer 1533, with Sir Francis Weston on 8th and 20th May, and the 6th and 20th June 1534, and with Mark Smeaton on 13th and 19th May 1534. Additionally, she was accused of committing incest with her brother George Boleyn, Lord Rochford, on 2nd November and the 22nd and 29th December 1535. In all, Anne was accused of 20 acts of adultery. Look at flaws in the first dates- just when she was getting over the birth of the future Elizabeth I who had been born in September 1533. Sex is the last thing she would have felt like at that time. Spring 1534, when Anne was pregnant. Why would she want to have sex/commit adultery when it would mean risking her unborn child which could be a son. That would have been extremely stupid and Anne was very far from being stupid. Also flawed are the other dates in the autumn of 1535 when she is supposed to have committed adultery, as she was again pregnant. She already knew that Henry was tired of her and would already have divorced her had it not been for the fact that divorcing her would have meant having to take Katherine back. She knew that if the child was a son, she would be safe. Henry would not get rid of the mother of his son. Therefore she would have taken every care possible to ensure its well-being, and sex could possibly damage it, so having sex with anyone would have been out of the question for her. As for the incest, according to court records, Anne procured her brother \u2018with the Queen\u2019s tongue in the mouth of the said George and George\u2019s tongue in the mouth of the Queen, with kisses, with open mouth, with gifts and jewels\u2026by reason whereof Lord George Rochford, despising all the Almighty God\u2019s precepts\u2026and every law of human nature\u2026on November 5 \u2026violated and carnally knew \u2026his own natural sister.\u2019 Considering that queens were surrounded by their ladies day and night, such a thing would have been noticed and seized upon by those hostile to Anne. The Spanish Ambassador, Chapuys who made it his business to find out and report to his master anything in the slightest bit detrimental about Anne -true or not- never mentioned such a thing. This evidence came from Anne\u2019s sister in law, Jane Rochford, a bitter and unstable woman who was extremely jealous of the close relationship between George and his favourite sister. Completely innocent actions, such as giving money to courtiers and dancing with her brother, were also used as evidence against Anne and she did not stand a chance. Even the fact that she had alibis for 12 of the occasions when she was meant to be committing adultery did not seem to matter at all. Anne was known to be a witch (after all, she had a sixth finger! Surely that was the sign of a witch!) and thus could do anything! January 24 1536. Henry had a very nasty fall from his horse while jousting. He was unconscious for about 2 hours. 2 days later Anne miscarried . Henry\u2019s reaction made it plain that he had reached the point of no return as far as Anne was concerned. He said \u201c I see clearly that God does not wish to give me male children\u2026\u201d [meaning by Anne]. He confided to one of his councillors, \u201cI was seduced into this marriage by sorcery, therefore I believe it to be null. God has shown this to so because He will not permit me to have sons. I believe I could take another wife,\u2026.\u201d Cromwell remarked to Reginald Pole that councillor should manage their prince\u2019s afffairs \u201cin such sort as they might obtain their ends, and yet no open failure in religion or probity be observed\u2026A minister should be able to reconcile the appearance of virtue, which princes are unwilling to give up, with the substantial interest of the state .\u201d Claiming he was ill, Cromwell isolated himself in his house for 5 days, not emerging until April 23rd, when he at once drew up a secret commission. This empowered Henry\u2019s leading nobles, officers of the royal household and judges to enquire into a long list of treasonable acts \u2018by whomsoever committed\u2019 and to try the offenders. Henry put his name to the commission the very next day! Compare this behaviour to that when he was informed of the rumours about his \u2018Rose without a Thorn\u2019 a few years later. Then he was furious, swearing extreme retribution upon those who had dared to blacken his precious darling\u2019s name and reputation and instructed Cranmer to make discreet enquiries that would clear the Queen and the make sure that anyone slandering Kathryn Howard was severely punished. Cromwell obtained information by means of threats and bribes. Many people heartily detested Anne, and were happy to repeat gossip. But slanderous gossip was exactly what Cromwell wanted. The fact that she had played the game of courtly love with gentlemen ie flirting with them enabled Cromwell to devise a new plot to which could replace the one he had already devised- a plot against the king\u2019s life. Most of the population already called Anne the Great Whore and they would have sympathy with Henry. They might balk a bit at a plot against Henry\u2019s life, but adultery was much more believable and more likely to stick. He learned that the day he had emerged from his isolation, April 23rd, Anne\u2019s ladies saw their mistress talking, laughing and exchanging flirtatious glances with Sir Francis Weston, a gentleman of the court.. One of the topics under discussion was of the love life of another gentleman of the court, Sir Henry Norris. A widower, Sir Henry had begun negotiations to marry one Madge Shelton, Anne\u2019s cousin. However, he hesitated to take the final step. What, Anne asked Weston, could be the reason? Weston couldn\u2019t tell her , but it was most likely because the Boleyn power was fading fast and Norris didn\u2019t want to compromise his position at court by marrying one of the family. Weston tried to cover for Norris saying \u201cNorris comes more into your chamber for Your Grace than he does for Madge\u201d Anne\u2019s reply was to remind Weston that she had heard him declare that he didn\u2019t love his wife. Was he then also in love with Madge? Weston knew the rules of courtly love and under those rules, what was expected of him and replied \u201cI love one in your house better than them both.\u201d Anne asked \u201cwho is that?\u201d \u201dIt is yourself\u201d Anne seems to have promptly ended the conversation, but too late. It was repeated to Cromwell. A day or 2 later, she had a visit from Norris and she asked him why he wouldn\u2019t marry Madge. \u201dI will tarry a time\u201d was the only answer, which caused Anne to say sharply, \u201cThen you look for dead men\u2019s shoes. If aught come to the King but good, you would look to have me.\u201d To wish or prophesy the King\u2019s death was treasonable and Anne was foolish to say such a thing, especially as she knew a) that all courts were full of people willing to make trouble for a faction they didn't support, and b) like everybody else that since Henry wanted rid of her, somebody was likely to curry favour by ensuring that Henry got to know of it. Cromwell\u2018s spies witnessed the episode and repeated it to their master . On April 29th, Anne saw the musician of the King\u2019s Chamber, Marc Smeaton standing in the \u2018round window\u2019 of her state apartments, and asked, \u201cMaster Smeaton, why are you so sad [serious] ?\u201d Smeaton apparently sighed and said, \u201cIt is no matter\u201d \u201dYou may not look to have me speak to,you as I would do to a nobleman ;because you are an inferior person\u201d Anne said sharply \u201cNo, no, a look sufficeth me; and so fare you well\u201d Another report to add to what Cromwell already had. He must have been rubbing his hands in glee. It appears that with this latest he considered that he had enough evidence to bring Anne to the scaffold. The next day, Smeaton was interrogated and tortured until he gave the answers Cromwell wanted. He had plotted the King\u2019s death, he had been alone with Anne in her chamber, he was inflamed with desire for her, his rich clothes had been supplied by her, she had given him money. By nightfall, Smeaton had admitted to carnal knowledge of the Queen. However, as has been seen throughout history, a victim of torture will say anything to stop the extreme agony they are suffering. The 1st of May, and according to a report by George Constantine, Norris\u2019s servant, Henry suddenly rounded on Norris as they were riding home from a tilting match and accused him of adultery with Anne. Norris denied it, but Henry persisted. Anne was known to have committed adultery with others. Norris must know their names. Norris insisted Anne was innocent and, rather foolishly, offered to prove her innocence with his body. The next morning he was in the Tower. By the afternoon, so was Anne. She told Sir William Kingston, the Constable of the Tower, \u201c\u2026I am as clear from the company of man, as for sin, as I am from you and am the King\u2019s true wedded wife\u201d Anne wrote to Henry from the Tower, proclaiming her innocence. \u2018But let not your Grace ever imagine, that your poor wife will ever be brought to acknowledge a fault, where not so much as a thought thereof preceded. And to speak a truth, never prince had wife more loyal in all duty, and in all true affection, than you have ever found in Anne Boleyn: with which name and place I could willingly have contented myself, if God and your Grace's pleasure had been so pleased. Neither did I at any time so far forget myself in my exaltation or received Queenship, but that I always looked for such an alteration as I now find; for the ground of my preferment being on no surer foundation than your Grace's fancy, the least alteration I knew was fit and sufficient to draw that fancy to some other object.\u2019 Since by then she must have known that she would not be allowed to live, if she was guilty, what was the point in Anne writing it? On the afternoon of May 17th 1536, all 5 men accused with Anne went to the block. None of them admitted to adultery, although Smeaton said, \u201cMasters, I pray you all pray for me, for I have deserved the death.\u201d Some historians have pointed to this being a sign of guilt, while others point to the fact that he worshipped Anne as an unattainable goddess, and that likely he felt guilty only for having let her down, and being a cause of her death, by falsely confessing to adultery under torture. Anne is reported to have been dismayed that Smeaton had not withdrawn his testimony. \u201cI fear his soul will suffer for it\u201d she told Kingston, when that gentleman deliberately reported Smeaton\u2019s last words to her, to gain her reaction and hopefully one more sign of her guilt for Cromwell. The day before her execution, Anne told her ladies that apart from her treatment of Mary, her conscience was clear. In a last attempt to clear her name, she summoned Kingston to witness her taking the sacrament.Before the bread and wine touched her lips, she swore to her innocence. Once she had taken the bread and wine, she again swore to her innocence. Considering the extremely strong beliefs of heaven and hell that Tudor people held, it is inconceivable that Anne would have lied when she was about to die especially as lying would, it was believed, condemn a soul to hell for eternity. It is quite obvious from all the evidence, that Anne was \u2018stitched up\u2019. Many things she was supposed to have done rested on the evidence of one of her women, who was dead, and thus couldn\u2019t deny anything, (the \u2018prosecution\u2019 claimed that the dead woman had reported various things to others of Anne\u2019s ladies) and on the so obviously false reports of Jane Rochford. Henry was now free of his first wife who had died on January 7th, so the way was clear for the disposal of the second. But Cromwell told Henry a second divorce would not look at all good, especially since he had fought so long and hard to get a divorce from Katherine. A charge of some sort that would mean the death penalty was necessary, particularly since Henry wanted to ensure that his marriage to Jane Seymour was completely legitimate and therefore that any sons she bore would be completely legitimate too. He wanted no more trouble of the sort he had had between Katherine and Anne, where many people refused to accept Anne as Queen, thus raising doubts about Elizabeth\u2019s legitimacy. While Anne was without doubt innocent of adultery, she was guilty of trying to rule Henry the way she did before their marriage . Guilty of laughing at his clothes, his poems, and contradicting him a great deal of the time, guilty of constantly insisting that he put Katherine and Mary to death. Guilty of arrogance, overwhelming pride and ambition, guilty of forward manners in an age when women were expected to be meek and mild and obedient to their husbands ",

            "answer_text": "My 13th great-grandfather was Sir Henry Norris. I firmly believe he was set up because his position in the royal court made him the perfect target! He was the groom of the stool for King Henry. The groom of the stool is the person responsible for monitoring the king\u2019s diet and bowel movements as well as providing the king with water and towels to wash up with. Ok, I know what you are thinking, \u201cYour great grandfather had a really crappy job!!\u201d. Well actually it was a very sought after job as it was the most important and most intimate job in the court. The kings often shared intimate secretes with the groom of the stool. This made my great grandfather an extremely powerful man who was wealthy and owned much land. However, with wealth comes jealousy. A lot of people were envious of him and of his power within the court. This created a lot of hatred for him. To get \u201ceven\u201d one of his haters began a rumor as to him having intimate liaisons with Anne Boleyn. Because my great grandfather had free reign of the court and thus had access to the inner chambers of the court it was easy for people to believe he had slipped away with Anne for some fun, shall we say. Anne herself even confronted my great grandfather, after hearing the rumor, and asked him if it were true that he was in love with her! He of course denied he was in love with her and that should have been the end of that but it wasn\u2019t. King Henry had very extreme head injuries from jousting accidents. This created a very similar effect to the brain injuries found in football stars that have snapped and killed or beaten those around them. King Henry, in essence, was loosing his grip on reality. As a result it was very easy to convince him that Anne was enjoying certain liberties with my great grandfather who was happily married to my great grandmother may I mention! He had literally gone insane and was impotent as a result of his brain injuries and diabetes. This compounded the situation as, in his crazed state, he believed it was Anne\u2019s fault he didn\u2019t have a male heir to the throne. All of this came together for a perfect storm that resulted in the beheading of my great grandfather as well as Anne Boleyn. I know full well my great grandfather was innocent and was literally murdered by a mad man! ",
