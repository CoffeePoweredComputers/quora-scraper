            "answer_text": "I think it was because of the different mentality Spanish an English had when they went to America and how natives were seen. For the Spanish, the natives were infidels who had to be converted to Christianity, and America was a land that could be conquered: the Spanish arrived in America after 700 years of Reconqusita. The English Puritans came to America later, fleeing from the religious persecutions they suffered in England. They considered themselves the chosen people, the only truly Christian, the only truly respectful of the Word and the commandment of God. They considered America the promised land, felt almost like paradise on earth. If America was the promised land, the presence of the red-skinned Indian was perceived as an obstacle to the community of true believers. Redskin was necessarily a representation of the devil and even the devil's own reincarnation. How could there be other true human beings in a perfect or perfectible world, created to give refuge to the true good who had the mission of building the kingdom of God? It was not by chance that in the Anglo-Saxon world itself, the libertine and Calvinist French, it is discussed whether or not these individuals were descendants of Adam. But if the Redskins are representatives or the incarnation of the devil; the righteous not only have the right to exterminate them so that they do not hinder the great puritan project, the righteous even have a duty to remove them from the environment. That was the mindset and will of the Puritan world of Northern America. With dramatic consequences for the Indians, much more dramatic than there were where the French or the Spanish arrived. Because they never wanted and planned the extermination of the American Indians, while the Puritans wanted and planned it. While the atrocities committed against the Indians in Spanish America were considered crimes that the Crown should punish, in English America they were considered as meritorious and necessary acts for the good of the community of believers. The Puritans are the righteous who were granted the foundation of the New Jerusalem; the red skins are the reprobate, the denied, against whom each attack is admitted, is meritorious to the presence of God. So the Puritans themselves related the tremendous attrocities satisfied and proud. Even an epidemic that decimated the Indians was interpreted as a manifestation of the work of God that thus frees from the evil of the land destined for the righteous: in 1621, Edward Winslow spoke of the \"wonderful plague\" sent by God against the Indians, while that a few years later, in 1634, John Winthrop increased the dose, stating that the Indians \"almost all die here from smallpox, and in this way the Lord shows our right to this that we possess\". While the Spanish counted on the natives for their society, the English sought to create a society only for them in the native lands, without counting on the natives. In Spain the problem of the nature of the Indian was quickly overcome. Paul III with the famous bull Sublimis Deus of 1537, declares that indigenous are men with all the effects and abilities of Christians. Almost a century before the English arrived, the Spanish had recognized the same rights to the natives as to the rest of the Spanish. This won\u2019t happen in the English colonies until many centuries later (we can still find lots of atrocities as late as in the 20th Century!) While the Spanish mixed with the natives and integrated them into their society, they built hospitals and schools for the natives, appointed them bishops and mayors, the English exterminated them, expelled and marginalized them, they considered them undesirable guests to be eliminated. In Spain, mixed marriages were not only accepted, but encouraged by the Crown. As early as 1503 (almost 120 years before the Mayflower voyage!), the Queen sent a letter to the Governor of La Espa\u00f1ola, Nicol\u00e1s Obando, saying this: \u201cMandamos que el dicho nuestro Governador e las personas que por \u00e9l fueron nombradas para tener cargo de las dichas poblaciones, en ansimismo los dichos Capellanes procuren como los dichos indios se casen con sus mugeres en haz de la Santa Madre la Iglesia; e que ansimismo procuren que algunos cristianos se casen con algunas mugeres yndias, y las mugeres cristianas com algunos yndios. \u201c \u201cWe order the said governor and the persons by him designated in charge in those villages, and also the named chaplains procure that some christians marry indian women by the holy church and christian women with some indians\u201d.

            "answer_text": "Since the conquerors began to arrive in the new world. The natives made a pact with the Spanish, giving them a wife as a gift. As a symbol of union between the Spanish and an indigenous nation.  At first it was only to unite them in a pact, but then it became a control of the Spanish over indigenous peoples. The Spanish sought a way to legally obtain the fertile lands of indigenous peoples, marrying the indigenous women of those lands. At that time there were indigenous people who thought that the Spanish were handsome because they were new, exotic and foreign. But there were also indigenous peoples who preferred the traditional. To put an end to these conservative ideas, two plans were carried out. The first plan was to deliver titles and ranks. Indigenous peoples could increase their benefits by marrying and integrating with the Spanish. Because indigenous peoples were part of the Spanish empire. On the other hand, it is the religious pact, the evangelists exchanged the divinities of indigenous peoples for saints and Catholic virgins. The most famous case is that of the goddess Tonatzin, exchanged for the Virgin of Guadalupe. The virgin of mixed race, but who has a white hand and the other indigenous brunette.  It is true that Spaniards can become very unfaithful and have children everywhere like Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, but they are not like rabbits. The Spaniards lived together with the indigenous peoples, some Spaniards lived in the indigenous peoples and other indigenous peoples lived in neighborhoods like the Chinese neighborhoods next to the cities. Indigenous peoples had their market stalls for all who passed.  In addition to that, indigenous slavery was quickly abolished. ",
