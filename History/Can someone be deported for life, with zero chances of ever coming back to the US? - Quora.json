            "answer_text": "I knew a Canadian who was living in the USA (Texas to be specific) under a legal visa. He chose to get involved with drug smuggling between Texas and Canada on a small scale. One of his partners in Canada, after being caught, gave him up. He decided to turn himself in to authorities in Texas with the hope of being able to stay in the USA after his punishment. After serving a few months, he was released - directly into the waiting hands of the INS who gave him a hearing and deported him back to Canada. The USA probably figured that they had enough home grown criminals and they did not any extras. He died about ten years later, still trying to return to the USA without the slightest hint that it would ever work. ASIDE: He was not charged with smuggling in Canada because of Double Jeopardy rules in Canada but he was an ongoing person of interest for the RCMP. He chose to live in Mexico to avoid this scrutiny.
