            "answer_text": "Short answer: between 33\u2033 and 40\u2033 of blade, with another 6\u2033 to 8\u2033 of grip, plus an inch or two of pommel. Long answer: nobody knows. \u201cBastard sword\u201d is a historical term that appears in armory inventories, but nobody knows exactly what it means. Its modern meaning varies somewhat according to who you're talking to. To some people, it means a two-handed sword that is small enough and light enough to wear on the belt and wield with one hand. I think this is the most common modern definition, and it's the one I assume in my short answer above. This is the sense in which D&D used to use the term (5th edition D&D has dropped the term), and is also usually what people mean when they say \u201chand and a half sword.\u201d To other people, bastard sword specifically means a particularly small version of the above (i.e., closer to the 33\u2033 of blade and 6\u2033 of grip ends of the spectrum). You'll sometimes see this meaning used in older western martial arts publications. To still other people, it means a sword like I described with a \u201cwaisted\u201d grip, like this:  Instead of this:  All of this terminological confusion comes from the fact that none of those old inventories actually says what they mean by \u201cbastard sword,\u201d leaving modern people to speculate. And even if historical sources were specific, it's entirely possible that they wouldn't all agree with each other. ",

            "answer_text": "There\u2019s no definitive answer for that. A look at the Internet search results will give you a variety of possible theories, but not one conclusive enough. Some say a bastard sword falls between the arming (one-handed) sword and the longsword, thus rendering it slightly shorter than a longsword. Others feel that it falls between the longsword and the great sword, which makes it longer than the longsword. Technically you can say that a bastard sword is a sub-class of the longsword. To break it down further, let\u2019s take into consideration the arming sword, long sword and the bastard sword. The arming sword is a weapon that is best used one handed. The oldest of the three, it was popular among the knights who used it with a shield. Then came the longsword which was perhaps most effective with two hands but on occasions, for specific techniques, could be used with one. The bastard sword had a special grip which enabled the user to use two hands for more power and specific techniques. Unlike the longsword, there was no compromise; the weight and the design were such that it was equally effective with one hand or two. By that definition, you can say that it was not as long as the longsword (if it was then one-handed use would be problematic) and maybe only slightly longer than the arming sword. ",
