            "answer_text": "It is not realized today that, at one time, the Japanese led the way in maritime aviation. It began when they launched the world\u2019s first aircraft carrier in 1922, 7,500 ton IJN Hosho. By 1941, the Japanese Navy had six fleet carriers that were worked up to a VERY high degree of expertise. For example, they had a system of spotting planes on deck such that they were launching them every few seconds which was far better than the United States or any other country. They had a cadre of pilots second to none on earth flying some of the best planes (at the time). The Navy pilots were battle hardened veterans of combat in China. Whether it was in a fighter, or bomber, they were the absolute best at the time. After 74 years, there aren\u2019t very many people who can remember that those Japanese carrier pilots were Hell on wheels. The Japanese Army had attacked China beginning in 1937. By 1939, they were mired in a war they could not win, nor afford to lose, so they asked the Navy for some help on long range fighter cover. The Navy loaned them pilots and planes and they cut their teeth destroying the Chinese air-force. These were the pilots assigned to the Kido Butai. Trained, experienced, deadly. The Zeke, or Zero as we now refer to it had a combination of characteristics that made it the best dogfighter of the war. In a dogfight, it could take on any and every plane and win. The Val was a dive bomber that was better than even the vaunted Stuka Germany fielded. The Kate was a great torpedo and level bomber that proved its mettle at Pearl Harbor and all to many other places across the South Pacific. During the time that carriers changed from a novelty to a serious weapon of war, the Japanese were in the forefront of the learning curve. They were constantly looking to other countries to see what they were doing and learned from their successes and mistakes. The British attack at Taranto against the Italian fleet suggested the an attack in a shallow harbor could succeed, so they devised special modifications to their torpedoes so that they could function perfectly in shallow water. They had no real armor piercing bombs, so they took 16 inch cannon shells from their battleships, welded fins on them, and successfully used them during their attack on Pearl Harbor. The real \u201csecret\u201d was practice. They practiced for years and especially in the months leading up to Pearl Harbor. They dropped dozens of practice torpedoes in Kagoshima Bay until a miss was almost unheard of. They practiced takeoffs and landings all day long. By the time of Pearl Harbor, they were possibly the best carrier pilots on the planet. ",

            "answer_text": "Prior to Pearl Harbor, the utilization of aircraft carriers was still in development. These ranged from aircraft carriers operating singly with its aircraft to scouting and spotting in support of the battle line to fleet protection. But one specific mission assigned to a carrier was to sink an enemy\u2019s carrier. The US Navy, Royal Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy each had their own ideas. The most significant change in aircraft carrier operations was the formation of the fast carrier strike group. This was the brainstorm of air-minded Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. By 1941, Japan would have 6 large aircraft carriers assigned to 3 carrier divisions of 2 similar ships each. CarDiv 1: Kaga, Akagi; CarDiv 2: Soryu, Hiryu, and CarDiv 5: Shokaku, Zuikaku. They were combined into the 1st Air Fleet, the Kido Butai. This new doctrine focused on first destroying an enemy\u2019s carrier force and then its battle line while also preserving an effective defense. The Imperial Japanese Navy proved the concept with its Pearl Harbor Raid. The Kido Butai encountered no opposing carrier forces in its rampage through the Malay Archipelago to strike Darwin, Australia. In the Indian Ocean, it sank the defenseless HMS Hermes on the Trimcomalee Raid. However, the first carrier-vs-carrier combat was at the Battle of the Coral Sea, Shokaku and Zuikaku versus Lexington and Yorktown. And then the Battle of Midway followed with the Kido Butai minus CarDiv 5. If one were to dismiss the impact of code breaking the Japanese Naval Code JN-25B, the US victories at Coral Sea and Midway did not discredit the Japanese Navy doctrine at carrier warfare. In fact, after Midway, the Battle of Eastern Solomons resulted in a draw but at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, the Hornet was sunk. However, the lesson learned from these two carrier-vs-carrier battles is that the winner shall be the force with the larger number of carriers and planes. The lesson brought home to the US Navy was its version of the Kido Butai, or the Fast Carrier Task Force. While in the 1930\u2019s the Imperial Japanese Navy was able to amass carrier formations of 4 to 6 carriers and war game with them, no other navy in the world had this capability. But the US Navy rearmament bills passed by the US Congress in the late 1930\u2019s, resulting in the Two Ocean Navy Act, provided a modern carrier force that only the newly deceased Yamamoto could envy in 1943. The US Navy\u2019s answer to the Kido Butai was Task Force 58/38. While the Japanese Navy did not have the benefit of carrier battles to continue the development of its 1st Air Fleet, the US Navy observed and learned well from their encounters. One could write that Yamamoto was the only supporter of naval aviation in the Japanese Navy but WWII US Navy had the likes of William Halsey, Forrest Sherman, Marc Mitscher, John McCain, Frederick Sherman, among others, to complete the doctrine. To answer the question, it is not an issue that the Japanese Navy became so experienced but that its doctrine was different from all of the other navies by placing the aircraft carrier ahead of the battle line.

Also the Zero, their \u201cgo to plane\u201d had been around for a few years and the pilots and flight deck crews got to spend a lot of time flying and getting used to it, conducting landing and takeoffs. But no one was shooting at them as opposed to the Americans who started off being shot at from the get go. So consider that until the last hour or so of the Midway operation, most of those Japanese crews and pilots had never been in the position of being the victim of an attack. So their experience was primarily with offensive operations. When the initiative changed they had many issues, which is why they lost 4 carriers at Midway. At Pearl Harbor there was literally almost no opposition. Consider a line by the character John Brooks played by John Wayne in \u201cThe Shootist\u201d. When he challenges the boy to shoot at a target on a tree, the boy manages to group his shots almost as good as the famous John Brooks and exclaims that \u201cI almost did as well as you did Mr. Brooks\u201d. To which the Wayne character replies, \u201cit\u2019s easy to group your shots son when the tree\u2019s not shooting back\u201d. Same applies to the Japanese. It\u2019s easy to do a sneak attack you\u2019ve practiced for a year. But at Midway, when the \u201ctree\u201d was shooting back, it didn\u2019t go so well. ",

            "answer_text": "How did the Imperial Japanese Navy become so experienced in operating aircraft carriers in World War 2 even though there had been no real carrier combat before Pearl Harbor and Midway? In truth the Imperial Japanese Navy was not experienced in operating aircraft carriers in WWII. The IJN had excellent aircraft, experienced, finely honed aircrews and an effective torpedo design that could be dropped from an aircraft and not bottom out in the shallower waters of the harbor. Their weakness, as was proven out at the Battle of Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway were the design and management of their aircraft carriers. The IJN spent little effort on design and training for fire fighting aboard ship. In addition, in the heat of combat they left ordnance on their flight decks with fueled aircraft, switching from the bombs intended for use against land targets to the bombs and torpedoes to use against ships. When their ships were struck while so vulnerable their crews weren\u2019t properly trained and equipped to fight the fires to save their ships. Poor design, poor doctrine and poor training. ",

            "answer_text": "Four reasons. Note that the statement that the Japanese carrier aircraft were inexperienced is incorrect. Training: A rigorous training regime was the principal reason for the effectiveness of the First Air Fleet. Japan at the onset of the Pacific War had the finest, most proficient carrier pilots in the world. Their training system focused heavily on excellence at the cost of quantity. And this can be seen in the their performance. The focus on excellence, however, proved to be a huge mistake. After the first year of the War, these magnificently trained pilots were gone and Japan had few trained pilots to replace them with. The result was the Marianas Turkey Shoot. https://www.histclo.com/essay/war/ww2/cou/jap/force/air/w2jfai-train.html Aircraft: The Japanese had the best cattier aircraft. Especially the nimble Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter. Torpedoes: The Japanese had a torpedo that worked. Not only did the Long Lance torpedo work and the American torpedoes did not, but it was the finest torpedo in use at the time. Experience: Japan invaded China (1937) and for over 4 years before Pearl Harbor was involved in a war. China had no navy, but a major element of their strategy was to cut off China from the outside world. This meant that much of the Japanese military effort was to seize the Chinese coastal areas and ports, And in this effort, the Japanese carriers were used extensively to support army operations.

            "answer_text": "Let me start by saying that Japan had be preparing for war for a long time. It first became fascinated by the possibility of launching naval bombers since 1913 and had been training to achieve optimal efficiency since then. Even before Pearl Harbor, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was very experienced in carrier combat. Carrier planes were used to bombard China\u2019s coast during the Sino-Japanese war in the late 1930s. By 1941, the IJN had the ability to launch and coordinate 180 planes from 6 carriers at one go. Bear in mind this was a time where most navies did not have aircraft carriers and even in the United States, carriers were considered experimental technology. (One of the reasons why the United States used carriers was because of the loss of battleships during Pearl Harbor.) For the navies that did have carriers, they could only launch and coordinate 30\u201360 planes at a time from a maximum of 2 carriers in a battlegroup. ",

            "answer_text": "Give them as much credit for evolutionary creativity as you give the USN. Both sides were evolving around the same lines prior to 1941 in response to the growing capabilities of naval aircraft (contrary to what others may tell you, neither side was flying junk off of their CVs in 1941). The Japanese did evolve the idea of massing fleet carriers for a powerful punch faster than anyone else. They developed this largely by themselves, perhaps with a little help from observing the British raid on Taranto. Let\u2019s not forget they had several years of combat experience fro the war with China. This type of operation also appealed to Yamamoto\u2019s gambling instincts. Ironically, they were only able to pull this type of massive air strike three times: Pearl Harbor, the Indian Ocean raids, and (arguably) Midway. I left out the Philippine Seas battle because the speeds of the various elements of the Japanese task force were so different as to preclude effective joint operation. This is not a surprise. Japanese combat formations in most of the war were tragically unfocused. They loved to scatter units all over the place in a vain effort to throw the enemy off balance. And let us not forget that they never let go of the idea that the Decisive Battle would be conducted with battleships. Off the top of my head, I don\u2019t recall Yamamoto ever leading an operation from a CV; he was always at Truk or in a battleship (usually anchored in Truk harbor). ",
