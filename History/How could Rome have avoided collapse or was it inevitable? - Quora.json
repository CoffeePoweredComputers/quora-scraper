            "answer_text": "How could Rome have avoided collapse or was it inevitable?  While I hesitate to use \u201cinevitable,\u201d Rome had a long run and there probably wasn\u2019t much that could have been done (beyond what actually was done) in order to prolong Roman civilization beyond the term it enjoyed. Rome had changed so much from the founding of the city in 753 BC to the loss of Rome to non-Roman forces in 476 AD (more than a thousand years) that it would be reasonable to say that it was not the same Rome that fell in 476 AD as that which was founded in 753 BC. It was a different civilization by that time, so that even if Rome and the political institutions immediately associated with the city of Rome had been further perpetuated, one could still have spoken of the \u201cfall\u201d of Rome. And even after Odoacer took over in Rome, the institutions of Rome did not suddenly disappear. These institutions had been changing for more than a thousand years, and they continued to change. They continue to change today. Rome has been continuously inhabited since its foundation. Moreover, Rome (i.e., Roman civilization) had a second life in Constantinople from Constantine the Great\u2019s re-founding of the city as Constantinople (prior to this it was the Greek city of Byzantium) in 324 AD, which endured until the Turks conquered the city in 1453 AD\u2014another thousand years for Roman civilization. There was also the medieval attempt revive Roman institutions under Charlemagne starting in 800 AD, and this \u201cHoly Roman Empire\u201d endured until 1806. This \u201crevival\u201d didn\u2019t really have any continuity with Roman institutions, but it did attempt to revive some of the symbolic meanings and values of Roman civilization. So Rome and the Roman idea lasted for a long time, and it was repeatedly revived under changed circumstances. What could have been done to perpetuate the Roman idea was done, and much that was valuable in Roman civilization continues to live on in our own civilization. By the time Roman civilization was over, it had already changed into something unrecognizable as Rome, so that what \u201ccollapsed\u201d (and I dislike \u201ccollapse\u201d as much as I dislike \u201cinevitable\u201d) wasn\u2019t Rome but a descendant of Rome.

            "answer_text": "That is one of those very hypothetical questions one really can\u2019t answer with certainty. But the probable answer is that it was inevitable, for the simple reason that most cultures mature and decline. And Rome didn\u2019t really collapse, so much as slowly decline and disintegrate (the Empire, that is). A key problem for Rome is that increasingly the Empire depended on members of the very groups it was fighting - the various Germanic groups - to defend it. This led to a dilution of the loyalty of the armed forces and to a real crisis when the nervous Romans actually slaughtered the wives and children of some Germanic soldiers while the latter were away. Then when the Goths offered them several chances to ransom the city, they reacted with delays and tricky dealing - i.e., with arrogance, which is another problem that comes from generations of being dominant. Rome didn\u2019t disappear after it \u201cfell\u201d - Goths were working again for Rome decades later. But it already had trouble ruling an extended empire with pressure from various outside groups and the lack of fighting spirit among native Romans and the failure to really win the loyalty of what were now largely foreign fighting forces didn\u2019t bode well. One could imagine an alternate history where, first of all, Rome remained a Republic, so that each citizen felt more immediate commitment to the Nation, as opposed to increasingly being the subject of an emperor, and where Rome halted its expansion before the first major defeat at the hands of the Germans. But a combination of being over-extended and over-weaning, and a growing taste for luxury that was criticized early on, led to a long, slow decline that was probably imperceptible for those living through it and too far advanced by the time it became fatal. Otherwise, consider subsequent empires. Charlemagne\u2019s hardly lasted two generations. Napoleon\u2019s left its mark all over Europe, but barely lasted decades; France\u2019s dominance overall only lasted a few centuries. The English empire was mainly beyond Europe and died with colonialism. From the broadest perspective, it is actually immensely impressive that the Roman Empire survived as long as it did. Decline to some degree is built into all that is human. ",
