            "answer_text": "The term Christian was first used in Antioch after Barnabas and later Saul (Paul) had been teaching the gospel message to \u201cGreeks\u201d there, that is to say, to non-Jews. It meant, literally, little Christs, or followers of Christ, and was used to refer to the believers in Antioch because of their Christlike behavior. I don't mean to harp too much on semantics, but Christian really isn't a very precise term, and probably not what you actually meant by your question. You see, a person can act and from all external appearances appear to be Christian and yet not be saved. Anyone can claim to be Christian and as men (humans) we are unable to look into their hearts as God does. Paul calls on us to judge those inside the church by their fruits, but I'm convinced that some even in the church are very good actors, so without the insight of the Holy Spirit, that\u2019s a very imperfect judgment call. But God knows the heart and will make that judgment with complete accuracy. Jesus made this clear when he stated in Matthew 7:21\u201323: (ESV Strong's) 21 \u201cNot everyone who says to me, \u2018Lord, Lord,\u2019 will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 On that day many will say to me, \u2018Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?\u2019 23 And then will I declare to them, \u2018I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.\u2019\u201d So I will answer your question as if it had been, \u201cDo most Protestants consider Roman Catholics not to be saved?\u201d, that is, whether or not they have attained the gift of eternal life as true believers and followers of Jesus Christ. Even in this form the question is problematic since Protestant and Roman Catholic present their own difficulties in terminology. I've never seen any survey results on this, trustworthy or otherwise. So I can only comment on my own personal observations. I would say that most of my Protestant friends hold many of the doctrines and practices of the Catholic Church to be heretical. At the same time, we hold out hope that some of our Catholic friends are saved based upon a simple faith in Jesus\u2019 divinity as the Son of God, His perfect sacrifice on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins (often referred to as His \u201cfinished work\u201d - because it was the only payment necessary and acceptable for the forgiveness of our sins - and His resurrection. I won't go into all the specific doctrinal differences between Catholicism and Protestantism as others have already done that in other answers; but one of the major differences is salvation by grace alone through faith alone and that faith itself being a gift from God (the Protestant position in its essence) versus salvation by grace through faith plus works (the Catholic position in its essence). Keep in mind this is a very great simplification of both views. Catholic apologists (i.e., one who argues in favor of something), who want to minimize the doctrinal differences will tell you that human works are not what saves but that the works are simply a manifestation of the faith. Protestants will retort that they know many atheists who are full of \u201cgood works\u201d, but by their own definition, that is, the title \u201catheist\u201d, they cannot be saved. But regardless of the Catholic church\u2019s official teachings on the subject, I can tell you that most everyday Catholics I've heard speak on the subject indicate they believe in a crass works-based salvation, sayings things like \u201cHopefully my good deeds will outweigh my bad and that the Man upstairs will let me into heaven.\u201d There is simply no way you can reconcile that viewpoint with the clear teaching of scripture to the contrary. For example, in Ephesians 2:8\u20139, Paul writes, \u201c(ESV Strong's) 8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, 9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\u201d I am a Protestant and so I will expound on that viewpoint. Scripture teaches that only an absolutely pure blood sacrifice can provide permanent salvation by taking away sin. And Jesus is that only pure and perfect sacrifice; therefore it is only by his perfect work on the cross that we can be saved. We are driven to want to do good deeds by our faith and the free gift of salvation, but since our good deeds are imperfect, they can in no way provide for our salvation. I have many friends who were raised in the Catholic church and subsequently were converted and became members of an evangelical church who have said they don't see how people still in the Catholic Church can be saved. They say this because, as they have experienced it, the current and historical leadership of the RCC throws so many obstacles in the way of that simple confession of faith required for salvation. In other words, the greatest critics I have seen of the Catholic Church are its former members. That being said, there are many Protestants and Catholics alike who want to emphasize the commonalities in our beliefs and on that basis accept each other as fellow believers. This is a tremendous temptation, because if we were able to accept one another as true believers, then that would be eliminate a huge obstacle to our being able to work together for the furtherance of God\u2019s Kingdom. But Protestants who know their history, who understand that many of the early reformers were willing to die (as many did) for their doctrinal differences with the Catholic Church and why, believe strongly this is simply not possible - that it is a bridge too far, so to speak. They tend to emphasize those specific doctrinal differences [see John Simpson\u2019s excellent answer to this same question] rather than the similarities. But these, I would guess, aren't \u201cmost Protestants\u201d. As I alluded to earlier, the term Protestant has lost a lot of its relevance for many people. Take younger believers in evangelical non-denominational churches, for example. My guess is that only a very small percentage of them know what the Protestant Reformation was all about, or care. They hopefully know correct Protestant doctrine, but may well not know what Catholics believe or the differences between the two; and since the mainstream media tends to refer to Catholics as Christian, they may simply accept that. Or they may have been taught by their parents and/or church school teachers that Catholics aren't Christian but don't really understand the specifics of why and may tend therefore to discount those teachings. So to sum it all up and return to your original question, I would have to honestly guess that most \u201cProtestants\u201d, that is non-Catholic believers, consider Roman Catholics to be \u201cChristians\u201d. But I would also qualify that answer by saying that most older Protestants believe most Catholics are not saved, and that most younger members of Protestant denominations probably believe most Catholics are \u201cChristians\u201d. Hope this has provided some clarity but if not, at least has provided some food for thought. ",

            "answer_text": "Here are what I think are the five most glaring and significant issues that separate the Catholic Church from the gospel of grace: 1) Justification Evangelicals teach that sinners are justified on the basis of faith alone, and that ones\u2019 faith is placed in the finished substitutionary work of Jesus on the cross, confirmed by his glorious resurrection, and that this is a gift based entirely on his grace. Finally, that justification is complete and total at the moment of our conversion, and that believers never grow more justified. In contrast the Catholic church teaches that justification is a process that includes works (with those works \u201cinfusing\u201d one\u2019s faith), and that those works are the cause of the justification process. Beyond that, the Catholic Church teaches: \u201cIf anyone says, that by faith alone the impious is justified; let him be anathema\u201d (Council of Trent #9) Or: \u201cIf anyone says that the justice [or justification] received is not preserved and also not increased before God through good works but that those works are merely the fruits and signs of justification obtained, but not the cause of the increase, let him be anathema\u201d (Council of Trent, 24). 2. The Pope as head of the church For evangelicals, the church is made up of all of those who have been justified by God through faith. Local churches are led by elders, and each church is generally autonomous. Jesus Christ is the head of the church, and there is no authority over any local church on earth apart from Scripture. Elders and pastors are fallible in how they lead the church. In the Roman Catholic teaching, the church is composed of laity and is led by those who have received the sacrament of Holy Orders (deacons, priests and bishops). The head of the church is the Pope, who when speaking authoritatively on matters relating to the church, is protected from the possibility of error concerning doctrine and morals of the church. Also, for anyone to be saved, they must be under the Pope\u2019s authority: \u201cWe declare, say, define, and pronounce that it is absolutely necessary for the salvation of every human creature to be subject to the Roman Pontiff\u201d (Unam Sanctam, 1302). 3. Mass vs. communion For evangelicals, communion is commemorative, and acts as a remembrance of the substitutionary atoning work of Jesus. The bread is symbolic of the body, and wine symbolic of the blood. There is nothing mystical or meritorious about it, but it is a means of grace and of provoking growth in godliness. The Catholic Church teaches transubstantiation, that the bread and wine are transformed literally into the body and blood of Jesus. Thus in the mass, the priest calls Jesus down from heaven, and in the breaking of the bread Jesus is re-sacrificed. The mass is meritorious, as one of the seven sacraments, and it is a \u201ctrue and proper sacrifice.\u201d Here again is the council of Trent: If any one saith that in the Mass a true and proper sacrifice is not offered to God; or, that to be offered is nothing else but that Christ is given us to eat; let him be anathema.\u201d As a side note, many of the Protestants and puritans made martyrs by the RCC went to their deaths over this issue. They considered participation in the Mass to be idolatry, and refused, and often were put to death for their refusal. 4. Mary For evangelicals, Mary was Jesus\u2019 mother, a sinner, and one who was saved from her sins by her faith in Jesus. We recognize a period of her life where she did not believe in Jesus (see, for example, Mark 3:30-33), but that by the time of Jesus\u2019 death she had placed her faith in him as her Messiah. She had other children after Jesus, and died a physical death. She is to be admired as a woman of faith. In the Catholic Church, Mary is an object of devotion\u2014and in much of the world, she is an object of outright worship. It is normative to pray to her (consider, for example, the Hail Mary), and it is taught that she was sinless. In fact, the Immaculate Conception is the Catholic doctrine that Mary was conceived without a sin nature, thus she was not a recipient of Jesus\u2019 redemption, but instead was a participant in that redemption. She was a perpetual virgin, and did not die a physical death, but was rather assumed into heaven, where she reigns now as the Queen of heaven and is herself Ineffabilis Deus (\u201cineffable God,\u201d or \u201cinexplicably divine\u201d) 5. Purgatory Evangelicals believe that there is no such place as purgatory, but that hell is real and heaven is obtainable only as a gift from God, through faith in Jesus\u2019 sacrifice, and this is all of grace. For those who place their faith in Jesus, when they die they are immediately ushered into glory, where they will be in the presence of the Lord. In Catholic theology, purgatory is where Catholics go when they die. Only those who are in a state of grace may go there, and once you have suffered for your non-mortal sins, you are made ready to see heaven. Thus purgatory is not eternal\u2014but it is like hell in another way: purgatory involves both flames and suffering, and serves to make atonement for sins that you did not confess before you die. In many ways, Purgatory is the glue that holds the system together. Because it is a system where eternal judgment is based on works, and because sins are frequent and it is impossible to know and confess all of ones\u2019 sins, purgatory is an essential piece of Catholic theology. I give this list here simply because it always surprises me to find those that say \u201cCatholics and Christians believe the same thing on the important issues, it is just in details where they differ.\u201d Well, I suppose it matters what the \u201cimportant issues are\u201d but these five certainly touch on areas that are essential to the gospel. 5 differences between Catholic theology and the gospel",

Probably same with Calvinists. However, they are reflecting an older attitude extremely common among Calvinists or Lutherans or Anglicans back 100, 150 and more years ago, since basically 30 Years War and even before. Those who did and do not have a motive and they have purported reasons. Among purported reasons, there is accusation of idolatry, accusation of irrationality, accusation of disloyalty to parents and prince, hence RC would be \u201clawless\u201d, accusation of RRC being the prophecied Whore of Babylon (which some RC would consider Modernist Apostate clergy to be), accusation of Papal office being Antichrist. A motive is, if one cannot accuse RC of being completely not in grace with God, completely heterodox and hence sham Christians, Protestants need to face up to the Catholic accusation against Protestantism : they are not the Church which existed and exists and shall exist from Apostles to us and to Doomsday, they do not hear the successors of the Apostles, they have come with another Gospel than that given by the Apostles and their successors, they have cut themselves off the Church. And some of them, like Anglicans, Lutherans and Calvinists, belong to bodies which have supported r\u00e9gimes who persecuted Catholics, or rebelled against r\u00e9gimes for not persecuting Catholics (like what Roundheads did in 1642\u201345, against the lawful King Charles I). They also twist Scripture according to carnal desire when denying necessity of fasting and of alms, like when allowing divorce and remarriage, and indirectly (more money than flesh, directly) when condoning usury.

The \u201cmost\u201d qualifier is irrelevant, since there is no central authority for protestants (that\u2019s the point) meaning they can pretty much believe whatever they want (and they do). To that extent, it has been my experience as a Catholic male that the further the protestant church in question strays from mainline sects (i.e. lutheranism, presbyterianism, etc) and gets closer to the cultish jehovas witnesses, sda\u2019s and street preachers, the more likely they are to had very odd beliefs including that Catholics are all going to hell since we\u2019re not Christian. These same people have no concept of church history or basic theology\u2026they are usually \u201cbible only\u201d people, who believe anyone can pick up and immediately understand the bible completely. And they prefer to shout rather than discuss anything, since they have no response to questions other than their own memorized rants. I will say this; out of all the weird protestant sects out there, I have noticed a new breed of \u201cbible followers\u201d (they don\u2019t even call themselves \u201cChristian\u201d, since they disavow any organized religion and claim to follow mosaic/jewish law and celebrations). While they have no actual \u201cchurch\u201d they have many online groups, which is convenient for them so they can believe whatever they want as individuals, and at the same time claim to \u201cfollow the bible\u201d. Their major issue in life seems to be convincing people of the \u201creal\u201d spelling/pronunciation of YHWH and Jesus\u2026whom they call \u201cyahoohsoo\u201d \u201cyeshuwah\u201d \u201cyeyehyah-baby\u201d or whatever, and have very heated conversations over this.

            "answer_text": "I cannot speak for \"most\" protestants, I am sure that \"many\" protestants do not consider Roman Catholics as Christians. I am not in any position to judge who is Christian and who is not. The Lord knows His own people regardless of denomination.  To become a Christian you must be born one. No not into a family that is Christian; I am speaking about a rebirth of your spirit which happens when you believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from death and confess that He is Lord. When you do this you are born into the family of God and He sees you as His new creation and what He has began in you He will also finish. Whatever else you believe or disbelieve is secondary to this, however, as you grow in Jesus your beliefs will change and you will abandon childish concepts and acknowledge truth.  I have seen this happen in people of all stripes and regardless of previous religious affiliation. I have also seen Christians of all stripes be it baptist, catholic, pentecostal, etc.  stall their growth by holding on to traditions of their varying Churches. I think in many cases this is because of a particular ministers doctrine and their love for and trust in the person. This is why I cannot stress enough the importance of seeking out a highly personal relationship with Christ and asking for revelation knowledge of His truth from a guileless heart of faith. ",

To use \"Roman Catholic\" to speak of the Catholic Church is a leftover slur from post-\"reformation\" England, and is only used in English.  Roman Catholic is never used by the official Catholic Church.  That being said, Protestants do not normally consider Catholics to be Christians for the simple reason that is the way that they are brought up, that is the way that they were raised - I know, I was raised that way.  What they don't understand is that Jesus Christ only founded one Church, guaranteed one Church, and said that it was His Body and the Holy Spirit would guide it to the end of time.  Protestants who use the word \"Christian\" to describe themselves are only accurate to the extent that they are validly baptized and believe in the Nicene Creed in its traditional interpretation.  Any other usage of Christian is to do violence to the word.  Which is one of the reasons that ecumenical discussions are so problematic.  We are all using the same words to mean completely different things. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say that it depends on the type of Protestant. Mainline protestants tend to consider Catholics as Christians. Many Evangelicals and \"non-denominational\" Christians do. However, there is a certain, vocal subset of Protestant Christianity that is extremely anti-Catholic and does not consider Catholics to be Christians, and they tend to be most numerous in the United States. The reason they say Catholics are not Christian is they believe that Catholics have adopted a number of practices and doctrines that contradict Biblical teaching; doctrines such as the papacy (which they sometimes equate to idolatry), veneration of Mary, prayers to saints, worship of the Eucharist, etc. They also believe that the Pope is the Whore of Babylon, as per the Book of Revelation, essentially the anti-Christ, and his followers are the instruments of Satan. As they are very vocal, one gets the impression that Protestants tend to think that way, but most don't. They just disagree with Catholicism. ",

The reasons for this varies; there ignorance of what Catholics actually believe as to what they were taught, there tradition to hate Catholics and I can guess sheer stupidity by the founders like E.G. White aka Ellen White one of the founders of Seventh Day Adventists. She is still known as E.G. White as the Adventists dont want you to know E.G. is a female. I have met many Protestants and on the whole they do accept Catholics as Christians but you still have the quacks who think Catholics say the Pope is equal to God, we don't. Or that we worship the Blessed Virgin Mary, once again we don't. In an online world where truthful answers can be found on Catholic Answers about what Catholics actually believe. I can only believe that those protestants who don't accept Catholics as Christians simply fear the truth. On the whole there are 1.2 billion Catholics and listed separately there are 1.1 billion Christians and less than half, perhaps even less than 25% don't think Catholics are not Christian. ",

But my own experience is that generally over the last two centuries most Protestants have come to a live-and-let-live accommodation with Catholics, and I have met very few myself who would consider Catholics non-Christian. Here in Korea Catholics are described with a separate word from Christians, but that is largely semantics and not doctrine. The few I've known who assert that Catholics are non-Christian state that Catholics revere Mary to the point of deifying her. I do not believe this is true and only list it as a reason I've been given. I've been in Lutheran services where the pastor prayed for the well-being of the pope. Unthinkable centuries ago, but I think now many Protestant churches are comfortable enough to respect the pope as a man of Christ while not feeling any obligation or subjugation to him. ",

Oliver Cromwell was tolerant of all Christian denominations but not Roman Catholics as he did not consider them to be Christians. Rather, along with Luther, he considered that the Roman Church had interposed itself between God & Man and was in that sense the \"anti-Christ\". Luther estimated that a third of humanity had gone to Hell because of this & was therefore dead against the RC church. Extremely violent persecutions did not help - such as the Huguenots & Waldensians (see Milton's sonnet \"Avenge O Lord, thy slaughtered saints\"). However given the anti-social nature of many Medieval heresies- which preached that the Second Coming was imminent only after we had slaughtered the rich, the priests & the Jews. I doubt they were that fussed about the Jews but you can see how the church might want to set up an Inquiry (or rather \"Inquisition\") to get them first. ",

            "answer_text": "The answer, as it is in many cases, is that it depends. Most Evangelicals today (think Rick Warren, Greg Laurie, etc.) are primarily interested in seeing growth in a believer's relationship with God. They are also broadly ecumenical with many denominations. They will often work in collaboration with Catholics on social issues where their faith informs a common sense of ethics (i.e. abortion).  However, some are not so friendly. Modern day Protestants that identify as Reformed and the heirs of Calvin remain decidedly opposed to Roman Catholicism. Here is a good example of what this can look like (http://www.aomin.org/aoblog/index.php/2013/05/23/a-case-study-in-apostasy/). This strand of Protestantism has quite a following. Noted pastors like John MacArthur and John Piper hold similar views. I myself am a member of a church that is not Roman Catholic, but also not much different. When I befriended some Baptists of this stripe, they were shocked to learn of my church attendance and effectively denounced me as a heretic.  Most Protestants, however, are charitable glad to find common ground and fellowship with their brethren in the faith. ",

That, plus the atrocious behavior on the part of both sides during the Reformation/Counter-Reformation has left a bad taste that lingers to this day. (About the only group with clean hands during that horrific period were the Anabaptists, pacifists who, in attempting to follow Christ\u2019s example, were persecuted by Protestants and Catholics alike. Menno Simons. Pr\u00e9sent\u00e9!) Bridging the chasm of tradition, theology, practice, and history is a monumental task but I think I bear witness to the fact that it can happen. As it happens, the Church now sees Protestants as \u201cseparated brethren\u201d, and will, for example, accept Protestant baptism as fulfillment of the Catholic sacrament. Main-stream Protestants will accept Catholics as co-coreligionists. Fundamentalist/Evangelical - not so much. The same with so-called \u201cTraditionalist\u201d Catholics, or Sedevacantists for that matter, who see the post-Vatican as infected by Protestantism/ Modernism. ",
