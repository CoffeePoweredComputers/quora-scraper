            "answer_text": "Siberia\u2019s a big place. According to Google, the land area of Siberia is greater than that of Europe. Though it was sparsely populated in the classical and medieval eras, a variety of people groups and nations lived there at one time or another. Western Siberia (Ural Mountains area) was by 1000 BC the homeland of peoples who spoke the earliest versions of Uralic languages. Most of these people later migrated west beyond the Urals, some as far as Finland and the Baltic. Others (Mordvins, Meshchera, etc) mixed with Slavs in northeastern Russia proper. A smaller percentage remained east of the Urals. The Komi and Khanty peoples, who lived a simple tribal life for most of the middle ages, were in the area from 200 BC to 1100 AD and remain there still. Southern and central Siberia were the home of a large variety of Turkic peoples in this time period. These people often lived a nomadic existence. The southern groups developed horse and cattle cultures, while the northern groups were based on hunting and fishing, or sometimes reindeer herding. The northern Turkic peoples were generally very primitive, not developing beyond the stone age or early bronze age. In the south, on the other hand, large nomadic empires sometimes rose. One example is the Gokturks (6th to 8th century AD), whose empire stretched from Manchuria to the Black Sea at its height. Though most of their empire was further south, they did control or influence large swaths of southern Siberia. The history of northeastern Siberia is much more obscure. The people who lived there and still do to this day are perhaps descended from paleolithic people who decided to stay instead of just passing through. The lifestyle of these people was highly dependent on their location and environment. People near a lake or river would fish, developing a fish culture, while others just a few leagues away would develop an entirely different trapping culture. Various ethnic groups inhabited the area. Many still hold fast to the old ways. ",

            "answer_text": "Native Americans originated from Siberia One wave of migration from Siberia populated the Americas, DNA shows Study also reveals some groups in South America have closer genetic ties to indigenous peoples of Australia, New Guinea and the Andaman Islands than to present-day Native Americans Most scientists agree the Americas were peopled by forefathers who crossed the Bering land and ice bridge which connected modern-day Russia and Alaska in Earth\u2019s last glacial period. mongol conquest of Siberia The Mongols had long maintained relations with the peoples of the Siberian forest (taiga). They called them oin irged (\"people of the forest\"). Many of them, such as the Barga and Uriankhai, were little different from the Mongols. While the tribes around Lake Baikal were Mongol-speaking, those to the west spoke Turkic,Samoyedic, or Yeniseian languages.By 1206, Genghis Khan had conquered all Mongol and Turkic tribes in Mongoliaand southern Siberia. In 1207 his eldest son Jochi subjugated the Siberian forest people, the Uriankhai, the Oirats, Barga, Khakas, Buryats, Tuvans, Khori-Tumed, and Kyrgyz.He then organized the Siberians into three tumens. Genghis Khan gave the Telengit and Tolos along the Irtysh River to an old companion, Qorchi. While the Barga, Tumed, Buriats, Khori, Keshmiti, and Bashkirs were organized in separate thousands, the Telengit, Tolos, Oirats and Yenisei Kirghiz were numbered as tumens Genghis settled a colony of Chinese craftsmen and farmers at Kem-kemchik after the first phase of the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty. TheGreat Khans favored gyrfalcons, furs, women and Kyrgyz horses for tribute. Western Siberia came under the Golden Horde. The descendants of Orda Khan, the eldest son of Jochi, directly ruled the area. In the swamps of western Siberia, dog sled Yam stations were set up to facilitate collection of tribute.In 1270, Kublai Khan sent a Chinese official, with a new batch of colonists, to serve as judge of the Kyrgyz and Tuvan basin areas (\u76ca\u862d\u5dde and \u8b19\u5dde).Ogedei's grandson Kaidu occupied portions of Central Siberia from 1275 on. The Yuan dynastyarmy under Kublai's Kipchak general Tutugh reoccupied the Kyrgyz lands in 1293. From then on the Yuan dynasty controlled large portions of Central and Eastern Siberia.The Yenisei area had a community of weavers of Chinese origin and Samarkand and Outer Mongolia both had artisans of Chinese origin seen by Changchun Russian conquest of Siberia The Russian conquest of Siberia took place in the 16th and 17th centuries, when the Khanate of Sibir had become a loose political structure of vassalages that were being undermined by the activities of Russian explorers. Although outnumbered, the Russians pressured the various family-based tribes into changing their loyalties and establishing distant forts from which they conducted raids. To counter this, KuchumKhan attempted to centralize his rule by imposing Islam on his subjects and reforming his tax-collecting apparatus. massacres of indigenous people The Russian colonization of Siberia and conquest of its indigenous peoples has been compared to European colonization in the United States and its natives, with similar negative impacts on the natives and the appropriation of their land The Russian conquest of Siberia was accompanied by massacres due to indigenous resistance to colonization by the Russian Cossacks, who savagely crushed the natives in 1650 some peoples like the Daur were slaughtered by the Russians to the extent that it is considered genocide. 8,000 out of a previously 20,000 strong population in Kamchatka remained after being subjected to half a century of Cossacks slaughter. The Aleuts in the Aleutians were subjected to genocide and slavery by the Russians for the first 20 years of Russian rule, with the Aleut women and children captured by the Russians and Aleut men slaughtered .90% of the Kamchadals and half of the Vogules were killed from the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries and the rapid genocide of the indigenous population led to entire ethnic groups being entirely wiped out, with around 12 exterminated groups which could be named by Nikolai Iadrintsev as of 1882.
