            "answer_text": "The Commercial Revolution was the creation of a European economy based on trade. It began in the 11th century and lasted until it was succeeded by the Industrial revolution in the mid-18th century. Beginning with the Crusades, Europeans gained access to spices, silk, and other commodities that are rare in Europe. This development created a new desire for trade, and it expanded in the second half of the Middle Ages. Newly forming European states, through voyages of discovery, were looking for alternative trade routes in the 15th and 16th centuries, which allowed the European powers to build vast, international trade networks. Nations also sought new sources of wealth and practiced a combination of trade expansion and colonial empire-building. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of financial services such as banking, insurance, and investing. It was the Age of the Medicis, the Tudors, Philip and Isabella, the rise of the Hapsburg Super-empire (I get dibs on this term), the rise of England and the discovery of America, the riches of the Netherlands, and also, the Renaissance and the increased interest on the East.
