            "answer_text": "Thanks for A2A. Before knowing why, please note that we are referring to British calendar here.The reason for skipping the dates was an outcome of aligning the British calendar with that of the catholic calendar.  This all started about 1300 years before 18th century. In those early days, a year was measured to be of 365 days and 6 hours where it was actually 365 days 5 hours and 49 minutes. That seems close enough, but over time this accumulates to a big number.11 minutes per year*1300 years would about 10 days. This started creating problems and hence the catholic church decided to move to the new calendar. The British empire, then being vast, thought that it was OK for them to have their own calendar while rest of Eupore followed the new calendar. Eventually after 170 years later, the British, understanding the confusion this was causing, decided to change their calendar to match with the catholic calendar, which means they had to skip those 11 days in certain and this was decided to be the month of September in 1752 as per new calendar act of 1750. Hence people in the British empire slept on 2nd Sep and woke up to see13th Sep in that year. You will not find any records of these dates because those dates never existed.

            "answer_text": "In England and Wales, the legal year 1751 was a short year of 282 days, running from 25 March to 31 December. 1752 began on 1 January. To align the calendar in use in England to that on the continent, the Gregorian calendar was adopted: and the calendar was advanced by 11 days: Wednesday 2 September 1752 was followed by Thursday 14 September 1752. The year 1752 was thus a short year (355 days) as well. ",

            "answer_text": "The calendar had been set back by 11 days by the countries which adopted Gregorian Calendar in 1582, in 1582 itself. However, the Britain adopted Gregorian Calendar in the year 1752. So what correction had been done in 1582 by other countries, Britain did in 1752. The correction was done because according to the Julian Calendar the calendar date of Easter had shifted by 11 days by 1582 since the date of Easter was calculated based on the number of days elapsed since the date of a particular equinox.
