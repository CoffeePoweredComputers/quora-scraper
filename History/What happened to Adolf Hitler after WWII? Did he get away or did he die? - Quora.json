            "answer_text": "We have been taught that Hitler killed himself and poisoned Eva Braun in a bunker just when the Russians were going to capture, and then was burned.But this story has been told by his then bodyguard, who could not manage to see Hitler's face when he died or when he was burned.However, Since the 1960s, the Russians have claimed that bones they extracted from the Eagle\u2019s Nest after the war were Hitler\u2019s. They took samples and then reportedly burned the rest of the corpses. The original jawbone they recovered apparently matched the records of Hitler\u2019s dentist, the investigators said. But in 2009, DNA Tests on what was thought to be Hitler\u2019s skull turned out to belong to a younger woman.Last year, the FBI declassified more than 700 pages of tips and investigations into the possibility that Hitler survived the war. Included in the trove were hundreds of typed and handwritten notes to the FBI, government memos attempting to verify the claims, and J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s replies.\u201cAccording to [retracted], he was one of the four men who met HITLER and his party when they landed from two submarines in Argentina approximately two and one-half weeks after the fall of Berlin,\u201d one report said, conveying descriptions of the heavily guarded ranch where Hitler, who had shaved off his mustache, was supposedly hiding out.Another person swore Hitler had taken to hiding in plain sight and was residing in Manhattan, the ideal city for anonymity. A Maryland resident was convinced the two had shared a table at lunch in 1946 (\u201clooked like he had been in confinement for sometime\u201d). Another informant claimed Hitler was being treated in Spain for a \u201cnervous condition.\u201dAnd then there\u2019s the bold report that included a letter, translated from German and postmarked with German stamps, which was supposedly from Hitler himself. \u201c[When] I was informed that my body and that of my wife had been covered with naphtha and burred [sic] in the Chancellery  garden. I could not help smiling for at this we were many kilometers south west of Berlin on our air journey to Argentina,\u201d the fraud F\u00fchrer boasted. (The man who turned this letter in was dubbed by the FBI \u201ca psychopathic case.\u201d)But other tips were apparently worthy of follow-up. \u201cHis letter is coherent and it is not known whether or not he is a psychopathic,\u201d an evaluation of another epistle reads. Its a very big debate in which most of the evidences refer towards Hitler surviving the war and fleeing away.Need to remember that when Russian's find the body in eagle's nest, they were convinced that it was not Hitler's body but he was his double who was burned and buried.After the operation Valkyrie, Hitler was having a double and he was himself maintaining a low profile.But as Hitler said during his rule , \"HISTORY IS WRITTEN BY VICTORS\".

            "answer_text": "As we all know that history is like river 'its course can be changed'.So, similarly, in case of adolf hitler , history has been tampered.there are evidences which show that he either flew to spain or escaped to south america.  Hitler and Eva Braun in Germany in 1940In allegations set to debunk one of the biggest slices of world history, Russia is also accused of hiding vital evidence proving the Fuhrer and his wife Eva Braun fled in disguise.Two corpses found after the Second World War reported to be those of Hitler and Braun were in fact murdered body doubles.The claims due to be aired in an explosive television expose tomorrow will blow wide open theories of what happened to the world\u2019s most infamous mass murderers.The programme claims Hitler did not die at the end of the war and threatens to  expose the foundation of post-Second World War history as nothing more than a tissue of \u201clies\u201d.Official records hold the brutal dictator, shamed in defeat in April 1945, shot himself in the head in a bunker in Berlin while his wife took a lethal cyanide pill.But their bodies were swiftly burned with reports confirming their deaths based on what is now claimed to be dubious eyewitness evidence.  GETTYHitler with Eva Braun escaped Nazi Germany according to historiansJournalist, author and historian Gerrard Williams claims two innocent lookalikes were murdered with the world falling victim to a \u201cduplicitous deception\u201d.He said: \u201cI believe that in April 1945 the real Hitler along with Eva Braun were spirited out of the bunker where they escaped.\u201cThey did not die, we were lied to, we\u2019re still being lied to.\u201dHe claims secret FBI documents reveal the Americans were investigating sightings of the Nazi leader months and years after the end of the war.According to official records Hitler\u2019s body was found with Eva Braun\u2019s in Berlin before they were destroyed and their deaths announced by German officials.That November an official report was released by the British Intelligence Services claiming the evil duo died shortly after 2.30  on April 1945.Hitler was smuggled out of Germany by the Nazis, according to historiansHowever it was largely based on third party accounts and contains an admission that the deaths were confirmed \u201cas conclusively as possible without bodies\u201d.Any speculation was put to bed 23 years later when a Russian autopsy apparently matched a recovered jawbone to Hitler\u2019s dental records.A skull fragment complete with bullet hole confirmed the cause of death to be suicide with subsequent DNA testing in 2009 backing these findings.However historians now claim this data was flawed and the Russian government is still refusing any access to the body parts.They say \u201ceyewitness evidence\u201d used to write the British Intelligence Services report was nothing more than feeble statements given to Soviet interrogators.Professor Williams said the Russians\u2019 failure to announce they had found the body of Hitler in 1945 casts serious doubts adding \u201cwe have been sold a dummy\u201d.He said: \u201cThere are no bodies reported discovered in 1945 and this is something which amazes me.\u201cIt\u2019s only in 1968 they said \u2018well actually 23 years ago, despite what we said at the time, we did discover the bodies of Adolf and Eva\u2019.\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.\u201dHe warns of \u201creal problems within official history\u201d and said official records confirming the deaths of Hitler and his wife are seriously flawed.\u201cIt is supported by eyewitnesses who actually never saw anybody get shot,\u201d he said.\u201cThey never see the Fuhrer and Eva go into his private quarters in the bunker.\u201cThey see bodies coming out but nobody ever see Hitler and Eva dead.\u201cI am pretty convinced two people probably did die in the bunker at the end of April 1945 but they weren't Hitler and Eva Braun.\u201cTwo doubles replaced them and it was those who were murdered and their bodies disposed of later.\u201cThe FBI never believed Hitler was dead, they looked for him around the world.\u201dSonke Neitzel, Professor of history at the London School of Economics, said witness accounts used to compile the British report into Hitler\u2019s death are unreliable.He said: \u201cWe know that prisoners who had been in the bunker most likely lied to the Soviets when they were interrogated.\u201dIt is thought Hitler escaped Germany in an elaborate plan coordinated by his private secretary Martin Bormann.After he and Eva Braun were out of danger two innocent people were executed and their bodies planted in a shallow grave later to be discovered.Professor Williams said: \u201cAnd that\u2019s it - end of history, end of Hitler.\u201cAfter these deaths everybody thought this is what\u2019s happened.\u201cIf you tell a lie often enough and loudly enough it becomes the truth, and in this case what the world accepted as the truth is this lie.\u201dTheories have come to light that Hitler was taken to a stronghold in the South Pole where the Nazis had plans of colonisation. AND LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST................................1)once in a meeting Truman asked Stalin ,\"is Hitler really dead?\" stalin said, \"I know him very well. he is surely not dead\".2)Hitler's doctor was escorted in Spain to ask for some german medicines. He was shocked to see the prescription. The patient's name was adolf hitler and it was written in doctor's hand writing. ",
