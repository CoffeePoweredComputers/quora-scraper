            "answer_text": "At the time Greece declared its independence the most powerful countries were England, France, Russia, and Austria with the first three having great interference in the new born state.  On February 3, 1830 the Protocol of London was signed by those countries and they decided that Greece will be an independent but not autonomous state, and will be a Kingdom with a Sovereign Prince. All countries wanted greater control over Greece, but first of all they wanted to keep the others away.  So they first asked another German born prince to become the first king of Greece, Leopold Georg Christian Friedrich von Saxe-Koburg- Gotha. The prince declined the Greek crown and he became the first king of another new born state, Leopold I of Belgium.  Then they proposed to the second son of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, Otto, who was not an adult at that time. So Otto was not Austrian but German, since Salzburg was part of Bavaria at that time. Otto was not very popular in Greece because he was not an Orthodox, but his wife Amalia of Oldenburg became very popular among Greeks.  Despite the fact that Otto was not an Orthodox, he was the head of the Greek Orthodox Church. The security and benefits provided by Ottoman Empire were only provided for the oligarchs, the Greek revolution of 1821 was mainly an uprise against the oligarchs, including rich Greeks. The Orthodox Patriarch condemned the uprise and he was later killed by the Ottomans only for failing to quell the revolution.    ",

            "answer_text": "I think User-13584768854815474418 and Spyros Theodoritsis have covered the main points. I'll just add that the King was there so that the \"Republic of Greece\" would become \"Kingdom of Greece\". The Greek Revolution took place not long after the French Revolution and was inspired and influenced by its ideals to a large degree. The conservative powers that ruled Europe at the time did not look favorably on the Greek  Republic. Revolution was viewed as contagion that threatened the status quo. For Greece to gain independence it would have to conform, i.e. be a kingdom. A lot of people in Greece who had tired of the endless bickering between the chieftains agreed because they saw the king as a force for stability and progress. The king was then chosen amongst the lesser European royal houses in order to ensure nobody had too much influence on the newly born state. As for  not preferring the security of the Ottoman Empire. Well, why would anybody choose to leave the security of an apartheid system where they weren't top dog?  ",
