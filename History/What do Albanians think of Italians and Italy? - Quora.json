            "answer_text": "Italy: the America for Albanians under the communist regime. Albanians (in the Albanian state at least) have always had a soft spot for Italy. That's because when our borders were closed, the only information about the life in the West was from Italy. Albanians (those who could of course), pirated in complete secrecy, the Italian TV shows, like San Remo etc. Being the only source of information about the west a lot of Albanians 'fell in love\u2019 with Italy, it's language and most importantly it's music! After the fall of the regime, a great number of Albanians migrated to Italy for a better life in the 'promised west'. Not all found the happiness they seeked though. A lot of them drowned in the waters of Adriatic and Ionian seas much like the Syrian migrants today (But that's another story) For us who remained in our homeland though, the Italian media continued to remain the main source of information and entertainment in the '90s and the beginning of the 2000s. The Italian music continued to influence our music a lot during these years. I was born in 1993 and I, as most other youngsters my age, have learned italian since I was little by watching Japanese Anime dubbed in Italian. We have to note that because of this a significant percentage of the Albanian population is fluent in Italian. When Italians ask us who taught us their language, we jokingly answer: \u2018Italia 1\u2019 (which more than a joke, actually corresponds to the truth!). Today Italy remains one of the most important economical partners for Albania, and a source for a big number of new workplaces as Call-centers mainly in Tirana. We do love their culinary and most importantly their football. More than 90 percent of the football fans in the Republic of Albania are fans of 3 teams: AC Milan, FC Inter Milan and FC Juventus Turin. As for Italian people, well the opinion is not generally as positive as for Italy in general: I have had the fortune and the misfortune to meet a big number of Italians though, and they do vary, certainly they do, Italy is a big country with a big population. I've met from the most intellectual and caring people to the most racist ones (their variation goes from one extreme to the other). For our fortune and misfortune Italians seem to be too much like us, in the good and bad ways. Our P.M during an interview in an Italian TV described Italians as: \"Albanians in Armani Clothes\". I laughed when I first watched the interview but the more I come into contact with italians, the more I think that statement is true! ",

            "answer_text": "You mean the Albanians living in Albania or those living in Italy? In the first case, that of the Albanians of Albania we can say that the image of Italy is overall good or very good. Then of course, it depends on the people you ask, how informed they are about Italy or simply how much of general culture they have. In particular the Albanians of Albania: who love football, know Italy through FC Inter, AC Milan and FC Juventus and the four football World Cups won by the Italian national football team.those who love to talk about history, know about the invasion of Albania by Fascist Italy of Mussolini in 1939 and the next four years of occupation. Below is a coin of that time. those Albanians who love to talk about more recent history know of the \u201cinvasion\u201d of Italy by the Albanians in 1991 which is better told in the film Lamerica - Wikipedia . Many Albanians are grateful for the welcome the Italian people have given them.Albanians who love to talk about good food, know that Italian food is the best in the world. The Italian restaurant \"Punto e Pasta\" in Tirana is quite famous.Albanians who have been studying in Italy and speak fluent Italian, are better acquainted with Italian art and culture and can tell you about its immensity.Albanians who know about foreign policy know that Italy is the best advocate that Albania has inside the EU.Finally, those who have worked in Italy and then returned to Albania to open their businesses -with the knowledge and capital accumulated in Italy- know that the period spent in Italy has changed their lives for the better.Then there is the second case of Albanians who live in Italy and continue to live there for more than twenty five years. For this category -of which I belong- Italy is a second home where to grow from a human and professional point of view and where to raise your children. ",
