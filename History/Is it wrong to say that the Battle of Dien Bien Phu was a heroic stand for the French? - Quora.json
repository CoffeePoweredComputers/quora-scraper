            "answer_text": "Is it wrong to say that Battle of the Dien Bien Phu was a heroic stand for the French? If the defenders of the fortified camp of Dien Bien Phu were not tenacious or \"heroic\" during the fighting from March 13 to May 7, 1954, then no other was ever anywhere.  In Ho-chiminh city there is Dien Bien Phu street, it is 14 km long.The Vietnamese are used to say in secret, 1 dead for each meter. They speak about their killed. The official death toll according to the Vietnamese authorities is 4,000. It is highly doubtful and can be strongly estimated to be much higher. Beyond the bravado of the armchair generals of the internet who give lessons in strategy and cultivate the myth of glory that exists only for those who have never approached a real war, the cost of the attacks alone between March 13 and 15 is estimated at nearly 3,000 Viet-minh soldiers dead.  They were very well trained and equipped soldiers. Infantrymen maneuvered on the whistle and knew how to infiltrate positions.The gunners of the 351st Artillery Division were very well camouflaged. They allowed the capture of key strongpoints essential to the defense of the camp, but Giap soon realized that he could not capture it in this manner.  The Vietnamese general therefore decided to halt for a while his bloody frontal land offensives and began to reorganize his troops and replenish his ammunition supply. The French took the opportunity to take the initiative again and launched counter-attacks which caused panic in the Viet-minh 308 division. On March 30, after having succeeded in neutralizing the airfield with his artillery, Giap considered that he had reached a satisfactory level of reorganization and resupply. He now set himself the objective of taking the hills to the north-east and east of the main centre of French resistance. Those that block access to it. This will be the Battle of the Five Hills. During the night of 30 to 31 March, a new formidable artillery preparation comes as a prelude to the assault of the infantrymen. In a few hours, almost simultaneously, the strongpoints Dominique 2 and Eliane 1 were submerged. The defenders of Eliane 4 and Dominique managed as best they could to keep their position. On Eliane 2, the resistance of the French is even harder: they fight with their bare hands, with knives, they smash skulls with stones.The fights are extremely violent. The defenders can still benefit from the support of the artillery of the Isabelle support point which pounds without respite the waves of Viet Minh assault which follow one another in defiance of the losses. In the early morning, the ground of the hill is literally covered with a thick and bloody carpet of corpses.  The Viet Minh is relentlessly attacking Eliane 2 for another 4 days. On April 6, its losses were so enormous that the morale of the \"bo-do\u00ef\" began to falter. Some units even refused to return to the assault. Faced with what he described as a \"characterized right-wing movement,\" Giap was forced to delay. He suspended frontal attacks on Eliane 2 and, to immediately stop the vehement defeatism, he summarily executed a large number of officers deemed incompetent. The same applied to any soldier suspected of defeatism or cowardice. After the Battle of the Five Hills, Giap was forced to bring in 25,000 reinforcements, many of whom were poorly trained coolies. The Vietminh renounced massive assaults and changed tactics. He dug up to 400 km of tunnels and trenches that gradually nibbled away at the hills.  They harassed the French positions until the end of the battle and did not launch any more massive assaults until May 1st in the evening. The final apocalypse fell on the defenders of Dien Bien Phu. The Viet Minh triggered a new artillery preparation. It is of an intensity never reached until then. It now uses Katyusha rocket launchers - the famous \"Stalin's organs\". Their impacts were terrible and devastating, and the massive assaults resumed for another 6 nights and continue even during the day, a novelty for the Viet-minh's mass assaults . At the end of their strength and ammunition, and after using up all the volunteer wounded from the infirmaries, the defenders succumbed on order. During the battle French soldiers went so far in their strength that cases of death by \"instant physiological aging\" are mentioned. Twenty-year-olds died within minutes, taking on the appearance of very old men with no apparent physical injuries. A last precision, the \"French\" troops included 25 different nationalities including Thai and Vietnamese.The elite battle corps of General Giap was sacrificed at Dien Bien, it is largely buried there.  The Vietnamese fighters showed extraordinary heroism and courage.  Not a single surviving Vietnamese fighter from Dien Bien Phu said the defenders were not extremely tenacious.  ",

            "answer_text": "Dien Bien Phu cannot be seen as heroic, it was far from it. The battle is a stain on France\u2019s history, never to be repeated.  Viet Minh troops plant their flag over the captured French headquarters shortly after the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu. The Battle of Dien Bien Phu can be best characterized as a French \u201cTeutoburg Forest\u201d; they had no idea what they were getting into, once they did realize, shit hit the fan, and when the chips were down, France simply put itself in a vulnerable position. Is it wrong to say that Battle of the Dien Bien Phu was a heroic stand for the French? Yes, it very much would be because it was far from it. A \u2018heroic stand\u2019 is meant to invoke something honorable, something that a nation or a people can rally around as a source of pride. Stands like Bunker Hill, Catalon, Thermopylae, and the Alamo invoke images of heroism, bravery until the end. Dien Bien Phu was a horrible mark on France, a source of shame and disgust for decades to come. The French had long ago tossed away the heroism of the Indochina War when it became clear that it was an attempt to keep Vietnam within the French Colonial Empire. France renounced all claims to heroism when they chose to preserve colonialism over self-determination. Ignoring the political implications of the battle. French made many blunders at there. And they were heavily outnumbered, outgunned and surrounded in all directions. Yet in terms of actual fighting, the French forces put up a fearsome defense against amazing odds with little hope for victory. The thing is, they wouldn\u2019t have had to fight as hard as they did had they actually chosen a sound battle strategy. The idea of Phu, to force a battle of annihilation where the Viet Minh would be irrecoverable damaged beyond fighting capability, was flawed from the get-go. The hedgehog concept that the French had developed after the Battle of N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n was horrendous, leaving large contingents of their military force in these fortified bases scattered throughout the countryside. What made matters even worse was the fact that the French commanders failed to recognize key differences between N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n and Dien Bien Phu: At N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n, the French held the high ground. This allowed for their artillery, which was crucial to the battle, to be well-positioned and able to afford an overwhelming amount of firepower. At Dien Bien Phu, the Viet Minh controlled the high ground around the base and were able to drag their artillery up the high slopes surrounding the complex, much to the French's surprise.The Viet Minh general in command of force at Dien Bien Phu, V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p, had learned much from his mistakes at N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n. At N\u00e0 S\u1ea3n, he employed costly frontal assaults against entrenched French positions which led to significant casualties. He would not make the same mistake again, biding his time at Phu and taking the time to drag artillery and anti-air equipment up the mountains to surround the base at Phu entirely.The French had failed to do any pre-battle reconnaissance as opposed to the Viet Minh. The Viet Minh had scouted early on before the battle and knew full well where the French artillery positions were, allowing for accurate fire once the battle commenced. In contrast, the French knew nothing of the Viet Minh\u2019s artillery and even expected them to not bring any whatsoever. When they did start to fire at the Minh\u2019s artillery, it was already rotated to new positions. Things got so bad that the French artillery commander Charles Piroth, unable to effectively support fellow French troops with his artillery batteries, committed suicide in his bunker during the battle.The numerous anti-air guns that Giap had brought with him proved immeasurably valuable when the battle commended. The plethora of guns effectively shut down the runway at Phu and rendered resupply mute as artillery fire continually battered the runway as well. Resupply was all but halted.French commanders had done everything in their power to ensure their loss. Their positioning was terrible, the strategy was terrible, and the mandate for the entire conflict was terrible. Things got so bad for the French that they were offered the bomb by the United States who feared France pulling out of Indochina. It was hardly heroic, it was a last ditch effort to force the Viet Minh to the table in an honorable fashion that would allow the French to leave with dignity but ended up costing France not only its pride, but its military dignity as well.
