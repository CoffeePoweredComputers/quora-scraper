            "answer_text": "They really weren't. I was in a radical church from 1999 until 2002. Then I left to get laid and explore the world. I lasted until Christmas 2003 seeing a lovely lady who remained a friend until 2006. In terms of TV, film and music? The Matrix movies were a massive big deal. V for Vendetta came out in 05, the 4th Die Hard movie came out in 2007 and arguably was the best of all of them. I think the Final Destination movies were a thing. Training Day with Ethan Hawke. Classic. Actually it was probably Ethan Hawke\u2019s decade movie wise. Before Sunset /Sunrise/Midnight. The last of which I had to wait until 2013 to see. And Gattaca was a 1997 film that eerily reflected what was happening with biotech throughout the 00s. Music. We had every style of pop music and literally every kind of music style on earth within reach via the Internet. From 2002 to 2004 I was part of a chat community - some people did a job on me so I had to get out of there. Ugh. Then it was MySpace for a while and seeing amazing live bands. Then that got bought out by Rupert Murdoch so we all shifted over to Facebook. It was an exciting time. Our Internet got faster, our computers got more powerful. In 2007 I was test driving NFC technology on a 3G flip phone. I played a lot of Sim City on it and used it as an oyster card on trains and buses. God I loved that phone. My current phone can do all that and much more but I just use it for Internet and playing roulette. Oh and who can forget Charmed and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I had Alyson Hannigan as my wallpaper for two years. There was also Friends and a zillion other cool shows. But it was not a boring decade at all. ",
