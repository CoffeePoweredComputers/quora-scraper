            "answer_text": "Around 1000 BC the area where the Kurds now live was the land of the Hurrians who had their own language and culture. After 1000 BC Iranian or Aryan tribes began to push into the Zagros mountains of what is now Iranian Kurdistan. These tribes were called \u2018Medes\u2019 by the neighbouring Assyrians. They raised horses with the Assyrians and went through various periods of cooperation and conflict. The Medes though, eventually aligned with the Babylonians to defeat the Assyrians between 616 and 608 BC. The Medes also defeated the Uratians around Lake Van in modern Turkey. This, presumably, meant Mede tribes migrated west into the high mountains on the modern Iraqi - Turkish Border. The Kurds are linguistically and genetically the descendants of the incoming Aryan/Iranian Medes and the local Hurrian population. The Kurdish languages are fundamentally \u2018North West Iranian\u2019 but there is significant grammar and vocabulary influence from Hurrian. They presumably worshipped a form of Zoroastrianism but probably more \u2018popular\u2019 and less \u2018priestly\u2019 than the Zoroastrianism of Sassanid Iran. Around 400 BC the Greek writer Xenophon was one of an army of 10.000 Greeks who traveled north from Mesopotamia to the Black Sea. He writers about the Karduchoi in the mountains north of the Mesopotamia Plain. The -ch- is a people ending in the Armenian language (like -ish in English) and he probably had Armenian translators/guides. This \u201cKardu\u201d form reappears over 1000 years later with the Siriani who referred to the land of the Kurds as \u201cBeth Kardu\u201d. In the Assyrian language Kardu means \u2018brave\u2019 so Beth Kardu may actually mean \u201cLand of the Brave\u201d. In Roman times there was a minor Kingdom east of the Tigris between Kepha (Hasankeyf) and the Turkish/Iraqi border. This was called Gordyene or sometimes Corduene (-ene is Greek and was used for all the Kingdoms in the area like Komagene). \u2018Gord\u2019 is an old Iranian word meaning \u2018hero\u2019 and I believe it was chosen for it similarity in both sound and meaning to the Assyrian Kardu. Into this mix came another old Iranian word, Kurd, which seems to have been used for all nomads, an Iranian equivalent of Bedouin. Effectively as \u2018Kurd\u2019 began to be used as the name for one group of nomads, the people of Beth Kardu / Gordyene then it stopped being used for the others. Beth Kardu - Gordyene was largely outside the power of both the Romans, but more importantly the Iranian Parthian and Sassanid Empires. Iranian Kurdistan (called \u2018Ma\u2019 or the Moon in Persian by early Arab geographers) was very much a part of the Province of Media which stretch as far as Tehran and Esfahan and had its own language. The Arabs used \u2018modern\u2019 Persian as the language of religion and government and much of ancient Media became Persian speaking. in the 800s the mountains of western Iran became the centre of a failed popular - Zoroastrian revolt against the Arabs. Arabs historians also talk about Kurdish rebels as part of this movement but they are very much deep in the mountains of \u2018Gordyene\u2019. After the defeat of this movement, many migrated west to the Byzantine Empire. Their leader, Nasir - Theophobos was referred to as a Kurd by historians writing relatively soon after the event. This was probably the beginning of a migration of Kurds/Medes from NW Iran into the area of the upper Euphrates that was largely abandoned during the Byzantine-Arab wars and thus the origin of the Zaza. There may have been further migrations when the Turks pushed into Median speaking Atropatane (Iranian Azerbaijan). As the Medes ceased to exist as a people, under the influence of Persianization and Turkification During the early centuries of Muslim rule there was an intense blurring of Islam and Zoroastrianism in these communities. Thus we had a Zoroastrian rebel named Nasir! In the 12th century a Sufi Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir settled in the valley of Lalish in Iraqi Kurdistan. His attempt to convert the Kurds to Islam instead created a new religion blending Islam and Zoroastrianism, the religion of the Yazidi and this became common amongst the Kurds who hadn\u2019t converted to Islam. Like the Zoroastrians, the Yezidi see God as infinitely distant, present in his holy light, and instead it is deputy, the peacock angel who acts on earth and instructs humanity. For Muslims, the angel Idris was punished by God when he refused to worship man, some early Sufi, remembering the importance in Islam of worshipping none but God, decided that Idris was actually right, and this was a test by God which only Idris passed and thus he was sent to earth not as punishment but as the \u2018best\u2019 angel to instruct humanity. So the Yazidis merged these two stories, and the connection between the Peacock Angel and the \u2018good Idris\u2019 got them an unfortunate reputation as \u2018devil worshippers\u2019 amongst mainstream Muslims. Facing frequent persecution the Yazidis pushed further north into Armenian territory and they were often the first wave of Kurds migrating northwards to places like Lake Van. And there is now a large Kurdish speaking Yazidi population in the republic of Armenia. The 12th century was a big time for the Kurds - as they began to emerge more solidly as a people into the page of history. This may be related to the arrival of the Seljuk Turks and the general \u2018disruption\u2019 they caused. Many local Kurdish Emirates emerged, most of them claim to be older but it\u2019s the 12th century that their existence becomes solid. Kurds, like Turks, entered military service in the late Abbasid Caliphate. Here Kurds from different tribes mixed on a significantly level for perhaps the first time, the word \u2018Kurd\u2019 becomes much more common in Arab literature. There\u2019s an amusing quote from this period about one Kurdish solider telling another not to braid his hair because Kurds don\u2019t do that (I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s what Turks did \u2026). In 1137 a Kurd from Dvin in Armenia serving in central Iraq had a son - Saladin - who would grow up to form an Empire which stretched from Mosul to Cairo. His Ayyubid empire didn\u2019t last long but Kurds filled many important position in government, the military and religion. Kurdish society was though largely tribal and ruled over by local rulers, Aghas or Emirs. They were frequently at war with each other and often swore nominal allegiance to the distant Sultan or Shah in return for money or weapons to fight their Kurdish neighbours. The mountains were high and the Sultan/Shah was far so this allegiance usually meant nothing on the ground. In 1514 the Ottoman Sultan Selim defeated the Persians at the Battle of Chalidiran near Lake Van. One of his advisor was a Kurd named Idris Bidlisi and he negotiated a pact with the local Kurdish Aghas and Emirs that granted them self rule and immunity from taxation in return for allegiance and military service. The Kurds on the eastern side of the Zagros though remained under Iranian rule. This situation lasted until the late 19th century when the Ottomans began to undermine the local rulers and exert central control. After WW1 the allies planned to break the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires up into nation states. In theory a Kurdish state was going to be created but after long, difficult and expensive war the victorious powers, particularly the British, had little interest in fighting to make it happen. The Kurds themselves were still largely tribal, and only beginning to develop a national consciousness and tribal rivalries remained more important. Thus is one tribe chose the British, the other would support Ataturk and his \u2018Ottoman resistance\u2019. On top of this the British were unwilling to \u2018help\u2019 until they were sure of local support, and many local Kurds were unwilling to jump into the British camp until they saw British support. In the end most Kurds were loyal to their Caliph and support the Ottomans but Ataturk promptly exiled the Caliphate and proclaimed a Turkish, secular republic. One part of the Kurds was already under Iranian rule, the Ottoman part was split largely between Turkey and Iraq, with a small part in Syria. In the 20th century modern nation states were able to project power in the mountains of the Kurds in a way that was unthinkable in early centuries. And they created a modern centralised state with schools, police, hospitals and laws. They also carried the ideology of a \u2018Nation State\u2019 which should have one identity, one language, one culture. During the 20th century also Kurdish national consciousness also began to emerge. These two together produced a bloody century. ",

            "answer_text": "The history of the Kurdish people is very fascinating, yet not a lot has been written on it in modern times. The best resources are actually in German, as in the 19th century and early 20th century there were a lot of German ethnologists and linguists that found the Kurds interesting.  First, let's say its controversial and academia has been split on the beginnings of the Kurds. So what I'm going to do here is summarize it, albeit controversial in some circles.  Kurds are an Indo-European linguistic people group.They originally were Bedouins who would travel around the Blacksea.At some point about three thousand years ago, they stopped and settled in the upper Mesopotamia area, today's Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan.The Kurdish ethnicity is likely the same people group called the Medes as recorded in the Holy Bible. The Medes conquered the Babylonians and set-up the Persian empire. Religion: The Kurds/Medes were originally ShamanisticReligion: Later they became a religion called Zoroastrianism.Religion: During the time of the Jewish people's Babylonian Captivity, the Jewish people evangelized the Medes.Religion: Many Medes joined the Jewish religion and became Jewish. Religion/State: A Jewish/Kurdish state was eventually formed in the later half of the last millennia of the BCE.  Religion: When Christianity came, many Kurds become Christians. Religion: At the time of 500 CE, most Kurds were Christian, many were Jews, some, but few were Zoroastrianists, and some still shamanistic. Religion: In the late 600's Islam came through the region and conquered the Kurdish people, forcing conversion to Islam (The first forced mass conversion). Those who did not convert fled to either Syriatic Christian Kingdom or the Armenian Christian Kingdom for protection.After the Arab invasions, many returned but labeled themselves as \"Syriani\", under the protection of the Syrian Kingdom, or \"Armenian\" under the protection of the Armenian Christian Kingdom. Over time they lost their Kurdish identity.During the Islamic times, the Kurds were subserviant to the Islamic, Seljuk, Ottoman powers. They were often used as canon foder for the Crusades. They were great fighters.The Kurds were promised their own Kingdom if they fought in the crusades. They didn't get it.One Kurdish leader, Saladin, was able to gain power. He's a very interesting character. Read up on him. @SaladinThe Kurds never got their power, and when the Turks took over, they became second class citizens.The Ottomans would use the Kurds often to do their dirty work. This was particularly gruesome when the Kurds were used to fight the Armenians in what many consider a genocide in the early 20th century. I won't get into that controversy but you can read more here: Armenian GenocideIn the New Turkish Republic, being Turkish and a Turkish state became important, and thus Kurds were persecuted for being Kurdish. They were often called Mountain Turks, which the Kurds did not appreciate. Frankly, with no one to fight against the Kurds, many attempts to get rid of the Kurds happened in modern Turkey/Syria/Iraq/Iran. This helped form the anti-government Kurdish groups, namely the PKK, YPG and other terrorist groups in the area.There's a fast History up to current times. Hope that helped. ",
