            "answer_text": "The Viking story has fascinated people for centuries. But as a major exhibition opens at the British Museum, have people got them all wrong?  The longships arrived on 8 June. The monks at Lindisfarne didn't know it then - the year was 793 - but it was the beginning of 300 years of bloody Viking raids on Britain and Ireland. \"Never before has such terror appeared in Britain as we have now suffered from a pagan race,\" Alcuin of York wrote at the time. \"The heathens poured out the blood of saints around the altar, and trampled on the bodies of saints in the temple of God, like dung in the streets.\" Over 12 centuries later and the Vikings are the subject of a major exhibition at the British Museum - and they still loom large in the imagination. Blond, powerfully built men with horned helmets, nostrils flaring with naked aggression, descending on settlements to rape and pillage.  Stora Hammars shows a man lying on his belly with another man using a weapon on his back, a Valknut, and two birds, one of which is held by a man to the right. That at least is the perception. But long-held views are being challenged. Let's start with the helmets, so beloved of Scandinavian football fans. The Vikings never wore them. They have only been included in depictions since the 19th Century. Wagner celebrated Norse legend in his opera Die Walkure (The Valkyrie) and horned helmets were created as props for the performance of his Ring Cycle at the first Bayreuth Festival in 1876. The horned helmet is based on historical fact, says Emma Boast from the Jorvik Centre, but it just wasn't a Viking thing. The British Museum has a ceremonial horned helmet from the Iron Age that was found in the River Thames. It is dated 150-50 BC.  The Vikings used horns in feasting for drinking and blew into them for communicating. They were depicted in Viking brooches and pendants. They weren't worn. And for battle it would have been a major encumbrance, adding weight to the helmet. But today a child asked to draw a Viking will start with the horned helmet, Boast says. \"I can understand that kids are drawn to that. It's so embedded with our society that I don't think we'll ever get rid of that. But actually there's a richer explanation.\" With the new exhibition there has been soul-searching in the media. A recent New Statesman headline asked: \"The Vikings invented soap operas and pioneered globalisation - so why do we depict them as brutes?\"  A Daily Telegraph reviewer - brought up on the idea of them as \"all hirsute jowls and beady eyes bent on rape and pillage\" - suspects that the new British Museum will be an exercise in academic debunking. \"I will learn that these rapacious raiders were in fact vegetarians, that they maintained some of the leading universities of the day and, worst of all, that they did not wear horned helmets.\" His tongue-in-cheek fears show that the British Museum has a difficult job on its hands. \"The debate about whether the Vikings were cuddly or not has been going for a long time,\" says Matthew Townend, who teaches Old Norse at the University of York. The classic view is that articulated in Hollywood's 1958 movie The Vikings. Starring Kirk Douglas, Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, it opened with what one critic today describes as a \"full-blooded depiction of rape, fire and pillage\". At least there were no horns in evidence.  In the 1960s and 70s their portrayal as marauding barbarians was questioned. Academics pointed out that most of the written records for the Viking invasion of England were written by monks who, as the \"victims\", would not have been objective. Archaeology began to replace the Norse sagas - written several centuries later - as the most reliable evidence. A crucial turning point came in the late 1970s. During the construction of a shopping centre in the Coppergate area of York, Viking homes, clothes, jewellery, and a helmet were found well preserved in the moist earth. It led to the creation of the city's Jorvik Centre. The Vikings became seen as domestic, family-oriented people. \"Until Coppergate our view of the Vikings was skewed,\" says Chris Tuckley, head of interpretation at the Jorvik Centre. The Viking makeover saw them transformed from bloodcurdling raiders into resourceful traders. A British Museum exhibition in 1980 - the last before this week's opening - reflected this view. They were poets. They wore leather shoes and combed their hair.  On a trip to Dublin in 2007, Danish culture minister Brian Mikkelsen was reported to have apologised to the Irish people for what the Vikings had done. He later denied having said sorry, telling a Danish newspaper: \"What I mentioned in my speech was 'it did a lot of damages to the Irish people', but we don't apologise for what the Vikings did 1,000 years ago. That was the way you acted back then.\" An apology 1,000 years on would have been absurd. But others question Mikkelsen's second point - that their behaviour was the norm. The correction to \"cuddly\" Vikings had gone too far, says Prof Simon Keynes, an Anglo-Saxon historian at Cambridge University. \"There's no question how nasty, unpleasant and brutish they were. They did all that the Vikings were reputed to have done.\"  They stole anything they could. Churches were repositories of treasure to loot. They took cattle, money and food. It's likely they carried off women, too, he says. \"They'd burn down settlements and leave a trail of destruction.\" It was unprovoked aggression. And unlike most armies, they came by sea, their narrow-bottomed longships allowing them to travel up rivers and take settlements by surprise. It was maritime blitzkrieg at first. Worse was the repeat nature of the raids. The Vikings, like burglars returning over and over again to the same houses, refused to leave places alone. Ivar the Boneless is said to have been particularly cruel. According to the sagas, he put Edmund, king of East Anglia, up against a tree and had his men shoot arrows at him until his head exploded. And Viking rival King Ella was put to death in York by having his ribs cut at the spine, his ribs broken so that they looked like wings and his lungs pulled out through the wounds in his back. It was known as the Blood Eagle. But the accuracy of these stories is disputed.  A Daily Telegraph reviewer - brought up on the idea of them as \"all hirsute jowls and beady eyes bent on rape and pillage\" - suspects that the new British Museum will be an exercise in academic debunking . \"I will learn that these rapacious raiders were in fact vegetarians, that they maintained some of the leading universities of the day and, worst of all, that they did not wear horned helmets.\" His tongue-in-cheek fears show that the British Museum has a difficult job on its hands. \"The debate about whether the Vikings were cuddly or not has been going for a long time,\" says Matthew Townend, who teaches Old Norse at the University of York.

It was known as the Blood Eagle. But the accuracy of these stories is disputed. And others point out that the Anglo-Saxons were hardly upholders of a prototype Geneva Convention. In 2010 it was reported that 50 decapitated bodies had been found in Weymouth, thought to be executed Viking captives. The Vikings also went west to Newfoundland, to northern France and Germany, and east into what is now Russia and Ukraine. Perhaps less known is the Viking influence in central Asia and the Middle East. \"It's very difficult to find a single way of assessing them all because they did so many things,\" Keynes says.  The largest body of written sources on the Vikings in the 9th and 10th Century is in Arabic, points out James Montgomery, professor of Arabic at Cambridge University. The Vikings reached the Caspian Sea and came into contact with the Khazar empire. They may even have got as far as Baghdad if one mid-9th Century source is to be believed. Vikings known as the \"Rus\" are thought to have contributed to the formation of the princedom of Kiev, which turned into Russia, Montgomery says. It has led some to paint the Vikings as global traders more than warriors. And even - with their Icelandic sagas - as inventors of the soap opera. Revisionism is natural. Academics are always looking for a fresh angle. And people change their mind as social mores evolve.  \"Stendhal said that the biography of Napoleon would have to be rewritten every six years,\" says historian Antony Beevor, author of The Second World War. But revisionism and counter-revisionism happens more in some fields of history - World War One for example - than others. For Beevor it tends to occur \"over periods and questions which have contemporary political resonances - civil wars, slavery and colonialism, labour, the treatment of women and so forth\". Townend says the Vikings were both invaders and migrants. They didn't just raid, pillage and leave. Over the 300-year Viking period, many stayed. Their attitude to the local populace was more complicated than just that of thuggish raiding parties. \"They don't wipe them out. So how do these two groups live together?\"  It becomes a story about not just conquest but immigration and assimilation. Many of the Vikings embraced Christianity. There was intermarriage. King Cnut, who became King of England and ruled for 25 years, replaced those at the top but allowed society to go on as before. At the same time they held on to Norse names and traditions. \"My view is that there was a good deal of give and take,\" Townend says. Haakon the Good converted to Christianity while in England. On his return to rule Norway, \"he was given a hard time\", Townend says. \"His religious beliefs were rather different to the majority of his subjects.\" What came after the Vikings was arguably worse, argues Tuckley. The Normans went about things in a more systematic way, he says. \"They oppressed the local populace rather than integrating as the Vikings did.\" No doubt the revisionism and counter argument will be fine-tuned. But the Viking story - replete with violence, colonialism and trade - has it all. With or without horns.  Journalism is said to be the first draft of history, but it is often disappointing to find that the second or third drafts, by historians, move little further in establishing the truth about what happened. Errors made by reporters in the heat of the moment, instead of being eliminated, have become part of the authorised version. Factors that are crucial in creating the context within which events occurred go unmentioned.  That context is the mix of hopes, fears, hatreds and habits, frequently the fruit of an individual's or a community's previous history, which are so important in determining how they will act. This is particularly true of wars when, even a few seconds after being truly frightened, it is so difficult to evoke in one's mind what those moments of terror felt like. \"Can a man who is warm understand a man who is freezing?\" Alexander Solzhenitsyn famously asks in One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.  The experience of mass fear, when large groups of people believe they are in danger of extermination or enslavement, is so important in shaping the historical instincts of countries and governments. Most European countries have suffered devastating war, foreign occupation or both over the past century, with exceptions being the British who remained unmarked by any recent experience of being wholly at the mercy of another's armies.  For all the current focus on 1914 and the mass slaughter on the Western Front, the British experience of the First World War was, in many respects, not as bad as what is happening to the Syrians today. Britons were not driven from their homes and their whole families were not threatened, whatever death toll from the trenches. Most people are more frightened for their children than themselves, which is why the Syrian, Iraqi and Lebanese wars created such all-embracing terror.  Writers all over Europe at the time of the Vikings, whose very name in Old Norse means \"pirate\", are at one in describing their savagery. But their terrified accounts of what happened were set aside by experts as biased because the eyewitnesses were often monks whose monasteries were prime targets of the raiders. Emphasis was instead put on the role of the Vikings as traders (though their main trade was in slaves), sailors, poets (though the Sagas were written much later) and craftsmen (though the most impressive objects in Viking hoards were looted from other countries).  The centre-piece of the present exhibition is the remains of what is known as Roskilde 6, an 11th-century ship, discovered and excavated from the bottom of a Viking port in Denmark in 1996-97. Skilled though the Scandinavians may have been at building better warships than anybody else, it is also worth recalling that these vessels played the same role in attacking other peoples in Europe as German tanks did much later.  It is extraordinary that the myth of the Vikings as misunderstood spreaders of Nordic culture should ever have had any credibility. My late friend Patrick Wormald, one of the great experts on Anglo-Saxon England, writing in The Anglo-Saxons, edited by James Campbell, mockingly derides the idea that the Viking attacks were \"mere plunder raids which were insufficiently sensitive to local religious susceptibilities\".  Signs are overwhelming that the Vikings waged total war against the Anglo-Saxons from the time of their first recorded raid in 789. These escalated by 865 into invasions by hundreds of ships bent on conquest and settlement. Wormald notes that the kings of East Anglia and Northumbria were defeated and then seemingly killed in a sickeningly gruesome Viking ritual known as , which involved \"ripping a victim's lungs out of his rib-cage, and draping them across his shoulders like eagles' wings\".  The pro-Viking lobby claim this is exaggerated stuff and there is no proof of such Viking atrocities. But the absence of evidence is scarcely surprising. The invaders, themselves illiterate, were so destructive that almost no writings survive from the conquered Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.  The Anglo-Saxons fought back heroically, reconquering much of the country, only to succumb to a final Viking onslaught in the early 11th century. The warfare never lost its ferocity: if I look out the front door of the house where I am writing this in Canterbury, I can see the city's great medieval walls behind an earlier version behind which local people withstood a three-week siege by the Vikings from 8-29 September 1011. The Vikings finally stormed and sacked the city, taking prisoner Archbishop Alphege whom they held hostage. Angered by his refusal to allow the people in Canterbury to pay a ransom for him on the grounds that they were already too poor, the Vikings beat him to death at a drunken feast.  The intensity of the violence was equal to anything in present-day Syria. Not many people have heard of the St Brice's Day massacre on 13 November 1002 when the Anglo-Saxon king, Ethelred the Unready, ordered the deaths of all Danes in his kingdom. In Oxford, surviving Danes barricaded themselves in a church (where Christ Church Cathedral now stands) and successfully defended themselves until townspeople set fire to the church. The skeletons of some 34 young men believed to have been killed in the same massacre were discovered under St John's College in 2008. Overall, the Scandinavians have a lot to apologise for. The leader of almost every Viking raiding party or army about which anything is known committed crimes which today would see them charged before the International Criminal Court.

All inspired by Indo European warriors on horses with chariots, moving quickly over vast areas. The Norse had a trading boat and battle axe culture with mixed farming from the Indo European Bronze Age up to the end of the Viking Age, but they did not create big slave empires, though they participated in slave trade as well. Both the Normans and the Norse were among the first to abolish slave trade and slavery in Modern Times. And the Norse did not have feudal serfdom either. If you look at the expansion of the Aztec empire, or the Russian empire, you get a picture of how brutal war, conquest and slavery can be. ",
