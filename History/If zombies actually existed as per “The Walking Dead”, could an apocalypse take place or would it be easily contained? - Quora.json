            "answer_text": "Now do you mean the exact Walking Dead zombies, or just slow zombies? If you mean slow zombies, yes, it could be easily contained. Shocking at first, depending on the country I\u2019d estimate 5\u2013300 deaths and/or infections. After that it\u2019d be quarantined, then after that razed to the ground if they\u2019re smart before building new, fresh, and clean areas. If you mean the exact Walking Dead ones, then the answer changes.In the Walking Dead, everyone is already infected, and death turns you as long as it wasn\u2019t a death that damaged the brain.This would almost certainly cause an apocalypse. From some fiction help work site, a good place to call an apocalypse (as a guideline) is when at least 10%+ of people have died. That may not sound like a lot of people, but let\u2019s use Earth at 7.5 billion. That means 750 million people died at least. That\u2019s a lot of people!You see people die at roughly 2 every second. Now getting stabbed or shot in the head are pretty rare deaths, so that means in most cases, 2 zombies are born every second, and that\u2019s not even counting children that die in birth who aren\u2019t counted in population or death counts. With 2 zombies every second, the world population of zombies rapidly grows bigger and bigger. Sure many zombies would be killed, but many people are not expecting their great grandmother to leap out of the hospital bed when they pull the plug. By 24 hours, 172,800 zombies would have been born. If we assume each one probably killed 1.5 people (conservative estimate), that\u2019s 259200 in the first 24 hours, which almost triples the zombie population. Now let\u2019s assume that extra 60k are killed by humans obsessed with zombie lore and able to do that mentally.That\u2019s still 200,000 zombies which would then become 500,000 zombies. Let\u2019s say every day, double the zombies are getting killed, so 60k, 120k, etc. We could say this is zombie awareness combined with zombies still appearing randomly in front of these \u201cimmoral\u201d people. By the first week, let\u2019s assume that the world is now fully prepared and ready for zombies, and the population of zombie killers is now quadrupling by the day. That leaves us with this:  As we can see, the outbreak is pushed back on the eighth day, and is stopped on the ninth. Even then, that is a world population, not a country level one. Is this an apocalypse? Well all we have to do for that is count how many zombies were killed. (By the way, \u201cZombies Killed\u201d in the table means per day, not total). On the 5th day, 1% of people will be dead, either zombified, or killed again as a zombie. By the 9th day, this would rise to 5.5%.No apocalypse has happened. If we up the zombies to two kills per zombie per day, then we see the outbreak reach its peak at 541 million zombies on Day 10, but gone by Day 11. This reaches the 10% mark by the 8th-9th day, killing 1.1 billion people on Day 9. Okay, so now we can say a reasonable apocalypse happens at two zombies per day, on top of two new zombifications per zombie per day, at an estimated 60,000 zombies killed per day doubling up the the end of the week then it\u2019s per day quadrupling. Easy to understand, right? Now here\u2019s the next part which will be a topic of the containment section of the answer; Zombies in the Walking Dead don\u2019t have a cure. Killing all the zombies won\u2019t solve the problem. Anyway, would it be easily contained?During, not at all.Afterwards?Several procedures would have to be put in place, such as Doctors being skilled fighters, being armed with weapons, and people close to death being restrained with something like handcuffs. Humanity took a massive blow but can prevent the outbreak after those procedures were made.  I know there could be issues with the maths. I based it on the Drake Equation though so substitute the numbers if you want.Basically: Zo = D*Zf+Y-(Zk*A) Zo = Zombies per dayD = Deaths Per Day or Y if not initial day.Zf = Zombification Daily RateY = Yesterday\u2019s Total ZombiesZk = Zombies Killed Yesterday or Zombies killed on initial day if 0 zombies were killed Yesterday.A = Awareness Spread of given day For example, my Day 1 was 199200 = 172,800 * 1.5 + 0 - (60,000 * 1) = ~200,000Day 2 was 380,000 = 200000 * 1.5 + 200000 - (60,000 * 2) If you want a zombie to eat 2 people on average per day, change the 1.5 to 2. Easy.If you want people to be aware of zombies and aggressive towards them, immediately after the initial outbreak, change A to 10 or something. Anyway. I hope I answered this thoroughly. ",

            "answer_text": "An actual zombie outbreak would be laughable. There's a reason why man is the dominant species on this planet and the reason is because we are incredibly efficient killers. The best on the planet in fact. Your traditional walking dead zombie by contrast isn't. Any predator that you can simply out-walk and certainly out-think isn't going to pose a problem to the 6 billion apex predators on the planet. Especially since the zombie weakness is quite simple to deduce. Now using the walking dead theory that anyone who does die is simply going to reanimate and start attempting to eat people Governments would simply enforce stricter quarantine laws and be extra vigilant around care homes and hospitals. A lot of the zombie lore entails a critical mass of zombies overwhelming survivors - what you very rarely see is the buildup to that critical mass. For instance in Walking Dead and 28 Later series the heroes both wake up from comas once the critical mass has been achieved. I think it would need an extreme threat escalation to make a zombie outbreak an actual threat to humanity - the zombie infection vector being airborne and infecting great swathes of people might make that possible. An interesting albeit completely hideous take on this is the Crossed comic series where an extremely infectious disease can very quickly (a matter of seconds) turn people into total psychopaths - they retain their intelligence (to a point) but they are totally committed to causing massive casualties. This makes it incredibly difficult to combat since soldiers get infected and turn on their comrades making it practically impossible to contain. So in summing up my feeling is that your traditional zombie is too slow and too shit at killing to be a credible threat to people and they would be killed far too quickly to build up to the critical mass needed to threaten humanity.
