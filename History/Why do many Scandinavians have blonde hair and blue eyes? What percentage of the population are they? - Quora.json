So over time, humans who were lighter-pigmented survived longer than those who were darker in the north. This also means their genes prevailed over dark ones, this is why many ethnic Scandinavians are blonde-haired or light-pigmented. Though they are all not uniformly blonde there are variations within various parts. Scandinavia as a whole is the most fairest-haired regions of Europe and the world .% of fair hairNorway = (usually) 75%+, especially in Central Norway, though some regions to southwest and the very north have a range of 65-74%. This is the blondest Scandinavian country.Sweden = (usually) 65-74% in most the country with exceptions in the very north where many might be Saamis or have Saami admixtures it drops to below 60% and the very southeastern part bordering the Gulf of Bothnia where it rises to again the 75%+ range. Sweden is not blonder than Norway.Denmark = (usually) 65-74% fair hair range, only very small districts in the northeastern coastal region go to the 75%+ range!
