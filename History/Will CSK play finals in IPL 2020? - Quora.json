            "answer_text": "If CSK wants to top the table nearly 20 matches are needed to go on there side like how it is shown in the picture below  But that is something not look exactly possible so lets just talk about CSK qualification criteria: In order for CSK to qualify they will have to win all the remaining matches which will take them to 16 points. 16 Points usually mean you will qualify but even if CSK wins 7 matches it can take them to play-off but they currently have a very bad NRR so they will need to take a look over there. . CSK does stand a chance to qualify but honestly the way they are playing I think there are already teams like DC MI RCB who deserves to qualify more than CSK ",

            "answer_text": "He'll my friends. Let's start my answer::  Your question is so simple. You are asking about the csk will qualify in the playoffs. Hundred Percent will qualify for CSK for Play Off in 2020.  Talking about the record till date, CSK has qualified every year and many of them have also reached the finals. This time also I feel that CSK is go for qualify and also play final of 2020.  Losing a couple of matches does not make much difference. CSK has Experience Player and Captain Cool. He will come back again.  If we talk further, Ambati Rayudu and Bravo will return for CSK in the next two-three matches, which will make the team stronger.  With all these things, I end my answer here. I apologize if you have said something wrong to me or if something is wrong with my answer. You tell me i improve it.
