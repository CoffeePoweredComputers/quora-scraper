If you want to learn how to defend against multiple attackers, here\u2019s a few tips: DO NOT run - As soon as you run, you expose your back to attack. If your attacker runs fast enough, he\u2019ll grab you and the rest will beat you to the ground. Running is the worst thing you can do.  DO NOT fight fancy - This is not the movies where you can pull off these flashy techniques in the middle of multiple attackers. Your life\u2019s at stake so you need to be practical. Otherwise, you\u2019re going to get beaten or killed. Circle around your attackers - Keep one in front of the other. Knock them out one by one. As soon as they see each other go down, they\u2019ll likely stop.  Want to learn more? Read and subscribe. Home ",
