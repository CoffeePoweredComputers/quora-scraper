            "answer_text": "Not being certain of the OP\u2019s intent I will answer with the largest engine in terms of displacement that was put in a production automobile. That would be the 1913 Pierce-Arrow Model 6\u201366 Raceabout with its 824 cubic inch 140 HP inline 6 engine. Cost new was around, inflation adjusted, $500,000, The 66 was named for its rated horsepower which had risen to nearly 100 by 1913. The last 6\u201366 was sold in 1918. The engine continued to be used in vehicles like fire engines where the massive torque was needed. The Pierce-Arrow was a top tier automobile manufacturer whose cars rivaled and, some say, exceeded Rolls Royce in quality. http://autoweek.com/article/car-life/jay-leno-my-pierce-arrow    RM Sotheby's - r218 1913 Pierce-Arrow Model 66-A Seven-Passenger Touring Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company - Wikipedia http://www.pierce-arrow.com/history  Jay Leno takes us for a ride There have been larger engines custom installed in cars. My favorite is the WWII Merlin 1650 cubic inch V-12 aircraft engine that was famously used in the Spitfire and Mustang fighters. It has been mounted in several cars. Horsepower is likely to be 1,600+.  Rolls-Royce Merlin - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "That honor goes to Fiat. The 300 hp 4 cylinder 28.4L (1733 cubic inch) Fiat S76 Known affectionately as The Beast of Turin, the Fiat S76 has a history almost as grand as its massive 28.4L engine. It was built to pry a pair of speed records from the hands of the Blitzen Benz, another racer with an almost-as-menacing 21.5L 4-cylinder engine. Fiat built two S76 racers. One was destroyed and the other is in the process of being restored after a Fiat fan was able to find and purchase its chassis and engine. This 28.4L unit is the largest engine built for a car\u2014ever. Built in the winter of 1910/11 by Fiat to take on the Blitzen Benz, it featured a four cylinde 28.3 litre engine (190x250mm). Two of these cars were built. Number 1 was purchased by the Russian Prince Boris Soukhanov late 1911, but after the Russian revolution it went to Australia where it was fitted with a Stutz engine until it was crashed in 1924. Number 2 was retained by Fiat, but was scrapped in 1920, only the engine being kept. ",
