            "answer_text": "Probably not deposed, but I think he would have abdicated. Time Magazine was founded on 3 March 1923, and the Duke of York married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon on 26 April 1923. There is a Time magazine article written when Princess Elizabeth was age 3 which openly discusses the possibility of Edward abdicating. Wallis Simpson married Ernest Simpson on 21 July 1928. She would not meet the Prince of Wales for a few years. This article was published just weeks before Edward\u2019s 35th birthday and 7 years before Edward actually abdicated. At this age, people were worried about Edward, but there was still a reasonable hope that he would marry and have a child. Prince Charles was age 32 when he married Diana. Time Magazine: P'incess Is ThreeMonday, Apr. 29, 1929 If Death should come soon and suddenly to three men\u2014George V. Edward of Wales, the Duke of York\u2014England would have another Virgin Queen Elizabeth. Last week, romping in a yellow frock, the Princess Elizabeth passed her third birthday. She does not know that she is but three removes from the Throne; in fact she has only very recently discovered that she is a \"P'incess.\" It is barely a fortnight ago that she knocked with chubby fist upon a door, and when her mother called \"Who's there?\" answered in an important little voice, \"Lilybet, the P'incess.\" \"Lilybet's\" mother, Her Royal Highness the Duchess of York, is herself only two removes from becoming \"Queen Elizabeth\"\u2014which title is constantly and teasingly applied to her by Edward of Wales. She would be less than human if she did not sometimes wonder how much truth there is in the story that he once said he would renounce his rights upon the death of George V\u2014which would make her nickname come true. If there is a woman in England who can remain unperturbed by the teasing of Edward of Wales it is certainly the fresh, buxom, altogether \"jolly\" little Duchess, but with a Throne in the balance it must be a trifle nerve-wracking to be called \"Queen Elizabeth\" by a man who can make you that. \u2026 AFAIK Wallis Simpson was just the last of a long line of married or divorced, older, pushy women that Edward dated.

            "answer_text": "Probably not, as the British monarchy is one of the most stable political institutions in the world. Edward VIII , born as Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David on June 23, 1894 was oldest son of King George V and Queen Mary. He became Prince of Wales on his sixteenth birthday by his father's order, nine weeks after his father succeeded as King. He served in the British Army during the First World War and had undertaken a number of overseas obligations in his father's name prior to becoming King. He had done well, and was a likable man, with considerable personal charm. Edward became King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Empire, and Emperor of India, on January 20, 1936 following his father's death. During his brief reign he disregarded established protocal, and caused concern among politicians by his obvious contempt for what he regarded as a staid political establishment. What kind of King he would have ultimately proven to be was short circuited by his infatuation with Wallis Simpson, a twice divorced woman from Baltimore. His announced intention to marry her led to his abdication on December 11, 1936, after which he became the Duke of Windsor by his brother, the new King's, order. I personally do not believe he would have abdicated or been deposed if the Mrs. Simpson crisis had never occurred. The monarchy had survived frivolous rulers before, and would have again. I also do not believe he would have been anywhere near as inspiring a leader during the World War as his brother was, but we will never know. A very likeable and charming man, he might have matured and become as great a King as his brother was. I doubt it, but one never knows... ",
