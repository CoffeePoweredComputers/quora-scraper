            "answer_text": "From the point of view of the Allies (chiefly Austria, Britain, Prussia and Russia), Napoleon was responsible for warfare in Europe being almost continuous from 1797 to 1815. When he was defeated and forced to abdicate 1n 1814, he was sent to an island off the coast of Italy called Elba. Elba is only 266 kilometres (166 miles) from the coast of France and in 1815, he escaped back to France and the war started all over again. When he was defeated again at Waterloo, he was sent to St Helena, an island in the South Atlantic some 1,950 kilometres (1,210 miles) west of the coast of southwestern Africa, 4,000 kilometres (2,500 miles) from South America and 7000 kilometres (43550 miles) from France. There was no real prospect of him escaping from there. ",

            "answer_text": "Because clearly he hadn\u2019t gotten the idea that he wasn\u2019t supposed to rule France anymore when they gave him his own principality in Elba to rule for life with a stipend paid from French Treasury, after he agreed to in a treaty he had signed. There\u2019s only so much you can do when a criminal who\u2019s been sent to a luxurious house arrest with a stipend paid for by his victims escapes prison to do the same shit that got him thrown there in the first place.
