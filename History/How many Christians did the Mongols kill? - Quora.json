            "answer_text": "For being Christian? Not one. For Soldiers fighting against us, I guess a bunch. But not because they were Christians. MANY MONGOLS THEMSELVES WERE CHRISTIAN. Not converted Christians but BORN CHRISTIANS. Nestorian Christians belonging to the \u201cEastern Church\u201d were integral part of Mongol People long before any conquests came to be. Even then, during Mongol rule Christians did exceptionally well. Since Mongol Queens were VERY fond of Christianity. And Mongol Khans took their wives and their counsel VERY seriously. In many Christian texts, mainly Georgian, Armenian and Orthodox texts Mongol Khans and Khatans (queens) are proclaimed to be the reincarnations of the Virgin Mary, Saints and Arch Angels. Below for example, a depiction of Hulagu Khan and his wife Doquz Khatan who was a prominent Christian leader in Ill Khanate. Oh by the way, we had a alliance with the Pope and the French. We were going to work together against Muslims. Mongols were planning to hand Jerusalem to Christians after it was conquered. But guess who gave up and betrayed the Mongols. The French. Worst of all, the Mongol General Kitbuqa, who was left with small garrison to defend was a prominent Christian and was betrayed by the \u201cWestern Christians\u201d to the hand of the Muslims. He stayed on the battlefield to the last man, knowing full well that he had no chance of winning. He remains as one of the immortal heroes, side by side with Khans of the Mongolian people to this day.  You probably don\u2019t know anything about this because, people want you to think that Mongols were and are some nightmarish monsters on a horseback eating and burning everything down. Just shows the extend of their ignorance. If you believe this, which I think you do from the question you posted, well then you are no better. ",

            "answer_text": "If you mean how many Christians did the Mongols kill for being Christian the answer is zero - see below. If the question is how many they killed because they were fighting against them in battles as military enemies who just happened to be Christians, the answer is quite a lot. The Mongols did not really understand religious intolerance at all and one of Gengis\u2019 sons was married to a (Nestorian) Christian, so at the start they favoured Christians on the whole and made several provincial governors (where some of them took the opportunity to persecute Muslims.) Many mongol rulers did, later, convert to Islam and some of them did engage in a little anti-Christian activity but not on an unusual scale. ",
