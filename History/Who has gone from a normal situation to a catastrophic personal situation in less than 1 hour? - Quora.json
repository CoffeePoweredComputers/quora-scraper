            "answer_text": "Catastrophe: A sudden event causing great trouble or damage It's 1:00 am. The house is quiet in its sleepy wooded setting. The screechy cicadas have been blessedly still for a few weeks now, and the crickets have just wound down. I awaken as usual, get up and begin my nightly wander, checking that children are home, lights are off, and the doors are locked. From the time the children were babies it\u2019s been a habit to check on them in the night. This particular night I find myself at the kitchen sink. I wonder why I am there; do I feel thirsty? I couldn't recall feeling thirsty. I feel a slight flutter on the back of my knees; a feathery butterfly brushing past me. I turn slightly, away from the sink\u2026and then Nothing. There was Nothing for a time. When there was Something again, I wasn't thinking of water, of thirst, or of butterflies. I was focused instead on boxers and MMA fighters. I cried for them and the pain they endured. Those poor, poor men. And women I supposed, and shuddered at the trauma to their bodies. I cried softly for quite a while. I wiped the tears from my face, then wondered why my tears were thick. And sticky. It was so dark I couldn't see my fingers, but I realized the tears were made of blood. I thought I had such deep empathy for the boxers that my tears had turned to blood. Then there was Nothing again. The world was formless and void, like the cosmos before creation. When there was something again, my mind was clearer. I knew my tears weren't blood; I was bleeding and crying. I reached to the counter for a towel and held it against the wettest part. After that, I felt weak and dizzy. I wanted to go back to the Nothing but was nervous the kids would find me in the Nothing the next day and be traumatized. So I crawled through rooms to the base of the stairs and called weakly for my husband. It was 2:00 am. When he came down, he said, Oh! Oh! And then left. He came back with a towel and began to clean the floor. I appreciate it when he cleans. But I thought I might die while he tidied. Later he said he did that so the children wouldn't be traumatized when they saw the deep red pools. He gathered me up and brought me to the hospital. He said they looked at him archly, suspiciously, certain he was an abuser. The hospital staff sewed my forehead, my nose, my lip. There were many stitches. The doctor said it was difficult to see what was what in the mess of what had been my face. He said I would need an ENT and perhaps a plastic surgeon to reassemble me. They realized my husband probably wasn't an abuser when they heard how confused we both were; neither of us could explain my condition. They only knew that I had a deep and intense regard for the pain of boxers and MMA fighers. They figured I had been drunk or drugged and were perplexed when my tests came back clear, one after another. Finally, having sewed all they could sew, tested all they could test, questioned all they could question, they came up with nothing and released us into the night. My nose was broken in three places and caved inward. My forehead was split, as well as my lip. My chin had a golf ball-sized lump. Over the next few days my eyes turned vibrant colors and my face swelled to a near bursting point. Later the ENT operated and reset my nose. Six months later the plastic surgeon cleaned it up with another surgery. A few months after that he did another surgery to smooth out the wrinkled skin on my nose. Three years later I still have a slight bump on my chin, and two scars on my nose. I have regular headaches and suspicions of forgetfulness and confusion. I can't smell well anymore. I have to ask others to test foods for freshness and am paranoid about dog odor in the house. I quit my job in financial services and now work in interior design. The new job is fun and doesn't involve memory or millions of dollars of others\u2019 money that I could accidently misplace. We never discovered what happened that night. We figured I fainted onto the tile floor. It was either that or an intruder with a cricket bat. ",

Tbey would relise this isnothing to do with a virus and al, http://to.do with tne fed, tne big banks big pharma tbe un agenda21\u201320/30 which is part of the control group like tbe eu, i f,ecb, nato, wto , who, all are control groups and owe their creators a big financial and political control by power of signatories into the un in 1945, when it was onky the un or rather its previous iteration tbe league of nations, the rest at that time did not exist. Tbe additions have been introduced without any danfare or need of approval or acceptance. If you rem the eu was a common market it was the mastrecht treaty it was the lisbon treaty. So many variants. Then thee was the absolute no votes from the uk ireland, portugal. Then eu showed its type of democratic values, by insisting we had voted wrongly and we should vote again. the second vote outcome was a miracle in mind control, somehow, tbe three countries at the iteration of the lisbon treaty, remarkably had a full change of mind and voted. Overwhelming wee. Really. Tbat was the first hint of sheeple and a different idea of democracy. Now im not anti german at all nor am i anti europe, nor am i against a democratic union of likeminded countries with a common market. That never materialised. Still to this day, despite the uk and others saying this is no good. The leadership is permanent and working to a different hynm shert to everyone within the eu is is. There lies the problem. It was not created as a thing of good for humans, it was created as a control group not the same thing most expected or wished for. Tbe owners of he eu. Imf,ecb etc etc etc are the same owners of the big banks, big pharma, big military etc. In the usa, a few presidents warned us of tbe impending problems if the military industrial complex ever got intertwined with goverment. We didnt listen.you need to now, tbe un is also tbe main control group. It has an agenda 21\u201320/30 which is what tbe covid -19 is, just bY another name. Its your life, your body, your rights. E counted, speak up. ",
