            "answer_text": "Well, if there is an event that never happened, then I would say is the future. The future never happens, and never will, because when we get to the future, it is no longer the future, but rather the present. We always dream about the future, and when we dream, we assume, and when we assume, we express our opinions. We never assumed of what happened or what is happening, but rather what will happen. Also, the future is part of history, which is a little bit confusing at first. The reason is that we think of the events in the future and the events of the past, which we also tend to focus on. But the future never happens, and the past has happened. ",
