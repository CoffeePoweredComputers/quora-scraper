            "answer_text": "Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is basically a root vegetable, starchy tuber that is used as a staple food in many countries of the world. After the crop harvesting, in order to avoid sprouting in tubers and maintaining its availability throughout the year for consumption purposes, it is stored in cold storages (Below 10\u00b0C). The low temperature inturn affects the carbohydrate (Starch) metabolism of stored tubers and leads to conversion of tuber's starch to glucose and fructose. The presence of these simple sugars in cold-stored potatoes impart sweetness to them. This phenomenon is known as Cold Induced Sweetning. Many theories are there reagrding this phenomenon but still we are not sure about the exact mechanism of how metabolism is governed under cold temperatures. I don't like the way they taste after turning sweet\u2026but they are still healthy and are potatoes only! \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude1d ",
