            "answer_text": "I think that Babur is a good example of this.  Babur Most people know of Babur as the founder of the Mughal Empire. Few know just how difficult his earlier life was. Babur became the King of Ferghana at the age of 11\u201312. This was because of his father\u2019s sudden death when a roof collapsed. This was a turbulent time in Central Asia. Conflict was present everywhere. The different kings and rulers were constantly at war with each other. It seemed more and more likely that the Timurids and Moghuls would go to war. But the biggest danger was a man who was relatively unknown. Muhammad Shaybani Khan and his Uzbek army would soon rise and change the face of Central Asia. For a more detailed answer on Muhammad Shaybani Khan - \u200eAhmad Abubakr (\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0628\u06a9\u0631)\u200e's answer to Who are some lesser known but still interesting leaders throughout history? What is their story?  A map of the region At the age of 14\u201315, Babur captured the city of Samarkand. Unfortunately, he was forced to abandon it because of a plot against him back home in Ferghana. He would try to capture it once more a few years later, only to be forced to surrender to Muhammad Shaybani Khan. A defeat in which his sister was lost to Shaybani Khan, who married her. Babur was unable to return home either as Ferghana too was lost. Now Babur was left without a home. Seeing the dire situation that he was in, most of his retainers and men abandoned him. They saw no future with him and decided to find other leaders to follow. Babur and his mother headed to the city of Tashkent. He had no wealth or resources. Only very few men still followed him. Tashkent was the only place where he and his mother could be safe. Tashkent was the domain of the Moghuls of Moghulistan. The Khans of Moghulistan were his uncles and brothers of Qutlugh Nigar Khanum, Babur\u2019s mother. Babur spent some time in Tashkent dependent on his maternal relatives for his survival. He lived in poverty in the city and despised it. The young king had lost his friends, allies, home and everything else. He suffered much humiliation in the city or so he believed. Babur even thought of abandoning everything and becoming an explorer. He had always wanted to travel to China and see its marvels. Now that his mother was safe with her family, perhaps he could follow his dream. However, at the very end, he decided against it. Babur would use the time to make new alliances and gain more allies. He would join the Moghuls in their war against Shaybani Khan and the Uzbeks. As he said himself, Moghuls and Turks must both stand against Shaybani Khan for any hope. Unfortunately for them, they were still defeated by the Uzbeks. A year or two later, an opportunity presented itself. The Timurid King of Kabul and Babur\u2019s uncle, Mirza Ulugh Beg II, had died. He only had an infant as an heir. Taking advantage of this, Ulugh Beg\u2019s son-in-law took control of the city. Mukim Beg Arghun, despite being in power, was still seen as an usurper by the nobility. Babur used this opportunity to gather forces and capture the city. He would become the Timurid King of Kabul. Soon he would remain as the last Timurid King. The last of a dynasty that once ruled an empire whose might was unmatched in the entire world, save the Ming Empire of China.  Note Babur\u2019s Kingdom of Kabul (red). To the east is the Delhi Sultanate (green). Babur would capture more territories and gain more power. After ruling over the Kingdom of Kabul for over a decade, Babur launched an invasion against the Delhi Sultanate. Babur led 10,000 men against the great army of the Delhi Sultanate which numbered around 100,000. Despite being greatly outnumbered, Babur was victorious in the First Battle of Panipat on 21 April 1526. He captured the city of Delhi, the capital of the Delhi Sultanate for three centuries, and would go on to establish the Mughal Empire. He would face the remaining of his enemies in the region in the Battle of Khanwa in 1527 and emerge victorious once more, despite being outnumbered. This resulted in the consolidation of his power in North India. The accession of the Mughal Empire had begun and within about a century and a half, it would control almost the entirety of the Subcontinent. For an account of the First Battle of Panipat - \u200eAhmad Abubakr (\u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0628\u06a9\u0631)\u200e's answer to What was the most important battle ever fought by the Mughal Empire?  The First Battle of Panipat Note: Babur\u2019s son, Humayun, is another example of this. Defeated by a Mughal general, Sher Shah Suri, and driven to the West. He was constantly being forced further West by the man who stole his empire. Even betrayed by his brothers multiple times. Eventually, Humayun had to flee to the Safavid court in Persia. Here he remained for about a decade before returning after the death of Sher Shah Suri. Assisted by a Persian army, Humayun took back his empire from the family of Sher Shah Suri. He punished his brothers for their betrayal. This would re-establish the Timurid Dynasty on the throne once again.  Humayun ",
