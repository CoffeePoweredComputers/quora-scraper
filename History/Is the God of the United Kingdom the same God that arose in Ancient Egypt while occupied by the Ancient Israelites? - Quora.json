Be THAT as it may, modern Christianity and its symbols in secular society (eg. \u201cGod save the Queen\u201d in the UK and \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d in the US, etc.) does indeed maintain that the God of the Tanakh (which Christians are pleased to call the \u201cOld\u201d testament) is the same God (the Father) referenced in the later scriptures called \u201cThe New Testament.\u201d So the God who manifested to Moses when the Hebrews were in Egypt was the God of Abraham and the God spoken of by Jesus, and the God of the various Creeds in Christian prayer. Why do you ask? Were you wondering if some other Deity slipped into common parlance in the UK? ",

            "answer_text": "\u201cIs the God of the United Kingdom the same God that arose in Ancient Egypt while occupied by the Ancient Israelites?\u201d There is a theory that the Israelites adopted the single deity concept from Akhenaten. His rule as Pharaoh lasted less than 14 years, and had no lasting affect on Egypt. How it could have affected the ancient Israelites who occupied Egypt has never been satisfactorily explained, and it is possible Akhenaten could have taken the idea of a single god from the Israelites.
