            "answer_text": "He is very famous, though not always in a good way\u2026 eg, 2 billion (1/3) of the planet\u2019s population is Muslim and know of him, but many hate him because he was not a supporter of Sunnism and leaned towards the Shia branch of Islam. He is very famous amongst Jews and Secularists, for he is known to have a Jewish education and background, and also by Scientists, in particular Albert Einstein, who famously said that Ataturk was the 3rd most intelligent person in the world after he himself (Einstein) being the 1st, his wife (Einsteins wife) being the 2nd, then Ataturk being the 3rd.. In the political scene, the educated politicians know of him, maybe Trump or Bush won\u2019t know, but even Ghandi knew of him.. saying \u201c Until i saw Ataturk, i used to think the British were God\u201d etc And let\u2019s not forget the 40 Turkic tribes of Turan, who in total make up 285 Million Turks from Turkey to north China, who now speak a single universal language known as \u201cTurkish\u201d thanks to Ataturk\u2019s language reform.. Quote from actor Jackie Chan \u201c In China Ataturk is taught in schools by force, if you do not know Ataturk, then that means that you know nothing at all \u201d  ",
