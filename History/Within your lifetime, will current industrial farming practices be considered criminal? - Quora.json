            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think industrial farming practices will be considered criminal, but it will end, because it is totally unsustainable. Probably six out of seven people alive have been conjured out of thin air! The Haber-Bosch process creates bioavailable nitrogen (ammonia) from atmospheric N3, which is not available to life because it is very stable and difficult to break down. Haber-Bosch turns atmospheric N3 into NH3 by applying high temperature and pressure and hydrogen gas as a feedstock. The high temperatures and pressures required are almost trivial with the use of natural gas, which is mostly elemental hydrogen (H2). Doing such a thing without natural gas will cost at least an order of magnitude more, because renewable energy sources typically create electricity, which is not fungible with natural gas. You would need multi-stage compressors and difficult-to-control and energetically expensive electric arc heating. Then there\u2019s the matter of feedstock, which is natural gas, which is about 70% to 90% hydrogen! Now one can obtain hydrogen gas via electricity from solar panels and wind turbines, using electrolysis, but again, this will be an incredibly expensive source of hydrogen. So, as natural gas goes into permanent, irrevocable decline, so will industrial crop yields, which are totally dependent on ammonia fertilizer from natural gas. The so-called \u201cfracking revolution\u201d has considerably reduced the cost of natural gas, which is not the same as saying it will be available forever. Bioavailable nitrogen is the big one, but other fertilizers and pesticides are also totally dependent on fossil sunlight, which must eventually end. So, unless you believe that the US has a chewy nougat core of hydrocarbons, industrial food production will not continue. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019m a farmer, retired, who used mostly conventional industrial type practices including the use of synthetic pesticides, manufactured fertilizers, etc, but I also did some organic stuff once in a while. I\u2019m also university trained in my field. Various farming practices have been outlawed over the years, or regulated out of existence, and there\u2019s little doubt this trend will continue, for mostly good reasons. We don\u2019t typically use human wastes as fertilizer for instance, unless it\u2019s been sterilized, in the USA. We have removed some of the worst or most dangerous pesticides from the market. We have tighter rather than looser regulations on what can and can\u2019t be in foods sold for human consumption. More changes along such lines will happen, and it\u2019s good that they will, because this will mean better public health outcomes for all of us, and a cleaner safer more sustainable environment for all of us. But we will still be doing things pretty much the same way we do now for the foreseeable future. Organic producers will gain market share, but it\u2019s extremely unlikely they will dominate any staple food market. ",
