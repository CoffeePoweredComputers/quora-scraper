            "answer_text": "As stated before, Kennedy\u2019s advisers all recommended invading Cuba. There was an invasion force ready with about 250,000 troops to invade. But, the Soviet commander in Cuba possessed \u201ctactical nuclear weapons\u201d, battlefield nukes, to defend his own forces of about 50,000 people. If Kennedy had ordered the invasion we would have seen a real situation where the Soviet commander would have no choice but to defend his troops or surrender. During this crisis here was an additional nuclear incident where US surface ships forced a nuclear armed Soviet submarine to surface. The captain and principle officers of the sub believed nuclear war might already have started and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo. This description is from Wikipedia: \u201c\u2026. Arkhipov alone opposed the launch, and eventually he persuaded (captain) Savitsky to surface the submarine and await orders from Moscow..\u201d At other times scenarios involved false nuclear attack radar alarms. In each case the people evaluating what they were seeing took the chance that the indications were erroneous. The movie \u201cWar Games\u201d depicts such a false alarm situation. For all the safety systems we, the US and USSR (now Russia) and other of the principle nuclear armed nations, have been very lucky. With nuclear proliferation the chances of bad luck increases. ",

            "answer_text": "Very, very close..because we were ready to see who would blink first. Even if we invaded conventionally with the military, the USSR would try to invade West Berlin because Russia did not have plans to enter our homeland like East Germany had, if ordered, to invade West Germany. So, the USSR had one choice of launching their subamarine-launch-ballistic-missiles and/or the medium range ballistic missiles from Cuba. I know that they both had two choices to either invade/defend Europe and/or global thermonuclear war. This was released 25 years after the Cuban Missile Crisis because it had to be declassified. ",
