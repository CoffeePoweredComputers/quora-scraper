            "answer_text": "The Absolute WORST company is called \"AVAdirect\". *Avoid* them and you should be ok. Why are they so bad? When you visit their site, everything looks normal - but what they do is Ship you \"USED\" *parts when everything on their site is advertised as new. It's completely insane, but it happened to us with an intel cpu. The chip they tried to send us was obviously Used and all marked-up, and had thermal-paste residue left on it. Completely useless, and a waste of time. The Worst part is they also try to rip you off with your refund. They try to \"Partially refund\" you - this is their actual business model, completely a joke. They're also incredibly Slow with everything they do, and their \"customer service\" if you could call it that is so rude. It took them over 5-days just to \"test\" the Used CPU they sent us once they got it back, it is by far the rock-bottom Worst company you could go with. The answer to your question is \"AVAdirect\", they are indeed a Terrible company, runned by mindless people. I think they are based out of Ohio. Save yourself the headache and money, and go with a reputable company for your OEM PC equipment/parts like Newegg - and you won't have to worry about getting Used junk parts that AVA ships out. Hope this helps, good luck! ",
