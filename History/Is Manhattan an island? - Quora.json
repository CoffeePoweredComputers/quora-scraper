            "answer_text": "I can definitively answer that question with a firm Yes. Why am I so sure? Because I swam around the island in 1983 as part of the Second Annual Manhattan Island Marathon Swim (a swimming race). Back then we started at E. 96th St. and swam counter-clockwise: up the East River, up the Harlem, through Spuyten Duyvil and into the Hudson (going south), under the GW Bridge, around the Battery (where I got stuck treading water against an outgoing tide -- someone miscalculated the tides), and back up the East River to end at the same spot we started. All told, a \"circumswim\" of about 30 miles. And it took me a bit over 8 hours to do (non-stop swimming). So consider me a Primary Source on this question! ;-) ADDED TO UPDATE ABOVE: OK, I guess I need to revise my answer to reflect what others are pointing out in this thread: there\u2019s Manhattan the island, and there\u2019s Manhattan the Borough in the City of New York, which includes a few other specks of land. I swam around the island of Manhattan. And by the way, I am the first author (after Washington Irving in 1809) to write a historical novel about the birth of NYC from its earliest beginnings (1609), and also the first to go into depth about the legendary \u201c$24 purchase\u201d of said-same island. I wrote a series of ebook novellas about all this and then published the full-length novel in 2018: New York 1609. And finally, the Harlem and the East River are NOT rivers. They are \u201cwaterways\u201d or \u201cstraits\u201d as part of the tidal estuary that forms New York Harbor. And I swam them all! ",

            "answer_text": "Manhattan is a part of the five boroughs in New York State (Queens, Staten Island, Brooklyn, and the Bronx) that make up New York City. Henry Hudson, an English explorer sailing under the flag of the Dutch East India Company, is said to have discovered Manhattan in 1609. He first sailed into what is known today as the New York Harbor. It is reported that the Manhattan settlement was bought for almost $24.00 from a group of Native Americans called the Canarsie. The island was previously known as New Amsterdam. The lower part of Manhattan included forts, homes, government buildings, and farms.  In 1664, the English captured New Amsterdam and renamed it New York. Manhattan is considered an island because islands are surrounded by water in all directions. Some people confuse it as being a peninsula, but peninsulas are surrounded by water in only three directions. Manhattan Island consists of Roosevelt Island, Governors Island, Randalls/Wards Island, Ellis, and Liberty Islands. Manhattan is 13 miles long and 2.3 miles wide. Manhattan also borders the lower part of the Hudson River, which was named after Henry Hudson; the East River to the east of it, and the Harlem River to the north of the island. The island connects to the state of New Jersey to the west via tunnels and bridges. Three of the New York City boroughs border Manhattan. The Bronx is to the northeast, and Brooklyn and Queens are to the east and south of the island. The island of Manhattan is famously known for many historic sites and landmarks. In the 1800s, the famed Brooklyn Bridge opened (1883), the Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886, and The Wall Street Journal was first published in 1889. Believe it or not, the paper only consisted of four pages and the cost was only four cents. Also, Manhattan Island became a part of the five boroughs in 1898. During the 20th century, Manhattan had some significantly more accomplishments, such as the opening of its first subway in 1904, the opening of the Holland Tunnel in 1927, and the publishing of the first edition of the New York Daily News in 1919. In lower Manhattan, there is the Financial District on Wall Street. It is considered the financial center of the world, Wall Street businesses that deal with the stock exchange and financial markets can be found there. In the 1600s, the street was named after an actual wall that was put up as a border for defensive reasons for the New Amsterdam settlement. The World Trade Center was constructed on Manhattan Island and dedicated in 1973. The center consisted of two towers at 110 stories high. At that time, the (twin) towers were the tallest buildings in the world.  Also on Manhattan Island, is its 60-storied office building called, One Chase Manhattan Plaza built in 1974. There are more monumental and infamous places to visit on Manhattan Island, including the Empire State Building, New York City University, Columbia University, the Lincoln Center, Harlem, Chinatown, and Central Park.
