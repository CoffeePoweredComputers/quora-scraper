            "answer_text": "Yes and no The eastern part was renamed as Roman Empire when the western part fell, and this name( or close permutstions as Roman Kingdom or Kingdom of Romans) was the legal name of the eastern part till the end. And after the end. In the end of the 16th century, the Germans who have styled themselves as the \u201cHoly Roman Empire of the German nation\u201d wanted to steal the \u201cRoman-ness\u201d from the actual descendants of the Roman empire. They pushed for renaming the defunct empire and call it Byzantine. That's it. It is like if the USA stops existing then Brazil renames itself as \u201cthe Holy USA of the Brazilian nation\u201d and then pushes for the name Washingtonia for the USA. ",

The eastern Roman Empire was later known as Byzantine empire since later European historians wanted to separate the eastern Roman Empire from the Holy Roman Empire thus named the ERE as the Byzantine empire. However people of ERE never referred their country as Byzantine empire. ",

Later historians referred to the eastern part of the Roman Empire as Byzantium to differentiate it from the western Roman Empire that fell in 476. The word Byzantium comes from Byzantion which was the original Greek colony dated around 657 BC located in present day Istanbul. ",
