            "answer_text": "Thanks for the compliment of the A2A. My answer is similar to E. Kier's. The arts are essentially a reflection of culture, with a few outliers working in advance - making predictions. The reflector-artists, which are the predominant group by far, are part of a giant feedback loop. They create from their position as members of the society, either deeply or shallowly, and the receivers of the art take that artwork in and internalize its content, thereby developing deeper understandings of themselves and their own culture through the experience of seeing and hearing. Through the receivers' deepened understanding, their responses to the culture then change.  With this influence (of course in addition to other aspects of their lives), they are helped to mature a bit. Through time and continued exposure, at least some of them are better able to become capable of invention, of more creative relationship, diplomacy, business, and other endeavors. Society inches forward. Artists then register these advances and once again, reflect them in their artwork. And the process continues.  It's not dissimilar from the way we grow through relationship with parents, lovers, and friends. We learn about ourselves through interaction and the reflection of ourselves in the eyes of others. Thereby we make progress and change. The arts are capable of doing the same thing in deeper, more subtle ways - reaching areas of our humanity that the often crude methods of human communication leave untouched.  We use all our experiences and interactions as mirrors for development - individually, communally, as cultures, and as a species. The arts have always formed one of most ancient, enduring  - and useful - tools.  ",

            "answer_text": "Art is fundamentally about how we see ourselves. Works of art can be mediums both visual and written as well as musical and others. Art casts a light on the world through the eyes of the artist. In this way, art lets us see much more of the world than we would elsewise see. It reveals to us hidden perspectives on our world. Art can be reflective and expose secrets of the past through the wizened eyes of the present. Dante's Inferno was not a fantasy about heaven and hell it was an expose on the corruption and malediction in the Italian politics of it's day through the stories of the past. The book is a smorgasbord of cultural references for it's time. This work of fiction inspired countless paintings and illustrations and continues to do so today.   <Canto 32 :Paul Gustave Dore>  Art can be illuminating to events of the present through another's eyes. These images then serve as snapshots of time for future viewers. Francisco Goya produced powerful paintings depicting the French occupation of Spain and the resulting uprisings. We can see the brutality of such an uprising and the desperation on both sides as they fight for their lives.  < Francisco Goya : The Second of May 1808 ( painted in 1814)>  Art can be imaginative and dream of futures no one could possibly predict. Sometimes these imaginings inspire real advances. It has been said by the inventor of the mobile phone Martin Cooper that he was inspired by the communicators of Star Trek to develop the technology. E.M. Forster in 1909 predicted a world in The Machine Stops that is so eerily similar to our own modern world you must wonder if he had a time machine. Forster even managed to capture the potential pitfalls of this modern world we live in and offer a warning of what may yet come to pass. Illustrator Frank R. Paul imagined both fantastic and surprisingly predictive visions of what the future might look like.   <Frank R. Paul : \"Science & Invention\", January 1922. Volume 9 Number 9. >  Art is about us. It is all of our best and our worst. Art is our triumphs and our failures. Since the very first cave paintings we have endeavored to leave a mark and to say, \"We were here.\", \"This was us.\".  As long as there are intelligent beings to make it, there will always be art.  <35,000 to 40,000 year old \"selfies\" in Pettakere cave in Indonesia near Maros in Sulawesi.> Thought to be the oldest hand stencils and cave paintings in the world.  We were here. This was us.   <More art from the same caves nearby in Indonesia near Maros.>  These are our dreams. This is our history. ",

            "answer_text": "To a large extent, the visual arts of literature, architecture. sculpture and paintings were used by the early Christian church to spread its influence- especially during the Italian Renaissance. As the church buildings were the physical giants of their cities and the power giants of their regions, they naturally influenced the mindset of the local inhabitants. As the merchant class became more influential, they began to show off their importance too and had homes designed, portraits made, and biographies written.  Writers, architects, sculptors and painters found the church hierarchy and the merchants to be a good source of income. The creative types bought homes, food, clothing and art supplies with their income. Trickle down indeed.  ",

            "answer_text": "It's a plausible scientific hypothesis that singing and dancing, in an early form, developed before language and were a resource from which it was refined.  This probably happened before Homo Sapiens. The concept of Art as referring to an object is of historically recent invention, coming from the word art meaning, the human skill of making things.  Most of these things were both useful and beautiful, because humans love beauty.  Nowadays this is called \"craft\".  Some of them had no physical use but had social or religious meaning.  Some of this making predated the physicalization of language.  After the invention of writing, these artifacts helped people remember experiences and meanings that could not be put into words.    ",

Introspection facilitates our growth as individual human beings and the same is true for social development within human societies. Art facilitates dialogue between people while mediating between scientific and spiritual concerns to cross boundaries which otherwise limit our potential. Art is a tool of communication with an inherent purpose of influence. Art is intended to change one's perspective, and when it does sucessfully on a social level, it can function as a catalyst, symbol, or language propelling revolution.
