            "answer_text": "If a bunch of organizations decided to make such a list, one name is guaranteed to feature in all of the lists, Prof Noam Chomsky. He is probably only intellectual (maybe, apart from Slavoj Zizek) who has a cult following. He is considered to be father of the modern linguistics and currently is a professor at MIT. However, in the public he is more widely known as the greatest voice of dissent in the USA. He considers himself a syndico-anarchist and has been one of the harshest critic of US policy of interventionism. His lectures and books on how governments and media can almost subconsciously collude to create narrative of their choice are widely studied worldwide (e.g. Manufacturing Dissent). He is also leading authority in current geopolitical affairs. Considering his penchant for being factually accurate and distaste for sensationalizing issues, he has almost been banished by the mainstream media. He hasn\u2019t been called for an interview or op-ed by a mainstream media house for quite some time. Apparently, his left leaning views are \u2018too extreme\u2019 to be broadcast the whole nation. And seeing how critical he has been of mainstream media, it\u2019s really not a surprise. Chomsky is the hero world needs but doesn\u2019t deserve. ",
