            "answer_text": "The easy answer is that this is who they viewed themselves originally i.e. as essentially \u201cWest Jordanians\u201d. Palestine was the name given my the British Mandate to the whole territory granted by the League of Nations - with the intention that it all should be the Jewish Homeland. In 1921 it was split into two - with 70% of the land (across the Jordan river) becoming the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and 30% remaining as the British Mandate of Palestine - with the expectation that this remaining part would become the Jewish Homeland. The residents of this area were known as Palestinians irrespective of whether they were Jewish or Arab. (In fact, the Jews were known as Palestinians - while the non-Jewish Arab residents were known as Arabs and culturally and ethnically were (and are) the same as the population of Jordan). After the 1947 partition plan (aiming to separate this 30% into two States - a Jewish State and an Arab State) the British decided to withdraw and in May 1948, Israel was proclaimed on the area allocated to the Jewish State. Immediately the neighbouring Arab countries declared war - aiming to destroy Israel. The result was that Jews living in territories on what is now known as the West Bank, and Gaza were expelled and sought refuge in what became Israel while several 1000 Arabs living in the same area fled (for a range of reasons) and become refugees and were kept as such in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere. A separate UN body was created to cater for their interests - UNRWA. These refugees became the Palestinian Refugees - until today. The idea of a Palestinian nation - distinct from the Jordanian Arabs only surfaced around 1964 with the creation of the PLO (although before then, the refugees were viewed as Palestinian refugees - and initially this included the Jewish refugees who were quickly housed by Israel and so lost their refugee status).

            "answer_text": "Because the Hejaz was using what is called the \u201cArab Flag\u201d.  The Hejazi Flag The Arab Flag was popularized during World War 1 to serve as a symbol of the Arab peoples and their quests for independence from Foreign powers. The Hejaz used this flag as it gained independence after the war after fighting against the Ottomans alongside the Allied Powers. Flags that are modifications of the Arab Flag:  United Arab Emirates Flag  Polisario Flag  Sudanese Flag  Kuwaiti Flag and of course, the Palestinians:  However there is a second Arab Flag When Nasser took over Egypt, he decided not to use the previous Arab flag and invented a new one:  The Egyptian Flag, the new Arab flag is the same flag without the falcon. Red, White and Black This was used by several Arab States:  Iraqi Flag  Syrian Flag  Yemeni Flag The difference between the two is ideological. The original Arab flag, the one you claim is from the Hejaz, isn\u2019t tied to any political movement but the Arab peoples as a whole. While the new Arab flag, the one that Egypt created, is tied to Pan-Arabism and Arab Nationalism. Only States run by Baathists and Nasserists use it. ",
