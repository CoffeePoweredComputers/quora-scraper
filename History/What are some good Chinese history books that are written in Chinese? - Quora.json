            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A, Audrey. I agree with Tom Xu\u2019s answer here, \u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e94\u5343\u5e74 (Five Thousand Years of Chinese Nation) could be an excellent series for Chinese language learners. In fact, I owned a box of comic \u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e94\u5343\u5e74 with Pinyin on, as my bedtime stories. After I finished the almighty-but-smartass-monkey & good-for-nothing-but-being-loved-by-everybody pig story, aka \u897f\u6e38\u8bb0 (Journey to the West), I decided to read some real thing instead of fictions, with my limited Chinese character skills. My dad bought me comic version \u4e0a\u4e0b\u4e94\u5343\u5e74 and \u4e09\u56fd\u6f14\u4e49 (The Romance of the Three Kingdoms) as my birthday gift. Amusingly, those stories which were supposed to be \u2018history\u2019 or at least \u2018based on history\u2019 seemed more fictional than fictions. Later on, I got to know \u4e09\u56fd\u6f14\u4e49 is more likely a fictional novel, which is why it\u2019s called \u6f14\u4e49, or in English, romance. Still, even the history taught in my text book always used a tone that the authors know exactly what people 2000 years ago thought. Yeah, just like what Meng Feifei pointed out in her answer, \u2018subjective\u2019. Good or bad, Chinese historians seem love such a subjective way, and Chinese readers seem love it too. My another recommendation of Chinese history book is \u4e2d\u56fd\u901a\u53f2 (History of China) by \u5415\u601d\u52c9. It\u2019s much more academic and tougher to read. So being a lazy butt, I never really finished it. Yet I absolutely recommend it not because I am an evil person who like others suffering (or I am?), but because this book is not a chronicle like many history books are. The author wrote it in a comprehensive way, by topics- Cultural topics: Marriage. Clans. Property. Taxation\u2026 Political topics\u2026 like this.   (Images are from \u300a\u4e2d\u56fd\u901a\u53f2\u300b \u5415\u601d\u52c9 \u4e66\u8bc4 \u7b80\u4ecb \u7535\u5b50\u4e66\u4e0b\u8f7d Kindle\u7535\u5b50\u4e66) So it\u2019s easy to pick a topic you like anytime, from anywhere, without being forced to read chapter by chapter. And\u2026 it\u2019s written in a super subjective tone too, which portrays a history world viewed from a Chinese individual\u2019s eyes, reflecting lots of Chinese philosophies and values. I assume it could be very different hence interesting from Chinese learners\u2019 eyes who are from very different cultures and backgrounds. Oh, as a cheap skate, I must mention this: If you are a kindle user, this book is available in \u201ckindle unlimited\u201d service. So enjoy some history combined facts and opinions (which we could hardly tell which is which, like most things in this world), from a different angle, in a different language, for free. ",

            "answer_text": "Upon most occasions, I normally try not to read any voluminous history books, if it is possible. As China has more than 4000 years of history, it is almost impossible for our ordinary folks to go through all of the authorized history books in a short time. \u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u53f2 (Twenty-Four Histories)? Oh No, give me a break\u2026I'd end up wasting my whole life... Apart from that, I find most history books dull. I simply can't focus my attention to read stories that are lacking details, that's why I always in favor of literature, because they are FUNNY and full of details, for example I wouldn't be bothered to read \u4e09\u56fd\u5fd7 if I hadn\u2019t read \u4e09\u56fd\u6f14\u4e49. Of course I understand that there are a lot of artistic licenses in literature works, but history books are not entirely credible. OK vent over. I sense most mainland Chinese will recommend the following two books: Ch'ien_Mu\u2019s \u56fd\u53f2\u5927\u7eb2 A General History of ChinaLyu Simian\u2019s \u4e2d\u570b\u901a\u53f2 General History of China (I guess Taiwanese readers would recommend Fu Lecheng\u2019s version)I won't pretend to have finished the above two , I\u2019d go crazy if someone demands me to finish them\u2026 There were only two brief points that stuck in my head: Ch\u2019ien Mu's book followed a very traditional Chinese sinocentric writing style, after reading a few paragraphs, I have already taken pride of being Chinese. I have huge respect for him especially after I learnt the background of the creation. By contrast, Lyu Simian\u2019s General History of China is a quite balanced one, he often has unique perspectives on a lot of Chinese historical figures and never falls into the category of lousy cliches. Of course, I have to admit that I am in fact quite bias in favor of Hunanese historians, therefore I would also recommend the following two books: \u738b\u592b\u4e4b (Wang Fuzhi)\u300a\u8b80\u901a\u9451\u8ad6 , I particularly love Wang Fuzhi\u2019s language, \u950b\u8292\u6bd5\u9732, \u9ad8\u5c71\u5ce8\u5ce8, which I can only find in Mencius (book), forget to mention that I am a big fan of Mencius. \u9648\u5bc5\u606a (Chen Yique/Tschen Yin Koh\uff09 \u300a\u67f3\u5982\u662f\u522b\u4f20\u300b, it is a supplementary biography of Liu Rushi, a legend lady and a courtesan in the late Ming dynasty. (Yes \u5982\u662f was chosen from the famous poem \u6211\u89c1\u9752\u5c71\u591a\u59a9\u5a9a,\u6599\u9752\u5c71\u89c1\u6211\u5e94\u5982\u662f). This book took Chen eleven years to complete after he lost his sight and was being tortured by Red guards during the cultural revolution. Thanks for the A2A, Kevin. ",
