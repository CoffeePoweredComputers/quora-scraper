            "answer_text": " Unfortunately it was just the opposite. Carpetbaggers descended to prey upon the misfortune of Southerners. They took their slaves and put them it governmental positions over their masters. The blocked legitimate governmental bodies from meeting. If someone was trying to create a circumstance where the hostilities of the war would be extended over the next 100 years, they were successful. The origins of the KKK can be traced to Reconstruction. The origins of Jim Crow can be traced to Reconstruction. It is probably accurate to say that the feelings of the South against the North were stronger in Reconstruction than they were during the War. No doubt had Lincoln lived it would have been vastly different. What is ironic is the Northerners really did not believe in what they were forcing on the South because they willingly gave it up in 1876 to keep Tilden out of the White House and put Rutherford Hayes in. Thankfully the US learned from its mistakes and did not try a Reconstruction after WWII. ",
