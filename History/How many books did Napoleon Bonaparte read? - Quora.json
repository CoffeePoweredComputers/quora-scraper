            "answer_text": "A lot. He was a voracious reader, to the extent that he actually travelled with his (portable) library! He literally always travelled with books and took great interest into getting the best portable library possible. He read a lot. He read all the philosophical classics, such as The Prince by Machiavelli, Montaigne\u2019s Essays, Plato\u2019s Republic, Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s oeuvre, and many, many others. He also read a lot about ancient history, especially Livy and Plutarch. His favourite work was The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans by Plutarch, which shouldn\u2019t be too surprising, if you know about his love for the old Greeks and Romans. All of the above doesn\u2019t even take into account his actual studies at the military school at Brienne, where he studied the new tactics that he would later apply so successfully. Not only the amount that he read, but also the breadth of his reading habits is striking. Not surprisingly, he read about military tactics, philosophy and history \u2014 as mentioned above, but also travel stories (Cook), poetry \u2014 with Homer being his favourite, religious texts (the Bible, the Quran,\u2026),\u2026 ",
