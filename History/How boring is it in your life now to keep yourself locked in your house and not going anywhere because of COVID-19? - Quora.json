Reuters Health News 4/17/20. Drs. Mahyar Etminan and Mohit Sodhi of the U of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. \"Tetracyclines have shown to have antiviral activity in other viruses (independent of their antibacterial activity).\" They also have \"powerful\" anti-inflammatory effects \"and, of course, inflammation is an important pathological attribute of COVID-19,\" he explained. The anti-inflammatory capabilities of tetracyclines include down regulation of the NFKB pathway as well as a decrease in levels of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1-beta, and interleukin-6. These cytokines have been shown to be significantly elevated when SARS-CoV-2 is exposed to lung tissue in addition to exacerbating the pathogenesis of the infection itself, they point out. Tetracyclines also have \"good absorption in the lungs, where COVID-19 attacks, and are relatively safe, safer than hydroxychloroquine.\" \"For all of these reasons, we think there should also be a focus on examining this drug in clinical trials as both a prophylactic agent or treatment in early and late disease,\" he said. Tetracyclines might be potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19 that are \"hiding in plain sight,\" write Dr. Etminan and Dr. Sodhi. \"We strongly urge international research groups to consider investigating the potential therapeutic efficacy of tetracycline antibiotics in treating COVID-19.\" ",

Like our next door neighbor that finally moved to Arizona 2 months ago. We need to secure our borders. Mainly it is because the CITIZENS of the US enacted a law that those that come in without permission are here illegally. Now we are under attack by a little microscopic bug instead of killers that are here illegally. I do nog lock myself in. I lock others out. 2 days ago I took a recumbent 10 mile ride on my trike with my service dog. Last night my wife and I had s'mors and hot dogs on our firepit in our backyard.
