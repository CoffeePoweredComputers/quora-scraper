            "answer_text": "Because, the idea of a unite India was missing. Mughal dynasty was taking his last breathe. A central empire to unified the whole Indian sub-continent was missing. In these situation, Britishers came to India which was one of the richest country in the contemporaneous world, a country which had 23 percent of world GDP. Britishers came first to trade and not to conquer, but over the time they played very clever strategic games and started to influence the state policies. The main situations which played vital role to strengthen the British traders were: 1. Lack of nationalism and identity consciousness: The identity of \u201cIndian\u201d is a modern theory. In 17th century, people liked to identified themselves by their religion, caste, tribe or ethnic groups. Clearly, this situation was favorable to a foreign invader to break and rule. It can be seen in structure of British army (in India) where regiments were formed on the basis of religion and caste. When a revolt happens in any region then other group of Indians were always ready to confront that. 2. Decline of the Mughal empire: Till 17th century, Indian continent was unified by the powerful Mughal dynasty. But after death of Aurangzeb in 1707, power of Mughal empire was started to fall rapidly mainly due to Aurangzeb\u2019s anti-secularism and intolerant policies which was further invoked by his successors. The last truly effective emperor was Aurangzeb. After him, the real power came into the hand of local rulers. If British would face an strong empire in this region then surely picture would be different.  3. Lack of Visionary view in Indian rulers: When Britishers entered in India to trade, before that time they were already started to make colonies. In 1578, Britishers established their first colony in North America. But, contemporaneous Indian rulers were not aware to world political situations and treated to Britishers very lightly till the conflict not came into their door. They were miscalculated the British power and gave them many privileges in name of trade and treaty.  4. Lack of strong colonial competitors: In India, Britain was not the first country which came to trade. The Danes, Dutch, Portuguese and the French all had a presence in this sub-continent. But, Britishers made best strategic policies to empower themselves and to defeat all of its rivals. After the battle of Wandiwash, Britishers became the sole and dominant power in India. Clearly, the circumstances were very favorable to Britishers. In absence of these fortuitous situations Britain could never have been able to conquer India. It could never have been possible to rule a country which was 6700 kms away and bigger in terms of land as well as in population. ",

            "answer_text": "Mainly for supporting the Industrial revolution in Britain. Initially, the textile industry was a major part of the Industrial Revolution and they needed raw materials for it. British India was the best and the biggest place to grow anything from Opium to Cotton. British India had the largest available farmland in the world at that time and even today the much smaller India has the second-largest farmland even though we have 30% of land covered with forest, 4.7% desert, and some mountains. So Britisher basically told the farmers to grow Cotton and Indica for supporting the British textile industry and sold the finished products to the rest of the world and India itself also. Textile production in India was discouraged which was the major employer in the cow belt (UP, Bihar, and WB which later became the most Industrialized state of India and then declined to below-average 3 decades). Opium was supported as it was then sold into China to keep the deficit of the British empire with China low. Wheat and rice were also supported as Britain was getting urbanized and needed these to feed its population although only a small percentage of these crops were shipped to the UK until WWII. India's location is also very important in global trade. Contrary to the popular belief among a lot of Indians British didn\u2019t come to India to loot gold, silver, and other mineral resources, it was just a little icing on the cake. If they were here for gold they would have found out Padmanabhaswamy Temple and looted it. The main sources of Gold and silver at that time were North America, South America, South Africa, and Australia. Diamonds were found in much larger quantities in South Africa, Australia, and other African countries. Britishers did take lots of antiques but it was not their main purpose here. They ruled India as a whole only for 100 years, not 150-200. The most resource-rich continent is Africa and it is still exploited by many countries directly (France) or Indirectly. Americas and Russia are also very resource-rich. India is not a resource-rich country except for agriculture, coal and thorium and Britishers took advantage of agriculture. Indigo revolt ",
