            "answer_text": "The Phalanx was an inflexible, defensive formation. The Phalanx never really went away (formations such as the schiltrom and shield wall are similar) but it's usage waned for various reasons. If you want to talk about a Phalanx vs a medieval army, the chances of the phalangites are slim. While any competent commander would quickly realize that a head on cavalry charge would be suicide against the phalanx, a push of heavy foot (dismounted knights or similar) could quite easily work it's way into the phalanx. Once the formation is broken, it's very vulnerable. A quick cavalry charge from the flanks and the battle is all but won.  This was the general tactic employed by the Romans against the formation. Their good armor and large shields protected them from the spear thrusts, and allowed them to work inside the phalanx, at what point it was easily beaten. The Romans also fought in much looser formations, meaning they could not as easily be totally broken, and the composition of their armies made them far more flexible.  The Phalanx was also vulnerable to harassing attacks, which the Romans employed successfully against them. The tight packing of the unit and it's lack of mobility meant that skirmishers were far more effective than usual against it. The Phalanx also required a far more disciplined soldier to be effective. Now, if we're talking a Greek era Phalanx vs a Medieval army, the battle becomes even more one sided, as the medieval army has steel weapons and armor against the bronze of the Greeks.  Now, if you want to talk Chinese, you need to specify which era. Chinese armies varied greatly in terms of equipment, strategies and composition during the long history of China. For example, there was a period where Chinese warfare was heavily centered around chariots, which would find little success against a phalanx, and yet other times where they had more horse archers, who would eat a phalanx alive with their mobility.

            "answer_text": " Warning written from memory.May contain factual errors,If so please correct me As you said the Greek armies were very static.I would explain you some strength and weaknesses. The length of sarrisa(long spear) used at that time varied.The Macedonian one was around 16 ft long which was mastered by Philip II.The soldierswere given small shield to defend themselves. A batallion was a 8x8 square. Strength:Obviously the phalynx was based on its unity.If a member in the front ranks was fallen he would be replaced by next person.For a person standing in front of the phalynx he would observe not just a row of sarrisas but many many.Their combines strength makes phalynx a perfect tactic for frontal attacks.  The men used to thrust in a rythm and this would provide a deadly advantage.More over complex manouevers could be performed by trained soldiers which were unbelievable(intimidating tactics) such as rotating the phalynx at the 45 degrees immediately etc. Awesome for stopping chariots and horses.Horses would not go into spiked wall of spears.A technique perfected by Alexander's army which helped him to mitigate Darius III 's deadly chariots. Super awesome  for defending bottlenecks especially when flanks are secured.Remember the battle at Battle of Thermopylae (Leonidus vs Xerxes) in movie 300(of course they weren't exactly 300 but more than a 1000). WeaknessVery slow to manouevre.The biggest disadvantage is that phalynx lacks that swiftness required by the army. Secondly an arrow fire could be devastating against phalynx. Crumbles if attacked from side or back.It is literally impossible to turn  16ft sarissa to the side. These all weakness were the pitfalls of the phalynx.The romans who were more swift never attacked phalynx from the front but always from the side.They also throwed pila to kill as many as possible. Considering the medival armies the phalynx would fare even worse.First they were no more chariots.The use of swift and light archers would be devastating for slow moving phalynx and if the phalynx were flanked then it would be decimated.The use of archers was prevalent in those ages.
