            "answer_text": "Thank you for the A2A: As many have noted, the early Christian church was in no position to persecute gnostics. And, as well, there were many \u201cearly Christian churches\u201d, of which the gnostics were one. So I guess we\u2019re talking about the ultimately predominate one, Catholicism. I am somewhat confused by some of the answers. I am more familiar with this lineage of thought extending all the way to the present, as opposed to being something \u201cold\u201d. In that way, gnostics have indeed been persecuted, mostly after Islam was no longer considered a \u201cthreat\u201d. Bu that means post-Crusades, which is definitely not the early church. The differences that they were/are persecuted for was for having a different idea about creation and a different idea, really, about what life and reality are \u201cfor\u201d in the present. We are kinda conditioned to think that Egyptian legend, Hinduism, Buddhism, the Kabala, are completely different, unconnected, even - and this is important - \u201cevil\u201d faiths with no relevance to modern Christianity. Gnostics were different in that then, and now, they acknowledged similarities and found them useful. What emerged from the early Catholic Church was the idea of requiring an intermediary - the Pope, a priest - and while gnostics recognized those with knowledge (holy, in a sense) they did not believe in needing an earthly person AS an intermediary. As well, and I don\u2019t want to encourage half-baked persons here, they considered math, science, etc as holy unto themselves - Pythagoras for one being one bad-ass dude to them. Discovering pi was part of discovering the universe. In the end, the whole of everything is very different. For me, much of it makes a lot more sense as it (also) includes pagan elements and is of the opinion that all the \u201cevents\u201d in the Old Testament are metaphorical and/or not at all what we\u2019re \u201ctold\u201d. But we\u2019re getting into my personal opinions. The persecution really came from it being a more mystical version of Christianity where the Bible in the main meant very different things and they were anti-Papist. The justifications by Catholicism are the usual, they\u2019re brutes and eat babies. Those things, stated in some of these answers, are simply not true. If you can handle the symbolism, if you can handle the interpretation that Jesus\u2019 main point was to open up the heart chakra of mankind, you can deal with these people. If you can handle openmindedness towards complete mysticism, you can at least understand what they were getting at. They just weren\u2019t hierarchical and literalistic, and anyway, defying the Pope made you a heretic anyway by the time they were \u201cpersecuted\u201d. ",

            "answer_text": "Back in 2001, Greece bore witness to a shocking act of vandalism. Without any semblance of legality, the local church authorities in Salonica rounded up their goons and bulldozers and set upon an early mediaeval cemetery of the Bogomils, a Gnostic sect. Entering \u201clike a thief in the night\u201d, they blotted out a remnant of an enemy some 1,000 years gone. Persecution hardly ever rests quietly in its grave. Many have heard of the relatively recent atrocities in Bosnia; few are aware that these same Bosniaks were the last nation professing Bogomilism, converting to Islam en masse sometime in the 17th century to escape the persecutions of their fellow Christians. Medieval Christian heterodoxy, much of it \u201cGnostic\u201d, spreading out of the Christian heartland in the Near East; the Armenian \u201cPaulicians\u201d [from bishop Paul of Samosata], Bulgarian \u201cBogomils\u201d [Slav. Bog+mil, \u201cGod-lovers\u201d], and the famous Cathars [Gr. Kathari, \u201cPure ones\u201d] in the Languedoc, targets of the eponymous Crusade of 1209\u201329.  These heresies were everywhere a threat to the established churches and feudal institutions, professing ideas such as the priesthood of all believers, emancipation of serfs and women, egalitarianism and immediate divine revelation. It is entirely mistaken to imagine the middle ages as some socially conservative era resigned to a rigid, theocratic order: every idea which might seem restrictive to us was doubtless experienced as such by those under it, and social unrest was commonplace. Where these ideas were enforced - most of Europe, most of the time - it was not because of some inescapable historical gravity, but because the people who might benefit from them had removed all competitors, by force if necessary. Ideas denying the entire apparatus of the orthodox conception of sin, some explicitly Gnostic (the word itself is not too helpful, being a polemical term), some not, had real if in historiography highly censored existence in medieval times. Early gnosticism, much like its medieval successors, represented an alternate form of distribution of authority - in particular one which did not rely on bishops to act as the equivalent of Roman provincial governors, and which had common congregants engage in ecstatic prayer and \u201cprophecy\u201d on behalf of the divine. It is not difficult to understand why such people would draw the ire of the authorities, once the already domineering episcopal polity was attached to the Roman state in full. The orthodox monastic tradition was as often as not a result of those leaning to gnostic practices being hunted into the wilderness, where they might commune with the divine in peace: places like the \u201cHoly Mount\u201d of Athos (an autonomous monastic state in Greece), although a pillar of arthrosclerotic church tradition today, were in late antiquity formed by people taking to the mountains to escape that same authority.
