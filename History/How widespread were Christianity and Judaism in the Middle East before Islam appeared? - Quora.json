            "answer_text": "Read my answer to the following question. How did Muhammad know so many things about Judaism and Christianity and put those with some twists in his book Qur\u2019an? Is it even possible to write a book twisting every other book and claiming it divine? Was it him or God actually revealed it. Christianity was established in Arabia some five hundred years before Muhammad was born. During Muhammad\u2019s time the two main Churches were the Monophysite (Jacobite) and Nestorian Churches. Churches were built and Christian monks could be seen walking around and chanting prayers. Some would fast for long periods and enter caves and pray loudly with much tears and lamentations. On Caravan routes, seeing Christians stopping and praying by prostrating on the ground at set times everyday was a familiar sight. Many of Muhammad\u2019s relatives from the Quarash tribe were Christians. Muhammad had at least two Christian wives. His adopted son Zaid, a former slave, was a Christian who was well versed in Christian and Jewish scriptures. Muhammad was also mentored by Khadija\u2019s cousin Waraca an old and blind Catholic scholar. Jews settled in Arabia long before Muhammad was born. Large numbers of Jews fled to Arabia to escape the ruthless roman repression. Jews were skilled agriculturists and they became the food providers in Arabia. half the population of Medina were Jews. They controlled the economy of Medina. ",

            "answer_text": "Judaism was scarce; the Roman ban in Palestine/Judaea was still in effect but there were fairly significant populations outside the Roman Empire \u2014 Arabia, Axum an the Sassanid Iranian Empire all had fairly large populations. But the principal religions were Zaroastrianism and Monothelistist Christianity (in which you can certainly see an influence on Islam), with Dyothelete Christianity (the type we are familiar with today) in the retreat and Arab polytheism mostly limited in scope.
