            "answer_text": "There just seems to be something very wholesome about it. I tend to watch a couple to episodes a week and I must admit it the acting is often sub par, the storyline can be somewhat cheesey and the production values questionable. However, for whatever reason it is an extremely enjoyable watch and has stood the test of time with re-runs still being popular. I would say part of the appeal is Angela Lansburys likability as Jessica Fletcher. ",

            "answer_text": "I would guess that the audience found Angela Lansbury a very appealing character. The stories were reasonably clever, not too \u201cgraphic\u201d (what the English call \u201ccozy\u201d murders), and not very realistic. The stories were light, fluffy, and easy to watch. That kind of show has a pretty broad appeal\u2026 We have very similar shows today. ",
