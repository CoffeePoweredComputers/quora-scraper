            "answer_text": "Azerbaijan began a massive and well coordinated attack on September 27, backed by Turkish intelligence, Turkish air support including F16\u2019s and now as the world is aware also using paid jihadists of Turkey This major offensive, which according to some estimates has seen the death over 5000 Azerbaijani soldiers & other militants has not produced an serious gains of territory for Azerbaijan. A number of villages in the low areas of the valleys have been taken, and even a few Armenians executed, one being a 70 year old man, dressed badly in Armenian army fatigues. And in Armenia we are holding a number of Azerbaijani POW\u2019s in very human conditions, including a few being cared for in the hospital This war I blame on Turkey & their Islamist president for starting, and they again have badly miscalculated again, as to take the high & extremely well defended positions of Armenians is possible only if they sacrifice 50,000 soldiers. Azerbaijan is not loosing & neither is Armenia, but the losses of Azerbaijan is astronomical thus far. ",
