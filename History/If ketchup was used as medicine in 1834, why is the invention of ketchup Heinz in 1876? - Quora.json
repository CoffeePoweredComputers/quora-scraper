            "answer_text": "Sugar has been used as medicine by some people in some times in the past (not just Mary Poppins, either). That does not mean sugar IS or WAS a medicine. Ketchup in the 19th century and before, reaching into the prehistory of food, has been a word applied to any number of savory sauces, both savory and smooth. Grape, walnut, peach, and countless other principal ingredients have been used to make ketchup, ketjiap, catsup, catch-up and so many more words in many languages have signified those classes of sauces. To this day, only the US and Canada say ketchup to mean exclusively tomato ketchup like Heinz. Brits generally say tomato ketchup to mean the Heinz or Heinz like sauce. So you have managed to ask the less common if/then Quora question where both the hypothesis and the conclusion are false. The dates are immaterial. ",

            "answer_text": "How could Heinz invent something that has already been in existence? The Virginia Housewife: Or, Methodical Cook: A Facsimile of an Authentic Early American Cookbook[1] by Mary Randolph, published in 1824, had a recipe for tomato ketchup. Ketchups with other main ingredients were introduced to European no later than the 17th century and first made (invented if you may) somewhere on the shore of the South China Sea before that. (Today banana ketchup is still being made in the Philippines. Gentleman\u2019s Relish is pretty much anchovy ketchup by another name.) Believe or not (as invented by Robert Ripley), ketchup was once touted as medicine.  Footnotes[1] The Virginia Housewife; Or, Methodical Cook by Mary Randolph",
