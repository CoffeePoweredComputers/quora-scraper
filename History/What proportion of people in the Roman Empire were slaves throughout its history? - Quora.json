            "answer_text": "I'm not really into the Demographics and statistics , but I found this - <<Estimates for the prevalence of slavery in the Roman Empire vary. Estimates of the percentage of the population of Italy who were slaves range from 30 to 40 percent in the 1st century BC, upwards of two to three million slaves in Italy by the end of the 1st century BCE, about 35% to 40% of Italy's population. [36] [37] [38]  For the Empire as a whole, the slave population has been estimated at just under five million, representing 8-10% of the total population of 50-60 million+ inhabitants. An estimated 49% of all slaves were owned by the elite, who made up less than 1.5% of the Empire's population. About half of all slaves worked in the countryside where they were a small percentage of the population except on some large agricultural, espically imperial, estates; the remainder the other half were a significant percentage 25% or more in towns and cities as domestics and workers in commercial enterprises and manufactories. [39] Roman slavery was not based on race. [40] [41]  Slaves were drawn from all over Europe and the Mediterranean, including Gaul, Hispania, Germany, Britannia, the Balkans, Greece ... Generally slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians, [42]  with a minority of foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) born outside of Italy estimated at 5% of the total in the capital, where their number was largest, at its peak. Those from outside of Europe were predominantly of Greek descent, while the Jewish ones never fully assimilated into Roman society, remaining an identifiable minority. The slaves (especially the foreigners) had higher mortality rates and lower birth rates than natives, and were sometimes even subjected to mass expulsions. [43]  The average recorded age at death for the slaves of the city of Rome was extraordinarily low: seventeen and a half years (17.2 for males; 17.9 for females). [44] >> From the Wiki article on Slavery in the Roman Empire . The fact that about 30-40 % of the population were slaves at the time of Christ had a big impact on Roman Society.  Spartacus had led a slaves revolt before and things were tense.  If a slave killed a member of the household, all the rest of the slaves would be executed as a punishment.  An escaped slave could be crucified they were recaptured and  the master wished.crucifixion was the worst and most painful death possible - a warning to anyone else not to try their luck.  ",

            "answer_text": "Very high.  Disturbingly enough, the majority of Roman slaves (slaves of Romans) were female. Even the poorest Roman citizen (and many freedmen) had a slave and that slave was usually female. Roman citizens often had second families with their slave mistresses... which could be an important source of clients to certain Roman artistocrats. ---It also swelled the ranks of the \"head count,\" which were the people who had nothing to offer Rome except children. ---I know very little about late Imperial or Byzantine Rome so I can't answer your question more fully. ---Its also important to note that slavery in the Empire was not based on race, so a large number of these slaves would be Greeks, Gauls, Arabs, etc ",

Indebted citizens could become slaves if they failed to honour their debts. Also, slaves were not only destined to hard labour tasks.There were greeks slaves acting as teachers for the rich families' children, for example. ",
