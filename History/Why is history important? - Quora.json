            "answer_text": "When i was in high school me along with other student use to say what is the importance of history why we need to know about the thing that have already happen that time i was not able to find the answer what was really importance of history but now i can answer to the question why is history important?  History is important because WE ARE the past: we are the sum of all the events--good, bad, and indifferent--that have happened to us. This sum product guides our actions in the present. This is true not only for the individual (imagine what would have happened to you had your parents never met, or had your parents raised you with different values), but for large societies as well (how would the U.S. be different, for example, if it had lost the American Revolution, or if the Spanish had founded the colonies of North America that became the United States?). In both cases the United States as we know it would not exist. The only way we can understand who we are and how we got to be that way is by studying the past. Similarly, the only way we can understand others is by studying their past. If we don't understand what made them who they are--in terms of how they think and act--we will make all sorts of mistakes in our interactions with them. Think of how you treat people differently based on how you know them. The same is true for countries when it comes to diplomacy. so in come to a conclusion that history helps us to UNDERSTAND SOCIETY,UNDERSTAND CHANGE,PROVIDES SENSE OF IDENTITY,PRESERVES STORIES,INSPIRE US,TEACH US WARNING SIGNS NOT TO REPEAT SAME MISTAKE and the last HELP US  TO BE BETTER PEOPLE. \"We study the past to understand the present; we understand the present to guide the future.\" -- William Lund ",

            "answer_text": "One of the more novel facts I try to teach my clients is that history will get you a job.   See, you're somewhere between 21 and 25. The Hiring Partner is between 55 and 70.  You go out to lunch with the Hiring partner.  Does she want to discuss Beyonce?  Maybe.  Does she want to compare her to Diana Ross, the role Beyonce played in \"Dream Girls\"? Maybe. But you don't know who Diana Ross is, except maybe for some jokes you associate with Michael Jackson.  You didn't know Beyonce was portraying a more-or-less real historical figure, at the top of the pop charts from maybe 1963 to 1968.  You don't know about the many other groups, before and after, in which the lead singer tried to go solo and failed.  You don't know that Diana Ross reprised the role of Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz. (You probably don't know the word \"reprise;\") you may not know Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, who was Judy Garland, and by now you're totally lost, the hiring partner has declared you a fool for bringing up a topic like Beyonce about which you actually know nothing, and you've talked (or silenced) yourself out of a job. You think I'm kidding?  I made my\" Intro to Law School\" class, an eight-day intensive, watch a socially important film every day over lunch.  One of my favorites is \"Cabaret,\" the 1972 or 73 version with Liza Minnelli.  One of the guys who watched it wound up having dinner with an important judge in California (9th Circuit Court of Appeals, for those of you who know your judges.) the judge mentioned Cabaret; they spent the hour talking about Nazism and the willful blindness of the Germans, comparing it to treatment of Hispanics in California.   When Dennis graduated law school two years later, he had a job waiting for him, clerking for a judge in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Another client, an immigrant (legally), didn't care about the American Civil War; he barely knew about the Vietnamese one that brought him to the U.S.  He got a great job working as a patent lawyer with a biotech firm, but after about 6 months a new managing partner was brought in, and Civil War history was her real passion outside of work.  My client had nothing to contribute to the conversation, so he stopped getting invited to the lunches.  But the lunches were where the cases were assigned; eventually he had no cases, and no job.
