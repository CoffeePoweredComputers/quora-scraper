            "answer_text": "I should certainly think not! Most schools didn\u2019t move to online classes until nearly the end of third quarter, meaning the students got 3 quarters of in-class learning. Those three semesters certainly weren\u2019t wasted. In addition, schools are simply not closing down, they are transitioning to online classes. Now, given how abruptly the switch happened, it\u2019s not feasible for the classes to be at the same rigor, but students will still be learning for home. Now, where it gets a little bit difficult is when you look at the academics of older students, for example high school seniors and college students. Seniors in high school this year are unsure at this point how their schools will deal with the online classes. They aren\u2019t sure if /when they will graduate and what kind of credits they will receive. The same goes for college students. There is much that cannot be learned from home in college, especially for majors with lots of lab classes. Finally, the other difficult part of this is dealing with AP (advanced placement) and honors classes. These classes are highly rigorous and students depend heavily on in-class learning and having the ability to ask questions of their teachers. AP exams typically happen at the end of May, so the timing of this school cancellation has left many AP students scrambling to continue their reviews in preparation for the exams. ",

            "answer_text": "Well, define \u201cwaste\u201d. I assume that states will find a way for students to receive credit for the courses they were taking. Some may even reopen for a month or more. For high school students there is more risk. English, social studies, and electives have less risk, since the next year\u2019s classes are less dependent on what went before. Math, science, and any honors or AP classes will be tougher because they presume a deeper knowledge of the subject on entry; and there is not much time in the year for review. SATs and AP tests will be very difficult for students taking them in the spring of 2020. It may mean summer school, or fewer electives in the 2020\u201321 school year. I would hope that colleges would adapt admission decisions to the situation, possibly with a \u201cpre-college\u201d summer session. Elementary students are on a somewhat less rigid ladder. In the fall of 2020 teachers will have to assess the students coming into their grade, and back fill the missing critical skills and knowledge before moving ahead. They will have to stick to a core curriculum to get a year plus the missed info into a normal school year. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say no. The whole world is facing the lockdown due to coronavirus. The number of children, youth and adults not attending schools or universities because of COVID-19 is soaring. Most of the schools have suspended site-based learning till May. Still some schools like Novato Unified School District providing online classes to the students. During this unprecedented time of COVID-19 and Remote Learning, they have compiled resources for staff, students and the community. In an effort to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, most governments around the world have temporarily closed educational institutions. These nationwide closures are impacting over 89% of the world's population. Many other countries have implemented localized implementations affecting millions of additional learners. UNESCO is supporting countries in their efforts to reduce the immediate impact of school closures, especially for more vulnerable and disadvantaged communities, and to facilitate the continuation of education for all through distance education. I hope this helps! Thanks! ",

            "answer_text": "Is this really what you think? What happened to the work that the children did between Sept - March? There are 10 month of school and students have attended 7 months. are you saying that 7 months of work is worth nothing that it should be wiped out? Ask a student if that would be fair? Education is not a baby sitting service. There is valuable progress and work that students do and progress as long as they are willing to learn, have a good outlook toward education which is something they get from their parents, come from a stable environment and have parent supervised at home to get homework done. As well there is an environment and trips that enhance the education of a child like museum, Art gallery and aquarium programs. Think you question needs more deeper though or needs to be reworded. ",

Even for the schools that are closed and won't reopen, the students have lost roughly 10 weeks, or a bit more than half a semester. We should not overdramatize the effects of this; it will be serious, but it will hardly wipe away more than 20 weeks that were spent in school this year. ",
