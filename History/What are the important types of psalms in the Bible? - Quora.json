            "answer_text": "While every psalm has unique characteristics, the psalms fall into seven general categories. The three most common types of psalms are the hymn, the lament, and the thanksgiving.  The hymn, using the language of Walter Brueggemann, is a song of orientation. It is a song of pure praise. A hymn is a psalm we sing when our relationship with God is untroubled (e.g., 29, 47, 96, 98, 146-150). On the other hand, a lament is a prayer we offer to God when we are hurting. We feel upset with ourselves, betrayed by others, or even abandoned by God; in a word, we are disoriented in our relationship with Him (e.g., 3, 13, 22, 77). Interestingly, these psalms always turn to God with praise or trust at the end (with the exception of Psalm 88). In this way, the lament begins with our negative state of mind and directs it toward its only hope. These psalms we will label songs of disorientation. The thanksgiving is the third major category of prayer in the book. It is a song of reorientation. It is similar to the hymn in celebrating God, but a thanksgiving celebrates God for hearing an earlier lament and answering the prayer (e.g., 18 and 30). These songs of orientation, disorientation, and reorientation are by far the most common, but we can also recognize four less frequently attested types.  First, there is the psalm of confidence, where the psalmist expresses his trust in God with a striking central metaphor. Psalm 23, the Lord as shepherd, is the prime example. The king plays a huge role in the psalms, both God as the divine King (47, 93, 96, 100) and the human king (2, 20, 21). Those psalms where the king is the major focus we call kingship psalms. History, too, is often alluded to in the Psalter\u2014not specific events in the present, but God's great acts of salvation in the past. We may call psalms where the history of God's redemption is the major focus psalms of remembrance, because they are causing us to remember God's grace in space and time actions (78, 105, 106). Finally, some psalms are like the wisdom books of the Old Testament, books like Proverbs (1 and 119), Ecclesiastes (49), or Song of Songs (45). These we call wisdom psalms.  Tremper Longman, \u201cThe Types Of Psalms,\u201d \u2013 Discipleship Journal 17, no. 3 (May-June) Hermann Gunkel, in Die Psalmen ubersetzt und erklart, first applied form criticism to the study of the Psalms. Gunkel analyzed the content of the Psalms and attempted to categorize them according to the literary forms he discerned. Thus, the focus of interpretation shifted from attempting to uncover the historical situation out of which the Psalm was written to attempting to determine the Psalm\u2019s use in private devotions or public worship. Gunkel identified five basic types of Psalms: hymns (e.g., Pss. 8; 19; 29; 33; 104; 105; 111; 113; 114; 117; 135; 136; 145-150), communal laments (e.g., Pss. 12; 44; 60; 74; 79; 80; 83; 85; 90; 126), royal Psalms (e.g., Pss. 2; 72; 110), individual laments (e.g., Pss. 3; 5; 7; 17; 25-27; 38; 39; 56; 62; 69; 88) and individual Psalms of thanksgiving (e.g., Pss. 30; 32; 34; 66; 116; 138). These categories focus on the Psalm as the prayer of an individual or the community and as a praise or a lament. Royal Psalms were used by the royal court.  The Complete Biblical Library \u2013 Psalms Anderson\u2019s greatest contribution, [in Word Biblical Commentary Series, Vol. 19], however, is in distinguishing the various types of psalms - individual and community laments; hymns; songs of trust, of Zion, of pilgrimage; wisdom, torah, and royal psalms. He also helps us to understand the psalms in their original historical context and he shows how Israel used non-Israelite religious material, demythologizing it in order to praise Yahweh  \u201cBook Reviews,\u201d \u2013 Ashland Theological Journal 19",

            "answer_text": "The 150 psalms in the book of Psalms have often been categorized into various types. There is no one way to organize the psalms, but most systems include similar categories with only slight variations. Biblical scholar Hermann Gunkel\u2019s system covers the following categories: Hymns: Many of the psalms are simple hymns or songs of praise. For example, Psalm 8 is a hymn that begins, \u201cLord, our Lord, / how majestic is your name in all the earth!\u201d (verse 1). Lament or Complaint Psalms: These include songs that express sadness to God or complaints against God\u2019s enemies. For example, Psalm 3 is a lament psalm that begins, \u201cLord, how many are my foes! / How many rise up against me!\u201d (verse 1). Some complaint psalms sound quite negative, though they are set within a context of God responding in love or power. Psalm 44:23\u201324, for example, says, \u201cAwake, Lord! Why do you sleep? / Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever. / Why do you hide your face / and forget our misery and oppression?\u201d Royal Psalms: Several psalms were performed in the presence of kings or dignitaries. Psalm 18:50 states, \u201cHe gives his king great victories; / he shows unfailing love to his anointed, / to David and to his descendants forever.\u201d Thanksgiving Psalms: These songs of thanks include both thanksgiving from individuals (such as Psalms 30, 32, and 34) and from the community (such as Psalms 67 and 124). One of the best-known thanksgiving psalms is Psalm 100. Verses 4\u20135 proclaim, \u201cEnter his gates with thanksgiving / and his courts with praise; / give thanks to him and praise his name. / For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; / his faithfulness continues through all generations.\u201d Wisdom Psalms: While many psalms discuss aspects of wisdom, certain psalms such as Psalms 1, 37, and 49 focus on the theme of wisdom, speaking of the fear of the Lord or offering words of wisdom. Psalm 1:1\u20133 is a great example: \u201cBlessed is the one / who does not walk in step with the wicked / or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, / but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, / and who meditates on his law day and night. / That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, / which yields its fruit in season / and whose leaf does not wither\u2014 / whatever they do prospers.\u201d Smaller Genres and Mixed Types: Some psalms include a mix of types. Psalms 9, 10, and 123 are examples. Other psalms have only a small number in their category, such as psalms regarding the stories of Israel (Psalms 78, 105, and 106). The Songs of Ascent, written to be sung by worshipers on their way up to Jerusalem, also represent a smaller genre that includes mixed types (Psalms 120\u2014134). ",
