            "answer_text": "You get a glimpse of art from that time reflected in the main design. A sense of what that nation values by the legends and words it places upon the coin. The facts learned from history of what happened that year in the life of the nation. You hold in your hand something that directly connects to a specific point of time. You get a sense of the comparative wealth of a nation by the metal used for coinage. Finally, the imagination of who might have handled and used this coin in commerce.

            "answer_text": "They tell you not just about history but culture and the general mindset\u2026 for example I was shock when i first saw Cuban coins all with the legend \u201cPatria o muerte\u201d (Translated as \u201cCountry or Death\u201d)\u2026 it is a very heavy statement that reflects the oppression that many Cubans lived\u2026. Another example comes from my main collection (I\u2019m specialized in Tibetan coins due to the symbolism in their coins), you can find the Sun and Moon symbols compassion and wisdom as the basis to become a Buddha\u2026 or the 8 auspicious symbols (each one with profound significance), or many other symbols that reflects the richness of the dharma (Buddhist teachings) and the impact that they had in Tibetan society before being crushed by the Chinese (i can add \u201csavages\u201d but the truth be told as any other county they have good people and bad people, yet what the communist did and are still doing is very sad)\u2026. Coin with lottus and 8 auspicious symbols  Coin with the Three Jewels (buddha, dharma and sangha)   Coin with Snow lion and compassion knott  ",
