More recently, Boston is known as the birthplace and home of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, much beloved Senator and president from 1961\u20131963; and James Michael Curley, beloved champion of Irish immigrants and multi-term mayor of Boston who broke the Yankee stranglehold on the city. For union activists, Boston is known as the site of the Boston Policeman\u2019s strike \u2014 and it\u2019s brutal repression by then governor and later president Calvin Coolidge. For sports fans it is known as the city of champions \u2014 the long suffering but 21st century successful Boston Red Sox, the greatest football dynasty of all time, the New England Patriots, and the greatest NBA dynasty of all time, the Boston Celtics. Three great boxers are also from the Greater Boston area: Marvelous Marvin Hagler of Easton and Brockton, the only undefeated heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano, of Brockton, and the first heavyweight champion of the modern gloved era, John Sullivan. The mammoth trans-USA interstate highway, Route 90, commences here (or ends here depending on your perspective). ",
