            "answer_text": "Well, The Iroquois launched wars of annihilation against all neighboring people. They destroyed the Wappinger Confederacy, the Susquehannocks, and the Munsee, along with having committed a genocide against the smaller tribes of the Ohio River Valley, when they invaded in the early 1700s in the name of Beaver Pelt. Likewise, the Sioux were pushed out of their ancestral homes in the Great Lakes region by the Menominee and Winnebago. The Sioux fled west to the High Plains, and then armed with guns, began genocidal wars against the Pawnee, Arikara, Mandan and Crow nations. Indeed, the Sioux claim the Black Hills as their ancestral lands, when, in fact, they had driven the Crow Nation from these lands, and had only been in and about the Black Hills for 50 years when they, and their murderous armies were finally destroyed by American forces. In the Southwest,the Apache massacred Navajo and Pueblo villages, and likewise the Spanish settlers of New Mexico. The Comanches dominated the southern High Plains and waged incessant wars against the Kiowa driving them out of Texas and north into what is now Kansas. Ironically one of the great swindles in American history was committed by, \u201cnon violent\u201d Quakers and William Penn\u2019s \u201cWalking Purchase\u201d of Pennsylvania from the Lenape nation (now known as the Delaware (with some descendants forming the Kickapoo in the desert southwest)). Penn sent runners across the state. The Lenape moved west and were butchered by the Huron and Shawnee. Inter Native American warfare was incessant until the USA stepped in and both conquered tribes, and defended tribes from one another. ",

            "answer_text": "Multiple reasons, which other answers cover one or two at a time. The American Indians were blessed with an absence of diseases, thanks to their lack of domestic animals. This became a curse when Europeans and Africans arrived, bringing their endemic diseases. Upon contact these diseases became epidemic in tribe after tribe, causing a 95% die-off. The result was that the original immigrant settlers found existing cleared farms, towns, etc. that were either deserted or barely inhabited. The few surviving Indians tended to be either killed, driven off or assimilated (Squanto and Pocahontas being classic examples of the latter). As diseases became endemic among the survivors, many tribes recovered. There was a tendency for tribes to ally with either the British or (more often) the French settlers. Once the British won the Seven Years War and French authority was gone, the British worked to establish peaceful relations with the tribes. Then came the American Revolution. The London regime ordered their agents living among the tribes to enlist the tribes in the war. The agents were universally appalled and said so, but they were ignored. Most tribes decided to stay out, some took up the British offer and a few sided with the US. These latter were like the French, in that they were interested in attacking their enemies, and allying with the US was just a convenient way to do that. After the war, the US government took careful stock of which tribes were which, punishing those who had sided with the British, and rewarding those who sided with the US. I lie; to the newly independent Ameicans, Indians were just Indians. The new US government had a massive war debt to discharge. This was done over several decades by selling western lands wholesale to land speculators, who then resold the land in farm plots at a markup. When the settlers arrived they found these naked, primative, heathen, illiterate savages on their land. (The facts that in general these tribes had adopted European dress and technology, that some printed their own newspapers, that many were Christian and that they were living on land their tribes had farmed for centuries meant nothing to the settlers.) The settlers banded together as militias and fought the tribes for the land. They often found ready allies in neighboring tribes, who were happy to help attack their hereditary enemies. Occasionally a leader would come along who would get several tribes to put aside their differences, and ally to fight back as against the US settlers. Generally that was when the US army would come in and eventually overwhelm the allies. Then there were the treaties. The US would negotiate for some piece of land (usually at gunpoint, sometimes implied, sometimes literally), and the local \u201cIndian Chief\" would sign the treaty. The problem was, the US did not understand the meaning of the various words that were badly translated as, \u201cchief.\u201d To the US negotiators, a \u201cchief\" was basically a king, whose word within a tribe was law. But in almost all tribes there would be several men with this title, which would better translate as \u201crespected elder.\u201d These men ruled a clan of a few families, not the entire tribe. Any agreements they made were only binding on that clan, and if a man or family did not like the agreement he or they could (and often did) readily transfer to a different clan. On the US side, treaties, agreements, etc. were considered legally binding documents to be scrupulously adhered to, unless there was some overriding circumstance that would compel them to break a treaty. Like a chance to make a buck, settle on free land, etc. (After all, these Indians are just savages. It is not like we are breaking a contract with real people.) As a result, the treaties were not worth the paper they were written on, to either side. This pattern went on for about a century. The tribes had a few local successes, but they were never able to really unite, and the US became expert at getting the tribes to weaken themselves by fighting each other. And the more the US expanded into the west, the less land the tribes had. To this day there are \u201cIndian Reservations\u201d scattered all across the US. Some are wealthy (the Agua Caliente Reservation consists of half of Palm Springs, CA. in a checkerboard pattern), some make money by legalizing questionable activities (casinos and loans with outrageous interest), but most are dirt poor. (Who is going to build, say, a factory on land they can never own, and how can the tribes get the capital to do it themselves if their only asset is land they cannot mortgage?) This is why so many individuals have left the reservations and assimilated in \u201cregular\" US society (I have known three of them over the years). I am an American, and in most areas I am proud of it. But the US treatment of the American Indians, both as tribes and as individuals, is shameful. \u201cGenocide\u201d is not too strong a word. ",
