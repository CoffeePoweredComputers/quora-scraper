In the meantime, President Carter flew out to speak before a large Hispanic crowd celebrating Cinco de Mayo in Los Angeles. The Secret Service arrested a homeless man by the name of Raymond Lee Harvey, carrying a revolver with blank cartridges. Harvey implicated another man named Oswaldo Espinoza. Together they told a story of other men that had wanted the two to create a distraction during Carter\u2019s speech for an assassination. A motel room was search that turned up an empty shotgun case and three live rounds of ammunitions. Carter cancelled his Cinco de Mayo appearance. The name of the two suspects combined, came out to Lee Harvey Oswaldo, a message that shook Jimmy Carter. He remarked that there was a stronger power than himself that was running the country. Carter also cancelled his national televised address. ",

            "answer_text": "Presidents since JFK do not ride in an open car any more. If Kennedy had the top on the car, he would probably have served a second term. They also don\u2019t jump out of the limousine and start shaking hands with people behind the barricades. Kennedy did this when he visited our town after he was elected. I saw Secret Service guys trying to herd him back into the car. I bet he was a veritable nightmare for them. Secret Service efforts have been stepped up even more when Reagan was shot. It\u2019s hard to know when someone will jump out of the woodwork. Guarding the POTUS must certainly be a daunting task and requires constant, maybe perpetual vigilance. ",
