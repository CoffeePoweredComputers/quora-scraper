Among those that escaped, some made it to the Netherlands, at that time a stronghold of Protestantism, & some of these the Government farmed out to the Cape. I expect you know, grandmothers are the repository of History. My grandmother taught me things about the persecution of the French Protestants that I never saw in history books until late adulthood. Also, that I, here in faraway Africa, am related to Cardinal Richelieu, & descended from King Henry of Navarre. ",
