            "answer_text": "I am not much conversant with Japanese history and culture, but I would assume Geishas would remain, but likely in a limited, watered down, version today to conform with modern sensibilities and realities.  Image courtesy of Pinterest. I doubt today\u2019s Geishas would retain their complete previous mystery, as they held in the past, due to all the information now available, almost everywhere on earth, and as today mysteries are often difficult to find. As for Geishas being revered, I cannot really answer that, but would enquire revered by who, and whom? Those they were trained to entertain? My understanding is that those girl children intending to become Geishas left their homes in their childhood to live away from their families evermore so as to be trained into the intricate duties, and service, befitting a well trained Geisha in an acknowledged `Geisha\u2019 establishment/school. Those necessities would represent a huge sacrifice to the children, and their families, but was undertaken in order to accomplish an outcome - i.e. to become a Geisha of great refinement, and sometimes undoubtedly, renown, and which required many, and various abilities in the social, and hospitality, realms. Geishas were tutored, and schooled, in all manners and ways of deportment, grace, dress, attitudes and behaviours as befitted the contemporary conventions of the eras when Geisha custom was likely a larger part of former Japanese society. Refinements included learning to play musical instruments and to learn all the Japanese conventions of high hospitality, and high courtesy, according to Japanese traditions involved in being a consummate hostess of high standing. ,Dress code for Geishas, was, and likely remains. extremely important so required much training as did the geisha\u2019s traditional face make-up. It took many years to train a Geisha, and likely still does. It seems to be a large sacrifice of one\u2019s early years. That, above, is about all the information I can provide without resorting to research.

            "answer_text": "I once attended a formal dinner accompanied by geisha. There were four of them: three experienced ones and one trainee. While we were eating and drinking they came to the room with the shami-sen musical instrument to perform singing and dancing. Yes, it was entertaining and made you feel like you were a chosen one, since super rich people alone were able to afford them. I was not super rich, but an interpreter for a group of Americans who made a speech on American dams. The experienced geisha painted their faces white, which made me wonder. Is white a symbol of grace? I thought it was unnecessary. The trainee alone did not have a white face. Now, are they mysterious? I\u2019d say yes, because regular people are unable to afford them. Are they revered? I do not know. They are courtesans, aren\u2019t they? While the trainee was performing her act, I was wondering when she would find a patron to go beyond a girl and become a woman. My vulgar interest is a proof that their status does not fall in the respected segment of society. ",
