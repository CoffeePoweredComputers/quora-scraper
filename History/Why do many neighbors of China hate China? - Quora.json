            "answer_text": "While it\u2019s plausible to say there are some points here that can\u2019t conclude to one true right answer, there are two points I have a problem with China for. And there\u2019s no excusing China or any means of accepting it. Forcing Other Cultures (like Tibet/Mongolia) to Assimilate to China\u2019s Uniform National identityTibet for instance - there is a complete lack of regard/respect for their ancient beliefs and culture. China seems to just absorb other ethnic identities into their ways. Yes-china has their expectations but it\u2019s arrogant to impose the fading/erasure of another culture\u2019s ethnic identity. I know historical events have done the same but in this day and age, i find it sad that cultures are being erased and unapogetically rebranded by China. I personally respect global diversity and cultural difference, but not China\u2019s method. Pretty sure China wouldn\u2019t like a completely different Culture coming into their space and demanding that they adapt to a life that\u2019s nothing like the one they\u2019ve always known. China claims their changes are \u201cwhat\u2019s best\u201d for these cultures but that\u2019s because China operates in a relentless/only one way style. Having a controlling mindset prevents any regard for making an attempt to compromise. Might be a wild thought - but maybe some people don\u2019t want to give up their cultural identities It\u2019s one thing to be intolerant of their people, but straight up arrogant to not show any recognition or respect for another culture\u2019s part.2. China\u2019s use of their power as leverage to be Bossy/Petty/Controlling over other countries. There are so many situations to mention on this, but here\u2019s a quick one The Petty threats China makes towards any country for things like Welcoming the Dalai Lama or any other positive encounter with a specific person or people on China\u2019s shit list. England is too afraid to even pay for Dalai lama\u2019s dinner when he visits because \u201cChina will get annoyed\u201d and the fact they go as far as manipulating other countries or less resourceful people by threatening to fuck up business relations. so most comply for the sake of that. Yeah China is a huge resource, but it\u2019s just super petty and immature / especially when China gives the passive agressive shoulder at others for not automatically blacklisting another human being just because China wants you to. Quite frankly, it\u2019s immature and bossy imo. No one likes a bossy friend or aquaintance.",

            "answer_text": "That\u2019s a complicated question, but I\u2019ll try my best. China is positioned literally like a body of a human where all the critical parts are in, whereas other neighboring countries could be described as the arms, legs, head, feet, or fingers. In pre-modern times, If a neighboring country wanted to visit another country, they\u2019ll most likely had to go through China. Along their journey, they would have to cross through the rough desert plains, mountainous sceneries and lakes, the rural farmlands, trading ports, and the huge cities like no other they\u2019ve seen in their own homeland. They passed by ordinary folks farming, selling, or fighting each other. They were invited by the local scholars or officials for a tea and had intellectual discussions. They might also have been intimidated by the vast imperial military. The ancient journey provided travelers a world that was filled with unique inventions, beautiful arts and culture, and a dynamic society. If they traveled in the wrong time, they\u2019ve experienced the most chaotic and unstable society the world had ever seen. In early modern times, China is no longer the China it was in the past. It was often called the \u201csick man of Asia.\u201d Other neighboring countries have passed them in certain fields of technology and economic prosperity. Neighboring countries have adapted foreign cultures that was once a distant impossibility. They\u2019ve adapted systems and ideologies that have made them progressed into a world-class nation. With it\u2019s new status, it can look down on other poorer nations. Few neighboring countries have prospered, while others have not, through adapting western system and ideology, and in many ways, China does admire the advancements the western civilization have made. They\u2019ve been looked down upon, beaten, schemed against, discriminated, and till this day they still are. They\u2019ve reached a really bottom point, so where else can they go but up? Today, China is climbing back up in every field you can imagine, It went through chaotic times in the past 150 years, but it\u2019s now in a period where they will soon enter another golden age within the next 50 years, imo. With today\u2019s global competition, every winner will always have a loser. That loser might be a Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, American, Korean, British, German, Thai, or etc. With its rise, there will always be a sense of fear, distrust, jealousy, and denial. China will always have its bad apples doing business within and outside of China, but they also have plenty of good apples. It\u2019s no different than any other foreign nationalities. China wants to succeed and proper as well, but they will do it their own way! Even if they have to go through a trial and error,and even if they adapt certain foreign elements, they will always choose their own path. Even if it cost them millions of lives, or in western standards, hundreds of millions of lives suffering through war, in the end, they want to control their own destiny! A destiny that is free from foreign influences and restrictions. In the most fundamental sense, this is what true freedom should be! You can hate them as much as you want. You can look down on them with pure disgust as much as you want. But at the end of they day, they\u2019re too busy trying to achieve their goals, personal and national. It was like this in the past, it is like this today, and it will continue to be like this in the future. This is the identity of the Middle Kingdom. ",
