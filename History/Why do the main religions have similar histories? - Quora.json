            "answer_text": "This is very obvious that all the religions have the similar history events. However, there are great variations too. Religions work on the people sentiments and brain washing. If you want to give message to the society then they will not listen or follow you however correct or logical you may be. But if you try to spread something in the name of god people will immediately follow you blindly however the stupid and logic less you may be. This is the science and development which has brought ease in the life of the people otherwise people have been involved in the war and have been very deprived with great hardships in life. In those ancient days the public mass was totally uneducated and people were just like herds of the sheep. At that time whatever was promulgated among them was immediately perceived by the common man and was acted upon it blindly. In ancient times many things were misleading especially in case of the religions and gods. Already, by giving a name or a word we render the supreme power as a thing. Moreover, after assuming it as a thing we put the personification to it. We render a personality to the supreme power. Then beyond the personification this supreme power thing has been provided with a shape and styles like statues etc. Actually, God is the creation of the imagination of the human. This can be an endless dispute. All the enlightened person will come to the ring to fight down you with their logic that their god is actual and real and have perfect shape, size or invisibility or nothingness. Finally, you will be believing what have you been believing and what have you taught about that in your childhood. The religion, god and such beliefs are nothing but the imaginations which are filled in a child mind by his family. All heaven, hell, justice, fear, this life that life these are just created to make a man righteous. Only sensible people can be good without such fears otherwise for 90% people it is impossible to be good without such fears. But it does not make any difference. A priest, mullha and godmen can be as disgust as anything whereas there are also examples of such persons who do not believe in any religion or god but they are still good and right of their mind, doings and sayings. There is not a department and court a god like thing sitting there and calculating your goods or bads and then will reward and punish you. If you believe it, keep believing. But these are just theories. Ok there is something and some system like that then only you are a good person? If there had not been any such system of god, his court, hell and heaven\u2026 then? Then will you not be good? if your answer is \u2018no\u2019 then you are in a trade with the supreme. Your all prayers and offerings are just fake and are just currency to get set free from your misdeeds. or your all goodness is just a pretending. If you say \u201cyes\u2019 then ok fine,, if you still can be good then just be good. Why do you bother so much about such a system? If it is there then its ok,, if not.. then again it is ok. You are always in a win win situation. If you are little thoughtful then you will be adding more imaginations and your own logic in it. If you are little more crazy, then you will start wandering in search of God. If you are going to be more intellectual more expressive and with a better spinning of the logics, then you will a be Godmen/enlightened person. Then in your life time you will be influencing the people. And if there will be some space left in the world and society, after you, you will be famous as a messenger or as god itself. Then a new religion with new definitions of the god and his rules will be erected on your names and teachings after few hundred years. It has been going in this way and it will go in the same way. Nothing about the supreme will be decoded and concluded ever. There will be different scriptures, new beliefs, new religions and more confusions about the older ones. ",

            "answer_text": "The histories usually originate from the same region. Your neighbor has similar beliefs to you. In another state they may be similar also. In a neighboring country they may not be all that different. When we go to another continent they may have more variance but many ideas are the same. This is due to people moving about and sharing ideas. For religion and government there must be commonalities for them to function as religion or government. There must be certain factors involved for them to qualify as government or religion. I often think of history as a pancake recipe. With history you must have common events in order to say create an country, religion or government or even war. With pancakes you can change around the recipe but you must have certain ingredients or it will no longer be a pancake. It is the same historically for religion. Without certain historical events and social factors it simply would not become a religion or be recognized as such. ",
