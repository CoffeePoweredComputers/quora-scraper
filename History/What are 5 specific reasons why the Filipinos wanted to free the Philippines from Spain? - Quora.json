            "answer_text": "The whole Philippine Revolution against Spanish and eventually American colonial rule was a nativization of preexisting consolidation of similar fragmented sociopolitical identities into a single nation states like American and Latin American War of Independence and destruction of sectarian and aristocratic-based political systems like French Revolution. Because of these preexisting revolutions across the globe, any kinds of native-based revolutions against colonial (whether against European-born leaders or monastic-based Catholic religious groups) rule was always inevitable and the Philippines was not that immune for such inevitable reality due to excesses of friar domination in the Spanish colonial rule in the country and easier access to news and reading materials about American, French, Latin American, German, or Italian revolutions, so Philippine founding leaders like Jos\u00e9 Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, Apolinario Mabini, Emilio Aguinaldo, Antonio Luna, and others had already read the works of Thomas Jefferson, Alexe de Tocqueville, Sim\u00f3n Bolivar, Niccolo Machiavelli, or even Karl Marx. So, due to these events in local and global histories I\u2019ve mentioned, a revolt against Spanish and eventually, American colonial rules was already inevitable for the Philippines. The problem on why the revolution failed was due to lack of necessary urgency among the general population by 1890s to revolt against the Spaniards and because of that, it was exploited by the American successors, so Philippine revolutionaries should have waited a certain boiling point to ignite an economic-based revolution by 20 more years just like in Mexican and Russian revolutions.
