            "answer_text": "Yes, Japan was a totalitarian dictatorship during the 1930s and 1940s. The dictatorship that ruled Japan at this time went by a Fascist philosophy similar to that of Nazi Germany. In some ways, it was even more totalitarian than German National Socialism was because it achieved a degree of collectivism and control over the population that Hitler could only dream of. For example, the Nazis never had the kind of power, with the exception of perhaps the most fanatical SS units, to compel their subjects to mount Kamikaze-style suicide attacks against their enemies. However, the Japanese junta was admittedly helped along in this sense by the strong Japanese cultural inclinations toward discipline, placing the group above the individual, and obedience to authority. What is unique about the Japanese dictatorship of this period as compared to other dictatorships was that there was no single dominant personality. It was more like a clique that had a very strong base and following in the Japanese army. It was the Japanese army that was the rough equivalent of the Nazis in Germany and the Communists in the Soviet Union. However, there was really no counterpart to Hitler or Stalin. Even when their members were not officially heading up a government, as was the case before fall of 1941 and after the summer of 1944, they would force their will and exert their influence through assassinations and threats of assassinations against those who disagreed with them. Additionally, every official governing act they executed was done in the name of the Emperor, even though the Emperor customarily had no substantive involvement, and indeed ultimately came out against them when faced with certain defeat in the war.

            "answer_text": "In the years before WWII, Japan was in the process of turning into a constitutional monarchy on the model of Great Britain or other European monarchies, with political parties and prime ministers going in and out of power. But it had a fatal flaw, in that the Navy and the Army were essentially independent, answerable to no one but the Emperor. Each had a minister in the Cabinet, which was appointed by the Navy or Army and NOT by the prime minister. If either one disagreed with a government action, all they had to do was withhold their minister, and the prime minister\u2019s government would fall. This became increasingly prevalent in the 1930s, and while civilian prime ministers continued to try to form governments, they finally gave up in 1940, and after that the prime minister only came from the military. Hence, a military dictatorship. However, when we in the West think of dictatorship, we assume a dictator (like Hitler or Mussolini). Japan, however, was dictatorship by committee. In the West, we assume this dictator to have been Tojo, who was prime minister during the war years (and was executed as a war criminal after the war). But he did not hold absolute power by any means, and resigned his position in 1944. At war\u2019s end, he was nowhere near the reins of power, it having passed to other senior military people. So, a dictatorship, but not at all in the Western sense. ",
