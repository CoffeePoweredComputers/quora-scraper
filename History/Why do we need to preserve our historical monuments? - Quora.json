            "answer_text": "I can think of quite a few reasons\u2026 Preservation for preservation\u2019s sake Many monuments are a link to the past. Even if very distant, they allow us to remember how far we have come as a species and they put our own lives into perspective. Take the Colosseum in Rome for example.  It gives a tangible link to the ancient past, reminds us that humans have been around and doing quite impressive things for a very long time, and allows us to see first-hand what our ancestors built. That leads to the second point. Education and interest We can learn from the past and many people find history interesting. The educational or entertainment value of actually visiting a piece of the past in infinitely greater than merely reading about it. There is also a second level to this. Say hello to the Rosetta Stone.  Before the discovery and analysis of the stone, no living human being could read Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. The stone was the key to deciphering them and it\u2019s a pretty good thing that we still had some ancient Egyptian monuments around so we could read and learn from the inscriptions once we knew how the language worked. Pride National pride cannot be underestimated. The Colosseum, mentioned earlier, is a key example. For many Italians, it reminds them that there was a time when Italy was the centre of the western world. In London, Nelson\u2019s Column in Trafalgar Square harks back to the golden age of British geopolitical power. Not all pride comes from military conquest, however. Take the Statue of Liberty for example.  Rather than celebrating an empire, it celebrates freedom from one. Lady Liberty commemorates the independence of the United States and became even better known as one of the first things that new immigrants to America would see upon their arrival by ship. She became a proud symbol of both freedom and egalitarianism and is still one of the most potent symbols of modern America. However, there are other types of symbols\u2026 To never forget Humans make mistakes - terrible mistakes - and it is important that we do our best not to repeat them. Most people reading this can probably see where we\u2019re going. It\u2019s the obvious one: Auschwitz.  The fact that the camp still stands, complete with \u201cArbeit Macht Frei (Work will set you free)\u201d in large letters above the front gate, is a constant reminder of the worst side of humanity. While it has become less potent in recent years, having a concrete reminder to point to of what can happen when people allow it is essential to our survival as a species. Those are, to me at least, the most important reasons for preserving our physical past. ",

            "answer_text": "Because history belongs to humanity and we as humans have so much to learn from those that lived before us. Civil war history has been victimized and used by hate mongers and politicians to push their agendas, they decided all by themselves what it should mean and that is exactly what the nazis did when they burned books, nobody alive today fought in that war, and if we continue to allow the media and politicians to use marxism and encourage the destruction of historical momentum we as a species will loose, those monuments are windows into the past, how long before someone looking to get ahead calls for the destruction of the coliseum in Rome? Democrats calling for the destruction of Confederate monuments is the pot calling the kettle black , the confederacy was the Democratic party! Or maybe thats what they really are after? To cover up their dark past, one is for sure. As long as they keep using fear and racism to promote anarchy Joe biden dose not have to talk about issue. Like what he can do Better then trum. Good for you Joe but civilized society and future generations should not have to look at a pile of rock and wonder what is used to be! Children should have every right to witness monuments for themselves and ask questions, experience that window into history, nobody alive today can really judge the past because you're just looking at it from a modern perspective (that past is how we got here ) and thats the point! To learn and appreciate, not to judge and rewrite, lt col Allen west said it best , history belongs to everyone ",
