            "answer_text": "Not to be verbose: 1) Discipline2) Logistics3) Horse archery and composite bows4) Tolerance First, they were very disciplined. Each Mongolian warrior was assigned to a group of ten, and if one of them deserted or run away from the battle - all ten were executed. And later on, when Mongolian empire was established, there was a saying that \u201ca virgin with a bag of gold can walk through all the empire, from one border to another, without losing her gold and her virginity\u201d. And that was true in case a traveler had a special pass (usually a metal or wooden plate with carving) issued by Mongolian administration. Second, they logistic was remarkable due to the fact that Mongolian army needed quite few supplies while traveling - they had horses, they drank horse milk and ate horse meat. Horses ate grass, abundant in steppe. So there was no need to wait for supply carts. Each warrior had two or three horses, riding them in turns not to exhaust them. And no infantry. Third, Mongolian composite bows were even better than Welsh longbows - they hit as far as 300 meters, and Mongols had bow and horse training since childhood (there was a saying that a Mongol starts riding a horse even before he starts walking). And tolerance\u2026 Funny thing is that Mongols were actually quite tolerant. They did not consider other people \u201cbarbarians\u201d, and they did not consider other religions \u201cheathens\u201d. They often kept temples and priests intact, \u201cnot to anger the other gods\u201d. And they often recruited people from conquered lands into their army, even as high ranks if they had appropriate skills. (We should mention, however, that their tolerance decreased drastically in case of resistance.) ",

            "answer_text": "the main advantage of the Mongol aggressors was luck. they were lucky to face incompetent opponents. lucky in the timing of their rise as a military power. no one thinks the Mongols would have gone anywhere had Genghis Khan been born in 1739 much less 1939. once their luck ran out the Mongol \u201cempire\u201d collapsed like a house of cards. all the chatter about the Mongol\u2019s, Discipline, Logistics, Tolerance, Archery and composite bows proved meaningless in the long run. 57 years after Genghis Khan\u2019s death the Mongol force attacking Hungary in 1285 was annihilated. a year later the Mongols were routed in Poland. the Mongols Never posed a serious threat to those countries or Europe again. in 1368 after less than 100 years of occupation the Chinese were able to drive the Mongols out of their country. had the Mongols forgotten how to fight in that century? what happened to the vaunted Mongol war machine? i would suggest that when they encountered able military commanders and troops the Mongols weren\u2019t so effective. certainly history would seem to suggest that is the case.
