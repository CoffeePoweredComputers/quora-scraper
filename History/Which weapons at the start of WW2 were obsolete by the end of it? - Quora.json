            "answer_text": "Many weapons systems deployed at the start of the war were obsolete by the end. This is virtually inevitable since technological improvement is a constant, ongoing thing and since the rate of development had to increase with war. The primary aim of technological development in a war is to counter the technologies of the enemy and make them obsolete! Even so, very many weapons on hand at the beginning, though known to be flawed or inferior compared to the job they were being asked to do, were still in use by the end simply because they worked well enough and could not be entirely replaced. Good examples are all the heavy bombers designed in the late 1930s. The American B-17 was designed to be self defending, able to deliver bombs on target and survive to return to base. To this end it used a mechanical analog computer bomb sight and mounted numerous 50 cal machine guns and carried as many as 6 gunners. But, this plane in its conception and even with significant improvements was never capable of fulfilling its mission as conceived on its own. The bomb sight was useless in heavily clouded skies and was almost irrelevant when the bombers dropped bombs from the required miles-wide defensive formations rather than from planes lined up in streams for a more accurate run by each plane over the target. Most of the planes could never drop bombs anywhere close to the target. The gunnery was woefully insufficient to prevent horrendous loss rates in defended skies unless the bombers were heavily protected by escorting fighters. The enemy\u2019s tactics and weapons rendered the B-17 obsolete early on. However, the B-17, with fighter protection, worked well enough, the fighter protection being a technological development that tended to rendered the enemy\u2019s anti-bomber technology obsolete. And, too late, the enemy\u2019s fighter aircraft technology rendered the bomber escorts obsolete. Almost all of the front line aircraft of WWII were obsolete and virtually worthless at the end, -their only function being to stand in for their replacements coming as quickly as possible. ",

            "answer_text": "The anti-tank rifle. Though in some sense the type lives on as an anti-vehicular weapon, as an anti-armor weapon it was dead by 1943. There are a lot of photos showing Soviet troops using AT rifles at Kursk, though whether they actually knocked out any tanks is pretty doubtful.  After Kursk, you really don\u2019 t see them at all at least in an anti-tank role. ",
