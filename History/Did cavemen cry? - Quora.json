            "answer_text": "I guess it depends on what you mean by cavemen. I am sure that EEMH (Early European Modern Humans formerly know as Cro-Magnon) cried because they were generally the same as us. They were Homo sapiens, as we all are. They were continually occupying the continent from around 50,000 years ago. Prior to that, the various species of humans may have cried but we have no way of knowing for sure. We can assume but we may never know. ",

            "answer_text": "Cave people would have had tear ducts, so yes. I am not sure if crying was purely functional for them, however, or if it would have the same social connotations. Certainly they\u2019d cry if smoke got in their eyes, or they smelled an onion, or were in extreme pain. But possibly not out of sadness. ",
