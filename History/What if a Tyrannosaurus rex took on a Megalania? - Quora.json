            "answer_text": "For one thing that wouldn\u2019t ever happen as tyrannosaurus was long dead by the time megalania rolled up on the block, but if they did hypothetically fight then tyrannosaurus would most certainly win. Megalania was very big. It was around 20 feet long and weighed three quarters of a ton. It was only about three feet tall when on four legs but could probably reach 10 feet tall if it reared up on its hind legs, which most modern monitor lizards can. There is a chance that is had a hemotoxin in its saliva but this cannot be prove. (The main argument for this is that the Komodo dragon has a toxin in its saliva.) source:Megalania - Wikipedia T. Rex on the other hand was forty feet long, weighed 14 metric tones (aka a metric shit tone) and was twelve feet tall at the shoulder. That\u2019s around the same size as the trailer on a tractor trailer. Tyrannosaurus probably had a biteforce of 6000 lbs. (The estimates run from 1800 to 12700 pounds so I just chose somewhere in the middle.) In short megalania could snap at tyrannosaurus\u2019s knees while tyrannosaurs could kill megalania in one bite. If tyrannosaurus was attacked while sleeping or lying down megalania could definitely win, but if the two had lived at the same time and in the same habitat then T. rex would probably prey on megalania.

            "answer_text": "The tyrannosaurus has all the advantages here. The first and foremost advantage it has is that of height. A T-Rex stands 16 feet tall while a megalania was no more than about 4 feet tall at most. And it could not rear up on hind-legs. The T-Rex is free to stomp over the low-laying lizard. The second advantage the dinosaur would have is weight/mass. The stomping rex would easily crush the bones and organs of the gigantic lizard. The third advantage a rex has in this fight is the type and size of teeth. The rex has serrated, 12 inches long teeth with jaw muscles which easily provide enough bite force to bite through the metallic skeleton of a car. One bite of the rex at the neck, and the lizard ends up in obituaries. The last advantage the rex has is that of speed. It was faster than megalania and slightly smarter too. It would easily evade the attacks of the lizard, while easily being able to deliver decisive blows in return. The rex would win all times against the lizard. ",
