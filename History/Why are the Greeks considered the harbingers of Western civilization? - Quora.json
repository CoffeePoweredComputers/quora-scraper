            "answer_text": "I agree with all the previous contributors. I only like to add that the key word for an answer here is \u201cRenaissance\u201d: This it is a \u201crebirth / revival\u201d movement, which originated from the cultivated elites of european states, in the 17th century onwards, who sought a way out of centuries old internal strifes in the continent and religious despotism, given also the fact that they where now facing a new age of world exploration and conquests, with vast fields of fresh knowledge to be attained. In that sense these people turned to the previous time when people in their \u201cneighborhood\u201d made efforts to explore and explain the world using reason and humanity at the center of all things. The Greek civilization, especially between the 6th \u2013 2nd centuries BC , was the best for that role for many reasons, amongst which : a) it was the oldest anthropocentric culture in the world (they even worshiped the victory of human gods against natural elements or animal-like gods represented in previous civilizations), b) it gave a sense of supremacy of Europeans against people of other continents (greek victories over Persians remained a major point of reference until the late era of European imperialism), and c) it gave a sense of continuity since it had great influence to the both the Roman and Christian shared past of all Europeans. \u201cRevival\u201d movements always work like that, taking for granted a common (often imagined) glorious past. Trying to make a point for discussion here, I think that this is a valid observation also for the Islamic revival movement, which, at least since the 1970s, calls Muslims to look back at the settings of politics, society and the practices of early Islamic era (especially during the Arab conquests) in order to rally behind future goals.
