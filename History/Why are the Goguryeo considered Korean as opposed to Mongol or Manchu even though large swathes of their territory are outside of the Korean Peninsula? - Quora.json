            "answer_text": "This is an incorrect question. Korean is a cultural concept. Manchu was a political concept. In 16-17th century, the Manchu leader Nurhachi claimed that Manchu was a tribe of Jurchen, and he used this name \u201cManchu\u201d to declare his dominance. It originally means auspicious and wonderful. The concept was borrowed from Tibetan Buddhism. On the other hand, Goguryeo and Balhae were both descendants of Fu Yu tribe. To understand the origin, you need to know the four main tribes who lived in Manchuria: The Western part was Eastern Tungus (AKA Dong Hu). This tribe is closer to modern Mongolians, and historical XianBei (Siberians) , Shi Wei and Khitan.The Eastern part was Jurchen. This tribe is closer to modern Manchu, Oroqen and Xibo.The middle part was Hui-Mo. This tribe is closer to modern Koreans, and historical Fu Yu tribes and Goguryeo.The Southern part was pan-Shang tribes, which is closer to modern Han Chinese.Now the problem is that, the early Goguryeo was a pure Fu Yu people which was part of Hui-Mo people. Obviously, they were not the same people with modern Manchu which was the descendant of Jurchen who lived in the eastern part of Manchuria. Later, this Goguryeo did absorb other tribes such as Mo He which did include some Jurchen tribes. And of course, the later Manchu state included many other tribes living in the same or neighboring regions and some of them might be the descendants of Goguryeo. But history is history. You cannot claim Donald Trump is a German because his grandfather was a German citizen. So you cannot claim Goguryeo was Manchu just because the Manchu state might have some people who were Goguryeo descendants or vice versa. And people consider Goguyeo was part of Korean history because it was one of three kingdoms in the Korean three kingdom period in 6-7th century. See this: Three Kingdoms of Korea - Wikipedia ",

            "answer_text": "I suppose the questioner's intention is to know what the structure of Korean ethnic formation is. ----- In BC, China's \"ancient historical book\" says Baekje\uff08\u767e\u6e08\uff09 was created by a Goguryeo(\u9ad8\u53e5\u9e97) sect (the ruling class). This is a historical fact. The book also says that Silla\uff08\u65b0\u7f85\uff09 is made by migrants from the continent Qin Empire(\u79e6\u5e1d\u56fd.) And the King of Ma Han=\u99ac\u97d3 (later Baekje\u767e\u6e08) divided the southeastern part for them and permitted to live there. In addition, do not forget the fact that later Koryo(\u9ad8\u9e97) king, Taejo Wang Guhn, unified again the Peninsula and clearly claimed that his Kingdom is the successor of Goguryeo(\u9ad8\u53e5\u9e97). That is why the similarity of names between the two Kingdoms exists. So, Goguryeo belongs obviously and undeniably to Korean history. *Note: What is the most interesting point is that this Silla derived from the continental Qin, and the Chinese letter \"the Qin=\u79e6\" has meaning \"Rome.\" In fact, a lot of ancient roman remains are excavated only in the old region of Silla. However, we don't know yet what was the real nature of the ties between the \"Qin Empire\" and \"the Eastern Romain Empire.\" We know that \"the Western Roman Empire\" is survived as \"Western Europe\" , and we could presume probably that \"Eastern Roman Empire\" would be survived in Korea. So, present South Korea is vested with partially both Goguryeo and Silla's roman culture and up the North Korean region has much more accentuated warrior culture of Gokuryo legacy. --- The etymology of Silla(\u65b0\u7f85) \u79e6\u21d2\u79e6\u7f85\u21d2\u8fb0\u97d3\u21d2\u65b0\u7f85 \u79e6=Qin indicates \"Rome\" \u7f85\u3000means country \u8fb0\u3000means dragon, blue, spring, and southeast direction \u65b0\u7f85 means \"New country\" *We have to remind the Qin Empire lasted only 15 years on the Chinese continent, a Kingdom of an extremely short period of time over there. Nonetheless, after its ruin on the continent, the Qin lasted effectively under the Silla Kingdom approximately 1000 years on the Korean Peninsula. South Korea can be said in this sense as a rightful successor of the \"Qin Empire.\" And later this \"Qin=Silla\" was to be merged into the Koryo Kingdom\uff08\u9ad8\u9e97.\uff09 --- \u5927\u79e6dai shin=Big Qin=Roman Empire\u3000\u79e6=Qin=Rome=actually=\u5c0f\u79e6=Little Qin=Little Rome=Present continental first empire=Romans (mainly ancient Turks) are the founders and not Han Chinese at all. So, present China, as far as they call themselves as the Han people, has nothing to do historically with the Qin Empire. Moreover, the \"Qin Empire\" lasted on the continent only 15 years. Inversely, Qin migrants moved onto the Korean Peninsula, South Korea's \u79e6\u97d3 (Qin Han) \uff1d\u8fb0\u97d3 (Jin Han) \uff1d\u65b0\u7f85 (Silla) \uff1dPresent Gyonju province of South Korea\u97d3\u56fd\u6176\u5dde where their Qin lasted under Silla about 1000 years. ---- Ancient Turks formed as some (but strong) part of Korean people and of later Japanese people. And compared to their language connections with the present Turkish: Turkish, Korean and Japanese languages have a lot of similarities, especially grammatical construction features, which have no relation at all with the present Chinese language. Words or vocabularies are more vulnerable and changeable by circumstances, but the grammatical construction does not easily change and usually stay as a solid trace of history. And curiously, facts of several times of trying in conquering the Chinese continent from the part of Korean (=Goguryeo and other eras) and Japanese (=Hideyosi\u2019s era and WW2) seem to be like that of \"Reconquista\" through that their ancient Turkish blood had been pushing them in order to regain subconsciously \"their ancient Empire of Qin.\" Thus, as present Chinese people are not from \"Qin ethnics\", but are from \"Han\", they should not be \"Qin=China\" but technically should be \"Han country\uff08\uff1d\u6f22\u56fd\uff09.\" These two are separate ethnics. And for China's etymology is \"Qin\", but no relation with \"Han\" at all. Therefore, in other words, if the present continental people, as long as they are from Han descents, the country name must be rather \"Han country\uff08\uff1d\u6f22\u56fd\uff09\", but absolutely not \"China.\" I am sure that some descendants of \"Qin\" may be surviving in present China. But the descendants of \"Qin\" are still living now also in the Korean peninsula and the Japanese archipelago.   ",
