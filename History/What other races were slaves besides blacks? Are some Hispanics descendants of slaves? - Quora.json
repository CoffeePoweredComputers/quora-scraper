This is all part of the inferiorization process developed by the worst enslavers of Blacks, including European slavers and their brainwashed descendants in the USA. https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/thomas-sowell-on-slavery-and-this-fact-there-are-more-slaves-today-than-were-seized-from-africa-in-four-centuries/ Of all the tragic facts about the history of slavery, the most astonishing to an American today is that, although slavery was a worldwide institution for thousands of years, nowhere in the world was slavery a controversial issue prior to the 18th century. People of every race and color were enslaved \u2013 and enslaved others. White people were still being bought and sold as slaves in the Ottoman Empire, decades after American blacks were freed. French conquest of Algeria - Wikipedia The conquest of Algeria began in the last days of the Bourbon Restoration by Charles X of France. It aimed to put a definite end to Barbary privateering and increase the king's popularity among the French people, particularly in Paris, where many veterans of the Napoleonic Wars lived. Algerian slave trade and piracy immediately ceased after the French conquered Algiers. Truth must be told. Etymology of the word slave : SlavsThe very word slave (degraded servant or perpetual serf) comes from the Slavs, a European ethnic group, because they were once the vast majority of people enslaved. It went from Slavs to slave. Their name is forever tied to human bondage not Blacks. Origin and meaning of slave by Online Etymology Dictionary slave (n.) late 13c., \"person who is the chattel or property of another,\" from Old French esclave (13c.), from Medieval Latin Sclavus \"slave\" (source also of Italian schiavo, French esclave, Spanish esclavo), originally \"Slav\" (see Slav); so used in this secondary sense because of the many Slavs sold into slavery by conquering peoples. The oldest written history of the Slavs can be shortly summarised--myriads of slave hunts and the enthralment of entire peoples. The Slav was the most prized of human goods. With increased strength outside his marshy land of origin, hardened to the utmost against all privation, industrious, content with little, good-humoured, and cheerful, he filled the slave markets of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It must be remembered that for every Slavonic slave who reached his destination, at least ten succumbed to inhuman treatment during transport and to the heat of the climate. Indeed Ibr\u0101h\u012bm (tenth century), himself in all probability a slave dealer, says: \"And the Slavs cannot travel to Lombardy on account of the heat which is fatal to them.\" Hence their high price. The Arabian geographer of the ninth century tells us how the Magyars in the Pontus steppe dominated all the Slavs dwelling near them. The Magyars made raids upon the Slavs and took their prisoners along the coast to Kerkh where the Byzantines came to meet them and gave Greek brocades and such wares in exchange for the prisoners. [\"The Cambridge Medieval History,\" Vol. II, 1913] White slavery during the Ottoman Empire, the Golden Age of the Moors (711\u20131492) and Barbary slavery was huge.White slavery meaning human trafficking for the purpose of prostitution comes from a time when European women were commodified and sold on Islamic slave markets. Circassian beauties were in high demand because they were considered trophy wives and preferred breeding partners. Whites were enslaved under different names, including in North Africa. The Punic slaves, the Barbary slaves, the Mamelukes, the Janissaries and the Morean slaves wer white slaved in Africa. Whites were sold as slaves in Africa as late as the 19th as far as Zanzibar where Circassian women were sold to wealthy Zanzibari merchants. Slaves on the Silk Road He cites the travelogue of Ibrahim ibn Ya\u2019qub, a merchant from Tortosa, who noted the trade when he traveled to Prague in the 960s. He also cites Ibn \u1e24awqal, who writes on Saqaliba\u2014the land of the Slavs. \u2018The country [of the Saqaliba] is long and wide. . . . Half of their country . . . is raided by the Khurasanis [Khorezm] who take prisoners from it, while its northern half is raided by the Andalusians who buy them in Galicia, in France, in Lombardy and in Calabria so as to make them eunuchs, and thereafter they ferry them over to Egypt and Africa. All the Saqaliba eunuchs in the world come from Andalusia. . . . They are castrated near this country. The operation is performed by Jewish merchants.'(Jankowiak 2012: n.1) Saqaliba - Slavic slaves in Islamic territories genealogy project From Slaves to Supporters The role of the Slavs in the Fatimid Mediterranean Empire in the Fourth AH /Tenth CE century From Slavs to Slaves Can Europeans, and European women in particular, become objects of trade? The idea seems laughable, since the term \u2018slave trade\u2019 almost always brings Africans to mind. Yet there was a time not so long ago when Europe exported slaves on a large scale. Between 1500 and 1650, Eastern Europe exported 1.5 million slaves to North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia (Fisher, 1972; Kolodziejczyk, 2006). Western Europe exported a little over a million between 1530 and 1780 (Davis, 2004). These slaves were taken during hit-and-run raids by either Crimean Tatar horsemen or North African corsairs. A raiding party would typically descend on an isolated village and carry away its inhabitants\u2014or rather those who were commercially useful, particularly young women and young boys. There was a time farther back, however, when Europeans were accomplices in this trade and when it provided most of their foreign exchange. This was during the Dark Ages and the early Middle Ages, specifically the 8th to 12th centuries. The slave trade was a godsend for the elites of France, Germany, and Italy. With the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, they had to dip into their gold reserves to buy foreign luxury goods from the Middle East, generally clothing, upholstery, tapestries, carpets, and other precious fabrics (Skirda, 2010, pp. 56-57). By the 8th century, these reserves had been almost completely exhausted. Gold was giving way to silver, and even that medium of exchange was being debased. Western Europe had largely reverted to an economy of autarky, its shrunken towns and cities no longer major centers of trade. Most people produced everything they needed within their local village or manor. \u2026.. And so began the commodification of European women. Initially, this trade involved prisoners of war captured during the Islamic wars of expansion. Soon, however, a peaceful trading relationship developed. It was officially prohibited by Christian emperors and popes alike, but \u201cin reality, people closed their eyes and everything was tolerated in exchange for good gold dinars\u201d (Skirda, 2010, p. 75). The women came from a belt of territory stretching from the Elbe in the West to the Volga in the East. This territory was inhabited by Slavic tribes\u2014the ancestors of today\u2019s Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, Byelorussians, Ukrainians, and Russians. They were typically prisoners of war who had been taken during fighting either between Germans and Slavs or among different Slavic tribes: \u2026 The Ending of White Slavery Monday, 3 august 2009 The ending of white slavery ... (the orthodox variety, anyway) ... which efforts came after the outlawing of the trade in black slaves, please note. The call to arms against Barbary was led by the eccentric British admiral, Sir Sidney Smith. He was passionate about the issue of white slavery and had established a movement devoted to ending the trade for ever. It was called the Society of Knights Liberators of the White Slaves of Africa and it rapidly drew influential members from across Europe. When at the end of the Napoleonic Wars crowned heads and ministers gathered to discuss peace at the Congress of Vienna, which began in 1814, Smith and his knights elected to join them. They organised discussions on the fringes of the congress and petitioned for a military showdown with the lawless rulers of North Africa. \u2018This shameful slavery is not only revolting to humanity,\u2019 thundered Smith, \u2018but it fetters commerce in the most disastrous manner.\u2019 Sir Sidney and his knights drew attention to a trade that had ensnared at least one million Europeans and Americans over over the precious three centuries The largest concentration of white slaves had always been in Algiers White slaves predated black slaves in AmericaWhite Slave Trade Aberdeen's White Slave Trade As early as the Jamestown experiment, Britain emptied its jails of prisoners, sending them to America and Australia. Black slaves came later. There were some 50,000 white slaves working on America's tobacco plantations in the 15th century. Many of these were released after they served their time of servitude. As soon as a white slave arrived in America, he was placed on the auction block -- probably in irons -- and wealthy farmers bid on them just as you would bid on a piece of merchandise. Most of those white slaves, once emancipated, moved to the southern states and made up a large part of what we now consider as \"Red Necks\" \u2026 https://www.loc.gov/item/11008401/ White slavery: An American paradox They Were White and They Were Slaves: The Untold History of the Enslavement of Whites in Early America: Michael Hoffman: 9780929903057: Amazon.com: Books White Cargo: The Forgotten History of Britain's White Slaves in America: Jordan, Don, Walsh, Michael, Clark, Roger: 9781515944102: Amazon.com: Books Slaves of a different color White Slavery In Colonial America: And Other Documented Facts Supressed from the Public Know!: Masterson, Dee: 9781442133976: Amazon.com: Books For decades, the story has been told. Major motion pictures have used it as a premise. We even teach it to our children. But what if AFRICAN SLAVERY is the BIGGEST HOAX ever perpetrated? Not to suggest it didn't happen; but rather not in the context often presented as factual history.A conspiracy to suppress 400-years of American history has kept everyone in the dark, made African-Americans feel inferior, and fueled the illusion of white superiority. When we think of slavery in American history, we are conditioned to go back only so far; the Trans-Atlantic African Slave Trade. THE TRUTH of the matter is that if we went back a little further, we would discover a world just as cold and just as cruel but exclusively to white slaves from Europe. They were kidnapped, put in chains, transported across vast oceans, auctioned, torn from their families, whipped, tarred and feathered, lynched, beat to death, malnourished, denied medicare, and worked until they literally dropped dead. Contrary to popular belief, America did not begin as a colony built on the labor of Africans. This earliest and covered-up period began with the systematic exploitation of labor, targeting WHITE SLAVES ONLY.Now suppose this is only the beginning of deceptions you were spoon fed to believe since birth. If you choose the empty hand, you'll go back to sleep, wake up in ignorant bliss, and pick up where you left off. But if you choose to bite the apple from the forbidden tree of knowledge, I'll show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Knowledge is evil only to those who want to keep you enslaved. ",

            "answer_text": "Indigenous were enslaved by the European conquistadors/colonizers, yes. Also, the trade of black African slaves to the Hispanic-held parts of the Caribbean, as well as to central and South America (likely some regions more so than others), was quite high. Both the Spanish and the Portuguese (granted, the latter not Hispanic in the sense of Spanish-speakers from a Spanish-speaking nation) were prolific slavers. As well as the French in their parts of the West Indies (also non-Hispanic, but like Portuguese a related language). What eventually became Haiti was originally Spanish-held, but the westerly part of the greater overall island of \u2018Hispaniola\u2019 was ceded to the French in about the 1600s, and the French continued the Spanish practice of slave labor. See: Atlantic slave trade - Wikipedia From the link, \u201cThe trade of enslaved Africans in the Atlantic has its origins in the explorations of Portuguese mariners down the coast of West Africa in the 15th century...[89] \u201c The first Europeans to use enslaved Africans in the New World were the Spaniards, who sought auxiliaries for their conquest expeditions and labourers on islands such as Cuba and Hispaniola. The alarming decline in the native population had spurred the first royal laws protecting them (Laws of Burgos, 1512\u201313). The first enslaved Africans arrived in Hispaniola in 1501.[90] \u2026\u201d Therefore it\u2019s probably primarily Afro-descended/black (or significantly \u201cpart-black\u201d) Hispanics today, such as in the Caribbean (Afro-Cubans, Dominicans, blacks or mulattos in Puerto Rico, Afro-Hispanics in parts of South America like Colombia or Venezuela, etc) who are the bulk of the Hispanics who would likely have slaves in their ancestral family trees. Though some, perhaps \u2018many\u2019, mestizos (part-indigenous/part-European) possibly could have a slave ancestor(s) as well, if one went back far enough and was able to trace it. See also: Indian Slavery in the Americas From that link, \u201cModern perceptions of early modern slavery associate the institution almost solely with Africans and their descendants. Yet slavery was a ubiquitous institution in the early modern world. Africans, Asians, Europeans, and Native Americans kept slaves before and after Columbus reached America. Enslavement meant a denial of freedom for the enslaved, but slavery varied greatly from place to place, as did the lives of slaves... \u201cAs it expanded under European colonialism to the New World in the late fifteenth through nineteenth centuries, slavery took on a new, racialized form involving the movement of millions of peoples from one continent to another based on skin color, and the creation of a vast slave-plantation complex that was an important cog in the modernization and globalization of the world economy. Africans provided the bulk of labor in this new system of slavery, but American Indians were compelled to labor in large numbers as well\u2026 \u201cBoth before and during African enslavement in the Americas, American Indians were forced to labor as slaves and in various other forms of unfree servitude. They worked in mines, on plantations, as apprentices for artisans, and as domestics\u2014just like African slaves and European indentured servants. As with Africans shipped to America, Indians were transported from their natal communities to labor elsewhere as slaves. \u201cMany Indians from Central America were shipped to the West Indies\u2026 \u201cThe European trade in American Indians was initiated by Columbus in 1493. Needing money to pay for his New World expeditions, he shipped Indians to Spain, where there already existed slave markets dealing in the buying and selling of Africans. Within a few decades, the Spanish expanded the slave trade in American Indians from the island of Hispaniola to Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Cuba, and the Bahamas. \u201cThe great decline in the indigenous island populations which largely owed to disease, slaving, and warfare, led the Spanish to then raid Indian communities in Central America and many of the islands just off the continent, such as Curacao, Trinidad, and Aruba. About 650,000 Indians in coastal Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras were enslaved in the sixteenth century. \u201cConquistadors then entered the inland American continents and continued the process. Hernando de Soto, for instance, brought with him iron implements to enslave the people of La Florida on his infamous expedition through the American southeast into the Carolinas and west to the Mississippi Valley. Indians were used by the conquistadors as tamemes to carry their goods on these distant forays\u2026 \u201cBy 1542 the Spanish had outlawed outright enslavement of some, but not all, Indians. People labeled cannibals could still be enslaved, as could Indians purchased from other Europeans or from Indians. The Spanish also created new forms of servitude for Indians. This usually involved compelling mission Indians to labor for a period of time each year that varied from weeks to months with little or no pay. Repartimiento, as it was called, was widespread in Peru and Mexico, though it faded quickly in the latter. It persisted for hundreds of years as the main system for organizing Indian labor in Colombia, Ecuador, and Florida, and survived into the early 1820s in Peru and Bolivia\u2026\u201d ",
