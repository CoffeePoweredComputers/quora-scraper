            "answer_text": "You might remember studying about the Industrial Revolution in history classes, and discussing how steam motors and production lines changed the scene of European and American financial matters and society. Yet, hasn\u2019t that just happened once? The progression into creation innovation, which was completely not quite the same as the past, is likewise called the mechanical unrest. The new generation\u2019s innovations in a general sense changed the working conditions and the way people used to live. Below is the brief history about modern revolutions and where do we get ourselves now: 1st Industrial Revolution - Mechanical Production The First Industrial Revolution was started in the 18th century using steam force and mechanisation of production. In the beginning of 1760, through the introduction of steam machine, steam was controlling everything from agribusiness to material assembling.Society to a great extent used to be agrarian or can say, life was based on cultivating. But with the evolution of steam power, those agrarian societies adhere to urbanisation. They started to depend on steam power and machine devices, while steamships and railways changed how individuals got from A to B. This gave existence to the factory, a new development in the society.However, industrial life was troublesome. Untrained workers were modest and abundant. They were made to work extra hours, regularly in unsafe conditions. Even kids worked in manufacturing plants, placing in 14-hours move nearby grown-ups.Such conditions suffered into the 20th century. Eventually, propelling industrialisation made a white-collar class of talented specialists. Urban areas and ventures developed more rapidly than any other time, evolving the economy simultaneously.2nd Industrial Revolution - Science and Bulk Production The Second Industrial Revolution began with the discovery of electricity and assembly line production in the 19th century.Things began to accelerate with various key inventions. Development of gas motors, planes, compound compost, all helped us speed up and accomplish more.Head ways in science weren't constrained to the research centre. Logical standards were carried directly into the processing plants. Most prominently, the sequential construction system, which viably fueled large scale manufacturing.By the early piece of the twentieth century, Henry Ford's organisation was mass producing the revolutionary Ford Model T, a car with a gasoline engine based on an assembly line in his plants. Individuals followed employment, and the initial 1900s saw labourers abandon their pastoral homes to move to urban territories and production line occupations. By 1900, 40% of the US populace lived in urban communities, contrasted only 6% in 1800.Alongside expanding urbanisation, innovations for example, electric lighting, radio, and phones changed the approach of individuals lived towards technology. When you think about it, it was this 2nd industrial revolution, which was introduced to the advanced world.3rd Industrial Revolution - Digital Revolution The Third Industrial Revolution started during the '70s in the 20th century through restricted mechanisation utilising memory-programmable controls, and PCs.In early 1950s, during the 3rd industrial revolution, the semiconductors, centralised computer processing, individualised computing, and the Internet - the digital revolution came into existence.Simpler gadgets turned to computerised innovations, similar to an old TV you used to tune in with an antenna, being substituted by an Internet-associated tablet that lets you stream movies.The drastic shift from simple electronic and mechanical gadgets to attractive digital innovation disturbed the enterprises dealing in global communications and energy. Hardware and data innovation started to mechanise production and take supply chain worldwide.Since the evolution of these technologies, we have been ready to computerise the whole manufacturing process - without human support. Known instances of these are robots that perform programmed sequences without human intervention.4th Industrial Revolution - Industry 4.0 We are presently implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution, depicted by the application of data and correspondence advancements to industry, also known as \"Industry 4.0\".The fourth mechanical transformation is another era that gives a quantitative and qualitative leap in the association and the board of significant worth chains. This new phase of the industry is focused on prominent robotisation, network and globalisation, expanding on the improvements of the Third Industrial Revolution.It fuses various technological advancements such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, Virtual Assistants, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Chatbots, Big Data, Cloud Computing, modern design programs and process simulation, 3D Printing, 5G Telephony, autonomous vehicles, Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, Quantum Computing and more.Listed below are some of the latest technologies driving the Industry 4.0: Artificial intelligence (AI): It is the ability of computers to \u201cthink\u201d like humans \u2014 recognising complex patterns, processing information, drawing conclusions, and giving recommendations.IoT: It portrays the possibility of ordinary things \u2014 from therapeutic wearables that screen patient\u2019s physical condition, to vehicles and GPS beacons - being associated with the web and can be recognised by different gadgets. There are likewise numerous mechanical applications, for example, farmers putting IoT sensors into fields to screen soil characteristics and determine choices in terms of fertilisers.Robotics: It refers to the structure, assembling, and utilisation of robots for individual and commercial use. While we\u2019re yet to see robot assistants in every house, technological advances have made robots increasingly complex and sophisticated. They are used in fields as wide-extending as manufacturing, well-being and security, and human assistance.3D Printing: It allows manufacturing industries to print their own products at a lower cost, much faster as compared to the traditional processes. Additionally, in 3D printing, designs can be modified to make sure they are a perfect fit.If we talk about education domain, from letting teachers focus on building the psyches of students instead of checking copies, to fitting the learning procedure for every individual student, Artificial Intelligence is completely revolutionising the teaching and understanding process in education sector. Right now, a considerable lot of advances that individuals longed for during the 1950s and 60s, have now become a reality. Possibly we don't have flying cars yet, but we have robots! Likewise, when you put a portion of these advances all together, the developments are unpredictable and amazing. This is the beginning of incredible modern unrest: The Fourth Industrial Revolution, we head there straightaway!! ",

            "answer_text": "The Industrial Revolution was a time when the manufacturing of goods moved from small shops and homes to large factories. This shift brought about changes in culture as people moved from rural areas to big cities in order to work. It also introduced new technologies, new types of transportation, and a different way of life for many.  A Factory from the Industrial Revolution1886 by Arnold Greene Where did the Industrial Revolution begin? The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the late 1700s. Many of the first innovations that enabled the Industrial Revolution began in the textile industry. Making cloth moved from homes to large factories. Britain also had plenty of coal and iron which was important to power and make machines for the factories. How long did it last? The Industrial Revolution lasted for over 100 years. After beginning in Britain in the late 1700s it spread to Europe and the United States. The Industrial Revolution can be divided into two phases: First Industrial Revolution - The first wave of the Industrial Revolution lasted from the late 1700s to the mid-1800s. It industrialized the manufacture of textiles and began the move of production from homes to factories. Steam power and the cotton gin played an important role in this period.Second Industrial Revolution - The next wave took place from the mid-1800s to the early 1900s. During this phase large factories and companies began to use more technologies to mass produce goods. Important innovations during this period include the use of electricity, the production line, and the Bessemer steel process.When did it start in the United States? The early part of the Industrial Revolution in the United States took place in the northeast in the New England region. Many historians place the start of the Industrial Revolution with the opening of Slater's Mill in 1793 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Samuel Slater had learned about textile mills growing up in England and brought his knowledge to the United States. By the end of the 1800s, the United States had become the most industrialized nation in the world. Cultural Changes The Industrial Revolution brought about many cultural changes. Before the revolution, most people lived in the country and worked on farms. During the revolution, people moved to the cities to work in factories. Cities grew and became overcrowded, unsanitary, and polluted. In many cities, poor workers lived in crowded and unsafe buildings. This was a dramatic shift in the way of life for the average person. Transportation Transportation changed dramatically throughout the Industrial Revolution. Where before people traveled by horse, walking, or boat; new ways of travel were introduced including railroads, steam boats, and automobiles. This changed the way people and products were able to travel around the country and the world. Working Conditions One drawback of the Industrial Revolution was poor working conditions for people in factories. There were few laws to protect workers at the time and working conditions were often dangerous. People often had to work long hours and child labor was a common practice. By the end of the 1900s, labor unions and new laws began to create a safer working environment. Interesting Facts About the Industrial Revolution Many early factories were powered by water so they had to be by a river that could turn the waterwheel.A group of weavers in Britian who lost their jobs to large factories began to fight back by rioting and destroying machinery. They became known as Luddites after one of their leaders Ned Ludd.Printers were able to use steam power to print newspapers and books cheaply. This helped more people get the news and learn how to read.Some of the most important American inventions during the Industrial Revolution included the telegraph, the sewing machine, telephone, cotton gin, the practical light bulb, and vulcanized rubber.Manchester, England was the center of the textile industry during the Industrial Revolution. It earned the nickname \"Cottonopolis.\"Industrial Revolution Sunil Arts ",
