            "answer_text": "Yes, if you are asking about refraining from doing something GOOD, you are indeed sometimes responsible. In a practical sense most of us have a right to live our own lives in a reasonably happy manner. I can\u2019t fault you for not agreeing to live on a diet of seaweed, mealworms, and sunshine when you know that your more \u201ccomplex\u201d diet may be helping in its own small way to increase levels of starvation around the world. I cannot fault you for not giving up smoking because you are adding an extra .00000000001% of pollution to the world. I cannot fault you for having an entire comfortable house for your family rather than living in packing crate and sending your rent money to the \u201cHomes For The Homeless Foundation.\u201d We all have a right to make reasonably happy and fulfilling lives for ourselves and our loved ones. But do I have the right to live on/in a 500 acre 75-room mansion plot of land with my wife while telling the local homeless shelter that bills are tight this year and I can\u2019t give them my annual $20 donation? Do I have the right to fly in my private chauffeured jet from Philly to NY and back everyday for my job just because I like the status of living in Philly and the jet (with its attendant airport transiting) saves me just 15 minutes over taking Amtrak and lets me avoid seeing those smelly people sleeping on the vents outside the train station? I\u2019d feel of course that I have the right to eat a hamburger if I wanted to, but do I have the right to kill and eat one of the last 13 purple spotted koala bear cubs in the world just because I thought it might be an interesting taste experience? How about the right not to bother myself to tell you that you forgot to buckle the strap on the ski lift even though I noticed that the stabilizer (or whatever) was rusted through and there was an excellent chance I\u2019d soon be seeing you take a 500 foot fall? Heck, maybe I\u2019d even be looking forward to having a chance at Instagram fame by filming your accident! Would I have that right? How about the right not to bother calling the cops when I hear you getting stabbed and raped to death outside my windows because I\u2019m in the middle of a game of Monopoly and I really don\u2019t want to be bothered with your nonsense? Ever hear of Kitty Genovese? Take just a minute or two to listen to this song by Phil Ochs:  and then check Google for more on Kitty and her story. So\u2026 ARE you responsible for things that you DON\u2019T do? There\u2019s no one, simple, fits all sizes answer, but you damn well SHOULD be responsible at some level for others\u2026 or else you\u2019re not worth much yourself. MJM",

            "answer_text": "We are responsible, to an extent, for things that happened in the past, beyond our time, if we do nothing to rectify the damage these things did. Slavery is, of course, usually the \u201cthing\u201d that crops up in such discussions. Dozens of companies in business today made their first millions from the slave trade or other commerce having to do with slavery (insurance, etc.). Our ancestors justified slavery by using various passages from the Christian Bible. Much of what is seen today as racism is a direct result of the refusal of generations to surrender these harmful and hateful views of white supremacy and the justification of slavery. The violence worked upon young black men by white police is largely a result of stereotypes and racial bias handed down by society, in the form of discriminatory housing practices, segregated schools, voting prohibitions. If you see such behavior toward an individual motivated solely through the color of his skin and for no other reason, it is your responsibility to cleanse yourself of this irrational bias and recognize the harm done to those against whom such prejudice is directed by your actions.

            "answer_text": "I think the answer actually lies in the question. Are you responsible for something you did not do? That\u2019s like asking if you have to care for children that aren\u2019t yours. Whether you want to take the wrap for something that isn\u2019t your doing is completely up to you. What will you get out of it? Will it benefit you or hurt you? You should evaluate your reasoning behind taking the wrap. It can actually give you a grasp of the person you are (a journey that seems life-long for many). ",

Each person is responsible for their own actions. That being said, \u201cresponsible\u201d is a fairly general term and can easily entail things like: Obligations to try and stop others from doing things that are wrong. Playing a causal role in someone else\u2019s actions. Obligations to make right something that is wrong (whether the wrong was caused by you or someone else). These categories are things that you could be said to be \u201cresponsible for\u201d even if they aren\u2019t actions that you personally have taken. ",
