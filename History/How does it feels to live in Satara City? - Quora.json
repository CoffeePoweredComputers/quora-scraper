            "answer_text": "SATARA.. my hometown..the most peaceful place for me.. Satara is named from the seven forts which are situated close to it. My city has been gifted with greenary, calm and cool environment. Since it is my hometown, I always love spending time in my city..It feels really nice when you are sitting in your own house having a cup of hot coffee and watching rain through the window..how mesmerizing it is! Everyone loves their hometown whatever happens so I am,but satara has some twists n turns that i always fall in love with this city.. you will know in next paragraphs!! As i said earlier,my city is gifted with alot of greenary and some heavenly beautiful places that you must visit once in your life. The first place that comes into my mind is kaas plateau which is also known as valley of flowers.Now it has became world's Natural heritage site where you can find endless varieties and different species of flowers and plants. It is biodiversity hotspot for various types of seasonal flowers and numerous species of butterflies too. It has more than 850 species of flowering plants.These include orchids,shrubs,carnivorous plants and many more.The best season to visit is mostly monsoon more specifically August and September..The next place is kaas lake which is located on the south of kaas plateau surrounded by the dense forest. It is the perfect place for picnics where you can chill with your friends and family. Moving forward the next place is thoseghar waterfalls, one of the most marvellous creation of nature. In monsoon because of the heavy rain, the falls look more spectacular and the surrounded area is calm and with dark woods..i really love such places.the vajrai waterfall, around 22 km from satara is the India's second highest plunge waterfall. so to keep away your tensions,worries and stresses you must visit my hometown. The another reason to feel proud about my city is its historical side..satara was founded by chhatrapati shahu maharaj in 16th century and was the seat of shahu maharaj. It has ajinkyatara fort..basically the satara is located at the foot of ajinkyatara fort..The other one is sajjangad fort which the final resting place of samartha ramdas. It is popular place for pilgrimage. The city includes chaar bhinti,natraj mandir which is beautifully constructed temple of lord mahadev and kshetra mahuli which is also known as dakshin kashi,a holy place.. perfect location for shooting..It gives immense pleasure after paying visit to such complexes. My hometown is kinda interesting for food lovers..kandi pedha is the famous sweet of satara..There are lot many halwais n methaiwalas which will give u the best kandi pedhas ever..The another chatapata place is rajwada choupati. This is place where every satarkar loves to eat paanipuri,shevpuri,ragdapuri,bhelpuri n many more..It also includes good quality hotels n caf\u00e9tarias. Satara is full package of awesomeness.. Now a days satara is the town of retired n old age people because there are not much opportunities for career n higher studies so the young boys n girls and also the working people leave satara for the further studies n good career opportunities. so i did the same thing ,I left satara after 12th for further education n to make my future more better.. But when ever i came to my home for weekend or for vacation i enjoyed those days with my full heart\u2026The best stress relieving place for me is my hometown..I can enjoy even if I'm alone in my home.. because there's something in every breeze of my hometown which is so fascinating . To sum up, satara is my happy n most favourite place and always will be..you should try and visit satara for once atleast..satara is the best place to aviod all the tantrums,hustle and bustle which we regularly face in our big cities..it is the perfect place for meditation\u2026for self motivation..It is the best mood booster Thanks for reading.. have a great day ahead!

            "answer_text": "Ever imagined to live in a city where you can enjoy the crowd of people as well as the calm of nature whenever you want? If yes, then you should definitely visit Satara. I bet, if you ever come to Satara, you wont feel like leaving.  (image: an early winter morning in Satara) I was born in Pune but brought-up in Satara. So, I guess, I know quite enough about Satara.  (image: Ajinkyatara Fort of Satara) Satara, earlier known as Sapt-tara(meaning a land surrounded by seven mountains), has many tourist attractions like the famous Kas plateau, Thoseghar waterfall, Sajjangad Fort, Chalkhewadi wind energy farm, etc. and some less popular places or recent tourist attractions like Vajrai Waterfall. Trust me even if you stayed in the central part of the city and decided to cover all the beautiful places in one day it would be a hard-to-do task. I mean there are many surprising places for even residents like me in spite of living here for more than almost two decades. Some pictures from the internet and my phone gallery.  (image: Kas plateau in the evening)  (image: Krishna river of Dhom Dam, Wai)  (image: Kas plateau, UNESCO\u2019s World Natural Heritage Site, in the months August-October )  (image: You get to see monkeys on the way to Kas)  (image: Clicked while we were searching the road to Vajrai Waterfall)  (image: The famous \u201917 number\u2019 formed by the street lights of Satara)  (image: Vajrai in monsoon) The famous city spots include Rajwada Chaupati, Rajpurohit Sweets, Char Bhinti, Powai Naka to name a few. I have definitely missed out many things above. Satara is much more than this. Hope this answers the question. ",

            "answer_text": "Ever imagined to live in a city where you can enjoy the crowd of people as well as the calm of nature whenever you want? If yes, then you should definitely visit satara. I bet, if you ever come to Satara, you wont feel like leaving.  (image: an early winter morning in Satara) I was born in satara and grow up in Satara. So, I guess, I know quite enough about Satara.  (image: Ajinkyatara Fort of Satara) Satara, earlier known as Sapt-tara(meaning a land surrounded by seven mountains), has many tourist attractions like the famous Kas plateau, Thoseghar waterfall, SajjangadFort, Chalkhewadi wind energy farm, etc. and some less popular places or recent tourist attractions like Vajrai Waterfall. Trust me even if you stayed in the central part of the city and decided to cover all the beautiful places in one day it would be a hard-to-do task. I mean there are many surprising places for even residents like me in spite of living here for more than almost two decades. Some pictures from my phone gallery.  (image: Kas plateau in the evening)  (image: Krishna river of Dhom Dam, Wai)  (image: Kas plateau, UNESCO\u2019s World Natural Heritage Site, in the months August-October )  (image: You get to see monkeys on the way to Kas)  (image: Clicked while we were searching the road to Vajrai Waterfall)  (image: The famous \u201917 number\u2019 formed by the street lights of Satara)  (image: Vajrai in monsoon) The famous city spots include Rajwada Chaupati, Rajpurohit Sweets, Char Bhinti, Powai Naka to name a few. I have definitely missed out many things above. Satara is much more than this. Hope this answers the question. ;-) Source-my phone gallary. ",
