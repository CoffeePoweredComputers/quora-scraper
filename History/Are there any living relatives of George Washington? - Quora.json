Long live Paul Emerson Washington, 82, of San Antonio, a retired regional manager for a building supply company. Paul Washington is the one among 8,000 possible Washington descendants that the chief family historian at Genealogy, Family Trees & Family History Records believes would currently hold the crown \u2014 had there been one. \"He kind of won the sweepstakes,\" said Megan Smolenyak, with the genealogical research group. George Washington had no children. He had an older half brother, Augustine, and a younger brother, Samuel. Many descendants died young or as lifelong bachelors. Other Washington descendants had only daughters, Smolenyak said.\u201d There\u2019s more, but knowing that the family had 8000 descendants is impressive - they just weren\u2019t direct descendants of George ",

            "answer_text": "You would not like this.. George Washington did not have any legal children. He was married to Martha, who was a widow and had children from her previous marriage but could not get some of George, It is not well known but George did flirt with other women but he probably did not go that far. However, there exist unproven rumors he had a black mistress and a child with her but i can not verify this and it is probably not true.... The real Washingtons are descended from George\u2019s relatives, not of himself. You will be amused that these bloodlines crossed those of the Bonapartes. Somewhere in the South there is a pictureperfect Great House of a lady who was one of them. Of course the house was updated to look more royal.. A certain British noblewoman, Lucinda Lambton, went on a tour in America, also for the traces of royalty in the United States. The 3 part TV Series was shown on the BBC around two decades ago. That is why i know of this. ",

George Washington did not have any children, so there are no direct descendents of George Washington alive today, and never have been. (2) Yes! Almost anyone can trace his/her documented lineage to somewhere on George Washington's documented family tree, by climbing his tree upwards a few generations and then coming back down again. I mean, if you think about it for a moment, everyone can trace his or her lineage to any other person's family tree, if you go back far enough; we are all related to each other. Geni.com  has traced all the Presidents to Washington's family tree, for example:  ",
