            "answer_text": "In short-term effect it was a failure, while for long-term effect, it was a success. Short-term effect 1857 Revolt shook the British government initially but got suppressed. It considered as a failure because of Limited territorial and social base. No all India territories were engaged in this Revolt. The Southern, Eastern and Western part of the nation remained more or less unaffected. And, even in northern parts, certain classes and groups didn\u2019t join it. In fact, joined from British side and worked against the revolt. Those who promised to support, backed off when needed support.Resources were limited. The sepoys were poorly equipped materially as they were fighting with swords, spears and limited guns and muskets. While, the other side was equipped with latest and advanced weapons. So, they got upper hand over the Indian Soldiers.Lack of leadership and no coordination. As it was more of the revolt of Sepoys and accompanied by peasants but the interest of revolt for both were different. So, it was missing coordination between two and even leadership wasn\u2019t that active as it probably be to coordinate the groups and lead it with one purpose. All fought independently rather than fighting as team.No Support of Certain Classes. The struggle was poorly organized, so the educated and middle class also not supported the revolt. In fact, the Zamindars or Tehsildars worked against them and in support of British Government. They worked in their personal interest. So, lack of common goal caused no support of certain classes and led to a poorly organized revolt.While, it was a success from a long-term effect as it established local tradition to resist British Rule and paved the way for Modern National Movement. Though many were fighting in their regional interests, yet it brought Indian people together and taught them the significance of being unified and work as a team, as a one nation rather than with regional interests. And, that\u2019s why it also named as First War of Independence by many Historians. ",

            "answer_text": "The First war of Indian Independence (British calls it as Sepoy Mutiny) was a failure. British took a bloody and inhumane revenge on the participants of the war and innocent Indians. Over the long term, we must not see a war in light of victory or defeat. The seeds of Australia and New Zealand was sown in the disastrous battle of Gallipoli. Hindus and Muslim Soldiers fought together under the Mughal throne and demonstrated to British that India have will and capabilities to fight foreign rulers. It was for the first time when Mughal Emperor became the leader of Common Indian.India got so many great heroes like Rani Lakshmi Bai, Bahadur Shah Zafar, Mangal Pandey, Begam Hazrat Mahal, Babu Kunwar Singh etc. Till the time India exists, the names of these heroes will be taken with respect and gratitude.This war forced British Government to take direct control of India and the crown rule was somewhat better than that than of East India Company.A few months back, my 4 years old niece asked me to tell the story of Rani Lakshmi Bai and then I realized that these heroes will always remain alive in our memories. We all have grown up hearing the stories of that war. During my childhood, I had memorized the great Hindi Poem \u201cJhansi Ki Rani\u201d by Subhadra Kumari Chauhan and I always had a sense of proud whenever I used to read it. This was the first war in which there was some sense of Indian nation (although many Kings participated for their own personal benefits). Yes, these brave men and women may have lost the war but they won a greater war of creating an awareness for freedom and within 90 years Britain had to leave India. ",
