            "answer_text": "Laws of Jim Crow Blacks were excluded form all newspapers and from trading. Negroes gradually lost jobs in government, which they gained after the Civil War. Whites owned the land, the police, the government, the courtrooms, the law, the armed forces, and the press. The political system denied blacks the right to vote. Murders were conducted in secret and in public by white men. The blacks were harassed and abused, physically and verbally. These violent acts became a part of their life. Signs were put up to separate facilities saying \"whites only\" and \"coloured\" or \"Negroes\" appearing on parks, toilets, waiting rooms, theatres, and water fountains.
