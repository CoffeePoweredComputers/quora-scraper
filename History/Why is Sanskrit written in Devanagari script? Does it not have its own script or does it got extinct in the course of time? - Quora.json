            "answer_text": "Sanskrit on its own doesn't have a unique script. The Vedic Language[1]which is the precursor to the Sanskrit that we use today was supposed to have developed as a scriptless, spoken language alone. The Vedas were transmitted orally for millenia and not written down. When things started to be written down, various scripts like Brahmi[2], Kharoshthi[3], Sharada[4], Siddham[5], Ranjana[6], Newari[7], Tirhuta[8], Tigalari[9], Sinhalese[10], Nandinagari[11], Bhaikshuki[12], Nagari[13]etc were used over time. The Devanagari script used today to write Sanskrit the most evolved from the Nagari script. Other than these, scripts from other languages outside India were also used to write down Sanskrit. Tibetan[14], Phags-pa[15], Galik[16], Turkestani[17], Burmese[18], Thai[19], Khmer[20], Tai Tham[21] etc are the major ones. Today, Sanskrit is also written using the scripts of regional languages like Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali etc.[22] Due to globalization of Sanskrit, a variation of the Latin script called the IAST[23]is also used widely to write down Sanskrit.
