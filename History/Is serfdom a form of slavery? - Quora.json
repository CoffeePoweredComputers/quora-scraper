            "answer_text": "I can gives you the legal answer. Slaves have no rights. They are-litterally-moving objects. They MAY have some kind of protection, because their master MAY have some kind of obligations, but basically, they are cattle. Serves do have legal rights. The owner of their land have obligations toward them. They could bring him to justice (and often had the help of the Church for that). Serves were basically minors (like Children and women). They couldn't do whatever they want (like free men), but you couldn't do whatever you wanted to them. Basically, serves were bonded by contract to the owner of the land. He owned them a number of service, and they owned him a part of their production and a numbered days of work (tax). Serves lived in close-knited communities, and lived well in time of peace. Lots of free men joined serves communities to have a better life, and the protection of powerfull Landlords. ",
