            "answer_text": " Image courtesy wikimedia commons fair use Sir Albert Howard is considered the Father of Organic farming. Although there have been recent attempts to include other early developers of Organic methods equal \u201cco-founder\u201d credit. It\u2019s probably merited since our modern sensibilities are to give credit to women where credit is due. Lady Eve Balfour probably deserves credit just as much as Howard. Even Howard\u2019s wives were competent botanists in their own right (He was widowed and remarried) and probably contributed significantly to early organic methodology. The third guy Rudolf Steiner, wasn\u2019t originally a developer of organic. He instead developed something called biodynamic agriculture. It wasn\u2019t until many years later that the two terms gradually merged and came under the umbrella of organic agriculture. But now that they have generally merged, it can now be confidently stated that actually Steiner came up with biodynamic several years before Howard came up with Organic, and it turns out Lady Balfour actually borrowed from both, but applied a more scientific approach to biodynamic than did Steiner, who had no science background at all.

            "answer_text": "Walter Ernest Christopher James, \u201cLord Northbourne\u201d, in his 1940 book, \u201cLook to the Land\u201d, first used the term \u201corganic farming\u201d [1] [2].   In the same year, Sir Albert Howard, published a much acclaimed book on the topic of \u201corganic farming\u201d. The book was titled, \u201cAn Agricultural Testament\u201d [3] [4] [5].   Now, it all comes down to subjectivity. Many critics, call Lord Northbourne the father of organic farming, especially by citing that he first used the phrase, \u201corganic farming\u201d, while advocating against the inorganic or synthetic modern techniques. Many critics, on the opposite side, call Sir Howard the father of organic farming, alluding to the possibility that many imperfections in the modern agricultural industry can be done away with, by the implementation of his teachings.
