            "answer_text": "As Dimitris Almyrantis points out both the Muslim world and Christian Europe changed with time which means the comparison changes with time. No European court was more opulent than the 17th century Mughal Court. On the other hand I also think it is relatively accurate to state that Italy surpassed the most developed regions of the Muslim world in the early 13th (potentially late 12th) century, but if you were to ask when Norway surpassed the most developed regions of the Muslim world we would have to look several centuries further. It is also important to note that prior to the age of discovery Europeans had little contact with Islamic lands further east in Asia. In fact direct contact between civilizations east of the Euphrates was rather limited before then. Italian ships in the 13th and 14th century sailed into the Black Sea where at places like Caffa they had contact with the Mongol established terrestrial silk road (and thus central Asia), but by and large Europeans were just part of the Mediterranean civilization continum. Furthermore one has to ask what things one measures when asking when A surpassed B. Are we looking at economy, military, technology, natural philosophy (science) or which middle class peasant had the nicest house. If you would ask me to distill the above factors into one metric of \u201cdevelopment\u201d and if you were to ask me to only compare France, England, Italy, (Southern) Germany, Spain and the Low countries to the Muslim polities in North Africa and West Asia I would say that those Christian European lands (rather than the whole of Europe) pulled ahead of the Levantine, Egyptian and Mesopotamian centers of civilization in the 13th or early 14th century; between say 1260 and 1340 AD an observer travelling through both lands would notice a difference. Though much later than that something like the Ottoman Empire would rather dramatically assert its military dominance against surrounding Islamic lands and Eastern European Christians. A really broad metric simply makes comparison hard and the more you narrow it down the more quantitative and qualitative analysis becomes possible. ",

            "answer_text": "The final rise to domination of Western Europe - and hence, Christian countries, can be dated exactly to 1683, when the (Muslim) Turks retreated from their siege of Vienna. They were never afterwards to go forwards, although they stopped Peter the Great of Russia in 1711, the long decline was underway. Shortly afterwards and independently the (Muslim) Mughal Empire in India started to unravel after the death of Aurangzeb in 1707. The powerful Safavid dynasty of Iran finally fell in 1736 and by 1800, Iran and nearby areas were a quarrelling mess. Meanwhile Western Europe stopped fighting itself over religion (the last full Catholic vs Protestant battle was at Aughrim in Ireland in 1691) and started to extend its powers beyond simple trading ports around the world (with the exception of the previous Iberian domination in south and central America). So take 1700 as the pivotal point. By 1800 the only Islamic power, the Ottoman Empire was a weak mess, being picked over by others. But you can also use 1700 as the point where Europe stopped being defined by its religion and became politically secular. It is fair to say that, while western Europe rose to dominance, \u2018Christian\u2019 Europe was completely gone by 1800 - dominated by secular, revolutionary France under Napoleon. ",
