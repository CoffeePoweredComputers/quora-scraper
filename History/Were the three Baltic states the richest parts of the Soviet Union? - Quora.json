            "answer_text": "In Soviet Union, the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were the most prosperous. However only in contrast to the rest of USSR they seemed to be richer. Comparing to the most advanced countries like Monaco, United Emirates, Norway or Luxembourg they would still look poorer (maybe not visible signs of poverty but less average income). Those three countries also were the only ones in USSR that experienced a glimpse of capitalism (1918 - 1940) and were kind of intergrated into Western Culture. They also had a history directly associated with Western Europe. Therefore they appeared to be looking very different from all other republics, with their striking Western architecture, science, literature, art and so on. These countries were also populated with people that looked somewhat like Western Europeans - whiter, taller complexion. \u201crichest\u201d is very broad definition in your question. It all depends what are you comparing it to. In USSR, which wasn\u2019t very rich by defaut, Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were doing really okay, and it considered as a \u201ccool\u201d thing to be from there or to go there for vacation - the only Eropean experience that Soviet Union could provide at the time.

Beautiful cities, clean streets, even clothes and shoes at shops were different, like European ones. I\u2019ve heard the same about Lviv, but I haven\u2019t seen it and have nothing to compare. ",
