            "answer_text": "Although lots of places find mention in mahabharat and folklore attributes specific events to such places there is no historical proof that can be confirmed by archaeology as such some of this can be attributed to several centuries of neglect of Hindu culture through external rulers of other faiths that ruled india for over 1000 years again, given that the original text of the epic comprised only 6400 verses which over the years were expanded to now a common version of 100000 verses adds an extra dimension of whether the epic is about history, maybe a very small part is and the character and story was expanded to provide us a text on the Principles of Dharma ",

            "answer_text": "There are none..Most scholars believe Krishna died in 3102 BCE, I.e. approx 5000 years ago. Do not I have used the word believe. They believe but havent been able to prove conclusively with scientifically verifiable physical evidence. So when we are unable to prove evidence of existence of Krishna 5000 years ago yet how do we prove anything about Mahabharat Whatever available today in public domain is purely circumstantial and taken as a matter of faith not as a fact. However researchers and scholars haven't given up. If the government supports research with permissions protection and funds who knows we may be able to convert what is faith to a fact tomorrow ",
