            "answer_text": "That is a big question with a complicated answer. China and the United States have had a fairly strong relationship which began as early as 1787. Things got a bit messy during world war II as the US saw the opportunity for internal strife and an external enemy as an opportunity to squelch communism. Things just didn\u2019t work out as planned. However, the US spend and lent 10s of millions of dollars in military resources to assist China and continued, through 2003, to give aid to the hungry in outrageous sums of money. That year the United States gave the majority of China\u2019s aid donations of US$1.3bn, or ~$1 per person. Most forget that the per capita. And in 1992 the US opened immigration to Chinese with the student protection immigration act: S.1216 - 102nd Congress (1991-1992): Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992 China has risen so quickly over the past 10 years, they forget that the country was taking handouts to help feed its people up until just recently and the US has been the majority of those donations. Most also forget the 1994 \u201cpatriotism\u201d movements where much of China's history from WWII through Tiananmen Square was heavily revised to create a strong communist party narrative and textbooks rewritten or banned. Today, empire building on lands/reclamation at odds with neighbors due to an old map is an ongoing issue. Most in the region would like to see Great Britain or the Dutch bring out their older maps and see those older claims of sovereign control enforced just for fun. It would highlight the ridiculousness of China\u2019s stance in conjunction with the World Court\u2019s findings for China\u2019s neighbors. Then there are issues with rule of law. No one that has interest would have to be reminded of trademark and patent infringements or human rights violations, kidnappings/abductions. The one country, two systems promise that mainland made to Hong Kong looks to be in revision. China is proving to the world that 1) it doesn\u2019t understand the importance of a developed market onramp to China; and 2) it is unlikely to keep its word or written agreements. Read the May 3rd minutes of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China Hearing on the Hong Kong Model for better understanding of where US lawmakers stand on this international commitment made by China. Why is it that Chinese military pilots will buzz American military, but I\u2019ve never read of the reverse? With China\u2019s technology and services economy (referred to as China 2.0) not yet in a position to drive the economy, why hasn\u2019t the party come out strongly against upsetting those still feeding the manufacturing side of China 1.0? This lack of foresight, yet a call into the US during the selloff in 2015 asking for guidance, is confounding and ridiculous. China\u2019s ridiculous, childish, responses are also wearing on the US\u2019s nerves. Remember lead paint on over 1 million toys (2007), tires that came apart prompting a recall of 500,000 units(also 2007), and poisons found in Chinese produced dog food imported to the US just a few years ago? Usually, within a month China will claim something similar from a US import. Yet, the US products tested at manufacturing source, as well as those stopped and sampled enroute during shipping, test negative for those claims. Furthermore, when a Chinese national is caught spying in the US, China finds a need to fabricate a mirror incident (not a specific item to US & China relations however). Just recently, Sandy Phan-Gillis, a US citizen and resident of Houston, Texas, of Chinese ancestry, was arrested in March 2015. She was held, tried and convicted of espionage and deported April 29th of this year after being held in jail for over 2 years. Her passport stamps proved she wasn\u2019t anywhere near China during the period in which the communist government accused her of spying. Silly and childish tit-for-tat that other countries seem to execute by arresting actual spies making their efforts not as childish as China\u2019s. If the relationship between the US and China sours further, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me. Indeed the sanctions about to be placed on N.Korea, and any who violate these sanctions, will put China in a difficult spot as one of the sanctions would bar any country supporting N.Korea from entering US waters and US ports. The two countries truly need one another and should show the world solidarity in dealing with N.Korea and forming a better relationship going forward. My wife and I will continue to be the example of how the US and China can get along AND make beautiful children in the process! My \u201chalf breed\u201d American/Chinese child was the only non-Chinese student in her school and 1 of 2 in the entire ESF system of schools in Hong Kong, to receive an award in Chinese education achievement receiving a 1st and 2nd in the 2 categories of awards. Maybe the combination creates a superior being!  ",

            "answer_text": "Because it has a competition and the potential to lose its No. 1 status in the world. Do you know how much the U.S. benefits from being No. 1? Its currency is the most wanted currency in the world, and 64% of the International Monetary Fund is currently in U.S. dollars. Aside from the U.S., there are dozens of other countries and territories in the world that uses U.S. dollars as its currency (i.e. Ecuador, The Bahamas, Palau, Zimbabwe, Panama, Timor-L\u2019este. This only happened because U.S. has the largest global economy and the most traded currency.It pretty much \u201cruns\u201d the largest and most powerful military alliance in the world - NATO, and it pretty much has no issue dominating any part of the world, with the exception of China.There are few countries in the world that the U.S. cannot influence, and those that it cannot (i.e. North Korea, Iran, Venezuela) have some sort of ties with China. Basically, if it weren\u2019t for China (and to some degrees, Russia), those countries don\u2019t dare to defy the U.S.Russia and China are the only two countries in the world where their military have some sort of chance in dealing significant and colossal damage to the U.S., and a war between U.S. vs. Russia/China would mean damage (socially and economically) to Americans at home. For Russia, as it\u2019s a much, much smaller economy compare to its Soviet days, is less of a problem. Russia\u2019s economy is also heavily Europe-based (for energy), thus an economic sanction would mean big trouble for Russia. China, however, is completely different.Economic sanction against China would cause devastation to the world\u2019s economy, and the common goods\u2019 prices would skyrocket back home.China\u2019s economy is not only driven by exports, but it is also much more endemic, so sanction against them won\u2019t work as well.Basically, China cannot be controlled by the U.S., and it influence many others. In addition, it\u2019s a fearsome competitor militarily and economically for the U.S. ",
