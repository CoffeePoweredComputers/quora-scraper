The people running his campaign likely are gathered from the countries finest group of WEAK LINKS. TOP OF THE BOTTOM CREAM OF THE CRAP they stopped because the out come is dismal either way so\u2026 I.magine an elderly man hobbled by the rapid decline of his mental capacity. That man running for president consults with his staff daily by closing his eyes and dreaming of holding court in a nearby playground his second grade staffers lining up to sit in his lap to whisper their ideas while his spindly fingers dance around garanimals snaps osh kosh bgosh suspenders and the closed eyes of the parents that voted for him. If he is elected i suspect Larry Silverstein of the World Trade Center demolision fame will be on hand to comment on his untimely demise saying \u201cWell Joey just took too much damage so i gave the order to just PULLEM\u2026 hes gone \u2026NEXT QUESTION.

Then he would look like three shades of a dipshit. Talking about a dead president like that. I don\u2019t think it was Joe, but someone in his campaign had a really good idea there. I don\u2019t think the idea that he might die ever entered into Trumps head. He\u2019s like that, and so far he\u2019s gotten away with it. It\u2019s things like this that drive his detractors absolutely nuts! Why didn\u2019t Trump stop his ads? Why should he? He\u2019s was the one with the virus. ",
