            "answer_text": "I have always believed that the academic disciplines which constitute the humanities are among the most important of all human activities. In studying human culture, one must accept not only that the ultimate goal of the endeavour - an objective understanding of what is - will always be unattainable, limited as we are by senses and language, but one must accept also that it is nonetheless necessary to deal with this incomplete evidence and these flawed interpretations using scientific methodology to arrive at a rudimentary understanding. It is my belief that of the humanities, history is by far the most complex. In the study of history, one must not limit oneself to what is but delve even deeper and attempt to understand what was - a seemingly infinitely harder topic, and one which is made all the more onerous by the fact that a historian's materials are narrower and more limiting than those in almost any other field, as valuable information is lost with the passage of time. Yet still we proceed with the impossible; why? Because history is the most important of all the humanities in that it provides context to the is and to every is that has ever been: in history lies the progression of humanity, and only through history can we understand poetry, theatre, music, art, politics, economics and even language.  History exists to explain what we are today and why we are so. ",
