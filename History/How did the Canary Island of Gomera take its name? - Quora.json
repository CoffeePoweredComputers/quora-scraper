            "answer_text": "The name comes from the aboriginal name for the island, transcribed by some as \u201cGhomara\u201d. The origin of the name isn\u2019t clear, although some think it may be related to the berber tribe of the Ghomaras from the north of Morocco, although as far as I know there is no definitive evidence. Worth mentioning that the Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera (off the Mediterranean coast of Morocco where the Ghomaras live) also bears that name. I personally think the theory is plausible since the original inhabitants of the Canary islands were related to the Berbers, but given the lack of written records of their language and the poor historical records from the Castillian conquest of the islands it won\u2019t be possible to be completely sure.
