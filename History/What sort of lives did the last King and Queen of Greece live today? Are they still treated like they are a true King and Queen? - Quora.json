            "answer_text": "I met the former Greek King 2 years ago. We was invited to a concert where I was playing in the orchestra. Constantine , *former* King of Greece, was a persona non Grata for a long time in Greece, after his expel. Finally, he was granted permission to enter the country, if he would get a surname just like all civilians (as you know, members of royal families do not use surnames, however he has one: Glucksburg). Being a smartass, he chose a different surname: Degrecia, which means \u201cof Greece\u201d, so his whole name is Constantine Degrecia, or Constantine of Greece. Apart from some old radicals that want him to reign again, he goes unnoticed for the biggest part. He comes just as a very rich man, with his or some businessman\u2019s yacht, and passes some time in Greece every summer. After the concert, I was able to talk to him, let him meet my daughter, even troll him a little bit, by letting my daughter call him \u201cYour Majesty\u201d and bowing to him, while a friend of ours was filming with his iPad :) I consider him to be a living piece of my country\u2019s modern history, a rather insignificant one though. His wife is a cute old lady just like any rich british grandma, and his children are all married to rich families and are running their own businesses. Maybe in England they are called Prince and Princess by those who know and want to lick their asses a bit. ",

            "answer_text": "There are a few in Greece that treat them with respect. They are both members in varying degrees of the Danish Royal Family of princely rank. Constantine is a close friend of Prince Charles and is baptismal patron of Prince William, so they are not out of similar company. I once saw a YouTube video where the King was relaxing in Athens, and some people came up to greet him in a friendly way, but the majority of the Greeks are not favorable to a return of the monarchy in most views.The leftist Papandreou dynasty does not like him, and they still have much power, and many Greeks actually liked the dictatorship of the colonels, according to an opinion poll a while ago. Constantine is still an honorary member of the Olympic Committee as a former gold medal winner in sailing. More than that, you will have to ask some different Greeks. ",
