            "answer_text": "Q: Were Scythians Mongoloids like many Turkic people, or did they look like Iranians? Scythians were groups of nomadic people who roamed large swathes of lands for a few centuries. So it is difficult to imagine that they were a monolithic nation looking the same and speaking the same language throughout the time. I am going to give you a quick rundown on them as the information about them, although in fair amount, is very scattered. You have to remember that they sparsely populated their lands. It means that you could have run deep into their lands for days in and days out without encountering one of them if you had chosen your paths carefully. As a matter of fact, this was their tactic to take in the enemy\u2019s armies in their infertile lands, get them tired and bogged down and then decimate them. What\u2019s the point in all I am saying here and how are these relevant, you might ask? Here is the point: It all means that any other group of people with different looks could have penetrated into their land, staged an attack on a third sovereign land, and the Scythians would have been recorded and described in history as the perpetrators of the attack in history. I say this because different historians of different times described them differently. That\u2019s how fluid things were back then. For all intents and purposes, Scythians spoke Iranic languages and are regarded as Indo-European people for most part. it is quite conceivable that eastern Scythians were mixed with the Turkic and Mongolians whereas the western ones were more Eastern European looking. It is also quite conceivable that in the course of time, as the Turkic and Mongolian tribes started pushing westward, Scythians went through a transition. Their relationship with the Iranians dynasties were always problematic. A common theme in the pre-Islamic Iranian history is that the Persian kings had to pause a battle in the western frontiers (or use an already existing break) to stop the Scythian assaults or run a military campaign to settle scores with them. Scythians were not a settled civilization but warrior nomads. They were a force to be reckoned with by everyone around them. It is still believed by many historians that Cyrus I was fatally wounded in a battle with them. This account of Darius I and his military offensive against them which almost cost him a total loss is worthy of a read if you are interested to know more about their tactics. ",

They are considered Iranic and indo-Europeans and were never Turks or Mongolians. They ranged from modern day Ukraine to Siberia and Iran. the term Scythians generally refers to the nomadic Iranian people who dominated the Pontic steppe Scythian, also called Scyth, Saka, and Sacae, member of a nomadic people, originally of Iranian stock, known from as early as the 9th century bce who migrated westward from Central Asia to southern Russia and Ukraine in the 8th and 7th centuries bce.

They also supplied the Sakas who dominated Central Asia by the middle of the first millennium BC. The Scythians themselves were essentially the same people as these Sakas - simply their westernmost groups spread across what is generally now southern Russia and Ukraine. They were more often recorded by Greeks rather than Persians (although certainly not exclusively), but in essence both names almost certainly come from the same original word, whether 'Saka' or 'Scythian' (which may mean 'knife' or 'sword' - see feature link, right). Their land became known to the Greeks as Scythia, and that name easily outlasted the political and cultural unity (if such a thing existed) of the Scythians themselves. It was still being used in the fifth century AD to illustrate the advance of hybrid Indo-Iranian/Turkic tribes into the Pontic-Caspian steppe. The Scythians would also seem to have dominated the early Slavs, prior to their outwards expansion following the collapse of the Hunnic empire. Slav origins have generally been pinned to the area between the Middle Dnieper and the Bug, both well within Scythia. By the fifth century BC when that domination is heavily suggested by Herodotus, the Scythian and Slavic languages may still have been mutually almost-intelligible, rather like Italian and Spanish today. Conversations may have been heavily sprinkled with 'huh?' and 'what?' of course, but the meaning would have been grasped. The Slavs were never turned into Scythians. Instead they were always subjugated peoples who were ruled by an Indo-Iranian elite in the form of the Scythians. They would seem to have been the farmers for whichever nomad group was in command of the region, right down to the Huns of the fourth century AD. ",
