            "answer_text": "If I answer your question as an originalist; meaning sticking to the question literally, then we can possibly add presidents who were not the elected candidates. First is George W. Bush. The Supreme Court decided that he would be president. We might possibly add John F Kennedy. There were many irregularities in Cook County Illinois and Nixon might have successfully challenged the results if he had chosen to. We can't forget the ignominious election of 1876. A committee was formed to decide who won. I recommend you read what a carnival that election was. In a number of states whoever was in charge of the election commission threw out votes and gave the candidate of  their party the electoral college votes. Tilden won the popular vote by a fair margin. But the fraud that tarnished that election makes it very possible that Rutherfraud B Hayes was not really elected. ",

All others have been elected at least once, including by the Electoral College after losing the popular vote in five cases. Of those, Ford was never elected Vice President either, and is the only President who was never elected President or Vice President. If also counting situations where someone lost the popular vote but still won the electoral college vote, add John Quincy Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, Benjamin Harrison, and possibly until 2020, Donald Trump (George W. Bush won the popular vote in 2004, so he would not be added in this scenario. If Trump wins the popular vote in 2020, he would fall off this list as well.) ",
