            "answer_text": "Antibiotics (like penicillin) all work to take out a bacterium by a variety of different warfare tactics. In the case of a STREPtococcus infection, a drug like penicillin works by interfering with the bacteria\u2019s ability to synthesize their cell wall. As times moves on, their cell wall weakens as it can\u2019t make the connections to stay firm. Eventually, the cell wall breaks causing the bacterium to essentially explode thereby killing it. ",
