            "answer_text": "In Mein Kampf there's a surprisingly insightful quote on the nature of pseudo-intellectuals and intellectual dishonesty:  The more I argued with them, the better I came to know their dialectic. First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary, and then, when there was no other way out, they themselves simply played stupid. If all this didn't help, they pretended not to understand, or, if challenged, they changed the subject in a hurry, quoted platitudes which, if you accepted them, they immediately related to entirely different matters, and then, if again attacked, gave ground and pretended not to know exactly what you were talking about. Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again. But if you really struck one of these fellows so telling a blow that, observed by the audience, he couldn't help but agree, and if you believed that this had taken you at least one step forward, your amazement was great the next day. [He] had not the slightest recollection of the day before, he rattled off his same old nonsense as though nothing at all had happened, and, if indignantly challenged, affected amazement; he couldn't remember a thing, except that he had proved the correctness of his assertions the previous day. Sometimes I stood there thunderstruck. I didn't know what to be more amazed at: the agility of their tongues or their virtuosity at lying. I like this quote because, seriously, haven't we all met someone like this? In fact, if we're all being completely honest, haven't we all occasionally done this? I suppose that's the danger of intellectual dishonesty. It has a certain seductive quality that even the most intelligent person can fall prey to. Although that's just about the only thing in Mein Kampf that approaches an intelligent thought. The rest is just...does anyone know the German word for \"rambling gibberish\"? ",

            "answer_text": "I will admit that, for all his faults, Adolf did push the German people to levels of achievement, beyond any ones wildest dreams. He showed the German military how to strike, so fast, called the \"Blitzkrieg\", that no one had time to respond to an attack. He pushed for the development of high-speed road ways, which, we now, call \"highways\". He pushed forward rocket development, which, after the war, allowed the US, and Soviet Union, to develop effective, long-range, missiles. Beyond the military, though, I cannot think of one, intelligent thing, the man ever did. Ofcourse, the public should remember that he held the German people hostage, to his whims, while chasing \"immortality\". ",
