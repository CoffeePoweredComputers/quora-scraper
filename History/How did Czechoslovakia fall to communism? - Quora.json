            "answer_text": "It was the culmination of long time trend of leaning our country to the left. The communist party had good position before WWII, and because of the Munich Agreement - Wikipedia there was high disillusionment in Czechoslovakia from the West (France, Britain, and Germany with Italy), while on the other side, USSR maintained good image and finally its army liberated most of Czechoslovakia. Communists were also active in the resistance against Nazi occupation. It resulted in Communist party\u2019s victory in the last free election in 1946 - they earned 38% of vote and created coalition government; then they nominated their people to the various important posts (leadership of army and police). All this prepared a playground for the coup in 1948 (starting with a political crisis and demission of non-communist ministers) that led to the new communist government; this new government get 230 (100%) confidence votes in parliament. (In detail here: 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat - Wikipedia), So, basically, Czechs (mainly, because Slovaks voted for commie in much lesser degree) elected the Communist party in 1946 in free election, and they managed to monopolize their power for the next 40 years. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t a regime that was forced to us from USSR, we established it mostly from within (probably as the only country from the former Eastern bloc), and the compliance and cooperation with the regime was also high till the end in 1989 when we only followed the suit of neighbouring countries.
