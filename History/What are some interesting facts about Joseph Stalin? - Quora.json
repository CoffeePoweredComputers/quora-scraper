            "answer_text": "Stalin was born with a birth defect. The second and third toes of his left foot were webbed and he was so insecure about it that when his feet were later being examined by his Kremlin doctors, he hid the rest of his body\u2014and his face\u2014under a blanket.He suffered from smallpox as a child and had pockmarks because of it. One of his nicknames\u2014and an Okhrana (Tsarist secret police that hunted revolutionaries) code name for him\u2014would be \u201cChopura\u201d (the Pockmarked). As a dictator, he had his pockmarks powdered by his bodyguards and removed from the official photos.Both of his parents beat him mercilessly - especially his drunkard father, Beso. Besides smallpox, he suffered multiple illnesses as a child. A childhood accident permanently damaged his left arm which disqualified him from draft and WWI.His mother wanted him to be a priest and with a great effort she managed to enroll him in a seminary in Tbilisi. That\u2019s when he read the Origin of Species and works by Karl Marx, which turned him into an atheist and a Marxist, respectively.He was an accomplished poet in Georgian, published several times in the leading newspaper of the day. He also sang in the church choir, painted well and acted in plays.As a revolutionary, he was the chief fundraiser of Bolsheviks. He organized bank robberies, protection-rackets, extortion, and kidnappings. He organized armed robbery in Tiflis in 1907 where the revolutionaries killed 40 people and stole over 200 thousand rubles (millions of dollars today). In 1913, Tito, Trotsky, Freud, Stalin, and Hitler all lived in Vienna. Besides Vienna, he has also visited London and Paris among other cities for meetings with his comrades. The apartment where he stayed bears this plaque. Stalin was quite a womanizer, sometimes dating girls as young as 13 and 16 and fathered children out of wedlock.In 1904, he courted a Georgian girl Nina Gurgenidze, asking her to marry him. She married a lawyer instead. The lawyer husband was shot in 1937.He had an extraordinary memory and never forgot any slights or rows. In the early 1900s, he was badly beaten by Chechens on the orders of a Baku oil tycoon. In the 1940s, he ruthlessly deported entire Chechen nation to Central Asia (Krushchev let them return after Stalin's death). To be fair, Chechens rebelled during the German invasion. Besides, he also victimized Poles and Koreans with whom he barely had any contact before the Revolution. In total, he deported a staggering 28 million, many of whom never returned.Stalin was a poor orator and not an impressive writer. However, he was an extremely skilled backstage politician adept at making allies. Trotsky: \u201cStalin was very valuable behind the scenes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe did have the knack of convincing the average run of leaders, especially the provincials.\u201dMost common punishment in Tsarist Empire was an administrative exile up to 5 years, very few people were hanged or sentenced to hard labor. Stalin was exiled multiple times to Siberia and he escaped most of the time. The exiles received an allowance from the Tsar\u2014twelve roubles for a nobleman such as Lenin, eleven roubles for a school graduate such as Molotov, and eight for a peasant such as Stalin\u2014with which to pay for clothes, food and rent. When Lenin was exiled he brought his wife and mother-in-law with him to care for him and even hired a maid. It was quite different from Stalin\u2019s own murderous Gulags.In 1915, Lev Kamenev, a fellow Old Bolshevik, gave Stalin The Prince by Machiavelli as a gift. In the 1920s, Stalin removed Kamenev from power, using principles laid out in the classic. In 1936, Stalin started the Great Terror with the show trial and execution of Kamenev and his pal Zinoviev. Stalin was already Machiavellian enough but this should still win a prize as one of the dumbest gifts ever given to anyone.Koba in the Planet of the Apes films is named after him. It was a protagonist of a Georgian novel who fights against Russians. Stalin picked it as one of his many nicknames during his revolutionary activity.He was an ethnic Georgian. His birth name is Ioseb Jughashvili. Ioseb is Iosif in Russian. Iosif is Josef in German since \u201cI\u201d is \u201cJ\u201d is German. And Josef is Joseph in English. Joseph, as pronounced in English, has nothing to do with his real name. Stalin means \u201cman of steel\u201d in Russian. It was one of his many nicknames which stuck because he wrote an important article under that name, liked the meaning and sounded similar to Lenin.",

            "answer_text": " This Georgian Satanic figure is considered as the worst killing machine of all times and was responsible for the death of over 27 Million people which includes over 20 Million of his own men. He was none other than Joseph Stalin, worst dictator of all times yet he is the one who transformed the so-called \"Peasant\" country to a \"Superpower\"! Here are some of the astonishing and unknown reality behind this man.  1.) Stalin, The Man Of Steel : He was born in Georgia, which was a part of the Russian Empire and his birth name was Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili. His father was a cobbler and his mother was a maid and due to his poor background eventually he dropped out of school. He participated in movements in his young age and was sent to exile. Later on, he changed his name to Stalin, meaning \"Man Of Steel\".   2.) Lenin and Stalin: He was considered the right hand of Lenin, and rose to power afterwards. He rose to highest party commands and after the death of Lenin in 1924 became the undisputed leader by sending his closest competitor, Trotsky to exile. Trotsky was later killed by an assassin sent by Stalin.According to a testimony of Vladimir Lenin, Lenin never wanted Stalin to be his successor.  Stalin(L) with Lenin(M) and Trotsky 3.) His Reign Of Terror: He abolished all kind of religious practices, beheaded priests and the primitive practice of Orthodox was put into shadows. If someone who was to be worshiped, it was Stalin as it was mandatory for everyone to have his photo hung in their house.  4.) Industrialisation and eventual famine: Stalin extensively focused on Industrialisation trying to transform Russia and in the process but meanwhile, the population in the countryside(which was about 70%) were worst hit. Small peasants were forced to give their lands and those who opposed were taken care of and deported to camps. While there was no food in Russia, Stalin was exporting tonnes of commodities. Camps were just a replica of Hitler's concentration camps, in fact, much harsher.   5.) He was miles away from being a \"Family Guy\" : Stalin's second wife Nadezhda Alliluyeva started questioning him for famines and terrible rural situation but this act made no effect on Stalin and later he killed her, but in an Official statement according to the government she died of severe medical issues. His elder son, became a Prisoner Of War, after an initial attack from Germany. Later on, when Germany tried to negotiate for the exchange of his son in return of a German General, he refused the offer and his son was eventually sent to concentration camp in Germany and was killed.Stalin left home at a young age and during his empire went to see his mother only once and even did not attend her funeral.   6.) Biggest Irony: He was nominated for Noble Peace Prize that too on a couple of occasions.  Despite being such a great paragon of vice, he is still considered to be a holy figure in Russia by many and he truly is the face of making Russia a Superpower. Source: My Blog ",
