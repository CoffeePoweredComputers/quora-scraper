            "answer_text": "This is a hard question that invites a lot of controversy. There are, unfortunately, many people who have axes to grind. They spring up to offer answers that are more ideological than historical. But there are a few things we do know that encouraged this discovery that we now call \"the scientific method\" to occur precisely in Europe. 1) Somewhere in his Summa Contra Gentiles (I forget exactly where), Aquinas gave the green light to scientific investigation of natural phenomena, even saying it would be helpful to missionary efforts to explain, for example, the cause of lightning, that it is not the anger of a god. 2) This freedom to investigate was taken advantages of by the Franciscans whose investigations into physics showed something was not quite right with Aristotle's physics 3) Galileo uses these results to build on with his own experiments, which looked even more like the modern scientific method. 4) Hook and Boyle followed similar methods in mechanics and chemistry. 5) Finally, Newton, with both his Principia and his Opticks, gave an even more stellar example of the success of the method, giving what is nearly the perfect statement of the method in the second book (Opticks). So that is pretty much what happened, why did it have to happen in Europe? Each of the steps was taken by Europeans, but that does not answer it. What does answer it is that both the freedom to do the inquiry and the interest in it were found only in Europe. ",

            "answer_text": "This is a hard one to answer, as it wasn't only Europe, but rather in several places over several points in time, but it was the same pattern repeating. The Egyptians were the 'first' most scientifically advanced, then the Greeks, and these latter advances were swallowed and greatly improved upon by the Romans... but the fall of the Western empire, and the rise of Christianity, put an end to that. In the meantime, the middle-east was making enormous progress in astrology and medicine (while Europe was in the dark ages)... but the rise of Islam put an end to that. China was way ahead of the game, but I frankly don't know what happened to their advances (feudalism?), so can't really comment on that, but I am a Confucius fan... oh, and there's the Byzantine continuation of Roman architecture (that later influenced 12th-century European architecture)... Anyhow, what followed was a general stagnation until schisms within Christianity (largely caused by a state-instigated promotion of education (a transformation of trade guilds into 'teacher and student' ones, whose education was appointed to the most literate of the time, the clergy) and the Vatican 'allowing' the populace/clergy to study the ancient Greeks) began to loosen their hold (voir 'ban') over non-religious expression... and the Reformation definitely undermined that absolute authority, allowing the study of sciences to spread even wider and more openly (although church denounciations and (religion-fuelled) public 'outcries' (as religion was still the still-rather-mob-mentality 'status quo' then) were still many). Post-enlightenment Europe was simply the first to 'free' its freedom of inquiry, so of course they had a 'head start' over the rest. ",
