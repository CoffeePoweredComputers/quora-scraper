            "answer_text": "Wes Frank offers a table of \u201cofficial\u201d numbers, and this is surely the basis for an investigation on the matter. Much harder is to account for those executed on the spot, without any trial. As far as Italy is concerned, an undefined number of executions happened during the retreat after the collapse of the front (Battle of Caporetto). Specially in-famous is the role of Gen. Andrea Graziani, general inspector of the Army during the retreat. He was given by the Army Chief of Staff, power to order executions according to his judgement, which he zealously did. At least 30 executions are recorded as directly ordered by Gen. Graziani. The most famous case was that of the killing of private Alessandro Ruffini. The 24 old private, at the passage of the General on a road, stood on attention while keeping a cigar in his mouth. The shooting order was given and executed on the spot. The case came to public knowledge after the war through the mother of Ruffini. Gen. Graziani remained unaccountable. A few years later, in 1931, the now old Gen. Graziani \u201cfell\u201d from a train. The official inquiry established very quickly that it was an accident, when in darkess the General mistook the exit door with that of his first class compartment. This has little credibility as the body was found several metres away from the rails, like if he jumped or was thrown out with a great force. Also, the doors are very different\u2026 The fascist regime didn\u2019t want a further investigation on a \u201cwar hero\u201d, but it is common belief that someone had a revenge on the well known butcher. It is also worth noticing that a number of summary executions were not recorded. Officers preferred to record a death due to shelling or accident to avoid any inquiry. While the comrades knew the real cause of the victim\u2019s death (often picked randomly among the ranks), they could hardly access the documents and didn\u2019t even know about the false reporting. This is mentioned in several personal diaries. ",

            "answer_text": "If you consider encouraging soldiers to kill themselves, and forcing suicides for defeated \u201cdishonoured troops\u201d, then Japan's your man. A close second would likely be USSR, however the mass killings of retreating soldiers was a lie. granted, some troops had machineguns placed behind them, but these were penal battalions, made up of criminals and men who had previously retreated, and let me tell you, they weren't inclined to ever retreat again. Might as well make a certain death, a meaningful one. Generally when troops retreated, the officers in charge were punished, being demoted, sent to penal battalions or in some cases, executed. Generally only outright traitors would actually be shot. In regards to things like the holodomor, there isn't much definitive evidence to suggest an intentional starvation, and regardless of political standing, an unbiased opinion is the best one to have. You've gotta remember that many of us live in countries saturated with antirussian and anticommunist propaganda for the best part of 80+ years now, of course stalin is going to be a psychopathic monster and have murdered millions of his own. That said, I would wager that the USSR overall executed the most troops (second to Japan, as I include forced/encouraged suicide as just a cheap form of execution), not due to their barbaric nature, but due to the logistics. The USSR was made up of many nations, including Russia, who has always been a massive, well populated nation (Think about it, what's one of the best ways to keep warm on those cold siberian nights? ;) ), and had the largest army in the entire world over the span of ww2. The Russians and other nationalities who fought for the red army were mostly fanatically patriotic for their nation, and viewed Stalin as a saviour who helped stop Russias involvement in ww1, brought the entire nation into the industrial age and in their eyes, restored the Russian Empire, just under a shiny new, red and gold brand. Sorry for the long winded answer, I just feel like Russia always gets a bad rap, and despite Communisms downfalls, people have to see that it certainly had its necessity and advantages at the time.
