            "answer_text": "The most shocking outcome I can think of is the following, but realize this isn\u2019t a wish; it\u2019s just a shocking scenario: As President Trump recovers from COVID-19, Joe Biden contracts the virus. He\u2019s in the high-risk group and he dies from it. The \u201cnever Trump\u201d people wonder: \u201cWhy did we select somebody so old? Kamala Harris tries very hard in public to not look elated at the prospect of becoming president. People complain that they want to change the vote they mailed in, because they say that now that it\u2019s Trump vs Harris, they\u2019d rather change their vote of Biden and Harris to one of Trump and Pence. They are told \u201cnothing can be done about it.\u201d Kamala Harris chooses AOC to be her vice-president. SJWs spontaneously begin having multiple orgasms at the very thought of Harris/AOC winning the election. The other side reacts in their own way: Every gun in every store in the country is sold over the next few days. Survival gear and books are sold in astonishing numbers. People wonder how Biden got the virus when he had been so incredibly cautious. Something just doesn\u2019t seem right. Then one morning newspaper headlines read: \u201cAOC implicated in intentionally infecting Biden\u201d! Holy shit! It turns out AOC is sick with the virus! There is some evidence she may have gotten herself intentionally infected just after passing a test for COVID-19. Allegedly, she had a friend who was sick with it give it to her so she could then infect the much older Joe Biden. When questioned, AOC says: \u201cI won\u2019 t dignify that deplorable lie with a reply. \u201c Tensions across the country skyrocket. In Chicago, a militia group annihilates a group of almost 70 people who were looting and burning stores, wiping them out with their massive arsenal of guns. One member of the militia is interviewed and states: \u201cWe\u2019re just doing what the Democrat mayor either wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t! The days of Law and Order are back! Can you feel it in the air\u201d? Kamala Harris is asked about the Chicago incident and says: \u201cThose virulently toxic males have strengthened my anti-firearm convictions. If the people elect me I will ensure that America becomes a country where guns are outlawed - anyone who doesn\u2019t hand all their guns over the government will be considered an outlaw.\u201d AOC, miraculously recovered, joins here at a rally where she declares: Although we are Democrats, we prefer to be referred to as the \u201cReparation Party.\u201d Election day is chaos as fanatics on both sides pick fights with anyone who doesn\u2019t look like they think the same way politically as they do. Early polls show Democrats leading Republicans by a slight margin. Then the tide turns and Republicans start voting en masse. Pence says that this turnaround is as if it\u2019s \u201cThe Hand Of God - first striking down Biden and now inspiring Republicans to vote in numbers that shatter all previous records\u201d! A around 11:30 PM on election night, news networks around the country say that a definite winner can now be declared. The winners are: Donald Trump and Mike Pence! ",

            "answer_text": "For me, it would be either this:  Or this:  Now, I am a Biden supporter, but even I acknowledge that the President has a more than plausible path to 270 Electoral College votes right now, as does Biden. I do believe the Biden-Harris ticket does have an edge right now and would indeed win if the election were tomorrow, but given the polarisation of current US politics, especially at the presidential level, a huge landslide of either major party nominee, Trump or Biden, would surprise me greatly. As much as I would be ecstatic at a Biden wipeout, I can equally see it is just not going to happen. Biden is not going to win Indiana or Louisiana, just as Trump is not going to win Vermont or Maryland or DC. In terms of my personal opinion, right now I do think the election in the Electoral College arithmetic will come down to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona (I think FL and NC are likely to back Trump and MI is leaning increasingly Biden). I would range Biden\u2019s win if he does from anywhere from this (a Biden scrape):  To this (Biden\u2019s best-case realistic scenario):  And equally I would range President Trump\u2019s win if he does from this, a razor-thin EC win for him:  To this (simply the 2016 map and a pick-up in NH):  On a final note, as of 12 September 2020, what I actually think it would end up as if the election were held tomorrow:  So to answer the question briefly, I think a major landslide (of say 400+ Electoral College votes or even 350+ Electoral College votes for either side would surprise me immensely, especially a Trump win of such magnitude).
