            "answer_text": "In one word: Chaos. All psykers are very much in tune with the warp, and constantly hear voices from across the veil, usually deamons. Weak psykers can unknowingly let themselves be possessed, or simply fall to chaos, either way: there will be deamons. The Imperium has roughly three categories of psykers: those who are too powerfull(Beta or stronger), those who are too weak, and those who are just right. The two first groups is offered either to the Golden Throne or to the Astronomicon, both using psykers as fuel. The ones that are middling are given training, and eventually become sanctioned psykers, or they die trying, and even sanctioned psykers usually has someone around to shoot them in case they start to act odd, say chaotic or if they loose control, there is a reason guardsmen refer to psykers as \u201cbolt magnets\u201d. Those psykers deemed to weak will never be able to controll their powers, nor protect themselves from warp influences, and are as such deamonic accidents waiting to happen, ticking bombs so to speak. Those who are too powerful might not randomly explode, but they are essentially walking super weapons, as well as they attract more attention from the warp than their lessers. Many either become possessed, or become curious of what the voices tell them, and we know where that ends. It is worth mentioning that humanity can produce Alpha+ psykers, but Beta or higher are simply not stable, and will cause disaster, some relatively stable Beta, and even Alpha has made their way into Inquisitorial service, or become space marines, the Grey Knights being composed mostly of the \u201ctoo powerful\u201d category. Ok, so what makes psykers so feared? Unchained psykers are disasters in waiting. During the age of strife, when Slaanesh was being born, psykers started apearing on human worlds all over the galaxy, and they weren\u2019t around before that. They were powerful and unstable, resulting in plenty of deamonic incidents, or mage kings rising to power, like Prospero.. Many worlds that wanted to survive developed religions, or just murder cults, to handle psykers before they could become a danger to society at large, this is also part of the reason why the Imperial Truth is secular, as the Emperor, an Alpha+, knows well the dangers of the warp. While all psykers are feared and reviled by the Imperium at large, the Imperium couldn\u2019t function without sanctioned psykers. Most human psykers can do one thing, say telepathy, but not telekinesis, or vice verca. It seems most sanctioned psykers are telepaths and they make up the Imperiums communications system, acting as psyker phone networks. They also make due as emergency navigators, as a psykers witch sight permits them to see without sight, and navigate the warp to some degree, with a major risk of exploding from the stress of gazing into the warp of course. Psykers are hated, and feared, with good reason by the Imperium, most world having developed a culture of hate to survive the Age of Strife, as wandering super weapons that can explode into deamons at a moments notice, or break all laws of reality with a flick of the wrist, are simply too dangerous. Sanctioned psykers are instead treated with unease, and distrust, as they are vital to the Imperiums survival, while still being at the mercy of the warps many dangers.  ",

            "answer_text": "Two reasons: Psykers are subject to the tithe of the black ships. Everyone who knows about the black ships is terrified of them, and there are stories suggesting that some worlds even offer up people who are not psykers just to have something to give when the ships come calling. Thus, psykers are associated with the terrifying ships and the freaky sisters of silence who come to collect them (who are psychic nulls said to make normal folks extremely uncomfortable just from being in their silent presence).Much less well known is the fact that any psyker can serve as the gateway for a daemonic incursion that devastates the area surrounding the psyker, potentially overwhelming the entire planet unless the gateway is closed, I.e. the psyker is killed. Dealing with this kind of problem is pretty much the entire job of the Grey Knights chapter of space marines. It must be said, however, that (at least until fairly recently in the 40k storyline) the average citizen of the Imperium would know nothing about daemons or the chaos gods whatsoever, so this is not the reason for antipathy from most of the population - they are being kept in the dark in order to avoid widespread panic (although the cat is probably out of the bag for a lot of Imperial worlds close to the Great Rift). This is, however, the main reason for the Imperium\u2019s leadership\u2019s extreme focus on identifying, locating and capturing or killing all unsanctioned psykers that appear among its numerous worlds.",
