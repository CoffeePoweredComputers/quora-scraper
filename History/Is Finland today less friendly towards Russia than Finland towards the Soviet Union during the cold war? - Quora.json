            "answer_text": "\u201cIs Finland today less friendly towards Russia than Finland towards the Soviet Union during the cold war?\u201d In my eyes that\u2019s a funny question. Finland is so small compared to Russia that Russia shouldn\u2019t even be interested of our friendliness or the lack of it. Instead I feel it quite essential to think about Russia\u2019s friendliness towards Finland. (Finland is that green stain on the corner of Russia.)  Finland\u2013Russia relations We have a long tradition to fear Russia. It\u2019s not really relevant to compare the Cold War era and Putin\u2019s era, that\u2019s a short time after all.Finland was a part of Sweden for 600 years and it was the Swedish buffer zone towards Russia. When Sweden and Russia had a war, it was often fought on the Finnish ground and the Finnish consciousness has a centuries long experience that the war and destruction come from the east. Yes, I know that it\u2019s kind of contradictory, because Finland was colonized by Sweden and they were often Swedish wars against Russia, but we had so long history under the Swedish rule that the Finns didn\u2019t feel it as colonialism. We were really an integral part of Sweden without a specific Finnish consciousness. Especially the Russian occupation of Finland during the Great Northern War has shaped the Finnish consciousness: the Russians even robbed the Finns and sold them to be slaves. Finland during the Great Northern War We also know that the time under the Russian rule was good for Finland\u2019s development to a nation, as a whole. There were however the periods of russification and they are remembered well in Finland even though we know also that Russia actually gave us our independence. So, in the long term, we have always been a buffer zone, first for Sweden and later for Russia and as a buffer zone, we can\u2019t just be friendly by heart, because the next time there will be a conflict, we\u2019ll very likely find ourselves in that role again. Russia is friendly to us as far as we stay neutral, which means, as a part of the buffer zone. I have understood that Russia sees us as a part of it\u2019s current buffer zone against \u201cthe west\u201d and Sweden probably still sees us as a buffer zone against \u201cthe east\u201d. Are we more friendly now than we were 30 years ago? Probably we are, because the USSR had stronger pressure in Finland than Russia after that. But both are still just parts of the same continuum of eastern pressure. It\u2019s sometimes weaker and sometimes stronger, but I don\u2019t see it going away. This is my personal opinion from the Finnish point of view, and if I have any facts wrong I\u2019m ready to learn more. ",

Finns have never been really friendly towards Russians - it is despite the fact that russians respect Finns immenselly and Russian Empire provided a lot for shaping Finland as an independent country more then hundred years ago /ofcource to the extend to which it was possible those times towards a regional autonomy within Empires those days/, so Finns treat russians today not worse not better then in Soviet times - in my opinion they just despize russians as they always do it /for that they will answer to the God one day/ ",
