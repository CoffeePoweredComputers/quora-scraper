            "answer_text": "Middle Ages - Wikipedia Dark Ages (historiography) - Wikipedia John Cabot - Wikipedia Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral - Wikipedia The Medieval Period or Middle Ages are generally accepted as being between the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD and 1492 AD, when the Americas were discovered (accidentally) by Christopher Columbus. Now it could be argued that the period between 476 and 1066 are the Dark Ages: that was between the fall of Rome and the Norman Conquest of England after the Battle of Hastings. However, much recent scholarship has made it clear that the so called Dark Ages were by no means as \u201cdark\u201d as they were thought to be originally. The millennium is usually divided into several different periods, as you\u2019ll see by the article. The High Middle Ages are generally thought of as being between the end of the 10th Century to the arrival of the Black Death (1000 AD to 1348\u201350). The decline of the Middle Ages and Feudal Period is counted (in England anyway) as beginning with the Black Death and proceeding to the end of the Wars of the Roses, when Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. Seven years later, Columbus arrived in the Western Hemisphere: by 1497, John Cabot was exploring the east coast of Canada. By 1500, Pedro Alvares Cabral discovered Brazil. From that time (1500 onward) the modern period of history began. ",

            "answer_text": "Middle ages were abut 500\u20131500. In the beginning there were events like adoption of Christianity in Rome 380, fall of Rome 476 and even beginning of Islam 622. As you can see the change was not immediate. People at the time did not see: hey now the middle ages has began. At the end there is renaissance which began in the 14th century, the great discoveries especially discovery of Americas 1492 and the sea-route to India 1498, and the reformation which began in 1517. Other facts were widespread use of firearms and increased power of central governments over feudal lords. In fact the term was adopted during the renaissance to point the time between antiquity and renaissance. A similar insulting term is \u201cGothic architecture\u201d. Goths sacked Rome in 410, they did not build cathedrals. It should be noted that people often associate things that belong to early modern age to middle ages like the witch hunts. They mainly happened in the early modern era in the Protestant countries. People also confuse formation (16th century) with the enlightenment (18th century). They think reformation meant a secular world and freedoms. Not so, in 1608 Sweden enacted the laws of Moses. They used the Bible as a law book. So when people now say,m Islam needs reformation I laugh as the got it in the form of ISIS. ",
