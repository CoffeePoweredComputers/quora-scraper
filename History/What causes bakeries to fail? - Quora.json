            "answer_text": "Hey Aydee,  Interesting question.   First let me say that my only experience with bakeries is that they are a great place for pastries.  What can cause a bakery to fail are similar to the causes that make many businesses to fail.  There can be a number of distractions that can cause the owner of the business to lose focus on the success of the business.  In no particular order they could be: Losing sight of the purpose the owner had for opening up the business,being distracted by wearing too many hats in the business,having unrealistic expectations on the outcomes of the business,not physically capable of managing the business, not having the right equipment to successfully execute the plan of the business,or, not have the right people or support to making the business successful.These distractions are just a broad stroke of why a bakery, or really any business, would fail.  It actually takes a conversation to determine what a particular person's challenges would be in making their business successful. I hope this is helpful.  Mark ",
