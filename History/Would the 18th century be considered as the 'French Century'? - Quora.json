            "answer_text": "As an American, I would have a hard time answering yes. The French fought the British multiple times-The War of Spanish Succession was a draw-but really the British destroyed any chance of primacy the French hoped to achieve. The War of Austrian Succession or the War of Jenkin\u2019s Ear if you prefer, was one in which the British wound up with colonial victories. Overall, while the French had military success, in the Peace of Aix la Chapelle, they gained little. The 7 year\u2019s war wound up as an unitigated French defeat. They lost across the board. The British strategy was very successful. The War of American Independence, looks like a British defeat. But after Yorktown, Britain won some colonial engagements and really suffered little other than in terms of prestige and in the pocket book. And then we come to the Wars of the French Revolution-perhaps one might best regard them as affairs of the 19th century. In any event, they left the British as the arbiter of the concert of Europe. Did the French enjoy some other form of hegemony in the 18th century. There would be those who might argue that the age of Englightenment was a French sponsored project. Was the French Revolution important outside of France-that is clearly a hard question because it soon lead to war and ultimately to Napoleon. While the 19th century saw the hegemony of Britain, and the 20th century was the American century I would be hard put to call the 18th century that of the French. ",

            "answer_text": "Maybe in the eyes of some of the French it would be considered there century. France fumbled the ball in the 1700\u2019s. They lost Quebec, yes they helped in the American Revolution but spent vast sums of money building Versaille. The latter so the royal court could better contain threatening politicians. France by the time of the revolution was broke. Quebec was essentially ignored till it was to late. The Mississippi valley was profitable but like Quebec was under populated by French citizens. Many of the Hugenots were forced to leave and several ended up in Prussia and South Africa. French fur traders in the USA did well with the help of the Indians. Still the traders did not get a lot of help from Paris. ",
