            "answer_text": " The socio-political phenomenon of nationalism, like psychological narcissism, is entirely natural, ubiquitous, and can even be advantageous, but it is ultimately a form of political immaturity and a cause of delusiveness, violence, and an inability to adapt effectively to the world. A nationalistic society, like a narcissistic individual, plays out a falsified and idealized version of itself, or rather of the \u201cnation,\u201d the people with whom it identifies. Whatever is meant by \u201cthe nation,\u201d this is never something that is based in empirical reality, but instead is always an ideal drawn from myth and imagination and fed by shame, fear, resentment and other highly reactive emotions. Like the falsified ego to which the narcissist sacrifices reality, the nationalist lives in service of this fictive ideal at the expense of reality. The cost can be tremendous, for this idealization entails repression of all that contradicts the ideal (\u2014all cultural, ethnic, linguistic, and religious minorities) as well as aggression in the face of anything that would challenge it. What\u2019s more, since it is so crudely fictive, it creates an impoverishment of cultural and political life. There is now one national narrative, one history, one tradition, one people. It thus belies the true reality of the people and in doing so suppresses the pluralistic and dynamic cultural forces that make for its actual life. But clearly the worst consequence of nationalism is its propensity for war and other forms of violence. As George Orwell points out in his famous essay \u201cNotes on Nationalism,\u201d the nationalist \u2014 much like the narcissist \u2014 tends to be someone who thinks largely in terms of comparative prestige. The nationalist, energized by \u201cpride\u201d and the insecurity that always lay behind it, is an inherently other-obsessed \u2014 and aggressive \u2014 personality. So, as natural and useful as it may at times be, nationalism, especially in its unchecked form, does seem to be a pathology of the collective mind, \u201can infantile disease\u2026 the measles of mankind,\u201d as Einstein described it. It is no coincidence that both Orwell and Einstein lived in times that demonstrated the horrific potential of nationalistic thinking.  It is worth mentioning, if only as a coda, that nationalism is quite distinct from patriotism. The patriot \u2014 like the person who accepts, respects, and dutifully cares for himself \u2014 is someone who need not be out of touch with reality. Neither need he be especially aggressive towards others. But the nationalist, like the narcissist, has gone sadly down the path of delusion and pathology, and, in the end, fails to either accept, respect, or properly care for the supposed object of his love. What\u2019s more, he is most decidedly not a good neighbor. He lives in the grips of a fantasy based in great desperation and, if necessary, he will gladly defend that fantasy with violence.   ",

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t think it is a disease of the mind, rather it is an example of a once useful trait, acquired during the early stages of evolution, reaching the end of its usefulness and becoming, in contemporary jargon, counter-productive. The tendency for animals to form groups of various sizes and characteristics, whether herds, or packs, or flocks, is a fundamental characteristic of inherited behaviour. Once humans began to develop their amazingly high intelligence, acquired language, and began to compete with other species, they continued the grouping behaviour but added to it the beliefs and knowledge common to their particular group, or tribe. Some of the knowledge was based on information about their environment acquired over 1000s of years, but some of it was based upon their equivalent of old wives\u2019 tales, and the emergence of ritualistic \u201creligious\u201d thinking. As human history progressed, tribalism began to operate on a much larger scale and conflicts that would once have played out in a few days became prolonged and destructive \u2014 warfare and nationalism grew hand-in-hand. Today we have reached a point where it has become very clear that nationalism in its extreme forms is a threat to the survival of the whole species. The arsenal of weapons now available, if employed, would decimate humanity. Organisations such as the UN have made a serious effort to contain the problem, but because most of us have a strong feeling of national identity their effects have been limited. Something that was once natural and which promoted survival has now become a problem that needs to be confronted. Increasing numbers of citizens have now accepted the idea in principle. Clear and obvious threats such as global warming and the coronavirus show dramatically that we need to overcome our natural but divisive tendencies to identify with smaller social units, and learn to regard ourselves as part of humanity as a whole.
