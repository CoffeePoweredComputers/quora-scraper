            "answer_text": "Yes, most definitely! Their aims are similar, perhaps even identical. But one has to read the Republic with discernment to see this. The little-known subtitle of the Republic is On the Just Man. Its central concern is how to obtain happiness or blessedness. The answer is found in development of the ethical virtue of righteousness (dikaiosune). This is also a central message of the New Testament: But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness. (Matt 6:33a). In the actual Greek, the word for righteousness here is dikaiosune. All or most of the discussion about civil politics in the Republic is an allegory; the real topic is the governance of ones soul: by passion, or by virtue? If we are ruled by passion, our soul is like an unruly city. Harmony of soul, like harmony of civil politics, comes by aligning ones will with God\u2019s will. Plato\u2019s ethics involves four cardinal virtues (Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence and Justice/Righteousness), while the New Testament adds to these the three theological virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity.

Plato, through Socrates, says this: \u201cThen we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to anyone, whatever evil we may have suffered from him.\u201d (Crito) This approaches the Golden Rule: \u201cTherefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you: do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets\u201d (Matthew 7:12) ",
