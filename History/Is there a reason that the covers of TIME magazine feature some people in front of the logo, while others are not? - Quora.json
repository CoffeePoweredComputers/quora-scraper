            "answer_text": "I can\u2019t speak for TIME, but having designed numerous covers for three different magazines, I can offer an opinion that I\u2019m willing to wager is correct. It comes down to the actual image chosen and the cover design. (One might have also assumed it depends on who the cover personality is and how well-known they were, but a look through the TIME archives tells me that assumption is incorrect). Rather than cherry-pick covers, a good place to start is the TIME Vault, where you can see pretty much every cover the magazine has ever published. Here, for example, are the thumbnails for covers for 2014, 2015 and until May 2016 (click to zoom in):  The key thing to look for is how well defined the edge of the element being overlaid on the TIME masthead is. (The element is usually, but not always, the head). If it\u2019s a crisp edge \u2013 such as the complete head being used \u2013 chances are it will be overlaid, like in these examples:  If, however, the face is being \u201cbled\u201d off the page (that\u2019s design-speak for part of the face being cropped), then it will almost always go behind the masthead, like with these covers:  However \u2013 and this is where design sensibilities come into play \u2013 there will be exceptions to these rules. With the first set of cover images, the designer has a choice of whether or not to have the logo partially covered. And it\u2019s only a well-recognized publication like TIME that can get away with this treatment\u2026for a smaller, less-well known magazine to do this would simply be foolish. Now that you recognize what the norm is, here are a few TIME covers that break the rules:  With the first, the head does in fact bleed off the page, but the clean edge and position of the face in the image mandates it being overlaid on the masthead. In the second, the smoke doesn\u2019t offer the clean edge, but having it swirl around the logo is a better effect than were it to go behind. And with the third, Pope Francis could have been used either in front or behind (a point I made earlier). In this case, the designer chose to have the logo in front, but a previous cover where he was named Person of the Year in 2013, had him in front. ",
