            "answer_text": "It was not built. The so-called Yonaguni monument is a natural sandstone formation, not a man-made artifact. So far as I can tell, nearly every geologist who has examined it, even those usually friendly to pseudoarchaeologial interpretations, has concluded that it\u2019s a natural formation. The stone in question has very well-defined planes along which it can easily split, and frequent earthquake activity means it\u2019ll split a lot. The result of this is lots of flat surfaces which create the illusion of man-made structures. ",
