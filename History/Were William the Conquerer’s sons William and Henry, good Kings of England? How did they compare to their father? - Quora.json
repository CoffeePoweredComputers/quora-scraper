            "answer_text": "Very briefly, William ll was not a popular king generally in that he was heavy on taxation, the church, including the Pope, didn\u2019t like him as he withheld posts and kept the revenue for himself, he lived the 11th century equivalent of a playboy life and spent as much or more time in Normandy than in England (but then most of the Norman kings did). His main achievement in hindsight is building the incredible Westminster Hall and his main claim to fame is being shot and killed \u2018by accident\u2019 while out hunting. Henry 1 may or may not have been personally involved with the \u2018accident\u2019 but he was certainly well-placed to leave his brother\u2019s body lying unburied and get to Winchester to take control of the Treasury and get himself crowned. He was known to be very ruthless, even by Norman standards (even before he was king he threw someone who tried to fight against him out of a tower window, and later in his life he ordered two of his granddaughters mutilated as their parents had done the same to a hostage), and few people crossed him except his elder brother Robert who wanted the throne he thought he should have,and various rebels in Normandy on and off for most of his reign. He had dozens of illegitimate children but only two legitimate, and when his only legitimate son was drowned in the White Ship tragedy, when a huge swathe of the up and coming aristocracy also died, he made his nobles swear to accept his daughter Matilda as heir to the throne. His greatest achievement was that he ruled for 35 years and England was more or less at peace (albeit very strictly controlled) for all that time. Unfortunately due to the death of his son it all unravelled immediately after he died and the country was in an on-off civil war for over 15 years between his daughter and his nephew Stephen, who claimed Henry had nominated him on his deathbed, and who took the throne exactly as Henry himself had, by leaving the king\u2019s body behind, taking possession of the Treasury and getting himself crowned. Their father would probably have approved of them both; William for his taxation-and-building policy (not so much the upsetting the church part) and Henry because he didn\u2019t mess about. If someone needed executing or mutilating or a rebellion needed putting down, that was what happened. ",

            "answer_text": "They were good or bad depending on perspective. To gain a fair understanding of these kings, it is necessary to examine all the evidence, including writs and charters. Most of the authors of chronicles and memoirs were bishop\u2019s scribes or monks, who were naturally concerned to protect and extend Episcopal and Abbey, privileges. They often took sides vehemently against each other when questions of jurisdiction, property and income were contested between them and other Church figures, let alone the la\u00efty. One only needs to compare the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to other sources, to see how narrow a scribe\u2019s priorities could be. For example, when major national events were occurring over a period of 3 years, the ASC only mentions a bishop\u2019s pilgrimage to Rome. Whereas the ASC in Wessex call \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d merely the \u2018Lady of the Mercians\u2019 and the wife of an Ealdorman, to the contemporary Irish Annals she is the reigning \u2018Queen of the Anglo-Saxons\u2019. So those are the limitations and heavy biases of the monastic sources. As expected, some bishops and abbots hated William II because he left bishoprics vacant and took their revenue. The senior clergy were so hoping they would be promoted to those posts and acquire the churches\u2019 revenues for themselves. In my perspective, William II was mostly a good king for the first half of his reign, when Alan Rufus was advising him. In those years, the king may have irked the Church but he consistently forgave rebels, with the exception of the nefarious Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, who betrayed him by leading a massive baronial rebellion only a few months into his reign in 1088 with the intent of replacing him with his elder brother Duke Robert \u2018Curthose\u2019 of Normandy. In 1089, during William II\u2019s reign, one of Europe\u2019s greatest reforms occurred in England: the foundation of Parliament. William II reconciled with the English populace, including the long-suffering people of York. He was also successful militarily. He was the first king of England to wrest Cumbria and Westmoreland from the Scots. In 1091, he led an army of Englishmen into a Normandy that was descending in chaos due to Duke Robert\u2019s incompetence and the conflicting advice of Bishop Odo and William of St Calais, the exiled Bishop of Durham. William II and his entourage were so popular that the Norman people lined the roads to cheer his army on. The French King, Philip I, was so worried that the sentiment would spread into his royal domain that he sent Pope Urban II (yes, that Pope) to negotiate a partition of the Duchy, which satisfied William II. With Alan Rufus\u2019s death on 4 August in either 1093 or 1094, William II lost a wise counsellor, a good administrator, a seasoned diplomat, and a strong general. Now trusting his own counsel, William treated the rebels of 1095 severely. When the Bishopric of Durham fell vacant, he gave it to Ranulf Flambard and employed him to increase royal revenues. Many scribes expressed hostility to this endeavour. Duke Robert and King William patched up their differences and made each other their heir. Unlike with similar arrangements in history, no mischief ensued. When Robert joined the First Crusade (travelling with the Duke of Brittany), he placed the whole of Normandy into William\u2019s hands in return for cash. This is surely proof of mutual trust. In 1100 Robert was travelling back from the Holy Land with the intention of marrying a wealthy Italian-Norman heiress (Sybilla of Conversano) and then buying back Normandy from William. Surprise, surprise, William died in a hunting accident in the New Forest on 2 August, and Henry, who was in the party, rushed to Winchester to seize the treasury and then claimed the crown. Henry was always canny with money, and also had an eye on reputation. So he imprisoned Ranulf Flambard in the Tower of London. Flambard soon escaped, and fled to Normandy where he became an advisor to Duke Robert. (In the circumstances, I guess Robert hadn\u2019t to pay to get his Duchy back.) Even though Flambard was heavily involved in Robert\u2019s abortive attempt to wrest England from Henry, and resided mostly in Normandy for the next few years, Henry returned the Bishopric of Durham to him. (A little suspicious, if you ask me.) After Henry defeated Robert at Tinchebray in 1106 and claimed all of Normandy for the English crown, Flambard returned to England and lived happily ever after. (Hmm\u2026) The French king Louis VI tried reconquering Normandy for Robert\u2019s don William Adelin, but the battle of Br\u00e9mule on 20 August 1119 settled that for the time being. The rest of Henry\u2019s reign I will leave for others to cover. ",

            "answer_text": "William ll (\u201cRufus\u201d) reigned for 13 years. He was, basically, a soldier rather than a statesman, and kept control of his lands on both sides of the Channel. Contemporaries spoke of him as \u201caddicted to every kind of vice, and the fact that he never married or fathered children gave rise to rumours (which have never been proven) about his sexual preferences. His death, shot by an arrow while out hunting, was said to be accidental, but is these days regarded almost certainly as murder. His brother, Henry l, reigned for 35 years. He was known as \u201cBeauclerc\u201d because he was well educated and could read and write (in Latin) which was not the norm in those days. He was more statesmanlike than his late brother, although he had a vicious streak. He kept both his British and Norman territories under control, concluded a major peace agreement with his French neighbours, and in Britain he maintained and strengthened both the financial and justice systems. Henry\u2019s real tragedy was the loss of his only remaining son, William Adelin, in the White Ship disaster, and despite all his attempts to make his daughter, Matilda, his heir, this ultimately led to the disastrous period of civil war between Stephen and Matilda, known as The Anarchy.
