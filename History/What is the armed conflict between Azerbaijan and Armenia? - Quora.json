            "answer_text": "Both countries have a long lasting (long lasting) dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh territory, a parcel of land located on South Caucasus, roughly the size of the U.S. state of Connecticut.  The dispute over the territory goes back to the early days of the Soviet Union: In 1923, Joseph Stalin, then the Soviet commissar of nationalities, drew up the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) as an autonomous enclave within Azerbaijan despite the region\u2019s 90 percent ethnic Armenian population. Sounds like a good idea, doesn\u2019t it? The Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic would raise the issue periodically over the next 60 years, but it was not until the Soviet Union\u2019s dying days that it exploded. In February 1988, with nationalism on the rise throughout the Soviet Union, mass demonstrations took place in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, calling for Karabakh to be detached from Azerbaijan and made a part of Armenia. Ethnic infighting between Azerbaijanis and Armenians broke out across both republics, including the expulsion of Armenians by Azerbaijanis from a town near Baku. As the Soviet Union crumbled in late 1991, Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence, and the conflict exploded into a full-scale war: Armenia and the new Nagorno-Karabakh Republic on one side, Azerbaijan on the other. When a cease-fire was finally reached in 1994, 20,000 people had died, 1 million were displaced, and Nagorno-Karabakh stood as an unrecognized republic: de facto independent and entirely outside of Azerbaijani control but de jure lying within that country\u2019s internationally recognized borders.  Flags of Azerbaijan and Armenia, side by side, during the meeting between representatives of the two countries in Geneva, Switzerland, October 2017 It\u2019s still unclear how the Armenian-Azerbaijani clashes began. Armenia claims that its forces fired on an Azerbaijani military truck attempting to cross the border; Azerbaijan says Armenian artillery suddenly opened fire. Both sides have plenty of reasons to avoid an escalation in this area. Two major oil and gas pipelines from Azerbaijan to Turkey pass through Tovuz district, only a few miles from the border. On the Armenian side lies the Yerevan-Tbilisi highway, a crucial transit corridor for both goods and people, crossing one of Armenia\u2019s only two open international borders to Georgia. It is estimated that around 150.000 civilians live within six miles of the border, with three-quarters of those on the Azerbaijani side. While heavy artillery might be off the table, there are a lot of other shiny new toys each side can bring to bear\u2014particularly Azerbaijan, which, thanks to an oil-funded defense procurement spree, has acquired high-end Russian and Israeli military equipment in recent years.  Video image provided by the Armenian Ministry of Defense shows what would be Azerbaijan tanks and military personnel in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Sunday, 27/09/2020. Azerbaijan has 3 times more manpower available than Armenia. Also, Azerbaijan spends almost twice in its Armed Forces. Even so, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, via Twitter, asked the troops to report to their districts and published the following message: \"For the country, for the victory\".

            "answer_text": "Here's my response from a (hopefully) unbiased perspective. I'm neither Armenian not Azerbaijani, I'm English, so hopefully my presentation will be seen as unbiased to either side. Nagorno-Karabakh is a region in the Caucasus, internationally and de jure a part of Azerbaijan but de facto an independent yet unrecognised state that is closely tied to Armenia and seeks to one day unite with Armenia. Both sides have been in an extremely heated debate about this, especially over the past 30 years, but this whole conflict has been going on for much longer. There was little more than some skirmishes here and there since the war in the 90\u2019s but now the conflict has escalated and the two are, in all but name, at war. Armenia/Artsakh's claim to Nagorno-Karabakh: 1) The large majority of the people living in Nagorno-Karabakh are Armenians and Orthodox Christians. 2) Nagorno-Karabakh has seceded from Azerbaijan as the Republic of Artsakh, which would suggest that the people of Nagorno-Karabakh don't want to be Azerbaijani. 3) Throughout most of the history of independent Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh has been an integral part of Armenia. Azerbaijan's claim to Nagorno-Karabakh: 1) Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as a part of Azerbaijan. 2) During Soviet times, Nagorno-Karabakh was part of Azerbaijan. 3) No peace treaty has been made confirming the transfer of Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia/Artsakh. Who supports who? Azerbaijan is closely allied with to Turkey and has received arms and materiel from Israel. Armenia is closely allied to Russia, who has sent materiel to Armenia and called for a ceasefire. What has happened so far? Armenia and Artsakh have been pushed back a little bit by the Azerbaijani forces who claim to have captured some towns in southern Artsakh. International calls for a ceasefire have been happening very frequently. A quick end to the conflict could happen. Whatever your stance on this conflict is, let's all hope that a long lasting peace that works for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenia and Azerbaijan is achieved.
