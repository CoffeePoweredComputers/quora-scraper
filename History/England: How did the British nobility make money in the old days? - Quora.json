            "answer_text": "Andrew Roberts accurately describes how they made their money in the Middle Ages, but by the time of Downton Abbey, things had changed, & it was more as User-9282751860602156258 says. The landed aristocracy were finding that renting out land, & farming (usually through a farm manager) some directly, were no longer enough to support their grand houses & lifestyles. Great houses built in the second half of the 19th century exist, such as Waddesdon Manor - paid for by banking profits, not income from the land.  Even before that, many of the fortunes which paid for grand houses weren\u2019t based on the land around the houses, but other businesses. There were families which made their money in trade, from colonial plantations, manufacturing, property development, etc. (there were some very rich brewers) & then bought or married into the landed aristocracy. By the time of Downton Abbey, many great houses which could no longer be supported by income from land had been sold to new owners who\u2019d made their money elsewhere, rented out, turned into schools, etc. Some were kept on but the owners could no longer afford to maintain them, & they were falling into dereliction. Some ended up being demolished. The National Trust (founded in 1895) was to take many over from their owners in the coming years to ensure their preservation, often in exchange for permitting the old owners continued use of part of the house. Some found other uses, such as Caversham Park, near here. ",

            "answer_text": "I would say there have been four clear phases to royal funding. The first was simply robbery, where the most powerful warlords simply plundered weaker tribes and took what they wanted. This was true up to around 1066, when the enterprise took on a wider dimension when Duke William of Normandy made the whole thing international rather than intertribal. He grabbed the entire UK dispossessing the locals, essentially to share it with his pals, killing anyone who disagreed. After that we get in to the second, extortion phase where royalty has a structured approach to plundering according to means with some sort of justification attached. For example, raising cash to fund wars. This began to take on some of the characteristics of taxation. Eventually, the upper echelons insisted that a more formal version of extortion was documented, Magna Carta is probably the first attempt at this. There was a brief, delusional phase where Charles II developed ideas beyond his station, but this was quickly corrected. The third stage was selling titles, which began in a blatant form as a way to reward loyalty in and age of emerging government. This stayed with us until the 19th century when government wrested control of even the sale of titles from the royals. I suppose we are now at the fourth stage with royalty being sort of pensioners, where government hands over interest payments on earlier plunder, whilst leaving tokens of power in their hands in exchange for being heads of state.
