            "answer_text": "Do you remember that shortly after 9/11, with the rubble of the Twin Towers still smoldering, President George W. Bush stirred up a hornet\u2019s nest by saying the following five words: \u201cThis Crusade\u2019s gonna take awhile.\u201d Did you ever hear that word \u201ccrusade\u201d out of President Bush\u2019s mouth again? You did not. Why the hornet\u2019s nest? Because, even though The First Crusade occurred almost a thousand years ago, the memory of its brutality was still fresh in Islamic minds. And since the 9/11 hijackers were Islamic, President Bush seemed to be saying that the U.S. government was about to launch a crusade against all those of the Islamic faith in the United States. We can date the start of the First Crusade precisely. In March of 1095, Pope Urban II received an ambassador from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos pleading for help against Muslim (Seljuk) Turks who had conquered most of Byzantine Anatolia in the eastern Mediterranean. The Seljuks were being pushed from east by Mongol hordes (they\u2019re always \u201chordes,\u201d aren\u2019t they?) On 27 November 1095 the Pope gave a speech which electrified his listeners. It was, in effect, a call to arms. summoning nobles and peasants alike to wrest the Holy Land, and eastern churches, from control of the Turks. It\u2019s important to understand that the First Crusade\u2014the term had actually not yet been invented\u2014was not one unified army under a single command, but several. The main division was between the untrained and unruly People\u2019s Crusade which comprised peasants and lower ranked knights. The second division was disciplined military units of the nobility, generally knights on horseback. They would meet very different fates in the Holy Land. In total, about 60,000 men in one condition or another, came down through France, Germany and Hungary. Along the Rhine, the People\u2019s Crusade indulged in slaughtering Jews, the victims estimated between 2,000 and 12,000. This motley People\u2019s Crusade was led by one Peter the Hermit, a charismatic monk who rode a donkey. At Belgrade, in what is now Serbia, the People\u2019s Crusade ran into major difficulties. Denied entrance to the city, they set about plundering the countryside. This, in turn, brought out the Belgrade garrison. In subsequent clashes, the People\u2019s Crusade lost about 10,000 men, a quarter of its strength. Petty quarrels within the People\u2019s Crusade often exploded into serious battles, causing hundreds, even thousands of deaths. This was testament to the People Crusade\u2019s complete lack of discipline. Peter the Hermit would periodically lose control of his people. By now, the People\u2019s Crusade was being whittled down by starvation, returnees to Europe or even enslavement by Baltic slavs. From Constantinople, the main body of the Crusade\u2014now much reduced\u2014 descended into the Holy Land in three waves. The People\u2019s Crusade was the first. Turkish spies mingled among the peasants, spreading rumors and setting a trap. The peasants fell into it by committing their \u201cforces\u201d to a narrow ravine where waiting Turkish cavalry fell upon them, destroying them in a savage massacre. The nobility came in the second wave, focused on one objective: re-taking Jerusalem. The city had last been under Christian governance in the year 638. The knights conquered it in a July 1099 assault, massacring most of the Muslim and Jewish inhabitants. Accounts tell of city streets running red with blood of the citizenry. It was the brutality of that assault on Jerusalem in 1099 which stirred up the hornet\u2019s nest of outrage over President Bush\u2019s \u201dcrusade\u201d remark about \u201c9/11.\u201d On that catastrophic day, 11 September 2001, Islamic terrorists hijacked four American airliners and flew them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The third wave of nobles arrived in the Holy Land in 1101. There would be eight more crusades, the last nearly 200 years later in 1271\u20131272. Together, they produced much good: they reopened the Mediterranean to commerce, enabling Genoa and Venice to flourish. They unified the Latin Church under Popes made stronger by the crusades. And lastly, the crusades produced thrilling stories of heroism, chivalry and piety. These tales fed medieval romance, philosophy and literature. In this way, the crusades reinforced the foundation of Western Civilization upon which so much of our present-day society is built. Painting: Crusaders assaulting Jerusalem  ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ll give you a quick and dirty run down. No doubt there are plenty of other factors I\u2019m ignoring, but the world is a complex one and can rarely be put into a few paragraphs. Rise of the Seljuk TurksThe Seljuk Turks and their rise to prominence in within asia minor is a huge reason for the Crusades. Not only should their rise be taken into account, but also their fervent adoption of Islam. The big date I want to cite is 1071 AD and the Battle of Manzikert. This battle was between the Seljuk Empire and the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire. The result was a defeat for the Byzantines and capture of their Emperor. The Seljuks were able to take advantage of their victory to push way into the traditional Byzantine heartland, snagging territory as they did. Even the city of Nicaea, famous for the council of Nicaea of 325 AD, fell to the Seljuks. The defeat and subsequent capture of the Emperor sent the Byzantines into a succession crisis. One man managed to emerge victorious, claimed the throne and was crowned in 1081 AD. This man, the newly minted Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, found himself heading a severely depleted state. The Empire had lost much of its strength due to the defeat at Mazikert and the following civil crisis, in addition to a few generations of severe mismanagement. Fortunately for the Empire (or unfortunately with some amount of hindsight applied), Alexios was incredibly shrewd. He used the Seljuk advances as a reason to petition the Pope for aid. Alexios was hoping the Pope would rally up a force of Latin Christian mercenaries which would be put under Alexios\u2019 command and utilized to retake former Byzantine territories. The Pope at the time, Pope Urban II, took things a step further. He had his own grand designs for the future. For quite sometime, the Catholic Church in Rome and the Eastern Church in Constantinople had been growing apart. Pope Urban saw this as a perfect opportunity to reunite the two factions and endure himself to the Byzantines, so the old empire would finally pay due homage to the pontiff. There was also the matter of Jerusalem. Not as big a prize for the Byzantines as Antioch or Nicaea, Jerusalem posed a tempting target for Pope Urban. The Seljuks had recently captured the city and ended the relatively peaceful state maintained with the previous Muslim rulers. Pilgrims were no longer safely able to travel to the holy city, and this was used as a rallying cry for the crusades. In 1095, at the Council of Clermont, Pope Urban addressed assembled nobles, imploring them to take up the cross and march to retake Jerusalem. Apparently, the call was enthusiastically received with men shouting \u201cDeus Vult\u201d or \u201cGod Wills It\u201d while sowing cloth crosses to their clothes. The message was further spread and resulted in the misadventure known as the People\u2019s Crusades as well as the Prince\u2019s Crusade, and event also known as the First Crusade. ",

            "answer_text": "Historically, the start of the crusades were given a much more religious basis than it seems actually existed at the time. The first thing to look at is the fact that after the stop of the Viking raids and the collapse of the Carolingian empire there was a large number of soldiers and knights with no big wars going on. Some went to what is now Spain to help in the reconquista, but many others devolved to extracting ransom from local villagers, waging small scale wars and raids in neighboring lands and increasing lawlessness all across West Europe. In Middle East, the Byzantines lost in 1071 the Battle of Manzikert and with it a huge chunk of territory. In the same time the entire Levant was in turmoil right before the first crusade. While the Fatimids were generally benevolent towards pilgrims, the area was conquered by the Seljuk Turks and then fragmented in smaller states. The lawlessness in the area and on the routes of pilgrimage increased a lot and attacks on pilgrims followed as a consequence. The Byzantine emperor asked for support from the Pope to shore up his eastern border. In response the call for the crusade was made and the First Crusade got underway. (I will not write about its conduct and the other related events. The question is strictly about the start). You should read thr Wikipedia article on the subject. It has a pretty succinct text about this and a few pretty good references. ",

            "answer_text": "In the 7th and 8th centuries, Muslim armies left the Arabian Peninsula and within a few decades built one of the largest and most powerful empires that the world had ever seen. They quickly conquered a large amount of territory in North Africa, Syria, Palestine, and Spain that had been (and in many cases, still was) under Roman rule and had been thoroughly Christianized as a result. In 674 and 717, Arab armies besieged Constantinople itself and in 732 a Moorish army from Spain crossed into France. All three of these were defeated, but it convinced medieval Europeans that they were surrounded by a hostile power intent on destroying their religion and their way of life. From their point of view, things got worse in the 11th century. The ruler of Egypt, al-Hakim the Mad, had destroyed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the holiest site in Christianity, and had begun persecuting Palestinian Christians. In 1071, a Turkish army annihilated Byzantine forces at the Battle of Manzikert, bringing much of Anatolia under Seljuk control. And while the war in Spain was going considerably better for Christians, all of this only made European Christians more afraid and more convinced that they needed to stop the spread of Islam. Now the crusades were actually triggered by a very specific event. The Byzantine emperor, Alexios I, had partially repaired the relationship between the Byzantine Empire and the papacy and in 1095 sent a letter to Pope Urban II where he asked the pope for military aid. However, Urban decided to do something different. He preached a sermon at the Council of Clermont where he framed Alexios\u2019s request as a call to a religious war and asked for volunteers to travel to the East and fight. In return, Urban promised that the crusaders would receive the protection of the Church - that is, anyone who hindered the crusade would be committing a sin and be punished by excommunication - and he granted a plenary indulgence to the crusaders, forgiving them of any sins they may have committed. Urban\u2019s message worked. By all accounts his sermon was well-received and word traveled across Europe, primarily through existing family networks. As near as we can tell, the vast majority of crusaders were motivated by a sincere belief that they were following God\u2019s will in trying to recapture and re-Christianize the Holy Land. If anything, Urban\u2019s speech worked too well: he had hoped that he\u2019d get a devoted, but professional army of soldiers, but he also raised an angry mob of peasants which rampaged across Europe before being annihilated by the Seljuks. Despite a major falling out between the crusaders and the Byzantines, the First Crusade succeeded in capturing Jerusalem and carving out four tiny kingdoms in the Levant. These states were small and vulnerable, so not surprisingly most of them only lasted a few decades. Nevertheless, the fact that the First Crusade actually worked inspired the future crusades to return to the Middle East to try to defend the crusader kingdoms or to re-create them after they inevitably fell. However, that\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg as the crusading movement was actually much larger. The ongoing wars in Spain, for instance, were re-framed as a crusade and Urban actively discouraged Spanish knights from going to the Holy Land on the grounds that their fight was closer to home. Similarly, the basic idea of crusading meant that one could be called against any group seen as an enemy of Christians, not just against Muslims. In 1198, for instance, German, Polish, Danish, and Swedish forces went on crusade against the Lithuanians, Estonians, Prussians, and other peoples in northeastern Europe who were still pagan. In 1209, Pope Innocent III called a crusade against the Albigensiansin in the south of France, partly to extinguish the Albigensian heresy but partly so that the French king had an excuse to conquer the region. The crusader movement was still going as late as the fifteenth century which saw the ill-fated Crusade of Varna in 1443 - 1444 and saw Joan of Arc threaten a crusade against the Hussites in 1430. As I said earlier, it\u2019s worth taking the sources at face value here, as the crusades represent a situation where our 21st century mindset is very different from the way an average medieval person thought. Almost without exception, the source material makes it clear that the crusaders fundamentally saw themselves as pilgrims who were willing to fight in the service of God and that they fought for religious reasons. They certainly didn\u2019t object if that aligned with their other interests - as was the case with the Albigensian Crusade, when Richard the Lionhearted had the Third Crusade stop off in Sicily to rescue his sister, or even Urban II\u2019s desire to channel European soldiers\u2019 desire to fight into something productive - but these were first and foremost religious pilgrimages. With that in mind, it\u2019s pretty clear that Alexios\u2019s letter and Urban\u2019s speech at Clermont were what triggered the First Crusade, but that was building on centuries of animosity towards Islam which was heightened by the Turkish victory of Manzikert and al-Hakim\u2019s desecration of Christian holy sites in Jerusalem. Moreover, when all of these factors are considered, we begin to understand why the European Christians saw the crusades as being a reaction to centuries of Muslim conquests - in effect, they saw the crusades as a delayed, but ultimately defensive war to protect fellow Christians from harm.

But Muslim attacks on Christian lands had been going on for centuries prior to the Crusades. More than three hundred years earlier at Tours, France, Charles Martel repelled a Muslim invading force deep in Christian land. In short, the Crusades were a tardy response to centuries of Islamic aggression, which frankly has never ceased. ",

The byzantine empire was the remnant of the roman empire in the east while in the west, many different kingdoms were fighting one another to control Rome but failed. When the byzantines lost the war against the turks, emperor Alexius I called the pope in Rome for help but instead the pope initiated the crusade to Jerusalem to illustrate his role as the patriach of Christendom.Population expansion. After the end of the western roman empire, infastructure was destroyed and population decrease due to invasions and wars. During the high middle ages, agriculture began to expand in western europe leading to more food supply thus more people were born resulted in lack of residential space. The knights wanted to have rich lands thus they joined the crusades.Trading and education. The east has maintained a systematic trade network from Constantinople to China through the silk road and effcient bureaucracy. There are many goods that were very expensive in europe therefore the crusaders wanted to obtain the rich materials beside Jerusalem was once the capital of the ancient world with libraries that preserved the knowledges that became obsolete in the west.",

However, in the 11th century , a group of Christian pilgrims had been attacked so in 1095 , Pope Urban appealed for help so as to recapture Jerusalem from Muslims. At this, an army of 30,000 set out from Western Europe to Jerusalem. To Christians this was the beginning of the crusades . To the Muslims it was the beginning of the Frankish invasions. ",
