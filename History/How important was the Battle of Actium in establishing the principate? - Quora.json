            "answer_text": "I claim no special expertise on the Battle of Actium or Roman politics, but my opinion is that a convincing victory by Mark Antony and Cleopatra would have made it extremely hard for Octavian to have consolidated power as the first Roman Emperor, under the name Caesar Augustus. That is assuming he even survived losing the battle. Depending on the severity of the defeat, he might have held on to Rome itself, but he would have then been on the defensive, and vulnerable to overthrow from within by political rivals anxious to cut a deal with Antony.
