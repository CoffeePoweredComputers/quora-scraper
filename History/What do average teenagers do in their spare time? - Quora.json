            "answer_text": "I'm a 16 year old girl, I'll be 17 in October. If my friends have time, I usually go out with them all day. If not, I spend my time on my phone reading stuff (usually history because I really like it), watching movies on Netflix and educational videos on Youtube. I also text a lot with my Internet friends on Whatsapp. Sometimes I write poems or just thoughts in Notes on my phone. I also spend some time on Instagram but I'm trying not to waste my time there. Oh, and I also spend some time here on Quora because I can learn new stuff. When I'm not on my phone, I take pictures (I'm trying to learn photography, my older sister gave me her DSLR and I'm learning to use it alone, and I also have some old analog cameras that I use, or I simply take pictures with my smartphone), I draw, or I read. I don't like reading books like SF or stuff like that, I only like reading educational books, or with legends, usually about my city's history or of my country's, but mostly about my city. If they have pictures, that's way better. Sometimes I spend some time on my phone searching for what books to buy next, or other stuff that I want to buy. Sometimes I get out alone just to learn the streets in my city. In weekends I usually spend time with my mom, going out with her or cooking together, or just talking. I also have to care for my plants (we have over 100 pots in the house and on the balcony) and I spend a lot of time with my cat. Other times I just sleep. ",

            "answer_text": "Some teenagers are mature and wise for their age, are super organized and have their life all planned out and it is commentable.! The others , sit on their asses waiting to be served by mommy and daddy who have spoiled them rotten. An ancient philosopher remarked that too much democracy leads to chaos. I say too much permissiveness leads to spoiled people that parents will need to support all their lives. But , it is the parents who created such lazy and helpless human beings. They were certainly not introduced to the School of Hard Knocks when they should have! People have too much money and resources and kids get in all sort of problems. It is not fun today when a parent has worked hard and made a good life for himself yet the offspring is on heavy drugs and in and out of treatments. . The parent feels guilty for not being with the child 24/7. You need to put good foundations from very young and boundaries and reward system for those who deserve it. ! Do not spoil your children , for if you do, you will live in their rotten smell for the rest of your life. Don't give them fish but rather teach them how to fish and always have them close to you. They will live by examples! ",
