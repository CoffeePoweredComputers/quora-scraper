            "answer_text": "The question is \u201cWas life better in the 70's than today?\u201d Perhaps for a few things and in a few places it was. But I suspect that for most people worldwide, it was not. I would even hazard to say that for most people in the US, it was not. The thing that were (a little) better in the 70s were: Infrastructure (roads mostly.) They were still (relatively) new and hadn\u2019t decayed as much and didn\u2019t face as heavy demand (i.e.: become functionally obsolete.)Suburbs - weren\u2019t as overbuilt with McMansions, etc. as they are now.That said, the negatives make a long list: High inflation (and later an worse - stagflation)Vehicles and highways were not engineered to be as safeEnvironmental protection laws didn\u2019t exist or were only beginning to be implemented.Wars. Terrorism. As bad as the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are, there was more warfare then and it was more indiscriminate.Governments were more corrupt (as hard as that might be to believe.)Civil rights were much more constrained - there were no \u201cFreedom of Information\u201d laws in the US at the beginning of the 70s.Medicine and medical practice in the 1970s was still fairly primitive - especially what was available to most of the population. Much of \u201cgood medicine\u201d even then was based more on \u201cauthority\u201d than on scientific practice.Organic foods were hard to find (if impossible.)Food sensitivities (and even allergies) were not well supported. A peanut allergy was likely a death sentence.As a footnote \u2026 It might be hard to imagine what life was like without the immediate availability of communications (via cell phone and social networking), but (in the US at least), land line telephones were ubiquitous and travel (via automobile) was easy in the 1970s - and the benefits of cell phones and social networking are largely refinements of that (especially compared to a 50 years earlier where any contact with someone more than 5 miles away was largely through the postal system or day-long trips - unless there was an interurban railroad available.)

            "answer_text": "If I have to pick an opinion I would say yes.I know that most of the people here are from the USA and they are basing their opinion about the 70s in the USA, but I have to look it globally if I am to make a statement. Globally looking I think that 70s were better than now, because: -Economy was better -There was less violence -Education was better-Music, movies, etc. was 100 times better compared to today.-There were not as many drugs addicts on the streets like today-Parents had more authority and upbringing kids was easier-The world was still enjoying peace after WW2-The world countries were still being built, and everything was mostly new and polished from roads, schools and other\u2026-There was a better balance in the world -Family values were much much better -Growing up was much better for kids-Morality\u2026-No GMO as we have it today\u2026-The mentality of people itself was better -There was more love and caring for each other -People were more friendly, and they were going out more -There was much less depression-People were very optimistic about the future and optimistic about life nonetheless Globally looking I think that 70s were worse than now, because:-We have technology that can help us in some of the biggest world problems -Healthcare is much much better with the rise of technology-Laws are better for national minorities, etc. -We can connect globally in 10 seconds with anyone-Science For me, personally, I think that if we could have a life as it was in the 70s and technology as we have it today, it would be perfect. I really think that technology did bring us good things, but also bad things. The biggest problem I have is that people are more lonely, depressed, they are not optimistic about the future as much, and kids growing up, and technology ruining their childhood since we know how kids are growing up nowadays.Our generation is not experiencing life as a generation in the 70s. Morality, also. It\u2019s enough to see music and movies today and compare it to back then. 1 smart person has said-look at the entertainment industry, and you will find an answer to how the society looks like. ",
