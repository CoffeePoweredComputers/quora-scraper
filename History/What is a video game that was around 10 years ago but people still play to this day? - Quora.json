One of the greatest games of all time and is easy to run, theres so many mods out there for it as well if you get bored of the base game, 5 different stages, the first 4 all smaller than the last, the 5th stage is where the actual game takes place. I cant really explain it that well but oh well, try it for yourself, it's worth the money. Same with GMOD, it's basically a sandbox but the multiplayer has so many different minigames that players have created and developed, like Traitors in Terrorist Town, where theres a small amount of traitors killing off the terrorists and the terrorists have to find and kill the traitors before they die themselves. Halo Combat Evolved is a classic that will never die and Pokemon was the start of decades of romhacks and people learning the game engines to develop their own pokemon games. There are quite alot of great games that I cant think of right now but heres a few prominent ones. I'm tired so not describing them as good as I should be. ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on how are you willing to concede the games identity Plants vs Zombies and Angry Birds both came out in 2009 and are still being played. I know The Sims 3, Hearts of Iron 3 and Left 4 dead 2 communities are still fairly populous. A friend of my still plays Empire: Total War (he is a fan of the era) I personally still sometimes play Guitar Hero: Metallica (great game for parties) and despite playing it too many times, I do from time to time return to the world of Ferelden in Drragon Age: Origins, as it is one of my top 3 games ever.
