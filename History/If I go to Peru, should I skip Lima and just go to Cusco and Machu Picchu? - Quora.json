            "answer_text": "I am a Peruvian myself, and was living in Lima for just over a year and can tell you it is definitely worth staying there 2 to 3 days. There are many tours available, beautiful beaches, big super-malls (if you're a big shopper) and amazing food you shouldn't miss out on (be prepared to put on some weight! I definitely did). Although I do not suggest sticking to all the touristy areas (generally Miraflores, San Isidro and Barranco), Lima is a big city and you should experience as much of it as possible. Also, please do not listen to people who tell you that most of Lima is terribly dangerous and it is impossible to walk down the street without getting mugged. I never had any problems during all the time I was living there, and I wasn't in one of the touristy fancy areas. As long as you're not daft and don't walk in an abandoned alley alone in the middle of the night you should be just fine. In addition, try making a point of going to the less well-off areas so that you can really say you experienced Lima (they are often the more exciting places). If you happen to be in Lima on a Sunday you have to go to the restaurant El Bolivariano in Pueblo Libre. They have a huge buffet of lots of Peruvian food that you should not miss out on. If you're into sushi I suggest going to a restaurant called Ohashi maki. Be sure to try Inca Kola. Of course, Lima is not all there is to see of Peru, but it would be a shame not to have experienced it. I loved living there and I try to go back anytime I have holidays. Have a great time and remember to take lots of pictures! ",

            "answer_text": "Many people make a huge mistake when they skip Lima and go directly to Cusco. Don't let the traffic in Lima scare you....be brave!  There is so much to see and do in Lima!  I am a native Limena and I LOVE my city!!  We were just there last November and we had so much fun!  We saw the Changing of the Guard at the Government Palace (be there no later than 11:30 am)....it's really impressive and you get a serenade by the Dragoon musicians. Then you visit the Museum of the Archbishop's Palace and the Cathedral Museum. You can visit the Museum of Gastronomy (we went there twice), the Afro-Peruvian Museum, the Minerals Museum. You can visit the catacombs at the Church of Saint Francis. Few people realize the importance of Lima. It was the seat of the Spanish Viceroyalty and therefore it has so much history and culture.  Outside of Lima's Historic Center you can visit the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Pueblo Libre, you can go to Miraflores and enjoy the wonderful energy at Parque Kennedy which has so many good restaurants and cafes. To name a few:  \"El Parquetito\", \"Rincon Chami\", \"Cafe Haiti\", \"La Tiendecita Blanca\". There is such a \"joie de vivre\" in this area of Lima. Or you can go to the Larcomar Shopping Center and just enjoy the view of the Pacific, check out the beautiful shops, enjoy some yummy food..., you name it. You can also visit \"Hacienda Mamacona\" or \"Los Ficus\" and enjoy a great Peruvian Paso Horse Show. You can go to \"Brisas del Titicaca\" and see the best folk dancing show you'll ever see......dances from all over Peru, and you get to dance to tropical music in between presentations. We paid the equivalent of US$11.- to see this magnificent show. You can also go to the Indian Market on Petit Thouars and admire the arts and crafts that Peruvians create with love, prices are reasonable. What can I say!  If you skip Lima.....you'll be missing a lot, believe me. Also, you'll be missing the best part, which is meeting Limenos....friendly, helpful, welcoming people. You should spend no less than 2 or 3 days in Lima to really appreciate it.  Enjoy! ",
