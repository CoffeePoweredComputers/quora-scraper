            "answer_text": "Well, we all have studied History in bits and pieces where Mughals have been credited with bringing to India, various arts and sciences which existed in Persia and India at large was unknown to them. Forming the Indo-Mughal Architecture, Modern Beureaucracy, etc. But what we are not taught how Mughals at the same time plundered greatly the emotional and material wealth of India at that time. Decline of Buddhism in India is largely credited to Mughals\u2019 policy of conversion of population.Islam was made the state religion many a times during the reign of Mughals and lead mass murders of Hindu population.Mughals plundered and looted the wealthiest towns, cities, temples, etc.The traditional Indian which is long lost now is also on the Mughals, as their foreign fusion led to the complete loss of genuinity if Indian art. Mostly in the North and West part of India.3 jauhars have been performed till date by various Rajput queens, most famous being the ones by Rani Padmavati and Rani Karnavati, the reason for all three are more or less same, to pdotect their honour from the hands of Mughals.Mughals allowed the British to capture India for 200 years. The Divide and Rule policy worked very well because of weak rulers who ignored their alarming rise.Homosexuality is said to have been brought to Medival India by Mughals. Mahmud of Ghazni was supposedly homosexual.For more you can follow the link below: http://www.thetinyman.in/2016/01/mughal-barbarism-islamic-savagery-india.html?m=1 Hope this helps!!! ",

            "answer_text": "To maintain the secular credentials, some sneaky Indians keep silence over talk about Islamic destruction of our heritage and culture more openly. These kinda hypocrites are indeed a disgrace to the nation. Our Sanatan Dharma, the only dharma which has no beginning or end \u2013 Which has given always shelter to others in the time of crisis irrespective of conversion, religion, caste with no persecution..... Being a proud Hindu, Any harm done to a family member\u2019s house incite anger in the minds of his well wishers. Recently I visited Mathura, A birth place of Supreme personality of God head Lord Krishna. I was deeply pained to see how Mughal Invader Aurangzeb demolished the Mathura Temple in A.D.1670 & built a mosque to his open war on Hinduism. This mosque is built to spread the evil cult of Islam among Hindus and obstruct the Hindus from visiting the Krishna Janmabhoomi temple & this cruel terrorist Aurangzeb also killed 4 Million Hindus because Quran calls for jihad to resist against non-believers of Allah :/ In A.D.1017 this gracious temple was also looted by Mohammed Ghaznavi. History has been witnessed that these murderers always attacked over epicenter of Hinduism like Mathura, Ayodhya, Kashi Vishwanath\u2026.many more temples. There has been thousands of Mosques in various states which were built after demolishing Hindu temples. Fortunately, Hinduism is not as weak and as shallow as these blood soaked invaders thought. Hence destroying idols did not destroy our faith in God nor our love for our culture and scriptures. Destroying temples did not destroy our faith as our faith was built with cohesiveness of our community which believes in ' Sarvey Bhavnti SukhinaH\" .... . Despite 800 years of brutal rule, Proud Hindus like us have managed to survive in our own lands :) Nobody have courage to destroy \"Sanatan Dharma\". Har Har Mahadev  !! ",
