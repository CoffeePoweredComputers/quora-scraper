            "answer_text": "No. There is good evidence that mean intelligence is slowly declining and that includes a reduction in the number of people with very high intelligence. The explanation of what is happening is a bit complex, because we have two opposite things happening simultaneously. Intelligence increased in Western nations up to about the year 1870 \u00b1 a bit. From that point on, real intelligence (psychometric g) has been declining. This decline has been masked by the increases in IQ test scores that are known as the Flynn Effect. These FE gains, have not been gains in g and are hollow with respect to real intelligence (g). For example, FE gains have been shown to be partly due to increased guessing [the Brand Effect]. The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data set has been scored (by A. Beaujean) using Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory. Subtest scores decreased by 50 to 100% when the superior IRT was used; ergo, the FE gains shown by CTT were artifacts. When intelligence researchers have tested FE gains for the Jensen Effect (gains in g) they found none. But there are significant, robust biological measures that consistently relate to intelligence that have been declining since Victorian times. These include reaction time (data going back to 1870), backward digit span, vocabulary, sensitivity to color hues, and the rate of major discoveries. These items are well documented in many sources and are nicely brought together in the book: At Our Wits\u2019 End: Why We\u2019re Becoming Less Intelligent and What It Means for the Future, by E. A. Dutton & M. A. Woodley of Menie. Exeter, UK: Imprint Academic. The primary cause of the decline in intelligence is the negative correlation between IQ and fertility rates. This simply means that low IQ people have more children than high IQ people. The children of low IQ parents are low IQ and they too have lots of children; the children of high IQ parents are also bright and have few offspring. A second cause of the decline in intelligence is believed to be increased mutation load. This is the consequence of advancements in medical technologies that allow babies to survive today when they would have died in the past. Today we do not have culling of the weak via natural causes (disease) as was common until the late 1800s and rapidly changing through the 1900s.  The figure above shows fertility rates by location. Data is from the CIA World Factbook - 2020. At the national level, IQ also declines due to immigration of low IQ people to high IQ nations. The rate of change in developed nations, due to this effect, is rapid and is well documented in the scholarly literature. I am appending a list of some of the many papers and books on this topic {I have read almost all of them.} to illustrate that this is not an isolated idea, but is well understood and documented in our peer reviewed scientific journals. One of these deserves particular attention as it directly addresses your question: At Our Wits\u2019 End: Why We\u2019re Becoming Less Intelligent and What It Means for the Future, by E. A. Dutton & M. A. Woodley of Menie. Exeter, UK: Imprint Academic. It points to the decline in the numbers of true genius (the people who make landmark discoveries and major contributions to mankind, not simply those with high IQ). Dutton and Woodley point out that these people are particularly important to major innovation and that fewer of them are being born. This book is excellent reading for all.

            "answer_text": "A2A: \u201cAre the smartest people in the world getting smarter every generation? Are there any reasonable ways to measure this?\u201d The longest running study in psychology measured 1500 bright people in public schools. Let\u2019s say they represent one generation. That study showed that after six years these people lost 9 points on the average in six years. See Genetic Studies of Genius, the author is Lewis Terman of Stanford University. See Vol III, page 25, Table 5. I would say that each year people are getting dumber with each year in public schools. The underlying reason for this loss that Terman identified, was demonstrated in 1964, is known, and has been known since 1964. In my opinion it is worse than Terman knew. Terman\u2019s study showed a loss of 9 points on the average in six years. I would say the average of his entire group of 1500 students was below his acceptance criteria of 140 IQ before his study was even six years into the study. Table 5 of that study was based on extremely accurate methods. It was limited to 13 years old, it was exactly the same test. I think modern tests add in social factors that are not strictly based on intelligence. I think that is why Flynn thinks what you say is true. Modern tests are based on patterns, that might be different, than what I know about. I think people in public schools are losing IQ dramatically every year. So the specific age you measure one generation relative to another is probably far more important than the amount of change plus or minus that you are looking to measure. Since the problem has been known since 1928, and the solution has been known since 1964, and nothing in public education has addressed it, it looks more intentional, than accidental, to me. I suggest you look at why year by year losses of 1.5 points per year for 140 IQ plus kids is still true, before you jump to generational changes to show if it might actually positive. Your question suggests that you believe people are getting smarter each generation somehow. What do use suppose might be the cause of this? Best regards, Leon ",

It seems kinda hard. As a society we are becoming more knowledgeable. So as individuals we are more knowledgeable. But does that mean we are smarter than people were 100 years ago? It depends on what smart means. If it means intelligent, I don\u2019t know that we have a way to answer that. If it means we, as a society know more, then, yes, we are getting smarter as we learn more stuff. ",

No institution could ever teach me what Mak taught me just sitting together talking, actually me listening and asking endless questions over the years we were friends. Mak, I was told, neither read nor wrote. I didn\u2019t care. As far as I know, I was the only one who would listen to him in his later years. When you try to measure his kind of intelligence, it isn\u2019t possible because it changes with the test or measurement. . SO no there\u2019s no reasonable way to measure someone so fluid intellectually. I wouldn\u2019t want to insult him with tests either. If you\u2019re trying to measure his intelligence you;re missing the point because his intelligence is like a seed that\u2019s responsible for the forest.  ",

Most early civilisations had a good grasp of astronomy for example and they were as knowledgeable as possible in their day and age. Math was hampered by difficult counting systems but the circumference of the earth was calculated with tremendous accuracy over 2000 years ago in Egypt. The value of Pi has been long established as well as non rational numbers such as the square roots of 2 and 3. People have worked with block and tackle for many thousands of years. Surveyors from the past set out monuments that are still standing today with. incredible accuracy. Intelligence hasn\u2019t changed significantly but there are more people than ever and our access to information has never been as simple. I like to remember recorded knowledge has never been so massive in all of history. Most importantly people should try to take every advantage of our good fortune today. ",

Parents are always going to be looking to provide the best possible life for their children. Thus, CRISPR or some CRISPR version 2 will be used to manipulate embryos to ensure optimal development. Initially, it might only be used to make sure that child has no heritable genetic conditions that would impact their quality of life or dramatically reduce their life expectancy. However, slowly but surely, this technology will be used to confer advantage, and the greatest advantage in the future will be derived through highest possible intelligence. This situation will create an arms race of sorts as each country will race to have the smartest individuals so that they can effectively compete on the world\u2019s stage. ",
