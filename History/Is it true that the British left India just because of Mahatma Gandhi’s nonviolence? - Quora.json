            "answer_text": "Political independence for India was achieved not by Mahatma Gandhi, but rather by Hitler rendering the British Empire a bankrupt entity\u2026 World War II had a profound effect on the colonial powers because it completely destroyed Britain\u2019s economies. Although Hitler committed crimes against humanity, I give him credit\u2014and not Gandhi\u2014for India\u2019s independence immediately after World War II. Hitler destroyed the economies of Britain and France to such an extent that they were no longer able to financially maintain their military forces, and were hence incapable of containing the burgeoning freedom movements in their colonies. It is worth noting that Britain was in such bad shape that it received about one-fourth of the total aid given under the Marshall Plan. Regardless of Gandhi or any other charismatic leader, Britain would have left India in 1947 purely for financial reasons, due to its wholly collapsed economy. After WWII, Britain left not only India but nearly all its other holdings, including Jordan in 1946, Palestine in 1947, Sri Lanka in 1948, Myanmar in 1948, Egypt in 1952 and Malaysia in 1957. For the same reason, France also had to grant independence to Laos in 1949 and Cambodia in 1953, and had to leave Vietnam in 1954; Netherlands also left most of its colonies called Dutch East Indies, mainly Indonesia in 1949. Had there been no Hitler and no World War II, it most probably would have taken another 30 or more years for India and some of the other colonies to achieve independence. Another major consequence of World War II was that it greatly hastened Indian political independence. The highly publicised Cripes Mission that took place in India in 1942 was essentially a political ploy approved by Churchill to buy time for Britain and to try to assuage anti-colonialist feelings in the U.S. British historians P.J. Cain and A.G. Hopkins described the hopeless situation of the British in India as follows: By the end of war, there was a loss of purpose at the very center of the imperial system. The gentlemanly administrators who managed the Raj no longer had the heart to devise new moves against increasing odds, not least because after 1939 the majority of the Indian Civil Service were themselves Indian. In 1945 the new Viceroy, Wavell, commented on the \u201cweakness and weariness of the importance of the instrument still our disposal in the shape of the British element in the Indian Civil Service. The town had been lost to opponents of the Raj; the countryside had slipped beyond control. Widespread discontent in the army was followed in 1946 by a mutiny in the navy. It was then Wavell, the unfortunate messenger, reported to London that India had become ungovernable [which finally led to the independence of India]. There is a saying that history is written by the victors of war. One of the greatest myths, first propagated by the Indian Congress Party in 1947 upon receiving the transfer of power from the British, and then by court historians, is that India received its independence as a result of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s non-violence movement. This is one of the supreme inaccuracies of Indian history because had there been no Hitler and no World War II, Gandhi\u2019s movement would have slowly fizzled out because gaining full independence would have taken several more decades. By that time, Gandhi would have long been dead, and he would have gone down in history as simply one of several great Indian freedom fighters of the times, such as Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, Motilal Nehru, Dada Bhai Naoroji, and C.R. Das. He would never have received the vast publicity that he did for his nonviolence movement. ",

            "answer_text": "World War Two had broken the back of our British masters . The five-year war had bankrupted the British. Small mutinies in the Indian army (the INA) and the navy had shaken the morale of the British. Indians had dreamt of independence after World War One. They got Jallianwala Bagh. Now in 1945 , with the hugely destructive and expensive World War Two over, the British had no money to station a huge force in India to subdue a huge restive Indian population. So they quietly left, like the battered US army did in Vietnam. The French too lost their overseas colonies in Africa;In their colony Vietnam they were kicked out after a long drawn out jungle war under Ho chi minh. After the 1857 mutiny the British were always nervous about their hold over India. In 1947 they packed their bori bistra and left. I do not think that Nehru and Gandhi going in and out of jails resulted in the British leaving India. Some Indians suggest that the riots in Pakistan were engineered by the British because the Hindus of Pakistan didn't want to move to India and the Muslims of Indian Punjab didn't want to move to Pakistani Punjab. It seems Nehru and Patel had started being arrogant with Jinnah before independence. As a result he persisted and got Pakistan. Most Indians wrongly blame Gandhi for this fiasco. Pakistan later joined the US camps CENTO.  Aurangzebs costly military expeditions into the deep south bankrupted the mighty moghul empire, which disintegrated a few years after his death. After spending a trillion dollars and losing over 2500 men, Trump is looking for ways to pull out the high-tech US forces out of Afghanistan, also called the graveyard of empires. The Russian invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and its long stay bankrupted the Soviet union which pulled out its forces and collapsed a few years later. India seems to have tried something similar in Sri Lanka during Rajiv Gandhi's time. He had a Rambo- like general Sunderji. The LTTE Tamil tigers severely mauled the Indian army. Two years later the next PM VP Singh quietly pulled out the battered army from Sri Lanka. Later LTTE members blew Rajiv to pieces in a suicide bomb attack. Sri Lanka has now joined the China camp. India is now involved in a Vietnam type war in Kashmir. About 4 lakh troops fighting about 300 Pakistan-supported jihadis. Despite heavy losses the jihadis have returned to South Kashmir. The war is on. Experts call it a war of thousand cuts, a war of attrition. Too early to predict the outcome. Sorry, the text is a bit too long. ",
