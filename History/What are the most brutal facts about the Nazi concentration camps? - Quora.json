            "answer_text": "When you were sent to a concentration camp you never ever knew how long your sentence was. Both the Kapos (prisoner block / squad leaders) and German personnel had the right to end your life - without any explanation - for any menial infringement or the mere fact that you had a face or attitude they did not like. Imagine seeing your brother beaten to death next to you and you are totally helpless to protest about it or help save him, without yourself losing your life. After Kristalnacht some 30 000 male Jews ended up in the German concentration camps eg Dachau, Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen of those released they were broken men so harsh was their treatment. Starvation, hard labour, icy living conditions in winter, public whipping, human experiments (Ravensbruck, Dachau and Auschwitz) selection to be gassed or shot if your worth as free labour diminished due to malnutrition was a day to day occurrence. Kitty Hart survived Auschwitz and wrote a book of her life there and in her book she maintains that there is only three things that humans HAVE to do to survive. Eat/drink, sleep and shit. Her wonderful re-visit to Auschwitz can be found on YouTube \"A Day In Auschwitz\" In her narration she mentions that, besides working in the Canada warehouse sorting out the possessions of transports one of the best work assignments was to be allocated to clean out the barrack's latrines since at least in the harshness of winter it guaranteed some shelter.Life in the camps: The prisoners' day began at 4:30 am with \"reveille\" or roll call, with 30 minutes allowed for morning ablutions. After roll call, the Kommando, or work details, would walk to their place of work, five abreast, wearing striped camp fatigues, no underwear, and wooden shoes without socks, most of the time ill-fitting, which caused great pain. A prisoner's orchestra (such as the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz) was forced to play grotesquely cheerful music as the workers marched through the gates in step. Kapos \u2014prisoners who had been promoted to foremen \u2014 were responsible for the prisoners' behaviour while they worked, as was an SS escort. The working day lasted 12 hours during the summer, and a little less in the winter. No rest periods were allowed. One prisoner would be assigned to the latrines to monitor the time prisoners used the ablutions. After work, there was a mandatory evening roll call. If a prisoner was missing, the others had to remain standing in place until he was either found or the reason for his absence discovered, even if it took hours, regardless of the weather conditions. After roll call, there were individual and collective punishments, depending on what had happened during the day, and after these, the prisoners were allowed to retire to their blocks for the night to receive their bread rations and water. Curfew was two or three hours later, the prisoners sleeping in long rows of wooden bunks, lying in and on their clothes and shoes to prevent them from being stolen. And then the aspect of surviving ... just a slight infection could become a major problem, treatment for pneumonia, typhus, a broken limb was a death sentence. So in ending imagine a world of constant hunger, imagine a world of incessant cold in the long months of winter, imagine been worked in inhumane conditions to the point of total exhaustion...and doing it again the next day and the day after, imagine been whipped or beaten to within an inch of your life, imagine sleeping in a bunk with four others and having diarrhoea with going to the toilet was a mission in itself, imagine the person sleeping in the bunk above you defecating on you because they were too weak to get to that toilet, imagine never having the luxury of a shower or bath, imagine hope fading day by day that this horror and terror will end... and then it doesn't, imagine the unimaginable (which of course is impossible for us) and you will still not manage to have even a minuscule insight into what a real Hell this was.

Trust me, the stories told in there are absolutely horrific. Many are eyewitness accounts. ",
