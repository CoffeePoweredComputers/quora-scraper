            "answer_text": "That depends upon what you call history. I do not believe there is any \u201cpre-history\u201d by that I mean that we have history all the way back to the first man on earth. What most people mean by history is written history. In order to have written history it is necessary to have a means to record. To my understanding the first form of writing was cuneiform that was developed by the Sumerarians around the time of Abraham. Prior to that time history was kept orally most likely in the form of stories and songs. The earliest history of humanity was likely penned just before the Flood of Noah's time. Probably, that record was carried on the ark. Both Noah and his son, Seth, lived together with Abraham for 39 years, and passed the biblical history forward along with the worship of Jehovah. Other forms of writing were developed from Mesopotamia through the Levant and into North Africa including Hebrew by the time Moses recorded the Pentateuch giving a written record of history all the way back to the Garden of Eden.

            "answer_text": "Pretty much as the others say\u2026. Depends on your definition of \u201chistory\u201d. Generally we would think of this as dating to the rise of the first civilizations with the emergence of writing, large-scale artifacts, etc. Usually thought to date to around 2500 BCE. But as the one answer says, archaeology and paleo-archaeology give us plenty of evidence of human activity before this, dating back, well, to the earliest emergence of our own species about 300,000 years ago\u2026. And of previous species long before that. ",
