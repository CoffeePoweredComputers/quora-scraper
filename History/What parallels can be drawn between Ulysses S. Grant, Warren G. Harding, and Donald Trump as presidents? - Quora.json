            "answer_text": "Ulysses Grant had a lifelong reputation for scrupulous personal honesty. The scandals of his administration were born of his naivety in political and financial matters.Grant battled racism and used federal power to suppress the KKK.Grant married just once and was devoted to his wife.His Memoirs are a classic of American literature.Grant served his country magnificently in two wars.Now let\u2019s review Trump\u2019s ledger: Donald Trump has been a dedicated liar and cheat since he left Roy Cohn\u2019s knee. No other American President has paid out a $25 million fraud settlement on assuming office. Or paid out a quarter of a million in hush money to silence \u201cplaymates\u201d at the same time.Trump took out a full page ad to demand the execution of the Central Park 5, who were later proved innocent. He has used racial bias and xenophobia to divide America and pander to white supremacists.He has the sexual mores of a crawfish.Trump\u2019s \u201cwritings\u201d are a national embarrassment.Trump had neither the physical courage to fight in Vietnam nor the moral courage to oppose it.Warren Harding falls somewhere in-between.

            "answer_text": "Black folk advanced further in Grant's years in office than before. Harding helped restore some reasonable treatment for blacks that Wilson had stripped away. And during Trump's time so far in office, more black folk have jobs than ever before and the Trump administration has not curtailed or diminished any minority in this country, except, perhaps, and it's arguable once you get beyond the yellow journalism and propaganda of the left, illegal aliens. The juvenile attempts to claim Trump is dumb, stupid, or incompetent is a long-standing propaganda tool of the left. Leftists believe anyone who approaches life differently than they are hateful, stupid, and ignorant. And when their candidate is rejected by the voters, there is always some dire conspiracy behind that \u2014 whether it's the military industrial complex, the Trilateral Commission. Opus Dei, the Koch Brothers, or Putin. This works better for progressives than to admit their chosen candidate was a failure. ",
