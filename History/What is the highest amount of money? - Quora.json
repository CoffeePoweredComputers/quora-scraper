            "answer_text": "From my background, BA and MA in Economics, primarily Austrian school: there is no limit on the \u201camount of money\u201d. So, no \u201chighest\u201d. It's not a question with true meaning. In a perfect, simplified, and to me, correct world, where money=gold, the amount is infinite. Not \u201cfalsely\u201d infinite like fiat, paper \u201cmoney\u201d, but in the true sense as real money: it's subjective value. If gold were the only money, i.e. medium of exchange, it's finite amount would adjust to an ever expanding market in terms of real goods and services easily: their prices would always be gradually falling, which, in spite of spurious theories to the contrary, is how a true free market economy would work. And something everyone could easily understand and anticipate. Believe it or not, \u201cwage earners\u201d would accept that while their hourly pay rate will constantly fall, so would the prices of everything they buy, so in terms of \u201creal income\u201d, they are better off. Radical? Yes, but we'll get there. So, to sum up, the value of money can never have a \u201chighest\u201d amount. Even it it's physical amount is fixed, it's \u201cvalue\u201d in terms of real goods and services is, literally, infinite. ",

            "answer_text": "The largest value of $ bill was the Woodrow Wilson $100,000 note. Of course there were other worthless trillion dollar notes from countries during hyper-inflation. The Wilson note was only used between government agencies and not in regular circulation. It\u2019s still \u201cmoney\u201d but not a currency in general. Then came some $5,000 and $10,000 notes from way back. THOSE were in todays terms big value. Imagine what $10,000 bill could buy you in 1920. In a sense, the largest \u201cnote\u201d you can get today is a BitCoin. The $500 Marshall note from 1918 was backed by Gold. You\u2019d get something of value from them. The world is now \u201cface value\u201d currency. In my view, cyrptocurrency will be more valid than a single-government note. They\u2019re both face value but without government intervention (anti-inflation policies or QE ideas) it will stabilize things. Every stock market crash since 1903 has been from a lack of liquidity (by the banks and government policies). If there are other forms of money available, there will be fewer stock market crashes. Looking forward to this new era. ",
