            "answer_text": "\"How was the Manhattan Project kept secret?\" ----- To a very large measure, the secrecy was maintained by compartmentalization. In other words, the project was broken into many isolated sub-projects. Most of the people managing each sub-project knew nothing about the other sub-projects. They would report to a superior, who would provide the information they needed. Within any particular sub-project, workers knew only enough to do their jobs. Only at the very top of the project were there people who knew about the Manhattan Project as a whole. Outside the project, only very limited number of government officials knew about the Manhattan Project, and they didn't know any details. It's worth noting that even Harry Truman knew nothing about it until he assumed the Presidency after Roosevelt's death in 1945. War-time security certainly helped. People accepted the need for limitations on what they could be told, and accepted that there were places they couldn't go. I'm sure it bothered people, but attributing things to \"the War Effort\" went a long way then. One of the popular signs of the times, posted at war factories, military bases and such, read something like, \"What you do here, what you see here, what you hear here -- when you leave here, let it stay here.\" That sort of thinking was quite widespread. There were security operatives who kept track of people in sensitive jobs. I've read accounts of people on leave (and even civilians in sensitive jobs were limited in what they could do on their time off) being chatted up by friendly, somewhat nosy people asking about their jobs. If you said too much about what you shouldn't have been talking about, you were going to end up having to explain yourself to some not so friendly people when you got back to work. If you were lucky, you might continue to have a well-paid job. I don't know what the worst result might have been, but I suspect it might have involved making license plates in some rural location with a lot of barbed wire fencing. ",

            "answer_text": "It didn\u2019t stay a secret. Scientists around the world knew it was being developed because of the sudden lack of communications among them and the ones assigned to the Manhattan Project. However, one of the Manhattan Project scientists said that developing a weapon based on nuclear fusion wouldn\u2019t be possible unless the entire country was turned into a factory dedicated to it. When he arrived in the US, he said that he now knew it would be possible because the entire country was indeed turned into a factory. That, and the fact that many of the scientists were Jewish and therefore slated for death by the Germans, ensured that the US would be the safe and productive country that developed the fission bomb as a weapon first. A great first hand account is found in the book The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes. I suggest to anyone who hasn\u2019t read this book to buy a copy and read it. It\u2019s a superb combination of philosophy, morality, and physics the way they should be taught. ",
