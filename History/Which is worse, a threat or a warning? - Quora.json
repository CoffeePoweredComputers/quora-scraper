            "answer_text": "A warning is to let you know that you\u2019re not safe or you\u2019ve done something wrong. It tells you that if you keep acting the way you are, things won\u2019t go your way. Either you\u2019ll be hurt by your own hand, or another will act against you. e.g. If you\u2019re late to school one more time, I\u2019ll have to put you in detention. A threat is to let you know that someone is angry with you, either for their own private reasons or because you provoked them in some way. They\u2019ll act against you, maybe even hurt you, and unlike someone warning they will choose this option before trying to change your mind and actions. e.g. I will find you, and I will kill you. The difference is that one warns of unpleasantness, and the other shows a want to personally cause you unpleasantness. ",
