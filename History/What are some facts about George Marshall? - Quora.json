            "answer_text": "After he was nominated Secretary of Defense, they passed a law that prevented Generals from that position until some time had passed. It had to be waived for Gen. Jim Mattis to take the position of SecDef. He is the only person to serve as both Secretary of Defense and State. While I was checking that fact, I found something weird I didn\u2019t know. Elliot Richardson (Nixon AG who resigned rather than perform the \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d) was SecDef for a few months. So Richardson held 4 different cabinet posts. Looking here, it appears he is the only person to do this. George Shultz had 4 \u201ccabinet level posts\u201d but OMB is not technically cabinet. Also, only person to hold 3 cabinet posts in same calendar year. Wow I\u2019m sorry, way off topic! ",
