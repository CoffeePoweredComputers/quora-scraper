            "answer_text": "The country with the lowest GDP per capita, according to IMF, World Bank, and CIA factbook independently, is the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The richest man in the Congo is most likely George Forrest, owner of the Forrest Group of mining companies.  I can't find any figures for his net worth, but Congolese politician Jean-Pierre Bemba has an estimated net worth in the hundreds of millions of USD. For comparison, the DRC has a GDP of around $15 billion, and a population of around 70 million, for a per-capita GDP of a little over $200, or about $0.60 / day.  (All figures USD). ",
