            "answer_text": "Why did it take three assassinations for people to figure out that the protection of U.S. presidents is a high priority? Three? To date there have been four U.S. Presidents who were assassinated, Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy. In addition, 35 attempts and plots on Presidents dating back to Andrew Jackson were discovered and foiled, including five attempts on Donald Trump alone, and he\u2019s only been President for three and 3/4th years. Plus the death of Warren Harding just prior to release of news of the Teapot Dome scandal was suspected to be an assassination. Harding was in Alaska when he became ill with what was thought to be food poisoning. He died of a stroke exactly one week later and his wife refused an autopsy. The attempt on Ronald Reagan in 1981 showed that a determined assassin could get through the best protection in the world. There have been attempts to assassinate every U.S. President since Kennedy. There have also been four attempts to assassinate Presidential candidates, one of them successful, Bobby Kennedy in 1968. The most notorious after Kennedy was an attempt on Theodore Roosevelt when he sought re-election for an nonconsecutive third term in 1912. He was waiting to give a campaign speech in Milwaukee, WI on October 14, 1912 when John Schrank, a German immigrant, shot him in the chest with a .38 revolver. A copy of his speech and his metal glasses case in his coat pocket saved Roosevelt\u2019s life by slowing the bullet, which lodged in his chest. He got up and made his speech, speaking for an hour before finally mentioning that he\u2019d been wounded. He was taken to a hospital where it was determined that it was more dangerous to remove it than to leave it. Roosevelt carried that bullet for the rest of his life.

            "answer_text": "I suspect protecting the president was always a high priority; it\u2019s just that how threats were perceived and processed has evolved over the years. When Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley were president, once could actually walk right into the White House and, with a bit of luck (or pull) meet with them personally. The idea that some random person could simply shoot them was considered unlikely (despite it happening several times. Apparently the Secret Service was slow to pick up on just how easily threatened the president\u2019s life was.) By the time Kennedy was president, security for the president had improved dramatically and was much closer to what we see today, though they still made mistakes. Kennedy\u2019s death spelled the end of the open air motorcade that had been a staple of politics for decades. John Hinkley\u2019s attack on Reagan in March of 1981 was another nasty little surprise that caught the Secret Service off guard, but it made them even more paranoid about protecting the president than ever before. As a result, today it is hard to imagine a sitting president ever being felled by an assassin (although one should never say never). The short answer to the question, then, is that over the century the president\u2019s security apparatus has learned and evolved into the truly formidable force it is today through trial and error\u2014though it cost four men their lives to make it that way.
