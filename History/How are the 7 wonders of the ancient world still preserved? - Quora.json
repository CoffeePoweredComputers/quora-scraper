It tends to vary which seven wonders are in the list, but of the seven of the Ancient History Encyclopedia, (the Great Pyramid, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Statue of Zeus, the Temple of Artemis, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the Colossus of Rhodes and the Lighthouse at Alexandria) Only the Great Pyramid is completely intact, and the Temple of Artemis has a single pillar standing of what was previously more than 100. The Great Pyramid is still preserved because its almost impossible to destroy, and the others have been destroyed by arsonists, conquerors or natural disasters. ",
