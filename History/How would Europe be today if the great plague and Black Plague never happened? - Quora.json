            "answer_text": "Interesting question! In Justinian\u2019s Flea, author William Rosen argues, or at least posits, that the bubonic plague of the 6th century destroyed Rome\u2019s ability to administer its empire, so that if the plague had not happened, Europe and North Africa might be a single, unified political structure\u2014 either a continuation of Rome, or a successor to Rome. But fast forwarding to the Black Plague of the 14th century, by the time of that outbreak, Europe had developed into separate nation-states. While the plague affected populations and affairs of state, it was not responsible for the downfall of any nation-state, or for any great change in the character of Europe. That said, the plague did break down the feudal structure\u2014 not enough people to work the land, so that farmers and peasants, who had previously been tied to the land by feudal duty, were much more mobile, and much better able to dictate their wages and living conditions. And one of the things that those farmers and peasants did was leave the land and go to the city, where they pursued commerce as an emerging middle class. That said, it is unlikely that the plague caused those societal changes, as much as it accelerated them. And of course, much has happened since. So without the plagues of the Middle Ages, history might have changed, but the ultimate makeup of European civilization would probably look much the same as it does today. ",
