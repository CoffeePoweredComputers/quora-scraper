            "answer_text": "Yes, due to a weird aspect of moose anatomy that its neck is weak and given the force of the bears paw if it hits the neck that area of the neck gives way. Otherwise a bear is only really able to decapitate human sized creatures and smaller. \u201cThe claim that an adult grizzly bear can decapitate a moose with one swipe of its paw is an established fact. The first reported event took place in Alaska in 1895 by a Russian miner who was hiking through the wilderness. According to his account, he witnessed a moose drinking from a stream when a Grizzly bear approached from the other side. Mooses are very territorial, and they are especially known to attack anything they perceive to be a threat to their water source. The moose charged full speed across the stream, and just as it neared the bear, the bear stood up and with a quick motion swiped the moose in the side of the face. The mooses head became decapitated and flew a distance of fifteen to twenty feet. ...and quick as a spark on a fire the grizzly bear stood up and swatted the moose in the face. Why it was if you or I would swat a fly, but the impact seemed to me as loud as a gunshot. And then I was absolutely flabbergasted and discombobulated to see, a great upsplash of blood, and the mooses head detatched from the body and landed not three feet from where I was hidden, its eyes staring right at me. The bear sat down immediately and began drinking from the stream as if nothing had happened, as if it were a regular occurance to go decapitating the head of a moose. Never in my life will I forget the power of the grizzly bear... The report was met by skepticism until noted American biologist Dr. Jacob MacDonaldson observed a similar event in the spring of 1954. MacDonaldson was observing the movements of a Grizzly bear when a moose walked into the same space. The grizzly bear perceived the moose to be a threat to the cubs, and roared to scare it off. But the moose began to graze. The bear then charged the moose, but again the moose did not move. The bear then lumbered over to the moose, and with a powerful swipe of its paw, decapitated the moose. Dr. MacDonaldson later retreived the moose head an autopsy found damage consistent with that of decapitation by impact. Later studies contribute the phenomenon to both the relative weakness of a mooses upper neck and the power of a grizzly bears arm. Although a grizzly bear is very powerful, it does not have the strength to decapitate most creatures larger than a man. A moose however is peculiar in the structure of its upperneck, which is weak, and any force that puts a significant and sudden pressure on the weakest point of the neck will inevitably cause decapitation. Since 1895, there have been 15 reported cases of Moose decapitation by Grizzly, and most scientists theorize it is a natural, albeit somewhat rare, event.\u201d https://boards.theforce.net/threads/an-adult-grizzly-bear-can-decapitate-a-moose-with-one-swipe-of-its-paw.16419039/",

            "answer_text": "In my humble opinion. It may have happened a couple of times in history. We have no real proof, I know there are loads of stories that say otherwise. As someone with a lot of experience with moose, and seeing how much of a beating they take from all types of automobiles(and huge 18 wheeler trucks) I would say no this is for the most part unfounded. You know given the fact we do not know the size of both of these animals in these stories\u2026anything is possible, especially if its a larger bear and a smaller moose. Also if either is sick or has a baby with them as both are very protective of young. So it is not out of the realm of possibility. Is defiantly not common, and not something you or anyone else would ever see. Unless you live in Alaska and even then, it is not likely. Grizzly bears will attack anything if hungry enough, but never underestimate a moose especially a bull moose who are insanely lean animals, so more of their weight is either antler or muscle, making their weight go much... much farther in a fight! Again just my opinion!! ",
