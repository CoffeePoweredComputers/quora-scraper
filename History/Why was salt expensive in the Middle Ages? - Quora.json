            "answer_text": "Any market is defined by the ratio of demand and supply. The higher the ratio the higher the price. Salt was together with drying and smoking the only way of preserving foodstuff up till well in the 20th century. In other words the demand was very high. There were 2 ways to get salt in those days: seasalt which was produced in certain areas, e.g. on the Atlantic coast such as the Vend\u00e9e or the Mediteranean coast such as in the Camargue and secondly from salt mines. As the rulers of the day were always in high need of cash they either appropriated the production (most mines in Europe were state controlled) or levied enormous taxes. Note that in a time when taxes were never above 10% (a lot of revolts ensued even at that rate) taxes on salt coild reach 50%. Anyway, salt demand was that high that it could genuinly be called white gold. ",

            "answer_text": "Because demand was through the roof.  Salting was pretty much the only way to store meat and fish for the long term so people all across Europe would have needed it.  The problem was, there were only two ways to produce salt: you could either extract it by boiling seawater or you could mine it.  Both techniques work, but they're expensive - it takes a lot of heat and therefore firewood to completely boil away a large amount of water and mining was slow and dangerous.  It meant that while there was typically a lot of salt available, the demand was so high that there was never a large enough surplus of salt to drive the price down. ",
