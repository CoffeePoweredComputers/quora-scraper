            "answer_text": "What is your impression about monks? I am an Oblate of St. Vincent Archabbey in Pennsylvania. Monks, like any group of men, fall all over the spectrum. Some of them I have a great respect for, others not so much. Of course, St. Vincent is a Benedictine monastery which was primarily founded to provide priests for, what was at that time, the the wilds of Western Pennsylvania. It was mining country, and there were an awful lot of immigrants working the mines, they were mostly Catholic, and the United States did not have enough vocations to provide priests for all of them. So Boniface Wimmer came over from Germany with maybe 30 monks, and built the monastery, a college, a seminary, and a parish. When I went to college there, back in 1972 there were maybe 250 monks in residence, and they had just had a huge fire which had burned over half the monastery/college complex. They had built a new monastery, but they have felt the vocations crunch as much as anybody, and are probably down to maybe 150 monks, there are very few left, at least active ones, from when I went to school there, although there are some. An awful lot of them have died or are confined to the infirmary. Saint Vincent Archabbey  ",
