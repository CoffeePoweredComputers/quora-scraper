            "answer_text": "Latin American dependencies spent three centuries being enslaved and exporting their wealth to benefit the aristocracies of Spain and Portugal, before achieving independence in 1820s. Litle or no industrialisation took place in South America until much later in the 19th century, and then it was often funded by overseas investors from the emerging financial centres in the USA. In the territories that became the USA various different things happened. The country was settled by immigrant farmers entrepreneurs and professionals who largely displaced the indigenous populations which please note remain relatively poor and disadvantaged to this day. In the south, huge numbers of slaves were imported to cultivate the land for cotton sugar and food, creating a wealthy land owning class . Please note the descendants of the slaves remain relatively poor and disadvantaged to this day. In the north, huge tracts of prairie were cleared of buffalo and farmed, creating a stable food supply and secondary industries in milling and distribution, and financial wealth. The American war of independence was about who would control and tax the growing wealth being created, and its success prevented Great Britain from exporting wealth in the same way as Spain and Portugal did. The American constitution establshed a relatively enlightened form of governance to fostet the industrial revolution fed by plentiful cheap labour from Europe and by abundant natural resources without the encumbrance of a landed aristocracy to act as a conservative brake and , with the exception of the civil war of the 1860s, the USA generally managed to steer clear of the kinds of revolution that Latin American countries had to go through and are still prone to have because of the social inequalities ingerited from their historical colonial masters. Social unrest, and broken populist or communist systems of government continue to afflict Latin American countries, such as Argentina in the 1970s, Colombia during the drug wars and Venezuela today, which have prevented them from economically exploiting and investing effectively in their natural resources. This is a qualified answer though. If you are a white educated middle class asset owning American you are lucky. If you are black, Hispanic, or white post industrial working class, your stability and prosperity will seem rather more fragile. America as a country is more stable and prosperous than any other but the cracks are appearing because of its growing wealth disparities and deep discontent in the sections of its population who frankly don't share in the fruits of stability and prosperity.

            "answer_text": "I don\u2019t have all the answers, but I would like to point out that the U.S. inherited, in somewhat modified form, the legal and political traditions of Great Britain, rather than Spain or Portugal. Neither part of Europe was flawless, and neither was without some virtues, but one culture proved more compatible with stability and prosperity than the others. It is noteworthy that when a speaker of English wishes to describe a violent seizure of power, he may use the French word \u201ccoup,\u201d or the German \u201cPutsch,\u201d or the Spanish \u201cgolpe\u201d; the English did not have occasion to coin a short word of their own to describe such an event. The European continent was war-torn, and to avoid being prey, each continental power needed a large, strong army, with all that was required to support it, which gave the king an instrument to use against a parliament or other rival power center. Britain, depending on a navy, which did not have as much capacity to be used in domestic politics, was not as militarized or army-mad as France, Prussia, or Russia. It was also not as bureaucratic; Spain, inheriting a late-Roman tradition, had a substantial bureaucracy to which men were appointed as salaried officials, not so much to get something done, but as a reward for having done something. Without as much bureaucracy, Britain and its American daughter society had a tradition of prominent men gaining honor by serving in Parliament, or in local office, or otherwise providing leadership, and not only as cogs in a military or bureaucratic machine. Also, whatever its considerable imperfections, the U.S. had the idea that all men were created equal (let\u2019s not say too much about the blacks and American Indians). Especially in the North, it was not as caste-ridden as a typical Latin American society. There was also a tradition of financing state and local government in large part by property taxes assessed according to the value of the property, and these were in part taxes on land, which discouraged holding vast tracts of little-used land merely on speculation, or for the prestige of being an haciendado. In the Spanish tradition, property was taxed according to what it produced, and other taxes, such as sales taxes, were imposed. While the difference between systems was not absolute (Britain and then the U.S. also had sales and excise taxes), it did have some impact on the incentives people faced, and on the chance that they would work hard to improve their property and rise in society.
