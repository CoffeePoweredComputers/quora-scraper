            "answer_text": "Before the colonization of North America there were no earthworms. The forest floors were covered by slowly decaying leaves that provided nutrients to shallow rooted young trees and certain other plants that depended on nutrients near the surface. Earthworms were introduced by the Europeans. Earthworms digested these leaves and recycled their nutrients deeper in the soil. Thus numerous types of trees and plants died out. The biodiversity of the forests was reduced, while trees and plants that naturally grew deeper roots benifited. Invasive earthworms of North America - Wikipedia Plus, of course, the very appearance of the forests changed. Other animals introduced by the Europeans, such as pigs, cows and sheep also changed the environment. Two interesting books on this topic are A Plague of Sheep which describes how grazing by sheep introduced into Mexico by the Spanish changed the ecology of parts of Mexico.  Amazon.com: A Plague of Sheep: Environmental Consequences of the Conquest of Mexico (Studies in Environment and History) (9780521574488): Elinor G. K. Melville: Books And Creatures of Empire which describes how European animals changed the balance of nature in North America. To the advantage of Europeans and the disadvantage of the Indians.

            "answer_text": "Depends on where you were. Large parts of North America, from pueblo societies in what\u2019s now the American Southwest, through the Great Plains, and into what\u2019s now the US eastern seaboard were occupied by people living in villages performing agriculture based on corn, beans, and squash. Environment naturally had an impact on this, with the southwest being less densely inhabited than the northeast. The eastern part of the continent was heavily forested, but it was apparently well-managed forest, with little underbrush relative to European forests. Forest-dwelling natives likely burned off vegetation to keep paths clear for deer, easy travel, and other purposes. But not everybody was a farmer. Hunting and gathering lifestyles still predominated along the west coast and in more northerly regions like Canada. Coastal Indians did a lot of fishing, And some people hunted buffalo on the plains, though not nearly as many or as intensively as they did once they acquired horses from the Spanish. ",
