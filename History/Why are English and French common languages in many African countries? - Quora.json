            "answer_text": "Because of colonialism. The British and French colonized most of Africa, with Belgium colonizing the Congo Basin, and Portugal colonizing Angola and Mozambique. Britain and France established educational systems that used English and French. They encouraged the use of the colonial languages as lingua francas. They brought promising young people to France and Britain for higher education. I don't mean to make colonialism sound so benign; it wasn't, and many evils came with it. But this is how the languages became established. ",

            "answer_text": "Africa has been a host to linguistic outbounds. Right from inviting outsiders in their native countries, the country turned out to not just giving up on their resources by the invaders but, turning the tables in the form of learning new avenues of life. One of the results of diverse invasions turned out to be the linguistical additions to the continent. Spiced up with the contributions of colonialization coming from the British and French, there are 115 million French and 130 million English speakers in Africa, currently. ",
