            "answer_text": "Between Napoleon and Hitler, which came closest to defeating Russia? Probably Hitler. Before both wars, Russian General command made the same mistake: concentrating almost all troops too close to the border, without any strategical depth. In both cases, Russians (OK, Soviets for the 20th century, but I will simplify) were forced eastwards by a superior enemy. But, with vast differences. In 1812, the Russian General-in-Command Barclay de Tolly, as well as later Kutuzov, applied a superior strategical maneuver and saved the army. Napoleon\u2019s forces were stretched thin in the Russian distances. Napoleon\u2019s colossal mistake was attacking Moscow instead of the capital St. Petersburg to capture the Tsar. A strike of Kutuzov genius was to sacrifice Moscow to win the war. Napoleon\u2019s troops were marauding in Moscow and around and losing moral all fall 1812, whereas Russia mobilized and drilled fresh forces. Then, Russian saboteurs burned Moscow, which caused the food shortage for French.  When Napoleon decided to leave Moscow in late fall, it was his second strategic mistake. In a series of minor but bloody battles, he was forced to retreat the same way he advanced in Summer. No military or food supply, but the Russian army and partisans attacking day and night.  First, the rainy fall when the roads looked like rivers, then the winter.   Napoleon has been defeated with a relatively few losses of Russian lives and infrastructure. In 1941, the strategic mobility was on the German side. We must remember the Wehrmacht was extremely strong and motivated, way superior to any European army of the time. They just defeated France in a few weeks. Purges and mismanagement weakened the Red Army, and it was not battle-experienced. This German superiority did cost at least 3 million (!!!!) of Russians killed or captured by the Germans between June and October 1941.  Russian POWs had only 36% chances to survive (from ca. 6.3 million died ca. 4 million. Source: B.V. Sokolov, The Cost of War: Human Losses for the USSR and Germany, 1939\u20131945, in: The Journal of Slavic Military Studies 9 (1996), p. 152\u2013193). In comparison, \u0441\u0430. 66% of German POWs survived the USSR captivity). Almost the whole regular Red Army has been defeated, more than the half of all warplanes destroyed (many of them on the ground by German bombs), the best land occupied. In fall 1941 Germans were close to winning the war, closer than Napoleon ever did.  Red Army did win the war only by huge sacrifices and mass heroism on the front       and in the production of a military device 24/7     The victory 1945 did cost 100 times more both in human lives and material than in 1813.  In 1812, all countries followed some rules in a war. They plundered but did not kill the civilians, and had no physical opportunities, to bomb and destroy the entire cities. In 1941, the total war killed more civilians than the troops. Artillery and aviation eliminated cities killing all live inside.  The siege of Leningrad alone (by German and Finnish armies) caused more death than the entire Napoleon wars in the 19th century.  ",

            "answer_text": "Absolutely Napoleon. Napoleon and Hitler were fighting two different wars. Napoleon\u2019s war aim was political in nature: force Tsar Alexander to rejoin the Continental System, and most probably cede some territory to Poland. French and Russian high command were in agreement as to what he had to do to achieve this: decisively crush the Russian army before Russian reserves could be brought to bear. If he did that, Russia would surrender. Hitler, meanwhile, was fighting a war of annihilation. The Nazis wanted nothing less than the complete annexation of European Russia, followed by the ethnic cleansing or genocide(whichever was easier) of the literate native populations of those lands, and the enslavement of the illiterate peasant population to German settlers. This would have required not just the total annihilation of the Red Army but the total and uncontested occupation of those territories. Hitler never came close to totally defeating the Red Army. He did come close to occupying Moscow, which one might see as a victory condition; however, I\u2019d argue that he wouldn't have been able to, between the partisans and the still intact Red Army, pacify the conquered territory while also holding it against partisans. He would still have lost eventually. Napoleon came extremely close to decisively defeating the Imperial Russian Army. Russian Marshals Mikhail Kutuzov and Mikhail Barclay de Tolly, recognizing both Russia\u2019s short term weakness relative to Napoleon\u2019s Empire and her long term strength in numbers, decided on a Fabian strategy against the French: the Russian standing army, outnumbered by over 3:1 by the Grande Armee, would retreat, counting on attrition and Russia\u2019s vast size to whittle down the French numbers while Russia mobilized her population for war. Then, Russia would counterattack and drive out the French. The strategy generally speaking worked fine. The problems, however, were twofold: first, it was extremely unpopular politically. The Tsar and his generals were called cowards by the nobility, and some in the army itself, such as Prince Pyotr Bagration. Thus, the monarchy was being damaged politically by giving up so much land to the invader. Secondly, Napoleon\u2019s army wasn't being drained of manpower fast enough. By September Napoleon was almost at Moscow, and still outnumbered the Russian army by tens of thousands of men. Alexander I, deciding that giving up Moscow without a fight would be untenable, ordered Mikhail Kutuzov to prepare face Napoleon in battle. Kutuzov set up defenses at a small village called Borodino, just west of Moscow. It was here that Napoleon would have his pitched battle. It was here that the fate of two Empires would be decided.  A map of the battle Kutuzov had picked an excellent location. Borodino was placed amongst rolling hills and unfriendly terrain; maneuver for Napoleon on a large scale was simply not possible. He had no choice but to attack into fortified Russian positions, slowly pushing the Russians back at great loss of life. Eventually the Russian defense concentrated around the so-called Great Redoubt, which the French savaged with superior artillery fire; nonetheless, it was the scene of vicious close-quarters fighting. The French eventually gained superiority in cavalry and used that cavalry to finally push the Russians out of the Great Redoubt. Napoleon had won the battle. Unfortunately for him, it wasn't the decisive victory he had been hoping for\u2026 yet. The Russian army was retreating and in disarray, and the path to its baggage train was wide open, but the French army, exhausted from the fighting, was in no state to pursue. However, Napoleon had a group of soldiers who had yet to fight: the Old Guard. These were the Emperor\u2019s most elite soldiers; had he deployed them at this point, they would have been able to capture the Russian supplies, take out huge numbers of Russian soldiers, and possibly gain Napoleon his victory. And yet, Napoleon dithered. He had always been wary of deploying the Guard, as part of their advantage was in their reputation: they had never been defeated on the field. If they were routed, the impact on French morale could be catastrophic, as, in fact, happened at the Battle of Waterloo. Now, at this point there was no way that the Russian army could have resisted the Guard; they were in disarray and the Guard were fresh. However, the Russians still had the capacity to resist and still had a large amount of artillery in the field; without a doubt, the Guard would suffer grievous casualties. Napoleon, deciding to preserve the Guard for another battle, did not commit them. He was so used to preserving his most valuable unit for the decisive battle that he did not realize that the decisive battle had come. And, though the Russians had retreated, they had won Borodino. Alexander could now claim he had fought tooth and nail to defend Moscow only to fail tragically. Napoleon would take the city only to find it a burning wreck. He would retreat from Russia, his once proud Grande Armee reduced to 10,000 men out of 400,000, to face the combined armies of Russia, Austria, and Prussia in 1813. But that is a story for another day. Napoleon\u2019s strategic imperative in his invasion was to defeat the Russian army in a decisive battle. He got that decisive battle and he won a victory; it was one decision, not committing the Guard, that kept him from sealing the deal. I cannot point to any single decision Hitler or any of his Field Marshals made that prevented them from achieving their strategic objectives in such a way. Napoleon came far closer to winning than Hitler did. ",

            "answer_text": "To now who was closer to defeating Russia, you have to first look at their objectives. The objective of Napoleon was to make Russia enter the continental blockade against Britain. In order to achieve it, he wanted to destroy the Russian main army to force the Tzar Alexander I to sign a peace treaty. Whereas the aim of Hitler was the colonization of the land west of the Ural mountains by German farmers, with the native people being their workers. To my mind, Hitler came much closer to achieving his objectives, he was able to capture Belarus, the Baltic states and most of Ukraine. This includes large cities like Kyiv, Minsk, Riga, and Kharkiv that were key to the Soviet economy. Because of this, the Soviets had to transfer most of their industry behind the Urals, this process took a lot of time and prevented the Soviets from achieving the total yield of their industry in autumn 1941. At the same time, he managed to destroy most of the 1941 Red Army killing or capturing around 3 million Soviet soldiers. In addition, it took 3 years and millions of casualties for the Red Army to push the Germans out of the Soviet Union. Remember that the initial number of opposing forces was 1.44 Axis soldiers to 1 Soviet one, that is much smaller than the advantage that Napoleon had in 1812, which was at least 2 French or allied soldiers per 1 Russian soldier. In fact, in 1941 the Soviets had both more tanks and artillery than the Axis forces, this makes Hitler\u2019s achievements even bigger. Meanwhile, Napoleon found only burned down villages with no economic or strategic value. Despite the fact that he captured Moscow he found it-empty, with all the resources being taken away by the citizens who left the city before his arrival. Then Moscow was burned down too and more and more evidence is suggesting that it was done by the Russians themselves. When it comes to completing his objectives, the main Russian army under Kutuzov avoided big confrontations with Napoleon until Smolensk (which wasn\u2019t a decisive battle and only involved a part of the opposing armies), and then Borodino was he found the Russian army in well prepared defensive positions. But even there Napoleon did not manage to score a decisive defeat on the Russian army, the Russians were able to retreat to fight another day. In contrast with Hitler\u2019s campaign were the Germans were forced out of the Soviet Union by large Soviet offensives, Napoleon\u2019s Grande Arm\u00e9e retreat by themselves as their logistical system was too weak to sustain an army so far away from France and he couldn\u2019t do anything but to retreat by that point of the campaign. You have to add to this that the Werchmacht managed to retreat from Russia with a large standing army that would be then capable of defending Germany, whereas Napoleon lost 90% percent of his army and had to rebuild the Grande Arm\u00e9e from scratch.

            "answer_text": "Likely Hitler: Napoleon took Moscow for awhile (which Hitler did not I admit) but otherwise France\u2019s occupation of Russian land ws brief versus the Germans (last than a year versus more than 3 for Hitler). The Germans held a big chunk of Russia\u2019s manpower, break basket, resource and industrial capacity for much of the war. Meanwhile the Grande Armee was crushed, or froze to death, decisively by early 1813. Perhaps 30,000 out of the 600,000 troops Napoleon sent to Russia managed to get away, Contrast this the Germans recovering in early 1942 or even 1943 after Stalingrad, Napoleon had no real chance of beating Russia after 1812 but arguably Hitler had a decent chance in 1942. And sheer casualties and losses alone Napoleon lost a lot more proportionately versus Hitler. The Germans inflicted 4 million casualties against vastly more losses regarding tans, artillery and planes, while Napoleon and Russian losses ended up not that far apart. ",

The Soviet Union lost battles, but never the \u201cwar\u201d. The objectives were also not the same. Napoleon had nothing in particular against Russia or the Russian people, and wanted to force Russia into the Continental System and stop trade with the UK, while Hitler sought the total and complete annihilation of the Soviet Union, it\u2019s people, it\u2019s culture.

Napoleon on the other hand went into Moscow, but it was burned by the retreating Russians, and Napoleon had Moscow, but no food. In the spring he had to retreat and the Russian army just decimated the remaining French soldiers. Hitler still had his army could have sent up winter clothing, and attacked in the spring with the possibility of taking Moscow, but that doesn\u2019t mean he would have won the war. ",

            "answer_text": "Hitler did. Napoleon invaded Russia on a narrow front and stormed to Moscow. But he did not threaten to destroy Russia\u2019s economic lifeblood. Most of Russia\u2019s farmland and other resources remained beyond his reach. He did not threaten Russia\u2019s existence as a state. He did not murder millions of Russians. Indeed, on reaching Moscow in September 1812, he expected to negotiate a peace treaty with the Czar! But the Czar refused to negotiate. Contrast this with Hitler. The Nazis invaded on a much broader front. They conquered and occupied almost all of European Russia. These areas included the Baltic States, Belarus, the Ukraine, the Crimea, and large areas near and in the Caucasus Mountains, They deprived Russia of a huge amount of farmland and natural resources. They destroyed much of Russia\u2019s industries. They murdered millions of Russians. They threatened Russia\u2019s existence as a state. Their \u201cpeace terms\u201d would have left Russia broken up into multitudes of weak states, and Western Russia to the Urals under direct and harsh Nazi domination. If Hitler\u2019s campaign had succeeded in 1941 or 1942, the result would have been far harsher and enduring than the harsh 1918 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Lastly, Hitler attracted many Russian collaborators. About 900,000 Russians fought in the German Army, the SS, or other German-sponsored paramilitary or police units. Napoleon attracted far fewer Russian collaborators. Howard Lederman ",
