            "answer_text": "Why did the Mongols raze Baghdad? because they could. Baghdad wasn\u2019t the 1st city where the Mongols engaged in the extermination and destruction of a place. it probably wasn\u2019t the 20th city to endure such a fate. the Mongols left a trail of murder and destruction across Eurasia. the Mongol invasions were a huge step back for civilization as a whole. the Mongols destroyed flourishing civilizations like no one before or since. they engaged in destruction and extermination on a level not even the Nazis did. they murdered men women and children when it was completely unnecessary. in their march of conquest they destroyed numerous hospitals, libraries and centers of learning. the ruins of cities like Riazan and Merv who never recovered from the Mongol destruction bear mute testimony. what art, letters and scientific knowledge was carelessly obliterated by Mongol thugs we will never know. i totally agree with Professor C P Fitzgerald. \u201cthe Mongols were the pre-industrial equivalent of atomic war. They destroyed flourishing cities and regions. They halved the 12th century population of China by killing nearly everyone in the cradle of Chinese civilization, in the \u201cLand within the Passes\u201d\u009d of Northern and North West China. The almost complete massacre of the Hsia population altered the balance of Chinese civilization from Northern-dominated to Southern-led. A region which in T'ang times had been wealthy and cultured, as the Buddhist Scriptures and cave monasteries prove, became a semi-desert, the poorest and most backward part of the China.\" i love the notion that by murdering unarmed men, women and children the Mongols were using the extermination in order to save lives! talk about Orwellian. yes they had to destroy Baghdad,Moscow, Beijing, Samarkan, Kiev, Aleppo, Merv and Herat in order to save them. yeah and the Nazi atrocities were also a gallant effort to save lives and the Japanese massacres in China, Singapore and the Philippines were all motivated by good intentions as well.

            "answer_text": "I believe the answer would be the fact that the invading force had such low numbers compared to the population of Baghdad and also the mongols belonged to the least civilized culture which lived a tribal life with murder and loot being common thus encouraging the massacre and destruction in order to achieve dominance through terror which would affect the entirety of Abbasid caliphate forcing surrounding towns to submit without putting up a fight therefore being instrumental in the conquest. We could also put to consideration factors contributing towards that event such as the continued refusal of caliph Al-Musta'sim to submit to the khanate of Hulagu and offer payment of tribute in the form of military support for Mongol forces stationed in Persia. Al-Musta'sim had also refused the last proposal of Hulagu demanding his acquiescence to the terms imposed by M\u00f6ngke which might have further influenced his decision to raze Baghdad to the ground in order to set an example.
