            "answer_text": "Some indigenous peoples haven\u2019t left their nomadic lifestyles yet, and may never. Some prehistoric peoples had a sedentary lifestyle. A Neanderthal in Europe, for instance, was found to have never ventured more than 50 miles from the valley where it lived. Other ancestral populations were almost certainly the same way. During the Last Glacial Maximum, some populations may even have been confined to a sedentary or near-sedentary lifestyles. During warm periods, certain human populations have been confined to islands as well. So the answer is actually \u201cThey didn\u2019t. Humans sometimes switch from sedentary to nomadic lifestyles and vice versa.\u201d Having said that, there was a big switch to sedentary lifestyles during the agricultural revolution. 90% of male y DNA lineages went extinct, and they were most if not all nomadic hunter-gatherer lineages. So since the agriculturalist had greater numbers than the nomads, they were able to assimilate them better into their societies. We took nomadic hunter gatherer women, and killed or drove many nomadic men to extinction. ",

            "answer_text": "I thing for the first time somebody notice that if you plant a seed it will grow. Hunter gatherers already knew what to eat. They knew of plants that matured in one season, they knew the time of year to go to areas where they can find food.When they realized they can plant the seeds from these plants,they started to grow their own food. People can make more permanent shelters, people grushed grain into flour which allowed them to get sufficient proteins and hunting became less necessary and by growing edible grains would draw herbivores which drew the the animals to them. These animals eventually corralled and demesticated. It was a much more stable life style. Food was more guaranteed and offspring wre healthy and a higher infact survival rate. Population kept growing and growing to today. The Earth has 90 billion people living on it ",
