            "answer_text": "I would imagine that a lot of the young adults of any generation felt nostalgic to some extent. But I think that pop culture changes more quickly than it used to, and technological advances certainly happen very quickly now. It's a relatively new phenomena that a person can experience so many cultural changes just over the course of their childhood and adolescence. I was born in \u201891, so I'm slightly older than the young adults you're talking about. I definitely feel that the \u201990s was a completely different era than now. Recently, I jokingly called my age demographic \u201cthe casette tape generation\u201d, but in all seriousness, it is a little strange that even something as normal as the experience of listening to music has changed several times just in my lifetime.
