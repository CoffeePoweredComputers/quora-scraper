            "answer_text": "My father passed away in September 2003, sixteen years after my mother, and in his will he left his house in a village in the countryside to myself and the rest of his estate, mainly in the form of considerable cash savings, to my sister. My wife and I decided that we would sell the property, but before doing that we thought we would do some refurbishment. Some paving slabs on the patio had to be refixed, as did some bricks on a small garden retaining wall, and also some work was need to remedy the damage done by damp inside the separate brick garage. Inside the house we did some cosmetic refurbishment, completely redecorating most of the interior of the house (in matt white paint), putting in some new carpets where the old ones had worn out, and leaving the curtains in the windows and the lampshades on the lights. As finishing touches we hung three pictures on the lounge wall, indicating that these were included in the sale. One was a big picture showing an aerial photograph of the village, another smaller picture showed a recent aerial photograph of the property, and another of similar size showed an aerial photograph of the property in 1964 before my father purchased and renovated it. It was about September 2004 when this work was completed, and so we then contacted a local estate agent who viewed the property and valued it at \u00a3220,000. Although we thought the house was now well presented and in a desirable village in the countryside, we were initially disappointed when the estate agent reported little interest from prospective purchasers. I thought that one of the reasons for this was the unappealing photograph used by the estate agent in his advertisement of the property in the local newspaper and in the window of his premises. The rear corner of the property was facing the camera in this photograph and so I asked the estate agent to revisit the property and take a better photograph and use that instead. After he had done this, there were more viewings of the house, but we did not finally conclude the deal to sell it until February 2005, five months after we had put it on the market. After some hard bargaining we had to secure the deal by reluctantly accepting a price of \u00a3203,000. At this price, the house was the most expensive thing I have ever sold in my life. ",

            "answer_text": "I sold this outboard motor. This was last year when I was 15 and I sold it for $1200. thing leaked like a bitch I had to get rid of it. During the summer I buy and sell outboards. I managed to turn $75 into 1500 ish dollars. First I bought an 80\u2019s 2hp outboard on sunday. met a dude at home depot sold it for $200 on monday. I then paid $225 for 3 outboards. I sold one for $500. One was scrap, and one was made into our mailbox. Then for $425 I bought a 2011 evinrude 25 HO, a beast, 200 pound motor which i really struggled in moving around. I did around $50 worth of tune up, but broke two important bolts. I sold it cheap to dealer for $1000, they mustve fixed the bolts and flipped it. I bought this nissan for $1150. Used it all summer and fed up with the problems. Within the past year it's the most expensive thing i've sold. In years prior it wouldve been my dirt bike but thats a story to tell once the statue of limitations are up on some things. lol  ",
