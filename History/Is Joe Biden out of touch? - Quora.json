            "answer_text": "Old Joe is one of those guys who it seems has been around forever, but has never done anything of note. You can tell that when he\u2019s introduced at Dem rallies. They talk about his \u201cyears in the senate and his time as VP,\u201d but nobody can remember a single thing he\u2019s accomplished. Let\u2019s face it, Joe\u2019s never held a real job in his nearly eight decades of life. He's always been on the public dole. He got kicked out of college once for plagiarism, then got elected as a local pol in a homogeneous village state, then stumbled into a senate job where never had his name on a single piece of significant legislation. As Hussein\u2019s VP, he lived up to his reputation as a hapless, jovial, often confused \u201dyes man, \u201d making muddled speeches and attending funerals. He was always in the background, usually ignored. So, lost touch? The fact is, he was never in touch. He's a glorified bureaucrat, living off the government, though somehow a multi-millionaire, performing menial duties. In his senior years, he's come to rely on handlers and speechwriters, all of whom say a daily prayer he won't go off script, because when he does, he's not just out of touch, he's out of control. Elect Uncle Joe and you'll get the proverbial empty suit, an unoriginal, unimaginative and thoroughly uninspiring figurehead. Which might be okay if his puppet masters weren't so dangerous and devious. A Biden presidency would put some sinister, far left, shifty characters in control of the country and Happy Joe would keep smiling while the country went to Hell. Best Joe retire to one of the several, million dollar homes he owns than to the White House. Eight decades of this boring blunderpuss is enough. ",

            "answer_text": "I haven\u2019t quite decided what the heck is wrong with him, but something seriously is. Being \u201cout of touch\u201d is about as good of an explanation as I have ever heard. As evidenced by all of his gaffes. Making racial slurs. Challenging Trump & others to arm wrestling and push up contests at the age of 78. Not knowing where he is half the time or what state he\u2019s in. Being unable or unwilling to keep his slimy hands to himself when he\u2019s been repeatedly told to. His campaign slogan is \u201cNo Malarkey\u201d ?? LOL Yelling at and becoming noticeably agitated with Trump, voters and journalists who dare to question him about his son and the situation in Ukraine as if he thinks he\u2019s above reproach. Meanwhile he\u2019s being called Quid Pro Quo Joe\u2026. Reminiscing about his High School days w/ \u201cCorn Pop, The really bad dude.\u201d Telling the story about his blonde leg hair and how the kids loved to play with it\u2026.. and on and on. WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM??? And he wants to be President of the United States???? God help us all ",
