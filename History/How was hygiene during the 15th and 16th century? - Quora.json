            "answer_text": "It was not as bad as some people show it to be. People washed at least once a week, at the very minimum. Middle class went to the bathhouses almost every day (you had to pay to use those). A lot of the bathhouses were left over from the Roman eras. Upper class and nobility went to either more luxurious bathhouses, or bathed at home. Poor people that couldn't afford bathhouses washed in rivers and lakes. Soap was know to humans for quite a while, and it was certainly made and used during this time period. Toothpaste of herbs and/or charcoal was used to clean teeth. Hands were washed before eating. Rich people even had parties involving bathing.   The Catholic Church disapproved the bathhouses because men and women washed together, as you can see, and some bathhouses became pretty much brothels. There also was a bath medicine, which involved taking baths with specific herbs. ",

            "answer_text": "Since there was no notion about the existence of germs, people didn\u2019t really care about hygiene, except about the smell. Bathing was a personal matter. Some people bathed everyday (that was considered morally dubious, and going to bathouses was discouraged by the Church as they were more brothels than just bathouses, but they were frequented by virtually everyone in the towns, except the most pious and the most poor, who couldn\u2019t afford them). Some people bathed once a week or once every two weeks, and that could be done at home. Some people bathed only twice a year and some people boasted about never bathing, and that was considered pious. Queen Isabella of Spain boasted about having bathed only twice in her life - when she was born and the day she married. Whether it was true, no one can know. ",
