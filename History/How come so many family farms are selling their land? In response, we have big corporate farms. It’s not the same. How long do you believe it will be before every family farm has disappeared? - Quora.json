            "answer_text": "I am assuming you are asking this about family farms in the US? The question asked is actually two different questions or issues. FIRST, yes it is true the number of family farms are decreasing. This is primarily due to the need of any farm to become larger to achieve economies of scale (in equipment, labor, production, and purchasing ability) to be able to remain profitable. You can\u2019t generate enough revenue and thus profit to raise a family on 40 acres like you could in the 1800\u2019s, or 80 acres like you could in 1900; or 160 acres like you could in 1940; or 320 acres like you could in 1970. Thus the number of actual farms and farmers are decreasing but the amount of land being farmed is roughly the same (though this is actually decreasing also as urbanization, roads, etc. eat up some land). Average farm size now is something like 800 to 2,000 acres. There are some smaller farms around but usually the farmer also has an off-farm job. Livestock farms face the same issues. Gone are the days where farmers raised ten sheep, a few milk cows, some beef cattle and some pigs on their farm for their own needs and some extra to trade/barter/sell. Livestock production has become larger scale and more productive. No longer do you leave cattle out in the snow in the winter but have climate controlled sheds for them, etc. Consumers aren\u2019t willing to pay to have multiple small, inefficient farms around producing livestock like we did 100 years ago. Related to this is the general public perception of what a \u201cfarm\u201d really is. The public has this romantic vision of old farmer McDonald, a red barn, small tractor, a few chickens running around and horses on the farm that you see in children\u2019s books. Farming is a BUSINESS; and farmers are in business to make MONEY to support their families, their lifestyles, retirement, etc. A farm is closer to a small family owned factory than it is to those children\u2019s books anymore. The market (commodity prices, consumers, price levels, global competition, etc.) determine what farmers grow and raise to earn that hard-earned profit. SECOND - the other issue or question here is why are family farms selling their land. There are a few reasons for this. In some cases the farm is not making money anymore and the farmer has burned through all their equity so they have to sell-out. This is not that common (not anywhere like it was in the 1980\u2019s farm crisis but the current period of low commodity prices is stressing farms again). The biggest reason is that farmer\u2019s are aging (like the general population in the US). They are having or had smaller size families (like the general population in the US, farm families have one or two or three kids now and not 6 or 8 or 12 like the old days). Most of these farm kids choose NOT to go into farming (often encouraged by their parents who don\u2019t want them to work so hard in an unpredictable market hoping to make money) and choose other careers, education, etc. Many simply want to live in bigger cities with all the activities that occur there versus living out in the middle of no-where on a farm. You add all this up and many farmers are in or past retirement age, decide they want to quit farming and retire, have no family member to sell or take-over the farm so they put the farm up for auction and cash-out (just like any other small factory or family business might do). Finally, people perceive that these \u201cbig corporate farms\u201d are taking over the world. The data does not support this. In the midwest (depending on the year) roughly 75% of the farm land that comes up for sale is sold to other farmers (and the rest to investors or corporations). In many states (such as Iowa) large corporations are not legally allowed to purchase farmland. Yes, you have many family farms incorporated as a farm corporation, S corporation, etc. but this is not so they can take over the world or become the next Monsanto but rather for tax reasons and liability protection (again, just like any other family owned business, store or factory). The vast, vast, vast majority of these farm corporations are other family members. The family farm is not going to go away, but they will change how they look like. They will get larger. They will look like more of a business than a \u201cway of life\u201d or your children\u2019s story book. Grain and niche market farmers likely will remain family farms. Livestock farms are more likely to be vertically integrated with a corporation owning the consumer side, packing plants, breeding stock, and business and subcontracting to family farmers to raise or feed-out the livestock (i.e. the dirty, daily work).

            "answer_text": "What you ask seems to be true today, but it may not remain so. Economies of scale favour larger operations in times of growth. Everyone alive today has never known anything but growth. But it is simply not possible for growth to continue forever \u2014 the planet has a fixed size! We are already hitting both resource limits, and pollution limits that will eventually, perhaps as soon as the next decade or so, cause growth to stall, and then actually reverse. When growth goes into permanent, irrevocable decline, I expect people will, by necessity, become more intimately involved with sourcing their own food. 150 years ago, it took twelve people on the land to support just one in the city. Today, some 700 people live in cities for each person farming. A return to the mean is inevitable. As subsistence farming becomes necessary, globalization will reverse, and economies of scale will no longer be favourable. Expect the return of the family subsistence farm, big time, by mid-century. So why not beat the rush? Start growing food now! Even in an apartment, you can grow food on your windowsill. With a balcony, you can have Scarlet Runners! And you can grow an amazing amount on a city lot. ",
