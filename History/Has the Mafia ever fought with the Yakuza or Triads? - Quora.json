            "answer_text": "My knowledge is extremely limited in this subject matter, so I\u2019ll try my best. As far as I can tell, there have been no large scale conflicts between the 3 groups. However, it should also be noted that the Triads are a LOT looser in organization to the Mafia and the Yakuza, especially the lower you get into their organization. Though perhaps the documentaries in prison life in North America (which seems to be dominated by a lot of Hispanics, no racism intended) might shed some light to their political dynamics; the dominant faction is the one with the largest bodies in any given area, and everyone else toe the line in a tense truce of sorts. I\u2019m assuming the 3 groups have their own specific spheres of influence, and usually try not to intrude into each other\u2019s territory. Any scuffles are most likely resolved diplomatically, and/or happen so deep in society\u2019s underbelly that we\u2019ll never really know (could be more horrifying than we imagined, or perhaps extremely mundane). Last thing they want is too much publicity. I suppose it\u2019s like the empires of old, who often had to consider politics and logistics in every operation. ",

They want to make money and they know that open Warfare with another criminal organization would lead to increased scrutiny from law enforcement. Real-life Mobsters who have watched The Sopranos highlighted a specific line from one episode they said was 100% accurate. \u201cYou wanna go to the mattresses or you wanna make money?\u201d Going to the mattresses is a phrase meaning go to war. Basically the boss is asking another mobster if he would rather go to war or make money. And he's asking it rhetorically since clearly both of them would much rather make money than fight a war ",

My reasoning for this is because when the Yakuza was at their height, which I believe was the 1970s, the Mafia would be in a massive delcine as the Colombians were taking away their business, The FBI was far more aggressive toward them after J Edgar Hoover\u2019s death, and they really only had influence in Real Estate. Also I\u2019m pretty sure the Yakuza was only, or at least mostly in Japan, which Italian communities sure don\u2019t live in to form some mafia, and if they did, it would be driven out easily. ",

There is a Russian mafia which operates all the way out in Vladivostok, and probably fights with a Triad in eastern China, but the American New York mafia probably hasn't ever gotten into it with anyone outside the states. Same for Triads. The yakuza is a shadow of its form self, so I doubt it. Maybe during the seventies. ",
