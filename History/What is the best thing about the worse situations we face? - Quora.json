            "answer_text": "Life\u2019s best lessons are learnt when we face our worst situations in life. Whatever be the type or nature of worst situations that they may be. Financial. Relationship. At work. Illnesses. You can add to this list. You can learn from others\u2019 experiences too but nothing like learning from your own. But you need to keep your mind open. Always. To reflect, introspect, to look within, and to learn your lessons for your life. And retain the lessons learnt for use whenever they are required. Share with others too for their benefit. Wish to share with my dear Quorans some of the select worse situations that I faced and what I learnt from each one of them. Please do bear in mind that these are specific to me and contextual. Death of my elder brother who committed suicide when he was 24 and I was 23: I have shared the details in Quora about this already. For me the lesson from this incident was all about relationship and priorities in life, and not just ambitions, achievements and materialistic goals.Loss of a kidney in an emergency and exploratory surgery when i was 24: I did not even know until i regained consciousness after a long duration, emergency and exploratory surgery that I have lost one of my kidneys. Permanently. While my family was disturbed and devastated, especially seen in the context of my brother\u2019s death just a year earlier, I was very sure that I will recover and move forward, given my young age and my fitness then. I did recover quickly and the situation taught me to \u2018expect the unexpected\u2019. Life is predictably unpredictable.Bankruptcy in business and the six years struggle that followed: This one was really tough as it had impacted me from various dimensions - financial, economic, relationships and social standing. The most important lessons that I learnt from this were - relationships are the most important thing in life, you need to reframe and reinvent yourself constantly if you have to come out of a monumental challenge like this, life is larger than just the financial dimension though it is critical, and never forget those related and unrelated faces who helped and supported you when you were a nobody. To be a good human being is more important than anything else in life. You need to return to the society and community what you have gained at some point in time. The last point in turn led me and my wife to set up ShikshaDaan Foundation, a NGO, that provides scholarships to needy students to pursue their higher education. We have quit our full time corporate jobs to work for ShikshaDaan Foundation since March 2015, travelling across India to meet stakeholders in education in all the 676 districts in our country.Despite the challenges that I have faced, my life has been very fulfilling and satisfying. I yearn for more challenges, as every challenge gives me an opportunity to learn something new. Renew myself.  ",

            "answer_text": "According to me, the worst situations that you face give you the best experiences of life. You get to see the real face of people close to you, be it your friends, relatives or whoever. You get to know that people who used to say that they can do anything for you, now won't be having enough time to pick up your calls. You get to know that everyone is busy fighting their own battles, so no one is really interested in fighting yours too. You understand that people will not care if you are happy or sad. They'll care if they are happy or sad. You learn that in this whole wide world, there is no one actually against you, but they are up for themselves. You get to learn the fact that people love a nice undisturbed goodnight sleep. So don't call them at midnight just to share your troubles because they won't pick your call anyway and you'll end up hurting yourself. You get to know that animals are better than humans. So have a pet if you want to pour your heart out. If not, write it in a diary. P.S. Everything written above is my personal experience and point of view. Exceptions are always there though. Feel free to suggest anything. Thank you. ",
