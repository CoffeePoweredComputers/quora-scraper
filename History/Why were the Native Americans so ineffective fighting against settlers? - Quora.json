            "answer_text": "Numbers, technology, and politics. Most estimates hold that disease wiped out about 90% of the indigenous population of the Americas.  As with the Black Death in Europe, these diseases did not simply strike once and then result in an inoculated population, but instead hit again and again in waves over the next several centuries.  Some of this was intentional on the part of Europeans, some not, but the end result was the same: colonizers were met with a continent that had been seriously depleted of its original population. Thanks to this disease, as well as population pressures related to war and displacement, Europeans were typically met with native populations far smaller than their own.  The much mysticized Cherokee, for example, numbered only 16,000 in their homeland at the time of the Trail of Tears, with a few thousand more who had already moved west.  While the United States was still an agrarian nation and populations were not particularly large at the time, there were plenty of American cities that were larger than their entire society.  When reading accounts of Plains Indians in the latter half of the 19th century, there are often references to the white men representing a sort of endless, unstoppable force.  Plains Indians, a highly nomadic society, never had numbers that were particularly high in the first place, and for every white interloper they killed or drove off, ten more would come in their place.  They simply could not compete.  Technology also played a role, albeit a smaller one.  It was incredibly difficult for non-industrialized societies to outcompete industrialized ones, and not just on the level of weaponry.  White society could create things at much lower costs in terms of time and materials than could native society.  That ax or hatchet was far more valuable to an indigenous individual than it was to his white counterpart, simply because it was a mass-produced object and not particularly expensive in white society.  Weaponry represented an added wrinkle here, as mass production of guns and ammunition put indigenous Americans at a disadvantage.  A particularly striking example of this is probably in the destruction of the bison herds of the Plains:   Indigenous American societies were also far from homogenous, and they had been fighting and competing with one another for millennia prior to the arrival of Europeans.  This map of linguistic diversity gives a sense of the kind of cultural diversity we're talking about:  The challenge here for the natives was that white settlers were by and large monolithic, a single entity fighting against their many disparate groups.  This is why we see tribes ending up on both sides of conflicts like the French and Indian War, the American Revolution, and the War of 1812.  The indigenous peoples of the Americas were people too, and they had grudges, scores to settle, and historical prejudices.  White colonizers were able to exploit these differences, while their native counterparts had no such schisms to exploit amongst their white counterparts. Ultimately, disease did most of the damage.  Even if Europeans had arrived with entirely altruistic motives, the Americas' indigenous population would have been largely wiped out and forever changed.  Remember, the seemingly indefatigable Incan Empire was tearing itself apart at the seams when Pizarro arrived with his meagre forces, reeling from the recent death of its emperor by smallpox.  European expansionist behaviors certainly didn't help matters, and led to the long-term relegation of the Americas' indigenous peoples to second-class status throughout much of the region, but winning was never really on the table.

            "answer_text": "It is actually a little complicated. The Natives were not usually instantly against the settlers. They traded with the Europeans for goods they could not make themselves- iron tools, cooking kettles, cloth, as well as decorations such as beads. Eventually though the tribes found themselves pressured into defending their land. This repeated itself as the settlers moved west\u2026 Once established, the tribes were often over matched. They might consider themselves fighting a couple of hundred settlers, the settlers would call on assistance from the east- eventually the Army would win. The Army also expected to lose some men here and there. The tribes did not believe in losing men, and tried to avoid it. They rarely made serious attacks against well fortified positions so as to avoid loses. They preferred to make a sudden rush against unprepared places- a fort might be rushed when the gates were open, for instance. If the walls were manned, they would put it under siege. The Plains tribes were not known for ever attacking a military fort. They would ambush those going in and out instead. Settlers were the invaders causing the tribes problems, so they would turn on them first, and only fight the Army later. In the end, the Army, once ordered to attack a tribe, was relentless and would not stop until they had won. If the Army was defeated they would return with more forces later. If the tribe moved, they were followed. Nomads were hunted continuously, allowing them little time to rest, hunt, or preserve food. Hunger and exhaustion would drive most into reservations eventually. Those who were farmers would lose their villages and crops, and again be driven to accept a reservation. Once established on the continent, the Europeans disease reduced the local tribes population while theirs increased. Once the Europeans had a numerical superiority, they would eventually outlast the tribes in any war. Then of course you add in the Europeans usually had better weapons, and could replace their ammunition easily, and bring in food as well, all advantages the tribes did not have. ",
