Ukraine officially adopted a blue and yellow national flag in 1918. The flag was the same as the one flown in 1848, yellow on top of blue. In 1918, the colors were reversed.

The top is blue, the bottom - yellow. Blue and yellow, the colors of the sky, mountains, streams, and golden fields have symbolized Kyivan Rus' long before the introduction of Christianity. With the acceptance of Christianity, blue and gold were incorporated into church symbolism. After the Mongol-Tatar invasion in the 1200's the use of blue/gold was interrupted, to be revived again in church ornaments and city crests some time later. The emblem of the city of Myrhorod, for example, was a gold trident over a blue background. Another city, Pryluky, used the head of an ox in gold over a blue background as its insignia. And in Lubny, the city emblem pictured a hand holding a golden mace over a blue background. The banners of the Cossacks (17th Century) were blue with gold stars, a gold cross, or with pictures of saints rendered in gold.The blue and yellow flag as the national flag of Ukraine by the Supreme Rada in 1992.\"Dov Gutterman, 10 July 2000The blue-yellow flag was firstly displayed in Lviv (Lvov, Lemberg) in 1848.

            "answer_text": "The history is not completely certain, but the Flag of Ukraine provides some answers:  The national flag of Ukraine was officially adopted for the first time in 1918 by a short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic. At that time the commonly used yellow\u2013blue flag had already turned into blue and yellow and sported a trident...in the upper left corner. The insignia remained unchanged by the successive government...During the Soviet era, Bolsheviks had been using red and later red-blue flags as the official flag of the Ukrainian SSR. The blue and yellow flag was officially restored in 1992 following Ukrainian independence.  A modern interpretation of the meaning of the colors used in the  Ukrainian flag is that the color blue represents the color of the sky,  and yellow symbolizes the lush golden wheat fields of this country. This  association is thought to have been developed in the mid nineteenth  century.  However, these two colors, blue and yellow, have been associated with  Ukraine from the times before the introduction of Christianity. Now they are incorporated into the flag of Ukraine. Interestingly, Ukrainians commonly refer to the flag as yellow and blue  The roots of Ukrainian national symbols come from before Christian  times when yellow and blue prevailed in traditional ceremonies,  reflecting fire and water. Some of the theories said that Ukrainian flag was given by the Silesian knight from the city of Opole\u2014W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolczyk, Polish governor of Galicia\u2013Volhynia. It has the same colours as Opole flag. In Kievan Rus' times, yellow and blue continued to be popular. These colours were used on the banners of the Halych-Volhynia principality in the 13th\u201314th centuries. Note, however, that the second section is flagged for needing citations. There does not seem to be a relationship between the Ukrainian and Swedish flags, as the Flag of Sweden page says that the blue and gold colors go back to the 13th century and does not talk about their meaning.
