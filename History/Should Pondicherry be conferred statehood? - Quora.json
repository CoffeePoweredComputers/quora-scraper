            "answer_text": "Question : Should Pondicherry be conferred statehood?Simple Answer \u201cNO\u201d Please skip to the end to view disadvantages of statehood and to know the politics behind it. Reasons:[math]  [/math] Size : The simple reason to grant statehood is the size. A state needs autonomy because they possess a large area and humongous population and thus representation becomes vital. As D. Prasad (\u0ba4. \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0b9a\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bcd) has mentioned in his answer to this question Pondicherry has only 12 Lakhs in population and 492 square km of landmass. Wherein a city like Chennai possess 90Lakhs and 1189square km. So, imagine how puny Pondicherry is. Economics: State needs to generate Money(other than taxing citizens) but all that the Pondicherry does is Taxing. Pondicherry doesn\u2019t have money to pay the Govt servents a months salary if let alone.Pondicherry doesn\u2019t do enough trade to begin with. i.e. the money circulation done by the UT is comparatively minuscule.there is lots more reasons to point out but let me come to the main part of your question \u201cWhat is the reason behind the demand by political parties for statehood? What is the constitutional procedure for this and what benefits/problems will it bring to Pondicherry?\u201d MORE POWER\u00a0If the UT becomes a state, the constitution grants the power to make lawsCreate bureaucratic hierarchyAuthorize govt to build whatever it wants wherever it wantsget Loans etc.Make Laws : At present Politicians in Pondicherry is literally kept on leash by the Central govt. All decisions are passed through the Governor and the Central Govt. The governor posses 50% of the power while the other 50% is with the CM. Current scenario: Till date the Politicians have been swindling a great deal of money. You know how ? Central allocates certain amount of fund for certain expenditure. For example Central govt allocates (say 250 crores) for the relief of Schedule Caste/Scheduled Tribe peoples. The Govt. has Strict laws on how the fund or seat allocated to the SC/ST peoples must be used. UT simply cannot overrule these stringent laws. So what the Pondy Politicians does is \u201cADJUSTMENT POLITICS\u201d. The Politicians and Governor goes hand in hand. The fund allocated for SC/ST peoples are re-allocated for different expenditure like construction/municipality work etc. where this Fund can be swindled by Politicians backed Corrupt Contractors. So if Pondicherry is made a State. It can reallocate these Funds itself without going through Governor. Guess why these politicians are having problems with honorable Kiran Bedi !!\u00a0Create bureaucratic hierarchy: The Municipality has slight upper hand over the UT than the Ministers. Also the bureaucratic hierarchy was made by the central govt long ago. This can be altered by the Politicians. For example: At present the PWD has one Head ( Chief Engineer) while the Electricity has 3 heads ( Superintending Engineers ) So if the Politicians wants to employ more Contractual Multi-tasking Staffs(MTS) in PWD, the CM had to go through one head while if it was for Elect. Dept, he has to convince 3 heads. So, if given statehood this can be altered and also Elec. Dept can be made into a Corporation. i.e. More Corruption Hurray\u2026. :) Authorize govt to build whatever it wants wherever it wants Consider below said as an imaginary Situation :P Currently an over-bridge is constructed over the 100ft Road and another Highway is being built connecting Villanur to this over-bridge. There has been a discord between the Central and the UT politicians over these plans. Center has objected to this road and denied funds to build the same ,but suggested widening the current NH. But the politicians has already gone far in accumulating the lands (land value will increase) besides the road for cheap price, politicians already started constructing(marriage halls,shops etc) along the impending road. Wherein, if the present NH is widened all the shops currently developed by the Politicians and other big shots besides the road will be demolished. So the State went ahead to build the NH without Central aid. To make the situation a Win-Win situation for the Politicians. So, if statehood is conferred. You know what will these Politicians do. get Loans: Currently the UT is struggling to pay the Government Servants even a months salary. It\u2019s already debt ridden. So if statehood is provided, POLITICIANS help themselves by getting more Loan without the authorization from the Center. Thus Pondicherry will be doomed for Good. POLITICIANS are twisting the minds of General population; throwing a tantrum for Statehood and playing a Vote Bank Politics to appease their own Selfish needs !!\u00a0Disadvantage of Statehood Indirect Taxation will hit the highest mark (Petrol and other essential product prices will hit an all time high mark)If Politicians of Pondicherry starts to demand Statehood strongly, The obvious decision expected from the center is to dissolve Pondicherry Govt. and join Puducherry & Karaikal with Tamil Nadu, Mahe with Kerala, Yanam with Andhra Pradesh. But the Politicians will not stand to this amalgamation cause, this will reduce the number of Political posting and representation to Delhi. So the Politicians are playing a Diversion Politics, attention of the general population is steered away from the real issues while they are not going to raise these demand for statehood in the central dais . above said are true to my knowledge, you can always correct me. But the above said situations abt the conflict between center and UT, are just imagination. Don\u2019t make a Fuss over it in the comment section.

            "answer_text": "Nope, Puducherry may not be conferred with statehood due to the following reasons Population is 12 lakhs (as of 2016). chennai\u2019s crowd alone is 90 lakhs.Area is 492 sqaure km and that of chennai is 1,189 sqaure km.The population and area is small and it can be governed by the current setup of union territory. Statehood is necessary if one is dealing with a huge area and population as governing it will require more power at the local level.Huge revenue generating place. Puducherry doesn\u2019t generate such funds.Political parties demand statehood so that they can have a larger say in the government. At present the Lieutenant Governor and the elected assembly have almost equal role in governance. Benefits of statehood: Can independently enact laws for people\u2019s welfare. At present any law has to be approved by the president.Drawbacks of statehood: Indirect taxes will go up. Centre\u2019s fund allocation to Puducherry will come down (as they no longer govern it and have transferred the responsibility) and to overcome that indirect taxes will be pushed up. Ex.Petrol prices will be up.",
