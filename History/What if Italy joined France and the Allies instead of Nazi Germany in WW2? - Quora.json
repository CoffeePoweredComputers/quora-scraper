            "answer_text": "This is a scenario which I have long considered: What if Italy joined France and the Allies instead of Nazi Germany in WW2? The foreign policy of Mussolini during the \u201830s was aimed to make Italy the \u201cdecisive weight\u201d, i.e. to create a balance of power in Europe, so that Italy, through her weight, could shift this balance in one direction or in the other one. In this way, Italy could play a prestigious role in Europe, greater than her financial and military possibilities. The final aim of this strategy was to grant Italy an equal status to the other Great Powers, to fix the \u201cmutilated victory\u201d of World War I and to achieve for Italy \u201cpeace with justice\u201d and \u201ca place in the sun\u201d. So, if Germany became too powerful and the demo-plutocratic countries cried for Italian help granting favours, Italy would side with them; on the other hand, if these nations became too confident in their strength and therefore started a policy of limiting Italian influence, Italy would shift towards Germany, and so on. However, this game proved to be dangerous and eventually failed because of the extremist instances of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, which materialised in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. At this point, Germany felt it could ignore the Iron Pact with Italy and just start a unilateral war, without consulting her ally. Mussolini was taken by surprise. Now he could understand that the Iron Pact was a mistake, but the damage was already done. The factions had radicalised and now neither Britain nor Germany wanted peace. Italy had not participated in the recent arms race, therefore she could just watch the events, hoping that both factions wore themselves out and that Italy could become again the \u201cdecisive weight\u201d in promoting a renovated peace and a new world order, more favourable from the Italian point of view and capable of avoiding another war. In the meantime, Mussolini ordered the construction of the Alpine Wall, a line of fortifications on the border with Germany. Unfortunately, the events proceeded otherwise. Germany achieved masterful and lightening victories in Poland and then in Denmark and then in Norway and then in the Nederlands and then in Belgium and then in France. The Allies looked like a bunch of incompetents. Now Italy herself was in danger. Twenty years before, it had fought a war against the Germanic Empires and had defeated them and many Germans wanted to cleanse this last shame. In Germany, propaganda against Italian neutrality started to circulate. This propaganda insinuated a suspicion in the people: was Italy going to betray Germany again, as she had done twenty-five years before? It seemed that nothing could now stop Germany. Peace negotiations with Britain seemed forthcoming: then, how would Almighty Germany redraw the borders of Europe? What would it be of France? And what of neutral Italy? If Germany had requested back Tirol and Trieste, could Italy have rejected? And if they had even requested Lombardy-Venetia? An intervention of the USA or of the USSR seemed distant and theoretical, while the German power was very much present and real. When Mussolini became absolutely certain that France was defeated, he decided that he could not remain neutral anymore and that he had to declare war against the losing powers. A war \u201cneither for Germany nor with Germany, but only alongside Germany\u201d\u00b9. In this way, Italy could protect herself from Germany but also reach her goal of fixing the mutilated victory. At the cost of just \u201cfew thousand dead\u201d, Italy could sit at the table which would determine the destiny of the world. There, not just would she press her ambitions but also defend the British interests at the expense of the French ones (Churchill and Mussolini signed a secret agreement in April 1940\u00b2). The victor of the war was Germany, Italy could in no way exert a \u201cdecisive weight\u201d, but that was the heaviest weight Italy could exert in that circumstance (in the eyes of Mussolini). At the peace conference, Mussolini was going to demand Nice, Corsica, Tunisia, Eastern Algeria and Djibouti from France; British Somalia and part of Sudan from Britain, in order to link Libya to Italian East Africa. Mussolini would have also demanded the internationalisation of Suez and Gibraltar and an alliance with Egypt\u00b3.  [This is the most accurate representation of Mussolini\u2019s war ambitions I could find online. The Balearic Islands, Malta, Cyprus and Southern Sudan should not be included, while Eastern Algeria should be included. Light green are protectorates. Credits to 1Blomma, DeviantArt] Anyway, the decision to enter the war \u201con the side of Germany\u201d did not suggest Mussolini to stop the construction of the Alpine Wall on the German border. The rest is history and in 1943 Germany annexed Trieste and Tirol anyway. With the advantage of hindsight, I would say that June 1940 was indeed the most propitious moment for Italy to declare war, with one \u201cminor\u201d difference: the side! Yes, Italy should indeed betray Germany once again and side with France and Britain! To take such a decision, one should consider many aspects, which were almost invisible in June 1940, but which could be found under a very thick layer of mirages and delusions. The geopolitical situation of Germany was doomed. Germany was destined to fight on two fronts. She was situated between the Western powers and the Soviet Union. And a Great Power does not back down when she sees an historical occasion, especially if her name is the Soviet Union.The British Empire would continue to fight, probably even if the Islands were invaded and occupied (that would be a problem for the British people, not for Churchill nor for the British Navy nor for for the British financial assets which were already moved to Canada). Not only that, but Roosevelt very much intended to bring the USA into the war, in order to outclass the British Empire and make America the new world capitalistic superpower.Also Stalin will enter the war. Both he and Hitler knew that the Moscow pact was just an expedient to gain times. For Stalin, it was a means to wear out the capitalist countries. When the Kairos had come, Stalin would have stabbed Germany in the back and would have steamrolled her. Most historians do not believe that the Soviet Union would have maintained neutrality forever (the thesis that the Soviet Union would attack Germany anyway is substantiated e.g. in Victor Suvorov\u2019s books Icebreaker and The Chief Culprit).One should also consider the psychological aspect. Attacking Britain and France when Italy did was ignoble and dishonourable. The Allies were collapsing not only militarily but also politically. Tension between France and Britain was every day higher. A sense of discomfort and dejection reigned everywhere.In such a dire moment, the Allies would have probably acknowledged Italy many of her claims, should she have joined the war on their side. The French would reconsider their imperialism over Nice, Corsica and Tunisia, while their fatherland herself was in jeopardy. The British would ask themselves why did they ever want to suffocate Italy in her own sea, while she was ready, now, to help them in the supreme danger. Therefore, they would have probably conceded the internationalisation of the straits. It would have been easy to give up the desert and miserable Somalia, even more so since the British could anyway count on their base of Aden. Perhaps, even the concession of a corridor in northern Sudan would have been possible.What impression would an Italian declaration of war against Germany have produced, in that time-frame? It would have revivified the enthusiasm of the Allies mostly, while it would have astonished Germany. All of a sudden, in the Allied field, this would no longer be the time of despair, but of renewed hope. One thing is sure: even if Italy had been invaded and destroyed, her decision would be considered an act of heroism, even by Hitler. On the other hand, if she resists Germany until the end of the war, she will be considered the saviour of the Western civilisation; but .The advantages of an Italian intervention would be enormous for the Allies. Obviously, France would not capitulate (actually, this is a prerequisite for the Italian intervention): with Italy as an enemy, France had no hope of pursuing the war from her African colonies; on the other hand, with the Italian navy on the side, French Africa is invulnerable. The French Army can retreat towards Italy, where the Alps can be defended quite easily (here, the Allies control two defence lines, the French and the Italian one, in a notoriously impervious region, so much that neither the Germans nor the Italians could defeat the French in the Alps until the armistice). At first, the Italian, the French and the British Mediterranean fleets can rescue the French Army in Southern France and bring them to Italy. Then, the Allied navies can dominate the seas and the oceans and impose a hermetic embargo on Germany. The invasion of Britain becomes absolutely impossible and even the submarine warfare becomes completely useless. Germany can no longer suffocate England in any way. In addition, hundreds of thousands of troops can now leave Africa and Western Asia to reach Italy and defend the Alpine Wall.The military scenario is way safer for Italy too. The Italian generals were not particularly vanguard or competent, but no one can deny this: they had spent the last twenty years to prepare the defence of the Alps. They had no imagination, they imagined just one possible scenario: a war on the Alps. If there was at least one thing in the world they were competent at, it was defending the Alps. There would have been no need of \u201cinventing\u201d desert warfare without any adequate armaments nor to engage the British Navy on the oceans and on the seas: the Alpine Veterans knew their duty.Furthermore, the military elite of Italy (starting from the top, Pietro Badoglio) sympathised with the British and with the French, while they detested the Germans. Now, you have them fighting with their friends and against their enemies. Furthermore, the fright of a tough German revenge would provide everyone enough motivation to fight.Blitzkrieg does not work on the mountains. The advantages of motorised infantry and panzer divisions on the Alps are dubious. Panzers on the mountains are like war-elephants. They can crush everyone and everything in the plains, but make them pass even just an unguarded Alpine range and it would be pain (as Hannibal reminds us and as also the Germans would experience later on).However, the passes won\u2019t be unguarded. Mines are cheap and powerful devices. Would you like to proceed in a narrow valley full of mines and other traps and obstacles, while on both sides the enemy controls the heights and machine-guns and bombards your incessantly? You can be the best army in the world, but you don\u2019t want to do that, otherwise you will end like the Soviets against the Finns. Now, Italy can put the Alpine Wall into effect. If the Italian leadership is not even more foolish than the French one, who thought that the Ardennes were impassable and there was no need to guard them, they can put up a strenuous resistance.In this scenario, there is no British embargo. This is as much fundamental as breathing. There is no more raw materials shortage. This means that the participation of Italy in the war can be something more than just a posture (or even a \u201cbluff\u201d, as someone said), but it can be real and effective. Italy has now the means to fight. She can now import iron, coal, oil and food in great quantities and at affordable price. Her main concern is not anymore to secure enough coal and food to survive, but to defend the Alps effectively.What I like the most in this scenario is that Italy would have been brought to war neither by the intimidatory British embargo (the British had tried so until then, in vain) nor by the dreadful German supremacy (which, historically, brought Italy to the intervention), taking instead a completely independent and sovereign decision.  [The Franco-Italian Alpine Theater]  [This map represents the British embargo on Italy in the historical timeline] One could say that, while this is an interesting and unthought-of scenario, the risks would be too high and that, after all, this would play into the hands of the \u201cdemo-plutocratic\u201d rivals of Italy, while it would be very detrimental to National Socialist Germany, who, after all, was an important partner for Italy, and whose leader highly admired the Duce. However: This move would procure new partners to Italy.Conquering all of Italy, from the Alps to the sea, is geographically and logistically difficult, but even if Germany managed to do that, there is no chance she would eventually win the war.The conquest of Italy would even be a gigantic problem for Germany. Indeed, it would not grant Germany any additional raw material: actually, Germany would have to send some to Italy (as in our timeline). Furthermore, she would have to station a big army there to avoid revolts and, above all, to defend thousands of kilometres of coastline from potential naval invasions; a coastline which the Germans would have to fortify at colossal cost, unless they want to stay there just to get bombed incessantly by the Allied navies, infinitely superior to the German one, which cannot intervene in the Mediterranean anyway. In the end, to conquer Italy would be even worse for the Germans than to maintain a second front on the Alps, stationing divisions on the defensive. But, without conquering Italy, the Germans would expose themselves to Allied aerial bombing. In short, the Italian intervention would put them in an impossible situation.But most importantly, this move would be neither suicidal for fascism nor truly advantageous for the \u201cdemo-plutocracies\u201d: our timeline was! Instead, this decision would probably cause a major change in the course of the war. Here is my reasoning: the Italian intervention would drastically change the attitude of Germany towards the war itself, to the point of making Italy \u201cthe decisive weight\u201d again.After the fall of France, historically it was impossible to conclude a peace treaty for two reasons: on the one hand, Germany wanted peace and was ready to make moderate demands, but the situation on the field was too unbalanced on her favour for her demands to be really mild. On the other hand, Britain was not ready to accept any peace, which would be in any case a defeat, essentially. Furthermore, the British did not trust Hitler. In our scenario, however, the position of Hitler would be very different. Not only would he be at war against Britain (while he wanted her as an ally) but also against his hero Benito Mussolini. Aside from this psychological trauma, there would be an even more impending military issue.In our timeline, after the fall of France, Hitler did not try to invade Britain using all his air and naval might. Many consider this to be Hitler\u2019s biggest mistake. On the contrary, his renounce was actually wise, in my opinion. In June 1940, the USSR invaded Bessarabia. While Hitler could have probably conquered Britain, this would have been suicidal, because it would have let the USSR stab Germany in the back, take the Romanian oil fields and then inevitably conquer a fuel-less Germany and probably all of continental Europe (after the fall of Germany, who would protect Europe?). While Britain was out of combat for a while, it was much wiser for Hitler to precede the USSR and march eastwards.In our alternative scenario, the situation is even worse for Hitler. He has two \u201cGreat Britains\u201d, so to say. He can neither attack Italy, exposing himself to attrition on the Alps, nor can he attack the USSR, exposing himself to Russian winter attrition. The first one would cause a Russian attack, the second one a renovated Anglo-Franco-Italian offensive. Two fronts were hardly tolerable, three would be totally intolerable. An attack against Italy or Great Britain would have inevitably caused, sooner or later, a Soviet invasion, while an attack against the Soviet Union would have inevitably caused an Allied counteroffensive. Even if Hitler had managed to conquer all of Italy, somehow even preventing the Soviet attack, he would now have too wide a coastline to defend, with ridiculously insufficient naval forces, against enemy landings.This situation would make Hitler want to negotiate on ever milder terms. On the other hand, Mussolini would be the perfect man to conduct the negotiation, due to his influence over Hitler. Mussolini would be again at the centre of the events, like in Stresa and in Munich, but at an even higher level. This would be the masterstroke I imagined! Before the intervention, Mussolini should agree upon conditions of peace with Great Britain and France, in order to impose them to a hopeless Germany afterwards, being compromise the only way out for Hitler. These conditions, however, given the military situation and the subordination of the Italian intervention to them, should not be the capitulation of Germany. Possible conditions would be: the Danzig corridor is recognised as part of Germany; however, the Wehrmacht must evacuate all the other occupied territories, including Alsace-Lorraine; independence for Poland and for all the other countries occupied during the war; referendums held under international supervision in each of the occupied countries, in order that the various peoples may choose between the demo-plutocratic and the fascist form of government. Some countries, after the disaster of the democracies, would probably opt for fascism, and neither Britain would be able to object against their decision.It would be absolutely crucial to agree with the Allies upon the peace terms to impose on Germany, before Italy intervenes, and to make sure that the Allies declare these conditions publicly, so that they cannot back out whenever Germany accepts them. It would be indeed necessary to avoid that the Allies lay a trap for Italy, pretending to agree on conditions but then forcing Italy and Germany to destroy each other and finally imposing on a weakened Germany an unconditional surrender.Hitler should to be persuaded by Mussolini to accept this compromise peace, however frustrating, in the face of the lack of alternatives. Indeed, it would be beneficial to Germany anyway. Mussolini should show Hitler how this peace is, paradoxically, the salvation of Germany, for the reasons explained above.In this way, Mussolini would really break into the room of the negotiations on the destinies of the world, to which he had not been invited, leading the assembly on top of that!If everything went as planned, in the end, actually, Italy and Germany would have won the war: indeed, they would have gained something, while France, Great Britain and Poland would have conceded something. The ideal of \"peace with justice\" would be realised, despite Europe having taken an enormous risk.If, on the other hand, Great Britain were not willing to pre-establish any conditions of peace, other than the unconditional surrender of Germany, this would clarify many things to the Italian leadership, at least preventing the reiteration of the historical error of entering the war without doing anything, convinced of having to sit down at the peace conference shortly after.Now, one more person remains, who hopes that nobody notices him and who needs to be punished: Stalin, the man who unleashed the German Wehrmacht against the West and devoured Eastern Europe meanwhile. Neither a friend of Mussolini nor of Hitler nor of Churchill. If Stalin intends to avoid a Pan-European attack against him, he has to renounce to all the occupations he has made in the last two years and in particular to release Eastern Poland to maintain this buffer state between him and Hitler (however, areas with clear Ukrainian and Russian majority should be conceded to him). In exchange for that, he has to grant a quota of his oil production to Germany and Italy, so that they are autarkic and a long-lasting peace in Europe can be assured. Italy should also promote the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, in order to make all European countries autarkic and to safeguard the renovated European peace: Italy would benefit mostly from this pact, since she lacks both iron and coal). As seal to the pact, all the Great Powers shall swear to protect the new European order, defending it by all means and punishing any country that doesn\u2019t respect it.Churchill can be proud of having saved the world from a devastating war, of having safeguarded the British Empire, its democracy and the worldwide capitalistic leadership of Britain; Mussolini can be proud of having saved the Western civilisation, of having amended the shame of the mutilated victory, of having achieved \u201cpeace with justice\u201d and \u201ca place in the sun\u201d for Italy and of having made her autarkic; he can also rejoice in the triumph of the fascist idea and in its rising prestige in the world; Hitler can be proud of having achieved Pan-Germanism, of having made Germany the most powerful country of the European continent, of having achieved autarky for her and of having cleansed the shame of Versailles; Stalin can be satisfied of having avoided a world-wide attack against him and of having lost nothing: at least he has tried to obtain the world revolution and he will now wait for the next occasion. \u00b9Mussolini pronounced this sentence in an address to the generals in April 1940, as reported in R. De Felice, Mussolini l\u2019alleato, Einaudi Editore, 2008, p. 106.\u00b2This is substantiated by a reconstruction of the controversial Mussolini-Churchill correspondence, based on fascist and partisan testimonies and on German interceptions and wiretapping. The original documents were captured (and perhaps destroyed, or permanently concealed) by the British in 1945. Other confirming documents emerged in 1985 (the secret correspondence between the King of Italy Victor Emmanuel III and the President of the French Republic Lebrun).\u00b3This was revealed by Mussolini to the Italian general Mario Roatta on 19th June 1940, as reported in Franco Bandini, La tecnica della sconfitta, Sugar Editore, 1963, p. 803.

            "answer_text": "This is a very interesting scenario. An Allied Italy could have drastically changed the course of the War. Firstly, we need to make a few assumptions: At some point between 1933 and 1939, there was a break between Hitler and Mussolini. Most probably it happened in March 1938, after Anschluss. In our timeline, Mussolini didn\u2019t receive too happy the news. In this alternate timeline, the annexation of Austria, combined with some other previous incidents, had a more powerful impact upon the fascist dictator.Scared by the perspective of a German-ruled Europe, Mussolini starts to distance from Germany and seeks an allied with France and Great Britain. He will most probably have to give up any imperial ambition and limit only to Libya and Ethiopia.In OTL Mussolini started in 1931 the construction of the Alpine Wall, a system of fortifications at the northern border of Italy. The Wall was formed by a system of fortifications, bunkers, machine gun nests, barbed wire etc. We can expect that Mussolini will most likely stop the work on the border with France and concentrate on the frontier with Germany after the worsening of relations with Hitler. On 1 September 1939 Hitler orders the invasion of Poland. On 17 September the Soviet Union invades Poland as well. France and Great Britain declare War on Germany. Along with them, Italy enters the War against Germany. The first months of the War will carry on in the same mode we know. There are very low chances Italy could make a difference in that period. Poland, Denmark and Norway will fail like in our timeline. The differences will start with the Battle of France. It\u2019s unlikely that Italy could change somehow the course of the Battle. Operation Fall Gelb will still take place, cutting the main Allied forces. However, there will not be a \u2018\u2019Fall of France\u2019\u2019 like in our timeline. The French Government will choose not to surrender, but to retreat with the remaining forces over the Alps, in Italy. The same thing will happen with the British Expeditionary Force. During Operation Ariel, around 190,000 Allied soldiers (mostly British) were evacuated through the Western ports of France together with 4,700 vehicles. An important part of these forces could be transported in Italy. The French colonies from North Africa will not fail in the hand of Germany. After France will be conquered, the War will start to be less and less similar to OTL. Before they could invade Italy, Germans would at least a month or two of rest and reorganization. In this time a new British Expeditionary Force will be organized and sent to Italy. Italian Army will mobilize and the Alpine fortifications will be strengthened. At the end of August/beginning of September 1940, Germans will launch an invasion of Italy. The main attack will come most probably from the German border due to the shorter supply lines and weaker fortifications. It will be a brutal battle: the mountainous terrain is one of the biggest enemies of the Blitzkrieg and the Italians will be much more motivated to fight than in OTL. They will fight now on their own territory, for the protection of their families and homes, not for some vague imperial ambitions of a dictator in the African desert or near the Volga. Despite the fierce resistance of Italians and other Allied soldiers, it would be impossible for Italy to resist. I estimate that in maximum 6 months any resistance on the peninsula will be crushed. Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica would probably resist. They will be guarded by the Royal Marine and the Regia Marina, the Italian Navy. In OTL, Germans lost a big part of their airborne troops invading Crete. Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica are on another level. In addition, they would be guarded by the Royal Navy and Regia Maria, the Italian Navy, which retreated in North African ports before the fall of Italy. The situation in Balkans will be interesting. Hungary was closer to Italy than Germany but they would not risk a war with Hitler only to help Mussolini. In Yugoslavia, there are very big chances for a civil war. In the north, the Croatians and Slovenians were more sympathetic to Germany than to Italy and the situation was the opposite for the Serbs. A civil war will start between Croatians/Slovenians and Serbs. Germany will intervene in helping the first. I am unsure about what side would Greece sustain. After the Invasion of Italy, Germany would not be capable to invade the USSR in 1941. Germans will have to wait at least until in 1942 for that. However, there are big chances Stalin will take advantage of this opportunity and attack Germany. If you want more details about this check these answers: Dima Vorobiev's answer to Does Dima Vorobiev believe that Stalin was planning to invade Germany in 1941? If it was true, do you think Hitler did the correct thing by preemptive striking since Germany cannot withstand a two-front offensive (due to resource shortage)? Dima Vorobiev's answer to If Hitler hadn't invaded Russia, would Stalin have invaded Germany? Finally, I think the result of Italy joining the Allies would be an end of the War by maximum 1944. With the bulk of German forces trying to stop the Soviet advance, the Allied will land and liberate France and Italy. The map of the postwar Europe will be similar to OTL, maybe with a united communist Germany. ",
