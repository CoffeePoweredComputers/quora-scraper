            "answer_text": "Oh definitely the Mughal era was much better for India. I\u2019d keep it short and simple. Mughals were nomads from the middle east. They won wars in India, conquered territories and decided to settle in India. They knew that for their own good, It was important to make India and Indians grow. With their economic policies in the right place they made things taxable (which was ok) and facilitated trade around the world. By doing this they made wealth from all over the world come to India. Around the beginning of the 17th century, India\u2019s share in the world economy grew to It was 27%, and was about 23% in late 1790s. It is said that the amount of tax collected by Aurangzeb amounted to about \u00a3100 Million only. India prospered amazingly well in economic terms during the Mughal reign. And was destroyed by the British in 200 years. Britain, when the East India Company came to India was very poor. It accounted for 1.8% of global economy. By the time they left India in 1947, they accounted for 10% while they turned India into a third world country. Here are some important points: Between 1757 and 1900 British GDP per capita increased by 347% in real terms. For India it was only 14%Between 1900\u20131947 India grew at less than 1% whereas Britain grew at 3.5%They knew the only way to get some money in the economy was trade and they could go to any extent for that. The British imposed huge taxes on Indian goods, gave preferencial treatment to British goods,De-industrialised India,pushed a large population into farming and made them grow stuff in high demand in Britain (and on top of that they were taxed heavily),they introduced corruption to India and brought the VIP culture.Britain used Indian resources in the 2 world wars and never paid the money it owed in full.Behaved like animals (kept buffer food stocks to be sent to London) and let millions of Indians die in the Bengal FamineDivided Hindus & Muslims and facilitated riots for decadesDivided India. Left millions deadHowever since they\u2019ve left, we\u2019ve grown slowly but very well. British left India with 16% literacy rate. Today it is about 72%British left India with 27 year life expectancy, today it is thrice of that90% people lived below poverty line in 1947. Today India has pulled 28- Million people out of poverty.Britain only got 1500 villages electrified but today it\u2019s about 320 times of that numberPS: Many people would argue that the British gave India Railways, English language, education system and what not. But the truth is, they had no option but to throw this on India. They needed railways to get stuff to the ports. English to facilitate movement of goods & people and administration and an education system that\u2019d restrict creative thinking and prepare people to take commands.

            "answer_text": "This question is really a tough one. You are asking to choose a good human being from a criminal and another criminal from the black pages of Great Indian history. But according to me and those who agree with me.. i would definately go Britishers and with the BRITISH COLONIAL ERA. First and foremost., Britishers were rulers whereas Mughals were looters. Britishers were more systematic in everything from ruling India to looting India unlike the Mughals who looted India mercilessly by ruthless killing of innocent people, rape of women, etc etc Britishers also started initiative to educate Indians post 1857 which later though led to India getting independence from Britishers, but this was the finest thing of reforming the educational system in India. In Mughal era? People were not even provided basic rights Britishers ended the SATI system., whereas in Mughal era women used to commit Jauhar ., a practise of jumping in fire to be burned till death when their husband goes on a war which is impossible to win., you can even say that Jauhar was done to save themselves from the wrath of Britishers. Such was the havoc of Britishers. British made constructions India Gate, Parliament house, Rash\u1e6drapati bhavan, Victoria memorial, St Mary's Church, Writers building, some of those useful constructions of British era whcih are even used today are as follows BDD chawls in South Mumbai where even today the rent is 10\u20b9 per month with no water bill, Gateway of India , S-Bridge at Byculla, Hancock Bridge, Arthur bridge, Carnac bridge, The famous Bellasis Road bridge at Mumbai Central Tilak bridge at Dadar etc etc And trust me, their construction is even sustained till today after 2 centuries!! And what did Mughals do? They made famous monuments like Qutub Minar, Taj Mahal. But didn't made any as such constitution of civic issue in their 500+ years like Britishers made in 200 years Britishers gave India., Indian railways which was primarily made by Britishers to make their movement of goods easy and quick. Mughals didn't Britishers gave India English language and today., though only 10% of Indians speak English fluently., we are on #2 in the list of English speaking country! Mughals please excuse! Britishers though never made any temples with an exception to one., Mughals in the other hand demolished many of the ancient temples. Britishers never or hardly tried to or imposed any religion or beliefs on the people of Hindustan whereas Mughals used to practice forced conversions and radicalisation. The current Democratic Government, Parliament system, Model of Governance is a Boon from Britishers. Mughals didn't even considered Indians in their sparse civic works if done! And the current system of civil services was started by Britishers in the Charter Act. Our current UPSC examinations are a brainchild of Britishers. What Mughals did? Sorry i never came across any such! ",
