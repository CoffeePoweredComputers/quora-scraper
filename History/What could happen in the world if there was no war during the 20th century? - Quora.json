            "answer_text": "Well, let\u2019s take a few minutes to think about this: One, no Russian Revolution. This came out of World War I and the disgust the Russian people had with the Tsar and his corrupt administration, which reinforced Russian public opinion from the Russo-Japanese war of 1905. This means NO Ulyanov, NO Dzugashvili, NO \u201cCommunist Menace\u201d to spur right-wing authoritarian regimes. Two, there would almost certainly have been no decolonization. Colonialism died in wars; think what World War II did to the European powers; it totally sapped their strength and will to keep colonies. If they had acted in the 20th Century the way they did in the 19th Century, the colonies would have remained. This means countries like India, Pakistan, Nigeria, and many others would still be colonies. Three, the Ottoman Empire woud quite possibly be in existence; this means it would be the major oil supplier to the world; after all, Kuwait, Iraq, and Saudi were all fragments of the Ottoman Empire. Four, NO Hitler! Indisputable. Had Hitler not served in World War I, he quite possibly would have died in Vienna a failed, starving artist. It was his service in the post-World War I German army that introduced him to the NSDAP, which he then proceeded to take over. And German \u201cstab in the back\u201d mythology was a key portion of Hiter\u2019s appeal, along with anti-Communism and anti-Semitism. Five, NO nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons were such a difficult project it took three years and unlimited monetary, physical, and personnel resources to make the first ones. I doubt anyone would have bothered, even if they could have afforded it. It is unlikely there would be an internet. Remember, the internet came from a DARPA program to enable communications AFTER a nuclear war, something redundant that would survive. Six, no ICBMs. They were a result of the Cold War, and built on German V-2 technology, which was an outcome of World War II. Aircraft would not be as advanced as they are today. Many, if not most, of the most influential aircraft were made for the military; many deveolpments in aircraft took place during war. Seven, the Chinese revolution would not have happened. After all, you said \u201cno war\u201d, and revolutions are war. It is quite possible the Manchus would still be in power, or perhaps Yuan Shikai would have founded another dynasty. The China we see today would not exist; it quite possibly would be as corrupt and as inefficient as the Qing dynasty was. Eight, the United States of America would not have its current role in the world. This role came about after World War II, when the US had HALF of the world\u2019s economic output. During the 19th Century, the US was a minor player in world politics. The US had a small military in 1900; naval expansion took place under Theodore Roosevelt, and the US Army expanded during World War I, and really took off during World War II. After World War I and II, the US had cultural explosions where American authors, painters, and other artists became internationally known and respected. Just my $0.02 ",

            "answer_text": "This question is just too weird. Let\u2019s look at what changed due to warfare in the 20th century: The Austro Hungarian Empire died and devolved into many small states.Germany transitioned from a monarchy to a republic, then suffered a major cultural change after World War II.Eastern European rural village life was destroyed.6,000,000 Jews were wiped out, 25% of the population of Poland.The Russian monarchy fell, giving way to a communist dictatorship whose collectivisation eventually led to the largest famine in modern times.All colonial empires were virtually dissolved.The state of Israel was founded in the aftermath of the holocaust. This reshaped the Middle East around Arab resentment of its founding.The Ottoman Empire fell.The last Chinese Empress died without heir; a civil war ensued.The Russo-Japanese War of 1905 cemented Japan\u2019s vision of itself as a major power, entitled to seek the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.The entire class of 1914 of the French Military Academy of St Cyr was wiped out.Radar and sonar would probably have progressed at a much slower pace, as there would have been little need for them.Cathode ray tube technology would have progressed at a much slower pace due to the lack of need. This would have affected TV deployment.There are many other issues that would have been affected, but I will stop here. ",
