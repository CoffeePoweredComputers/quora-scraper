            "answer_text": "For those who don't need to take out loans to lead a decent life, I'd say they're useful in helping someone limit how much they rely on credit instead of the cash they already have, and give great incentive to pay off loans as quickly as you are able. For everyone else ... Well, a small interest rate makes sense (incentive for people to allow you to borrow money in the first place), but the higher rates are just ridiculous and make it impossible for many to pay off things like their mortgage for a very, very long time.  And higher interest rates just seem like a bid from the greedy for more money, instead of that helping hand which many need. (And I'm writing this as someone who has never taken economics, so feel free to correct my assumptions.) ",
