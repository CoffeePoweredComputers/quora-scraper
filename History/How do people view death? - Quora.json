            "answer_text": "I'm not sure,but I prefer to totally put it out of mine because I spoke to my grandmother on a Thursday afternoon after work in 2006 when she was dying of liver cancer in a palliative care unit my auntie who works in aged care put her into. I was crying because I knew it was the very last time I was ever going to speak to her & we were very close,the next day work finished at midday & my mother rang me up & said that she didn't have very long to live. I was in a mad rush to get to the palliative care unit & very worried I wouldn't see her alive ever again, the woman at the reception desk told me that she died at about after 11 am. So our family all got there & surrounded her dead body to grieve & to say our goodbyes,it was very sad just to see her lifeless body just lay there, she was no longer our Nan,just a body !!!! A week later,we went to her funeral on a Friday which went for 1/2 an hour then her body & coffin was taken away to be cremated, after that, we went to the bowling club for her wake. I was shaken by the whole ordeal & I took the Monday off work to get over the funeral. So,that's my thoughts on what death is to me !!!! ",

            "answer_text": "If I do good, my death will be good and I will be in heaven as Allaah has promised, and if my deeds have wronged me, I will be in hell. All these processes of life like education, marriage etc will all ultimately lead to death. So the end is basically death. What excites me is however that we are promised a perfect life afterwards provided we do not fail this test of life. And since it is Almighty\u2019s promise so it has materialize. I have dream about that life is going to be something like this one but with perfection. So take out all that is troublesome and that is how life is going to be in the hereafter. To achieve this feat however we have to go thru lots of tests and trials, as Allaah says in Qur\u2019aan that: \u201cDo the people think that they will be left to say, \u201cWe believe\u201d and they will not be tried?\u201d (29:2) Death, a conundrum Allaah has left for those who believe; those who have firm faith in Allaah knows that His promise is true. Everybody shall be held accountable of his own doing. Be very very excited about meeting the Lord but be very very prepared for it, for Him is our Creator. He has given the clear view of hell and heaven. So there is no doubt about what it is going to be. What the real worry is that which side we end at. Fingers crossed while efforts on its way! P.S.: I am excited about it but I am so under-prepared. ",

I know this\u2026 I spent sometime working with patients/clients in a hospital as well as hospice and from my observation it\u2019s not something to fear. I had one patient stating \u201c There he is, he is right there.\u201d and peacefully died. Seemed like most of the deaths especially on hospice were peaceful and many expressed seeing someone or something coming (that was unseen) or there with them. My father-in-law passed away four years ago. He was on life support but still conscious, and he made the decision himself to be taken off life support. The whole family was there and he was fully conscious when he was removed . His last words were \u201cThis isn\u2019t so bad.\u201d ",

            "answer_text": "Depending on one\u2019s culture and upbringing, and by the time one reaches the age of 18, he or she will have an idea of how to deal with death. Or at least how they view death. For some, their culture will have the biggest influence on what death is and how they will approach it. Different nations, cultures, peoples and religions will have a different view of a person\u2019s passing. Some view it more as a transition, while other view it as the end of one\u2019s journey. Others rejoice of one\u2019s death, others pray and mourn the passing of a beloved. But one thing is certain, death is our final graduation in life. Not one is immortal and we cannot foresee when we will be passing. Of course there\u2019s the act of ending one\u2019s own life. Even for those people who\u2019d committed suicide, their view of death might have influenced their action to take their own. ",

No more lives, no heaven, no higher consciousness, no level-ups. So my perception of my existence looks like this:  On the other hand when I die my body will give possibility for new life to grow: grass, trees, worms and such. I get recycled in this extremely complex ecosystem that has been on Earth for hundreds of millions of years, and hopefully will be here for several hundreds of millions more. So, in a sense, despite the lack of any religious beliefs, I know that I AM part of something bigger than me and upon death I enter this circulation of life. It makes it a tiny bit less heavy to bear the thought of me not being around anymore. ",

But, despite all the trouble, all the joy that we experience, death is the common denomination in all our lives. Life has some meaning to it only because we know that someday, it will have to end. And we try to live, to do all we can to truly live, before we pass on. Death adds some meaning to life. ",

I can`t believe that a \"loving God\" would send an otherwise righteous, saintly person to hell just because he hadn`t heard about your God, or simply didn`t believe there actually is a God. Why does one have to be \"God fearing\" in order to get into some heaven? I believe that the 10 Commandments (most of them) are good things and I`ve pretty much lived my life by them. I`m a good person and I`ve always believed in the \"Golden Rule\", but if I`m wrong and God does exist, I will burn in the eternal pit of fire, etc. Bull Crap. ",

Yeah very scary but its the only truth we know. ",

People who have had near death experiences can give you a glimpse but it is generally only of the \u201cReception Area\u201d. The world of Spirit is a very very large and varied place with many levels and sub levels. Most descriptions will therefore be quite limited and will not show that particular souls final destination. The good news is that wherever you end up (Birds of a feather flock together!) you can work you way up by your prayers and actions. ",

Still every day we live until the last, I don't think we should overthink it nor ignore it just appreciate the sun, the wind, nature, your family and everything you care for, that's what life is about.
