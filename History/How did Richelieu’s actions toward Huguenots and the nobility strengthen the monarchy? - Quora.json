            "answer_text": "The Huguenots were as much political as they were religious. They represented a faction in France that at times contested the king\u2019s edicts. That they had a separate army led by prominent members like Coligny and the Prince Of Conde was a danger to the king\u2019s idea of a unified nation. Richelieu was not only a Cardinal but the king\u2019s Secretary Of State and responsible for order. There were 8 civil wars starting in 1562. (side note. My family left during the 2nd war in 1567. The last war was in 1629 and with the fall of the last Protestant city, Rochelle. Protestantism came to the nobility first as they were able to read the tracts and pamphlets proclaiming the return to primitive Christianity with its emphasis on the bible and preaching and the elimination of what they saw as man made religion. Originally Lutheran they soon adopted the faith as interpreted by a fellow Frenchman Jean Cauvin (John Calvin) living in exile in Geneva Switzerland. Thousands of refugees from France and Scotland came to be taught and act as missionaries. The faith spread among the lower classes who were primarily merchants, soldiers and craftsmen. As persecution multiplied against them they started to leave for other countries taking their trades with them and reducing exports and the taxes they brought. They mostly went to Norwich England and Amsterdam in the Netherlands enriching both countries. A small group went to Poland and Russia. Richelieu passed laws forbidding them to leave. The treasury was shrinking and French kings liked to spend money especially Louis XIV. England and the Netherlands became powerful traders while France became weaker. Still Huguenots kept slipping out. Richelieu never thought to reduce the terrible punishments like quartering soldiers in Protestant homes, seizing children under 12 years of age, declaring Protestant marriages null and void and the children from them bastards. Rights of inheritance were taken away. The Edict Of Nantes was a treaty promulgated By Henri IV the first Bourbon king. He\u2019d been raised a Protestant and his sister was a leader in the Protestant movement. Some peace was possible but still there was violence. Cities were divided between the two faiths. A massacre took place on Henri\u2019s wedding day with as many as 50,000 Protestants killed over a two week period including Protestant leaders like Coligny. All of this disorder was bad for the king and his government. The loss of goods to trade hurt financially. Richelieu did what he could but could not stop the fighting and loss of tradesmen. Louis XIV finally finished it all by declaring Protestantism illegal. All preachers were to leave France in two weeks or face execution. France never recovered from all this disorder. The rest of Europe gained territory and wealth. Huguenot thought is present in the US Constitution in the Bill Of Rights. Some of the founders were Huguenots or descendants. (Jay, Boudinot and Washington) Richelieu tried to spare France and the king all of this but the king brought all of his efforts to naught. ",
