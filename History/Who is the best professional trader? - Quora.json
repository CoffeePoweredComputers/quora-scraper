            "answer_text": "I am going to take another tack in answering this based on what popped into my mind when I read the question, though what Nassif says is totally accurate. My answer is - you cannot tell! And the reason I say this is because I am the founding director of a company called firstglobalcredit.com. Our core business is allowing people to use bitcoin as collateral to trade a broad range of markets. 350 or so split among US, UK, Hong Kong and German stocks, futures, precious metals, oil etc. But another thing we do is run these trading competitions and then stake the winners to live, funded trading accounts. This means we attract a wide range of people to the competitions, from professional traders to rank beginners. What i have learned in the 2 years we have run these competitions is YOU CANNOT TELL WHO WILL BE THE BEST PROFESSIONAL TRADER! The competition lets the cream of talent to rise to the top. Then the winners get the live accounts. This absolutely changes the dynamic because all of a sudden they are trading actual money. It\u2019s weird and quite fascinating who is profitable and who cannot handle that transition. I am just delighted watching these people that maybe would not have had this opportunity. They start trading, learn while going along making a profit. They ask questions. I will always answer factual questions about trading. But I do not comment on style or strategy. We are building a pool of real talent and ALL over the world. That is quite cool too. People in southeast Asia or Africa who seem to be using this as a foot in the door to a different way of life. An unexpected and really neat consequence. ",
