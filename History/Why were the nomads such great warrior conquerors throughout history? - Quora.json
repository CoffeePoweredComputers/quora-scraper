            "answer_text": "The great tactical advantage for all steppe warriors was mobility and speed of maneuver (being 100% mounted) during the campaign. Their centuries of nomadic hunter/gatherer/herder existence had hardened them to endure the physical challenges of the military campaign and to triumph over the softer, settled peoples of the Near East, China, and Europe. Their discipline and ruthlessness, along with their ability to carry everything they needed to live off the land while campaigning, eliminated or greatly reduced supply problems in the field and allowed them to exploit tactical options (such as the feigned retreat) that were not available to the heavy cavalry they were typically arranged against. With every warrior mounted, they were the Middle Age equivalent of modern mechanized infantry, and their reliance on missile weapons perfectly complemented their mobility and tactics to make them difficult to engage except on their terms.  Technologically, the steppe warriors were not actually inferior in most of the ways that affect success in mobile warfare. Their composite bows were the finest in the world during most of that period and their swords and light armor were perfectly suited to the slashing battle tactics they adopted. The possible advantages of their more heavily armed and armored opponents were easily neutralized when (as was generally the case) the nomads could simply decline battle when conditions were not favorable. When the Mongols added a state-of-the-art siege warfare capability following their conquest of China, they became an almost irresistible force that combined the sophistication of Chinese engineering with the tactical force multiplier of battle-hardened light cavalry to ensure there would be no hiding place for those that opposed them. Fortunately for the world, they were mostly indifferent emperors who were not that concerned with holding territory and consolidating their gains, or all of Europe might have been seriously threatened.

            "answer_text": "The technology of the Mongols was certainly different but not necessarily inferior. Their composite bows were state of the art for the time and there were documented (by others) of mongols shooting at targets 500 metres away.   The skills of a mounted archer and a mounted hunter / herder are essentially the same.  Accurate shooting, superb horsemanship and teamwork.  In a nomadic culture, every man would have these skills.  The Chinese army probably only made up of 1% of the population.  More Chinese but fewer soldiers.   The Chinese had something, a lot of somethings to defend.  The Mongols were attacking.  They took advantage of the fact that if you defend everything, you defend nothing.  Most of the Chinese soldiers were out of the picture because they were assigned to defend a town that was never attacked.  They were no more a danger to the Mongols than if they were dead.   If the Mongols lost a battle, all they lost was some soldiers and territory.  They just went away and came back.  Any battle that the Chinese lost, they lost peasants, territory and stuff.   In the end, the Chinese won though.  The invaders became part of the invaded. ",
