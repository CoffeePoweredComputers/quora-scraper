            "answer_text": "The 20\u2019s were marked by Prohibition, expansion of Criminal enterprise, ostentatious consumption by the nouveau riche, fatuous disregard for the environment including wanton air, water pollution and extreme post War economic confidence which , of course, led to the eventual Great Depression. Does one see any comparison from the above to the current dynamics in America? It is probably \u201cRoaring\u201d to some, the vulgarly wealthy perhaps but down here on the streets where the consequence are met in real time, it is reminiscent of a Lord and Serfs Society. When the rectification party gains control once more this year, America will thankfully return to the progressive paradigm set forth in previous conscious intelligent administrations. We will see \u201cGreen\u201d environmental attitudes again, individual freedom expansions, a cessation of a \u201cWaring\u201d culture, and focus on \u201cHuman\u201d fundamental issues. However, this repatriation will come with a profound price, not to the working class so much thankfully, but to the bottom line of mega business and the ultra wealthy. The false sense of economic security will be rudely awakened by the fear of a redistribution of wealth driving an attenuation of investor confidence. Meaning, not so \u201cRoaring\u201d any more! ",

            "answer_text": "Welllllll, sort of. I personally think the fascists pulled the trigger too soon, and there are still too many Americans who can reason critically. I think the 2020s will be more like the 1930s, we will skip the final Republican grift and go right to restoring a free market economy, higher incomes for working people, and creating more billionaires than the rest of the world combined, like the USA did when we followed Progressive Economic Policies from 1930\u20131980.
