            "answer_text": "Well, yes, assuming you realise that real life is not a movie and therefore fighting for self-defence only has one goal: to get away. So \u2018effectively\u2019 here means to escape. We know from various incidents that an unarmed but highly skilled defender can successfully escape from up to eight attackers with knives who are attempting to corral him, stab him and rob him. It\u2019s all about the escapeBut you have to understand there is only one goal in self-defence and that is to escape. It\u2019s not some kind of movie fight. You can either choose to fight for a draw, so you can walk away - if that looks like a possible - or simply leg it in the first place. The sensible option of course is always to walk away whenever possible, preferably before anything physical happens. Staying around to argue, or fight, is not self-defence: it\u2019s voluntary streetfighting. Self-defence is when they stop you getting away and you have to fight or die. Maybe it is when your family are threatened and you can\u2019t just walk away. Self-defence = multiple assailantsWhere I lived there was no such thing as a single person street assault. There were a shedload of street attacks and the local papers were full of them every week. Deaths, maimings, people in a coma. There were always several assailants and some were likely to have knives. The favourite method there was to stab the victim in the back of the neck while an accomplice argues with them. Several of the guys in the gym had scars from this, it\u2019s called the Croydon tattoo. If you know how to fight, you can survive: by escaping. Fighting for your life is a fight, no getting away from that - so fight experience is king. Run-punch-throwWhen the odds are high you only have one way to survive (assuming you\u2019re not an 800 metres champ): it\u2019s called the run-punch-throw method. In this you run for a defensible space (lights or crowds in the distance, a doorway or stairwell, whatever) while fighting off the nearest attackers. You punch / strike anyone who gets close or throw them if they grab and you can\u2019t hit. All on the move. It helps to practice a mobility-based defensive fighting art, to make this work, and that\u2019s what we did. It is proven to work and like I say has succeeded versus 8 guys with knives. Not without a few stab and slash wounds of course :) \u2026that would be impossible unless it\u2019s in a movie about Ip Man or something, who was clearly immortal. Hard to achieve at a bodyweight of about 110 pounds but that\u2019s Hollywood. Self-defence is about escaping as soon as you can, preferably before any violence. Fighting is best avoided and is only ever needed in a situation where you would be perfectly justified in drawing a pistol and putting two shots into the face of the nearest assailant [1] then lining up on the next. If you aren\u2019t legally / morally supportable doing that, then you should be walking.  [1] Advice from a US police officer who survived 14 gunfights: Shoot them in the face. The only guaranteed way to stop an attacker is to shoot them in the head.Learn to shoot one-handed. Your free hand usually isn\u2019t free: it\u2019s doing something like fending off an assailant; holding onto cover you\u2019re trying to get some protection from; applying pressure to a wound you\u2019ve taken, to stop it bleeding you out; pulling a fresh mag out; etc.Or take a look at the Sgt Grammins gunfight on YouTube, the Donut Operator channel (an ex-cop who puts up gunfight dashcam and bodycam vids). Grammins was a police firearms instructor, carrying a .45 Glock, who put 13 shots into an attacker shooting at him after a vehicle stop. Three shots from his .45 went through the attacker\u2019s centre chest, including one right through the heart. The attacker kept coming and kept firing at Sgt Grammins, emptying one pistol then returning to his car for another pistol, then back to Sgt Grammins who was taking cover behind his patrol car, to keep firing at him. The shootout only ended when Grammins put a shot through the guy\u2019s head: hit #13. He was one shot from running out of ammo, or something like that (must have had some misses, as well as the 13 hits). Grammins changed to a 9mm Glock as the big .45 made no difference - now he carries 145 rounds and has a better chance of putting rounds into an attacker\u2019s head without running dry. Shooting an attacker might do nothing at all, in some cases, unless you shoot them through the brain or upper spine. That works. Some outfits teach to shoot them centrally through the mouth, which blows out their cervical spine and they drop. Good if you have a long gun maybe. Guns aren\u2019t the answer to everything - if you watch channels like Active Self Protection you can find hundreds of examples where shooting at an armed attacker did nothing at all. They just kept coming, or ran off. Knife holders then stabbed the armed defender. There\u2019s one clip on there where 4 officers fired at a knife wielding perp, at point blank range, and he stabs them then runs off. And then you have the classic case where 7 officers lined up against 1 armed perp, at a range of around 6 or 8 yards by the look of it on the bodycam videos. So there were 8 present with pistols all firing at each other at close range. 67 shots were fired in total. When they stopped due to empty guns or whatever, they soon realised that no hits whatsoever had been scored by anyone, out of 67 shots at short range. The perp surrendered, was cuffed, and taken into custody - probably as stunned as the rest of them. That\u2019s 67 shots at close range by a mix of trained officers and a desperate shooter, one of them somehow aiming at a bunch of people but still missing. First learn to fight. Guns are not always the right answer. Fighting ability always is. The goal of any defensive action is to escape. ",
