            "answer_text": "This is a fairly commonplace scenario in semi-bilingual societies: societies where lots of people know a second language, but they don\u2019t know it well. Other examples include: Pseudo-anglicisms, such as handy for mobile phone/cell phone in German, recordman for record holder in French, and pokemon \u201cpocket monster\u201d in Japanese;Engrish, as a coverterm for the decorative but not communicative use of English in East Asia;Neo-Classical compounds that violate the rules of how Latin and Greek put words together (and which I often fulminate about here).Pseudo-Spanish in the US, such as Camino Mucho Dinero (mocking Californian roads like El Camino Real), or correctamundo\u2014SpanishDict \u201cAre there any other words you've heard used before that are pseudo-Spanish?\u201d \u201cMost of the Spanish spoken in Southern California is pseudo-Spanish.\u201d Jocular equivalents in other languages; fake Turkish was considered funny in Greece a couple of decades ago, such as tso\u0263lan doktor \u201cbrat doctor\u201d = \u201cpaediatrician\u201d (Turkish i\u00e7 o\u011flan\u0131 \u201cpalace groom\u201d is pretty far from its offspring Greek tso\u0263lani \u201cbrat\u201d), or banistir dulap \u201cvoyeur cupboard\u201d = \u201cTV\u201d. (Greeks assume banistiri \u201cvoyeurism\u201d is a Turkish word, but it is formed within Greek from Italian bagno \u201cbaths\u201d, via the Greek derived verb banizo.)The expectation behind the question is that, if you\u2019re going to introduce a French word in English, surely you\u2019re going to already know French. Surely people don\u2019t just make French words up without actually knowing French properly. The examples above show that is not the case. People did not ask the permission of English speakers before making up handy or recordman. And in the case of Engrish, or Neo-Classical words, or pseudo-Spanish, or pseudo-Turkish, the people making up the words really don\u2019t care whether they make sense in the source language or not. And I\u2019m deliberately lumping all those other instances with Engrish, because the point of them is not to communicate better with speakers of the source language, or to reflect the lived experience of bilingualism. The point of all of them is to sound like the source language, with whatever reasons of associated prestige or humour or local colour, without actually having to fully study the source language. People made up automobile without caring about what Greeks might think (and inevitably, they thought \u201cyuck\u201d and corrected it to aftokinito). People made up recordman without particularly caring whether English-speakers would recognise it as a word of their own. People did not make up correctamundo thinking they were speaking genuine Spanish, any more than Greeks really thought \u201cbrat doktor\u201d was genuine Turkish. And the thing is, they genuinely can get away with it. Just as any number of pseudo-Gallicisms have. Neglig\u00e9e looks like it isn\u2019t an example of this kind of thing: it was originally used in that sense in French (in the masculine); but as Pseudo-English points out (yes, there\u2019s at least one book about this phenomenon), au gratin is.

            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy are there French words in the English language that have never existed in authentic French?\u201d It is worth questioning the concept of \u201cauthentic French\u201d. Relatively little of the French population spoke French as their primary language until after the Revolution. It had, and still has, dialects. Not least Walloon, Swiss and Canadian dialect clusters but possibly more in times past. Many words rejected by the Academy may still be part of what others see as authentic French. French was spoken in England for a couple of centuries after 1066. It derived from the Norman dialect of French, not Parisian. It will have gained, lost and modified quite a few words over that time. Additionally, when French was no longer everyday speech in England amongst the Normans, the pretentious amongst them will have used it to sound sophisticated but will have gotten it wrong at times. Nick Nicholas and Robert Hill have made other good points that I won\u2019t duplicate. It seems strange to focus on French in that context because so many more words in English are constructed from Latin and Greek \u201croots\u201d. Even where those might make sense where the languages are or were spoken they are used in quite different senses: broader or narrower; to what they might have been in those languages. The scientific name of every plant and animal, to begin with, but a vast array of other words as well. ",
