            "answer_text": "WW2 achieved unbelievable unity between capitalist USA and marxist USSR between states with diametrically opposite ideologies as marxism and capitalism. That unity crashed unbeatable Wehrmacht army and \u201cthe eternal Third Reich\u201d. In 1930s Hitler was behind anti-soviet propaganda in USA to prevent the alliance between USA-USSR in any possible way in the light of the upcoming war. Of course the USA-USSR unexpectable military alliance drove him crazy. Consequently one of Hitler\u2019s objective was to destroy the USA-USSR alliance as soon as possible. Modern political antagonism between USA and Russia is Hitler legacy. In 1944, after the total German defeat on the battlefields Hitler planned political revenge. Although Germans are always military failures but politically very manipulative and persistent. Even after losing two global wars in the 20th century they could not stop to behave this way. In 1945 the interrogation of a French collaborator revealed he had attended a conference about a \u201cgreat plan of promoting post-war Nazi agenda\u201d near Munich in mid-April 1945, a few weeks before the end of the Second World War. The agent, Olivier Mordrelle, was caught and interrogated in Italy and a report produced for MI5 that was marked \u201ctop secret,\u201d describing his reliability as \u201cgood.\u201d MI5 files: Nazis planned 'Fourth Reich' in post-war Europe In 1944 Hitler preplanned few steps to continue his ideology after surrender to allies. The plan of Hitler was surrender to Americans and convince them in \u201cred danger\u201d. Nazi plan worked well indeed because: USA was ideologically very liberal, soft and weak in 1945, therefore the takeover will be easy.in USA Hitler still had a Nazi spy network and tens of thousands American Nazi party supporters (despite Roosevelt sent many of them in American concentration camps).GEHLEN ORGANISATION Nazi general Reinhard Gehlen broke the alliance and began the Cold War. In 1945 Gehlen surrendered to the Americans, scared Americans with mythical Soviet invasion (typical for Nazis), pitched himself as professional spy organisator, he shared his vast espionage archive on the USSR, Gehlen promised that he could resurrect an underground network were well placed to wreak havoc throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe against communism. Gehlen returned to West Germany in the summer of 1946 with a mandate to rebuild his espionage organization and resume spying on the East at the behest of CIA. The date is significant as it preceded the onset of the cold war, which, according to standard U.S. historical accounts, did not begin until 1947. That means Washington was in a cold war mode already since 1946. That fact debunks the Western myth about \u201cthe aggressive Soviet policies to blame for triggering the cold war\u201d. That way Nazis continued their russophobic Hitler\u2019 policy. Allies did not win the war in 1945, the Hitler agenda is still intact. USA had fully adopted Hitler\u2019 politic in all life aspects : religiously, culturally, politically, and military. General Gehlen always exaggerated the Soviet threat in order to exacerbate tensions between the USA and USSR . He succeeded in convincing General Lucius Clay, military governor of the U.S. zone of occupation in Germany, that a major Soviet war mobilization had begun in Eastern Europe. This prompted Clay to dash off a frantic, top-secret telegram to Washington in March 1948, warning that war \u201cmay come with dramatic suddenness.\u201d Gehlen used the American fear of a sudden Soviet invasion of West Germany to his own advantage. To demonstrate his intelligence prowess to the Allies, on numerous occasions he used bogus information to convince them that the Russians were planning an imminent strike against the West. Gehlen\u2019s disinformation strategy was based on a simple premise: the colder the cold war got, the more safe the life of Nazis criminals. In 1991 when most of Nazi ideologists in CIA died the cold war had ended but the enormous damage to the humanity, to spirituality, to USA, to USSR to many other countries has been already made. The Gehlen Organisation could only flourish under cold war conditions; as an institution it was therefore committed to perpetuating the Soviet-American conflict. Most of Gehlen Org\u2019 infiltration missions in the Eastern block were dismal failures. Over time, the Soviets were able to infiltrate their own counterspies into the Gehlen Org and tipped off their counterparts whenever a mission was planned. Gehlen spent his post war life in a sort of double role, employed officially by the US and unofficially furthering the interests of the postwar ODESSA organization and its hopes for a \"Fourth Reich\" that would one day rise again It seems that in the Gehlen headquarters, one SS man paved the way for the next and Himmler\u2019s elite were having happy reunion ceremonies,\u201d - the newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau reported in the early 1950s. Gehlen employed in his Gehlen Organisation ex-Wehrmacht and SS officers under his command. Later, for 12 years, Gehlen was the first president of the Federal Intelligence Service of West Germany (1956-1968) \u2013 and was also the highest ranking reserve officer in the West German military. Based near Munich, Gehlen proceeded to enlist thousands of Gestapo, Wehrmacht, and SS veterans. Even the vilest of the vile\u2013the senior bureaucrats who ran the central administrative apparatus of the Holocaust\u2013were welcome in the \u201cGehlen Org,\u201d as it was called\u2013including Alois Brunner, Adolf Eichmann\u2019s chief deputy. SS major Emil Augsburg and gestapo captain Klaus Barbie, otherwise known as the \u201cButcher of Lyon,\u201d were among those who did double duty for Gehlen and U.S. intelligence. Bolted lock, stock, and barrel into the CIA, Gehlen\u2019s Nazi-infested spy apparatus functioned as America\u2019s secret eyes and ears in central Europe. The Org would go on to play a major role within NATO, supplying two-thirds of raw intelligence on the Warsaw Pact countries. Under CIA auspices and as head of the West German secret service until 1968, Gehlen influenced on U.S. policy toward the USSR. However \u201cthe agency loved Gehlen because he fed us what we wanted to hear. We used his stuff constantly, and we fed it to everyone else\u2013the Pentagon, the White House, the newspapers. They loved it, too. But it was hyped-up Russian bogeyman junk, and it did a lot of damage to USA,\u201d- a retired CIA official told to Christopher Simpson who is the author of the book Blowback: America\u2019s Recruitment of Nazis and Its Effects on the Cold War. Many Nazi spies proved inept or worse. Some were deemed habitual liars, confidence men or embezzlers, and a few even turned out to be Soviet double agents. Third Reich veterans often proved adept at peddling data\u2013much of it false\u2013in return for cash and safety. Many Nazis played a double game, feeding scuttlebutt to both sides of the East-West conflict and preying upon the mutual suspicions during the cold war. The only thing Nazis wanted to insure is to make a Cold War as cold as possible. For Nazis who would otherwise have been charged with war crimes, the cold war enabled to avoid a death sentence. \u201cThe real winners of the cold war were Nazi war criminals, many of whom were able to escape justice because the East and West became so rapidly focused after the war on challenging each other,\u201d - says Eli Rosenbaum, director of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Special Investigations. \u201cInstead of capital punishment Nazi criminals received generous financial compensation and good salary because Western spy agencies considered them useful assets in the cold war,\u201d - recent CIA papers raise critical questions about American foreign policy and the origins of the cold war. The decision to recruit Nazi operatives had a negative impact on U.S.-Soviet relations and set the stage for Washington\u2019s tolerance of human rights abuses and other criminal acts in the name of \u201canti-Communism\u201d. With that fateful sub-rosa embrace, the die was cast for a litany of antidemocratic CIA interventions around the world. In the decades after World War II, the C.I.A. employed thousands high ranked Nazis criminals and many of them got USA citizenship. USA absorbed many them into the government structures. Employed by CIA, Nazis ideologists implanted genocidal Nazi policy to the relatively peaceful USA. Being part of NATO, Nazi apologists implemented the colonial ideas of global conquest to the USA. Nazis implanted the murderous political and military agendas as an official NATO policy. Hitlerism did not die in 1945. Gehlen Organisation employed all kind of Nazis during the Cold War:  The key figure on the German side of the USA-Nazi trust was former Wehrmacht General Reinhard Gehlen who was head of Abwehr on the Eastern Front (1942-45) where the most atrocious crimes were perpetrated. During World War II, Gehlen oversaw all German military-intelligence operations in Eastern Europe and USSR.

            "answer_text": "Theoretically, Winston Churchill's words about the \"Iron Curtain\", but more realistically it's the end of World War II and a new geopolitical division of the world. As a result of World War II, many countries lost their current position: France, UK, Germany, and many also lost their independence. As a result of hostilities, Europe was divided between the western zone under the control of the US and its allies, as well as the eastern zone supervised by the USSR. The US and USSR had conflicting interests, both countries wanted to dominate politically and economically all over the world, especially in Europe. The result of this rivalry was the constant fear of the outbreak of another world war, which would be tragic due to the resources of the state (including nuclear weapons, and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which was important for the start of the Cold War). An open conflict never occurred (of course, some alternative form of conflict took place in other countries, such as Korea, Vietnam or Afghanistan), and the costs of the arms race turned out to be too much of a financial burden for the USSR and as a result the country collapsed, thus ending the cold war.
