In such a case, the game is declared to be a draw, as no move can be made and yet the king is safe where he is. Each player gets half a point each. ",

            "answer_text": "Thanks for the A2A. Stalemate in chess refers to a position where your opponent can no longer make a legal move inspite of not being in check. Such a situation results in draw. Refer below diagrams black to move for better understanding:   In the above diagrams black cannot make a legal move. Hence games are drawn by stalemate. The game result is draw by stalemate even if you are in a superior position. The opponent can no longer make a legal move as he may be having only his king or his other pieces may be blocked by your pieces.
