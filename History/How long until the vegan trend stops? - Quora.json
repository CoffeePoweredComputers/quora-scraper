            "answer_text": "One of the biggest misconceptions of veganism is that it is a diet. I am not sure if this is implied in your question, but when people refer to veganism as a trend this tends to be one of the underlying perceptions. From the Vegan Society: Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.[1] I prefer to frame veganism as the principle of not harming (including killing) sentient beings. As you can see from both of our definitions, veganism boils down to not exploiting sentient beings, namely animals, for any purpose. These definitions therefore stretch veganism beyond being just a diet. And the reasons for becoming vegan are many and can usually be characterized under ethical, environmental and health reasons. Because of this, in practice, I do not foresee veganism slowing down anytime soon. In fact, there are straightforward data that show veganism is rising. That does not mean it cannot end, but it does mean more and more people are catching on to the fact that we can live healthy, prosperous lives without contributing to the harm and death of other sentient beings. But your question is asking when will it potentially end and when that will be. I foresee it ending when we no longer breed and slaughter animals for food, clothing or any other use. It will have ended because veganism will be the social norm and therefore will no longer need a label. I do not see this happening in this lifetime but perhaps within the next few hundred years or so. Footnotes[1] Definition of veganism",
