There are however a few problems (1) while durant is certainly not relgious his history is teleological in that he tends to see history as a heading toward particular purpose.for instance both fall of Rome reformation were nessersary. (2) some of is outdated for instance he to caught up idea like decadence when dealing the later Roman Empire (3) occationally some of the term can seem a little racist he some time uses the term white mans world his opinion of woman at least in the earlier volume is occationally pratonizing and attitude to homosexuality is ambigious. (4) he genially but firmly anti relgious this maybe some that is good in your books, if your that way inclined, to be fair he will give time to the defender of religion in history, but more so to those on the attack and general favours them. He will tend interpret anyone\u2019s who faith is anyway in doubt , as being an atheist like Montaigne. He tend to repeat term like decline of religion all to often faith declines, so much such that one would be amazed, by the end 1815 that anyone went to church. Also he declared that great battle of 18 century was between faith and reason now this maybe durant belief but he does little to suggest it was how people saw it at the time or since. ",

            "answer_text": "The only ones I've read cover-to-cover are Our Oriental Heritage and The Age of Faith, both of which are tremendously rewarding. Because of the way the books are arranged, you miss important perspectives if you only read selective chapters, missing out on, for example, the social history of a particular period, or the history of its art, or its philosophy. So to answer, it's certainly worthwhile: You appreciate the breadth of the authors' erudition, and your own understanding takes on additional dimension. The moral perspective in the Durants' historiography is, if a bit dated, nonetheless enlightened and very progressive for its day; they steer a nice line between the sin of historicism (imposing contemporary morality on historical situation) and slipping down the slope of total relativism.  The humor that you note in your question details is there in abundance. Wit and wisdom, lovely prose, terrific insight, an astonishing breadth of perspective\u2014what more could you want? I'm a big fan too. If you enjoy the audiobooks narrated by Grover Gardner, I suggest that you try those read by Stephan Rudnicki too. He's narrated, to date, both The Age of Faith and The Reformation. I think they're better, honestly. Rudnicki is my favorite audiobook narrator. He reads the Latin passages  in The Age of Faith beautifully, and lends both gravitas and, where appropriate, levity to the text. Let me just share one passage that I copied out after being absolutely floored reading it. This passage closes out a section on pre-Renaissance Italy in that book: \"We must remind ourselves again that the historian, like the journalist, is forever tempted to sacrifice the normal to the dramatic, and never quite conveys an adequate picture of any age. During these conflicts of popes and emperors, Guelphs and Ghibellines, Blacks and Whites [the political factions, not races], Italy was sustained by a hard-working peasantry; perhaps then as now Italian fields were cultivated with art as well as industry, and were divided and arranged to please the eye as well as feed the flesh. Hills and crags and mountains were carved and terraced to hold grapevines, fruit and nut orchards and olive trees; and gardens were laboriously walled to check erosion and hold the precious rain. In the cities, a hundred industries absorbed the great majority of men, and left little time for the strife of speeches, votes, knives, and swords. Merchants and bankers were not all merciless ghouls; they too, if only by their acquisitive fever, made the cities hum and grow. Nobles like Corso Donati, Guido Cavalcanti, Can Grande della Scala, could be men of culture\u2014even if now and then they used their swords to make a point. Women moved with vibrant freedom in this high-spirited society. Love was for them no wordy sham of troubadours, nor the grim fusion of sweating peasants, nor yet the service of a knight to a parsimonious goddess; it was a gallant and ardent amorousness leading with reckless dispatch to a full-bodied abandonment and unpremeditated motherhood. Here and there, in this ferment, teachers maneuvered with desperate patience to insert instruction into reluctant youth; prostitutes eased the tumescence of imaginative men; poets distilled their foiled desire into compensatory verse; artists hungered while seeking perfection; priests played politics and consoled the bereaved and the poor; and philosophers struggled through a labyrinth of myths toward the bright mirage of truth. There was a stimulus in this society, an excitement and competition, that sharpened men's wits and tongues, brought forth their reserve and unsuspected powers, and lured them, even if by their own destruction, to clear the way and set the stage for the Renaissance. Through many pains, and the shedding of blood, would come the great Rebirth.\" ",

As a challenge to myself, I took the set to sea with me after I joined the Navy, then determined that I would read it consecutively from Volume I through Volume XI.  I did it if for no other reason than to be able one day to said I did so.  I have since read several of the volumes for the second and third time.  Today, I study the colonial period of American history and still refer to Durant for expanded studies on the period.  I have three or four of the volumes on my laptop now, and I am sure I will return to the resources often.  I would like to mention that only a year or so after I read the set, I happened to be in Los Angeles at the time the Durants passed away within a week of each other, and I mourned them as family.  They will be missed, but not forgotten. ",

I read: The Age of Louis XIV, the Age of Voltaire, Rousseau and Revolution, and the Age of Napoleon, and in excerpts, The Age of Faith and the Age of Reason. What wonderful books! It is a very enlightening experience. The Durants manage to find that perfect balance between detail and summary. Anyone could very well learn about, for example, the philosophies of Descartes and Kant in a few pages, with historical background, appropriate quotations, and clarity. If anyone seeks to be more cultivated, and learn about civilization, culture, and refinement relatively easily, pick up a volume of the story of civilization. ",

It's cumbersome when facing the totality, but as you've found, taken individually, each sentence is light and easy. Heck, even each page isn't too much to take in.
