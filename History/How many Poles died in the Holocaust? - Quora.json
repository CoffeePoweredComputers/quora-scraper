            "answer_text": "Estimates range from the Nazis murdering 1.9 to 3 million non-Jewish Polish civilians and an additional 3 million Polish Jews. The German occupation of Poland was exceptionally brutal. The Nazis considered Poles to be racially inferior. Following the military defeat of Poland by Germany in September 1939, the Germans launched a campaign of terror. German police units shot thousands of Polish civilians and required all Polish males to perform forced labor. The Nazis sought to destroy Polish culture by eliminating the Polish political, religious, and intellectual leadership. This was done in part because of German contempt for Polish culture and in part to prevent resistance against the occupation. In May 1940, the German occupation authorities launched AB-Aktion, a plan to eliminate the Polish intelligentsia and leadership class. The aim was to kill Polish leaders with great speed, thus instilling fear in the general population and discouraging resistance. The Germans shot thousands of teachers, priests, and other intellectuals in mass killings in and around Warsaw, especially in the city's Pawiak prison. The Nazis sent thousands more to the newly built Auschwitz concentration camp, to Stutthof, and to other concentration camps in Germany where non-Jewish Poles constituted the majority of inmates until March 1942. The Nazis conducted indiscriminate retaliatory measures against populations in areas where resistance was encountered. These policies included mass expulsions. In November 1942, the Germans expelled over 100,000 people from the Zamosc region; many were deported to the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps. Approximately 50,000 Polish children were taken from their families, transferred to the Reich, and subjected to \"Germanization\" policies.

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve always heard 6 million, 3 million of whom were Jews. That would obviously mean 3 million non-Jewish Poles. Other people here are saying 2.1 million, and I think the reason for that difference must be the changing borders after the war. Present-day Belarus was essentially carved from Poland after the war, and part of Germany was given to Poland to compensate for this loss. Lots of the deaths were in Eastern Poland (modern day Belarus). ",
