            "answer_text": "How about heavyweight boxer Rocky Marciano. He went undefeated for a total of 49 fights for the span of his professional boxing career (1947\u20131955). He\u2019s one of the only heavyweight professional boxers to retire as champion and he was the inspiration for the name and fighting style of the character Rocky Balboa from the Rocky movies. Marciano had an impressive 43 wins by knockout making him one of the best heavyweights to ever step in the ring.  Unfortunately, Marciano died in a plane crash at the age of 45 but his legacy continues to prosper in the boxing community.  A bonus photograph to show just what happened if you stepped in the ring with one of the greatest heavyweight boxers to ever do it. ",
