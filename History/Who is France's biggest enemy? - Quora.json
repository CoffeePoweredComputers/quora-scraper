            "answer_text": "France is France\u2019s biggest enemy. The importation of large numbers of radicalized Muslims has already cost a number of French lives and the toll will rise substantially. These \u201crefugees\u201d have rioted in French streets, committed acts of terrorism, are part of rapidly rising crime rates, essentially invaded parts of France making them unsafe for French to walk. Outside of internal threats, Iran and Russia are France\u2019s two top threats. Iran funds most of the terrorist groups in the world and arms quite a few of the ones it doesn\u2019t fund and train. Iran is moving into an expansionist mode and sensing the power vacuum left by the EU\u2019s withdrawal from world matters. This is emboldening Iran to get increasingly aggressive. Putin in Russia dreams of recreating the Soviet empire. He also holds Western Europe by the gonads if the pipeline goes through. Anything he wants, he will get just by threatening to shut off the oil. France is highly vulnerable and committed to defense treaties which it won\u2019t honor with Eastern European nations. The problem is if Russia rolls through Eastern Europe it\u2019ll continue on West and roll through France like the Nazis did. France\u2019s military is small, poorly prepared and geared for engagements with small nations and guerrillas. France lacks the kinds of weapons, training and infrastructure to fight against a major opponent. Worse France\u2019s EU weapons commitments mean if a couple EU nations get knocked off all of the EU\u2019s manufacture of weapons systems is KO\u2019d. The more dependent a nation is on joint EU weapons the more vulnerable it is to a lightning attack by Russia. The US is on the verge of civil war and if the US falls into civil war there will be nothing except Poland standing between France and Russia. Germany\u2019s military is in even worse shape than Frances and Italy pretends to have a military but not very hard. Most Eastern European nations have no chance against Russian forces that\u2019ll roll through them with little effort. Especially if Russia allied with either Sunni or Shiite forces, the combined air power would be enough to level all of mainland Western Europes infrastructure in a matter of days. Imagine waking up to no power, no water. The highways clogged with military vehicles, major bridges all gone, major military bases destroyed. Industrial centers in ashes, nuclear plants blown up and leaking radiation. Most of France\u2019s air force destroyed on the ground or shot down. Muslims rising up in the streets in support of the Russian advances. Taking over entire towns and killing and looting at will. That is a serious possibility if France does not take the threat of Russia and Muslims serious. It only takes a few hundred strategically located Muslims in the French military to provide enough info for local squads of Muslim infiltrators and air strikes to take out almost all of France\u2019s vital military and infrastructure. Russia alone has the air power to take out France. Iran and Shiite allies or Sunni Muslim nations combined also have larger more modern air forces than France. Without the US the only substantial military left is the UK and it\u2019s no match for Russia any more. The UK has downgraded the size of it\u2019s military and military spending so much it\u2019s not the power it once was. Germany has a sizable military but it\u2019s more like a welfare program. Poorly trained, poorly motivated, poorly armed and also full of Muslims who might turn on Germany in a heart beat. There are also a number of Soviet sympathizers and outright Communists who would probably take up with the Muslims against the current German government. Germany would not stand long. Italy and Spain are paper armies. Not worth mentioning against a major enemy. Sweden and Finland are well prepared but have tiny armies. That doesn\u2019t leave much else. Most of the rest of Europe has disarmed and spends a tiny fraction of their budge on the military. Europe has grown so used to the US protecting it that it\u2019s forgotten how to field a military. Another major potential threat is the fall of a nation like Nigeria to Muslim extremists. This became a serious risk when ISIS backed Muslims took over a chunk of the country. Had they managed to overthrow the government, the neighboring nations could have quickly fallen leaving much of Western and Northern Africa in the hands of Muslim fanatics. This alone is not a major threat as these nations lack a navy and air force. However Russian or Chinese backing and all of a sudden 5 to 10 million Africans could appear on Europe\u2019s shores. All Russia or China has to do is knock out Frances air power and infrastructure as well as keep the UK\u2019s air force busy. Take out the air power the French navy are sitting ducks for the most part. No navy or air force, clogged highways and limited communications and millions of Africans arriving in all manner of boat and you have a very serious threat. It would not take much for a Califphate to form in Northern, Central, Western Africa. ISIS and similar groups still have strongholds in those regions. A lot of Muslim radicals in the area. All that\u2019s needed is a charismatic leader and the backing of a Russia or China. China might do it for guaranteed access to resources and to keep Western Europe out of it\u2019s expansion in Asia such as invading Taiwan and a war with Japan. Russia would do it to tie up Western European forces while it slogged through Eastern Europe. All of these hinge on the US going into civil war, but that is increasingly more likely. Russia won\u2019t try the US, and the US keeps China in check as well. THAT is why we spend so much on our military. If we spent like France does then France would be speaking Russian right now and China would own half of Asia. ",

            "answer_text": "The worst enemy a country can have may not necessarily be the one we met on the battlefield but the one that is infiltrating at home from abroad when the necessary steps were not taken to stop it. I am referring here to illegal immigration. It is now obvious that France with over 16% illegal Muslim immigrants has left itself wide open for the type of conquest that neither the English or the German could achieve. So when someone says that because of so many wars, our worst enemy was England, they do not know what they are talking about. 1. France was warned by someone they called \"Crazy\" of the days that we live today. Le Pen explained exactly the times in which we live today. 2. Instead of throwing Le Pen's ideas like you would throw away bath water, the French government never analyzed properly Le Pen's ideas to see which ones could be implemented because they could have helped to prevent what is happening today. What the French government did was because they did not like Le Pen, they threw away the baby with the bathwater. That was a major defeat on the battlefield of ideas. 3. I could not believe after everything that is happening in the country of my birth that the police was unarmed. When Muslim terrorist attacked Charlie Hebdo's place, they came on bicycles (moving like tortoises) and unarmed. This is no longer the country of my birth. I can't believe the depth of stupidity there. 4. The worst enemy of France besides Muslim terrorism and illegal immigration is the French themselves. Always in French history, when France was occupied by either the English or the Germans, there were a lot of people who would help the enemy. Today, refusal to take necessary actions to deal firmly with illegal immigration and Muslim terrorism is an act by the French government and those who voted for them TO BE DELIBERATELY against the people who wants to see more serious change TO BE TAKEN TO SAVE THE COUNTRY. The solutions to be taken should be as follow: a) ReARM the policemen b) Patrol all areas inhabited by Muslims c) Establish a new rule where Assimilations of Muslims become possible. d) Be more religiously tolerant and stop issues like the banning of the scarves that aggravate Muslims... However, Muslim women will need to know that for security reasons, they will have to remove the scarves when asked to do so for identification. ALLOW ALL JEWS TO DRESS AS JEWS IF THEY WISH TO DO SO. A free country should be a country with a plurality of opinion, religions, tolerant oriented political parties, etc.. ",
