            "answer_text": "The fact that the South Pole is located on a continental landmass, and in a mountainous region of a continental landmass to boot, makes it much colder than the North Pole. The North Pole is located in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, which is actually an extension of the Atlantic if you delineate the oceans by oceanography rather than geography. As such, currents carry colder water away from the Arctic and bring in warmer water. It is actually possible, during the late Arctic summer, for the North Pole to be free of ice (albeit with lots of floating icebergs). At the South Pole, the presence of the Antarctic continent has a dramatic effect on ocean currents. There is a continuous, powerful circumpolar current that circles the entire continent, which is why oceanographers actually consider the Antarctic waters as an ocean in their own right--the Southern Ocean--although the official boundaries of it are totally incorrect. (It's officially designated as all waters south of 60S latitude, but the correct boundary is on the Antarctic Convergence, thousands of miles to the north in some instances.) The Antarctic current keeps the warmer waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans from ever reaching Antarctica. This, in turn, makes Antarctica bitterly cold year-round, and it's why most of the continent is under an ice cap more than a mile thick. This same phenomenon actually happens in any land area that is far from open sea, which is why Greenland and the Canadian High Arctic are largely covered with permanent ice, although they're not nearly as cold as Antarctica. The coastal areas of those islands are ice-free and largely habitable thanks to the sea currents, but go inland and it's extremely cold. ",

            "answer_text": "I guess you mean the northern and southern Hemisphere or the north and south poles. Earth is divided into two halves. Northern and southern Hemisphere. Northern Hemisphere consists of most of the Land mass whereas southern Hemisphere is dominated by Oceans. If it is summer in Northern Hemisphere, then southern Hemisphere experience winter and vice versa. Earth revolves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit. It is important to note that sun is not located at the center of this elliptical orbit. The below diagram should explain it better.  The farthest point from the sun is called aphelion position during July 3 or 4 and the closest point is perihelion position during January 3 or 4(winter in Northern Hemisphere). When earth is at the farthest position(aphelion) from the sun and due to the earth\u2019s tilt of 23.5 degree the Northern Hemisphere experiences summer and southern Hemisphere experience little harsher Winter. While the earth is at the closest position(perihelion)to the sun, southern hemisphere experiences extreme summers which is much harsher compared to the summers of Northern hemisphere. But since the southern Hemisphere is dominated by water body and water has high specific heat capacity, water tries to maintain the temperature reduces the severity of solar radiation a bit when closer to the sun. Also note that, this aphelion and perihelion position doesn\u2019t determine the seasons. Hope this Helps. ",
