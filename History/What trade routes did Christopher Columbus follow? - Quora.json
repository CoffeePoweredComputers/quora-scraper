            "answer_text": "Think about it for a second and you\u2019ll realize that Columbus couldn\u2019t have followed any trade routes because there wasn\u2019t any trans-Atlantic trade when he set out on his first voyage. At most, and for a very short first step, he would have known how to get to the Canary Islands. Anything past that was a leap into the unknown. Say what you like about the man but he was an excellent sailor. His times for crossing the Atlantic weren\u2019t bettered for many years. ",
