Sex was extremely prevalent even compared to today. Women rely rely on the \u201ckindness\u201d of men much more. Any drug use was limited the availability of that drug in the country we are discussing, but it would have been rampant, as would have been any ethanol drinking, based on the cost of the beer, ale, or wine. People had little to think about beyond their needs and emotions, so they didn\u2019t think much by our standards! They had to be able to bargain to stay alive, all day long! Nearly everyone believed on one god or another and often prayed to several gods as Christians in the 1950\u2019s did with saints. Almost everyone believe in some afterlife, possibly based on the planets and astrology, so that they might sojourn with the god of a particular planet. Many other people believe in reincarnation on Earth, as we do today. Many Jews and Egyptians, as well. Ah\u2026that\u2019s about all I know\u2026 They would not seem to be \u201cdim witted\u201d by IQ standards, but they would have trouble carrying on a conversation with even a ten year old.

            "answer_text": "I do not know what the early Christians believed about the world. However, I do know that the early Christians all lived communally and they shared all things in common. They were very radical. Just like the Teachings of Jesus is radical. I also know the way the early Christians lived and practiced their faith does not have any resemblance to what you see in churches today. Please watch the following video.
