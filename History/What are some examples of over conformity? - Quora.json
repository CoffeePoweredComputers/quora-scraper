            "answer_text": "Before I answer it is important to note that, while obvious, examples of over conformity change drastically with time. There are always static things that stay the same mainly due to instincts, such things mainly being over social conformity etc. With that out of the way here are some examples I can think of not previously mentioned already. \u2022Clothing choices- If you ever take a look at the 1950's clothing catalog (especially with women) or at any school or institution you'll see plenty of instances where everyone wears the same clothing despite a few of them having a interest in Victorian Era clothing or other unconventional clothing choices. Regardless of what they feel they would like to wear, the desire to fit in usually overtakes and dominates that decision. Rather than risk personal gain over reputation, most kids or adults will wear something that society at the time deems appropriate for the occasion. \u2022Behaviors and Personalities- Perhaps an example that has existed for thousands of years is the over conformity of someone's personality. Take for instance you ask a question and the person doesn't know, you feel that they're a idiot perhaps but you wouldn't say that because it's not appropriate. You could argue this is basic human decency but I'd consider it nonetheless a decent example of over conformity simply because of its nature and what it exhibits in human behavior. \u2022Ideological standpoints- The best example I have for the question that hasn't already been stated is the idolizations of an idea. Take rap music for example, it's a somewhat popular genre that has gained attention over recent years, thus this can lead to people being too afraid to express interest in any other genre simply because of anticipated backlash of the aforementioned party. That was a rather mellow example so I'll give a better yet highly debatable one. Take any social movement that is somewhat like Black Lives Matter or the recent party of Democratic protesters harassing politicians for their standpoints or beliefs. In the face of a possibly dangerous situation or even normal life most people will either stay out of the debate or suppress their belief if it contradicts the opposing parties views in order to preserve their well being at the cost of being bended by an outside force. This is my first answer ever given so I apologize if it's not as informative as it could be, but I hope it answers your question a little better than before. ",
