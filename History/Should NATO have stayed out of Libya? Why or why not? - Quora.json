            "answer_text": "Great question; my best and simplest answer: On balance, and given the amazing clarity of hindsight, you bet. Allow me to elaborate: NATO\u2019s Libya Op was not only welcomed by those civilians who were on the \u201cbusiness end\u201d of their government\u2019s (and its allied) forces, but it was also supported - - mandated, actually - - by the UNSC in its Resolution 1973 (2011); this last group even includes some of NATO\u2019s harshest critics, China and the Russian Federation, without whose tacit support - - even if by abstention, as also joined by Germany, India and Brazil - - the Resolution could not have passed, and the mission would not have happened. But more to the original Question, while many consider the UN to have been the bigger failure in Libya, I\u2019d argue that NATO was - - precisely because they didn\u2019t ensure beforehand that proper plans were in place to rebuild the nation (whether by the UN, the AU, \u2026) after its Op was completed; stated differently, if they\u2019re asked to do the shooting, by UN mandate or not, then they should make certain that such rebuilding plans exist, else they clearly risk making a bad situation that much worse. And this is exactly what happened - - in fact, the downside of that poor planning actually spread instability across Libya, across North and West Africa, and even extended it back into Europe through the refugee/immigrant crisis. And so it\u2019s not hard to see why cries of NATO and/or UN \u201cimperialism\u201d abound; perhaps I could add UN/NATO hypocrisy to the list, since they seem to have cared much more about the devastation of Libyan civilians than they ever did about Syrian ones, the Syrian Civil War clearly taking a much greater toll on civilians. Given the aftermath, it also didn\u2019t matter that NATO actually began with good intentions, wanting to help civilians being brutalized; moreover, \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201cfailure\u201d in anything, whether done by NATO or some other entity, is neither guaranteed nor avoidable just because that entity has UN backing. About the only good things I can about NATO\u2019s Libya Op are: the UNSC\u2019s primary goal was achieved - - the initial brutalization of civilians was stopped; and I think that NATO learned its \u201clessons of Tripoli\u201d, so no one will be harder on them to ensure thorough planning for the aftermath of their future Ops than they will on themselves.

            "answer_text": "Q. Should NATO have stayed out of Libya? Kaddafi had relinquished its nuclear research, been punished for the Berlin bombing and the Lockerbie aircrash. Further support for terrorists brought the NATO strikes that took down Gaddafi to a point he was killed by rebels. NATO leaves a vacuum that results in further U.S. losses. UN sanctioned Tripoli government is now near to overthrow due to split NATO alliances in Libyan civil war. All around bad scene 20+ years. ",
