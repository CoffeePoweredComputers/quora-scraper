            "answer_text": "Not really. Some of them fought to the bitter end, especially when facing Soviet troops and especially when defending their home areas. Some of them were veterans of World War I so knew a bit about fighting, others were volunteers trying do protect their families. Many were forcefully conscripted, even at gunpoint. It didn\u2019t make a difference. At all. Lack of training, lack of ammunition, lack of leadership and the absolutely overwhelming enemy strength made sure the Volkssturm never stood a chance. So yep, I will have to go with cannon fodder: they were simply ordered to fight, piecemeal, without any clear strategy and lacking even the most basic tools of war. ",
