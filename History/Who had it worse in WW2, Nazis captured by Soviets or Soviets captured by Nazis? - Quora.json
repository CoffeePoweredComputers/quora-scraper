            "answer_text": "The Nazis captured somewhere around 5 MILLION Soviet soldiers in the Great Patriotic War and only about 2 million of those were alive and released at the end of the war. Of those that returned to the USSR many were treated as traitors for allowing themselves to be captured and instead of returning to their families wound up in the gulags. The Red Army for the most part had little interest in taking prisoners. The 90,000 at Stalingrad was a bit of a fluke. Of those prisoners the Reds did take, the treatment was harsh, but so far as I can tell they were not systematically murdered or starved while in captivity. They may have died in their thousands from other hazards or poor diet or disease, but it does not seem that the USSR had a policy of extermination in place. They were having trouble providing for their own citizens. The majority of production went to the war effort, the civilians get what was barely necessary, or sometimes whatever they could scrounge. German prisoners certainly sucked hind teat in that regard. By sheer numbers and intentionally mistreatment the Red Army solders were poorly treated by both the Nazis and by Stalin (his own son died in captivity when Stalin refused a prisoner exchange). German soldiers in Soviet hands had it rough, but the Soviets could certainly argue in their own defense that the invading forces, due to their barbarous tactics, had earned every degree of hardship they faced if captured.

            "answer_text": "It seems that, at least late 1944 onward, conditions in at least some of the Soviet POW camps were NOT designed to kill the prisoners. They, at least by design, tried to keep bulk of prisoners alive. Conditions were still awful, yearly death rates up to 10%. But for example food rations, however meager, rotten etc, were not making it obvious that all prisoners will certainly die within 6 months, because of near absolute starvation. We can say with certainty that German POW camps for the Soviets were, in many cases, not giving the inmates any chances. You cannot live for years on grass you scavenge from under the barbed wire fence. I stress, the Soviet Gulag/POW places were murdering people, inhumanely, it was Hell, but not the central circle of it. People who found themselves there were daily losing friends to illnesses resulting from overwork, lack of clothing, inadequate (cold!) housing and general weakening of all body defenses, from malnutrition. Think of one of the most severe Roman penalties, decimation. This is what the Soviet camps were. German camps were more of a \u201ctotal extermination\u201d type. How do we know this, relatively \u201cobjectively\u201d? Because the Soviets were arresting the members of the Polish resistance (1944/45), and putting them, by the thousands, in the same camps they kept the German POWs in. A good example is the camp complex #270, Borowicze/Jog\u0142a. When the Polish underground soldiers arrived, they were a bit shocked finding themselves on the same side of the barbed wire as Wehrmacht. But I guess it had some touch of familiarity, same guys they were shooting at, and were shot by, for the last 5 years. Homely touch. What irked the Poles was that the Germans were getting larger food rations. So more Poles were dying than the Germans. My guess (I still have to confirm) is that those German POWs were coming from a negotiated surrender of Courland pocket, where the Soviet Army promised that they will not starve the surrendering German soldiers. Anyway, the Soviet Gulag command responded to the irate complaints of the Polish guests, by evacuating the Germans somewhere else. I stress, the Soviets did not diminish the German rations, there was some type of a deal (I know from survivors) the Soviets wanted to keep their end of. To get more food, the Poles had to conduct hunger strikes later, but this is another story. But coming back to the question, this is a good confirmation I think that at least some German POWs had better treatment in Soviet camps than the other way round. ",
