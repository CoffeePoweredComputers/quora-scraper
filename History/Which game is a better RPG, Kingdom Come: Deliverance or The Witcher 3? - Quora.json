            "answer_text": "Both choices have their perks and drawbacks. Both games can be incredibly beautiful, both offer hours of gameplay in a medieval playground, and the sense of \u201cdiscovery\u201d in both games set them apart from other current RPG titles. Kingdom Come is a game that is rather \u201chardcore.\u201d Combat is a lot more difficult to get the hang of, you must keep yourself fed and well rested at all times, and many core skills that normal people take for granted must be trained for a good amount of time(archery, swordsmanship, reading, etc). In many ways, Kingdom Come is much more of a role playing game, though you are restricted to role playing as a medieval everyman. Player agency is paramount.  The Witcher 3 is a fantasy RPG, taking place in a fantastic version of medieval Poland(or some other North European country). Filled with a colorful assortment of characters and monsters, The Witcher 3 definitely has a story worth bragging about; Spanning a good 60+ hours, one could get lost among the many routes and choices that affect the overall story. Endless side quests abound.  In conclusion: Kingdom Come: hardcore gameplay, immersive medieval sim, Performance isn\u2019t the best if could be. Witcher 3: lax RPG mechanics, gorgeous world and story, runs nice, gameplay takes a back seat to story. ",

            "answer_text": "Answer : Kingdom Comes Deliverance. Why I choose this? Because the question asked for best Role-Playing Game. In Witcher 3, you play as a Geralt- a human who are\u201dmodified\u201d with mutagen and magic, go out to fight monsters of all sort. At the end of the day, you play as a fictional character. Full stop. But in KCD, you play as Henry, a son of a blacksmith. He has no speacil powers, nothing which makes him standard out in a crowd. Your game is set in 14th Century Europe. It has no magic or dragons or fairy tale monsters. Matter a fact, it is said that the World of KCD is modelled as accurately as possible to the real World Europe. So in term of role-playing, you are actually playing a character modelled after a possible human living in real 14th century Europe. That sense of realism is why I choose KCD as better RPG game. ",
