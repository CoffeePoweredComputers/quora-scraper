            "answer_text": "Q: What is history? What is the meaning and the nature of history? In its broadest sense history is everything that we know has happened. To be known scholars have decided that there has to be some documentation, and so it requires writing of some sort to be history. Since writing began, as far as we can tell, with the appearance of urbanization, history is what has occurred since the foundation of the Sumerian city of Eridu, generally considered to be the first city settled about 4900 BC. If the text of the Monhenjo Daro is ever translated I personally believe history will be pushed back somewhat. History has no meaning other than what is assigned to it by us. Different people have different meanings, such as \u201chistory is the record of human progress,\u201d or \u201chistory is the record of human oppression by overlords,\u201d or \u201chistory is the tale of lies told by historians,\u201d or \u201chistory is the unfolding story of humanity.\u201d The nature of history depends entirely upon the person interpreting it and writing their ideas. It\u2019s nature might be approached economically, scientifically, philosophically, militarily, artistically, culturally, religiously, political, and so on. To me history is important because it gives us an idea of what humanity is capable of. We can use it to see how people have changed, perhaps even learn lessons from it. It is a fascinating tale however it is approached. ",

            "answer_text": "History is a set of lies agreed upon. -Napoleon Bonaparte Yet if you are not familiar with history, you are prone to repeat the mistakes within it. If you practice truth, you run a better chance of avoiding the mistakes of history by letting truth come to you. For this you may still be slandered. The best way to answer a lie about your past is to simply say, \u201cso glad they didn\u2019t mention ALL my flaws!\u201d Real and true history is known only those who have lived it, provided they don\u2019t lie to themselves and others as time passes. That, of course, would be our normal reaction since true history is seldom told without personal bias. Learning from our past mistakes and successes is the real burden of time on each one of us and the main purpose of reflecting on history. Facts and dates are only trivial measures of times past to be parroted in the classroom or maybe on \u201cJeopardy\u201d if you have that talent. Forgive as much as possible but never ever forget lest we repeat our folly and dishonor all that has gone before us. So then, we must always try again even if we fail repeatedly as the wise tell us. That\u2019s all I have today! ",
