            "answer_text": "Because Plato was a philospoher himself, obviously. But you've also got to put the situation in some context. The philosophers in ancient Athens wouldn't have seemed like that bad an option when you compared it to the alternatives. At least they were educated. They were roughly equivalent of modern-day \"academics\" than modern-day philosophers, because philospoher simply meant an educated and knowledgeable man.The alternatives were: Democracy - rule of the people, although not the way we have it now. Back then, it was an uneducated mob arguing about issues that they didn't really understand all that much and serving in positions of power because their name had been pulled in a lottery. Monarchy - Rule of one man with the unquestionable right to do whatever he damn pleases. Given Athens' (and Greece's) historical experience with tyrants and the hostillity towards one-man rule, this wasn't likely to happen and probably wouldn't have been all that effective either. Oligarchy - Rule of the few and often of those already in power, such as the rich. Athenian politics were already influenced by rich people, but in their democracy, at least wealthy merchants were still equal to an impoverished city dweller. Plato wanted to find an alternative to this and given the experiences he had (such as the Athenian democracy executing or dismissing all it's best generals for a religious scandal right before the final battle of the Peleponnesian War and of course Sokrates getting executed for not supporting the democracy) he wasn't all that satisfied with democracy and believed sincerely in his Theory of Forms and that philospohers were the only ones wise enough to run a city-state effectively.

            "answer_text": "According to Plato's theory of philosopher ruler . A philosopher by his grasp of idea of good was best qualified to rule , implying that knowledge could be obtained only by a select few who had leisure and material comforts . Plato shared the general perception that leisure was essentials for the pursuit of wisdom.A philosopher would be able to administer justice and act for the good of the community. He would have a god character , a calm disposition and a sound mind . He would have the qualities of a ruler , namely truthfulness , high-mindness , discipline , courage and being a lower of truth , he would be honest and forthright .Plato said that a philosopher ruler would make a wise legislature and frame laws in accordance with the idea of good .For plato , an ideal state ruled by the philosopher ruler was a divine institution perfectly worthy of emulation and imitation .Devoid of emotionalties and economic considerations , he would be public spirited and wise .But from my opinion , A philosopher could not possibly rule well , for the good philosopher that saw one around were useless to society , and the bad ones downright villains .A philosopher preferred to become a social outcast and line in ivory tower .Politicians in societies were admired and respected not for their wisdom and goodness , but for their ability to flatter people and satisfy their basest desires and instincts .",
