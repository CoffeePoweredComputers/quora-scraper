            "answer_text": "It is a Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva), called the Methuselah Tree, located somewhere in the Schulman Grove of the Inyo National Forest in the eastern Sierra of the White Mountains of California, near Big Pine and Bishop, also home to Mt. Whitney. The natural history of the grove where the tree is located, the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest describes it as older than 5000 years, but there are various reports about these trees with differing ages. I went to visit those forests about 15 years ago with my family, and our tired Subaru was having trouble with the altitude (nearly 3000 meters) and my kids chided their Dad for having taken them so far off the beaten path to see \u201csome old tree\u201d. I had to bribe them with extra Pokemon cards. ",

            "answer_text": "As the other answer says, it is a Bristlecone Pine n the White Mountains a mountain range that straddles the state line between California and Nevada. This is not the Sierra Nevada Mountains, the next range to the west. Mt Whitney is in the Sierra Nevada mountains, not the White Mountains. Owens Valley lies between the ranges. This is the oldest single tree yet discovered. There may be older Bristlecone Pines whose age has not yet been measured. Bristlecone Pine grows in isolated groves at high altitude throughout the Great Basin ranges. Some may argue some stands of Quaking Aspen are older. This is playing fast and loose with the definitions. Quaking Aspen grows in dense stands with a common root system for the entire stand, and all the aspen in a single grove are clones of each other, sprouting from the common root system. Some aspen stands are over 10,000 years old, but the individual trees within the stands are only a few decades old. ",
