            "answer_text": " It's a little simplistic to view France as the most powerful country on Continental Europe following WW1, yes they had emerged as a victor but at terrible cost with some 1.4 million Frenchmen losing their lives. This had a profound effect on the French people who obviously wanted to avoid another war of such cost and upon the French Military who looked for a way to win a war without incurring such loss. Interwar French military planning reflected these thoughts and as such proved inadequate in 1940. One of the most important ideas that went into French thinking was the so called 'Verdun Factor'; the idea that even if the French were to enter a conflict with less than adequate equipment or preparation the inherently superior French soldiery would be able to provide France with a victory. Unfortunately parallel to this assumption of superiority was a moral quandary, was France prepared to suffer such terrible losses to deliver victory as they had in 1916? The answer was no, France's depleted population simply could not suffer such losses again and so another way to win had to be found. This led them to assess the trench warfare of WW1 and draw from it the conclusion that terrible losses could be avoided but only if they were to rely upon a network of fortifications that would act like the forts of Verdun and provide centres of resistance that would prove hugely difficult to capture. However unlike at Verdun when the forts had been neglected and so weakened this new line would not, it would be a continuous front from Switzerland to the Channel and thus nigh impenetrable. The Maginot Line was born out of this thinking, in 1922 the French Army Commission concluded that a continuous line of defences would act as Frances shield, it would defend their territory (which with the recovery of Alsace and Lorraine no longer needed expanding) while simultaneously acting as a deterrent against German ambitions, they would surely not be willing to sacrifice so many lives attacking it. It was a direct reflection of their experiences in WW1 \"We had been haunted by the tenacity of the German machine guns, and the impossibility in which we found ourselves of breaking the enemy front\" wrote General Beaufre, France had not been involved in any of the more mobile campaigns in the East or Palestine and so had no people experienced in campaigns of manoeuvre. However the Maginot Line was undermined by the French desire to involve the Belgians in their defence, in 1934 Petain (then Minister of War) said that in the event of a War the French plan was to \"go into Belgium\". At the time this made sense, France still enjoyed a huge superiority over Germany and it obviously seems preferable for a war to be fought as far from French soil as possible. This kind of defensive thinking allowed the French army to ossify but it was not the only thing that undermined it. The so called 'hollow classes' caused by the drop in births during WW1 hugely depleted French manpower, the class of 1915 in Germany amounted to 464,000 men while in France it was merely 184,000. Additionally a French soldier received much lower pay than private workers and with the supreme national goal, revenge for 1870, achieved there was little reason for a professional to pursue a military career. France was also undermined by the lack of funding made available for military spending, in 1936 (six years after the Maginot line was ordered) a fifth of spending was still on constructing and maintaining it. The French were also slow to adopt new technology, in 1924 the army decided to replace its infantry rifle, the new weapon was not selected until 1932 and by 1939 only a few hundred thousand had been issued. Mobile warfare was also not really ever accepted by the French Army, they took the approach of building a small number of prototype tanks each year but suspending mass production until a date when war seemed imminent which self-deception and appeasement delayed significantly this left them with a small number of tanks that were modern (depressingly the tanks they had, Somuas, were actually of very high quality) and a far greater number of obsolete relics. Frances position would then go on to be significantly undermined by the announcement of Belgian neutrality in late 1936, this crippled their plan of rushing into Belgium and left them with a Maginot line that, although hugely strong, was simply too short and could not be extended through the industrialised north without incurring a tremendous cost which politicians in the Third Republic simply could not afford with the rising tide of anti-militarism in France. I could go on about the political instability of France and how it undermined their ability to prepare effectively for war but I think I've set out a basic presentation of why Frances post war superiority is really only illusory and not reflective of their crippling instability and unpreparedness.

            "answer_text": "Straight after the French Revolution at 1792, The revolutionary leaders of France declared war on Austria due to the certainty that Austria was marching an army to France. Prussia soon declared war on France. This was the first French revolutionary war. This war was primarily fought because Austria wanted to reinstate the House of bourbon monarchy as the leadership of France. You may think that a war with Prussia and Austria at a Frances fragile state would be absolute suicide and at the beginning, it was not looking good as a Austrian-Prussian coalition slowly invaded north eastern France. However, with some rushed policies of mass conscription and many loans, France actually pulled through and won the war. This ensured a short period of relative peace and an end to the first of 3 revolutionary wars. France would go on to battle Britain, Prussia, Austria and the Netherlands in further conflicts. The French not only survived the massive coalitions against them but won the wars that ensued with Napoleon at the lead towards the last revolutionary war. It is worth noting that France did not have any notable help from allies either. It was truely France against the rest of Europe We all think of the French Revolution as a messy and hard time in Frances history. What it caused led to Frances status as the unrivalled master of Europe. The French conquest of much of Europe (1800 onwards), Egypt and Syria (1801) and later Reaching Russia (1812). The early half of the Napoleonic period was when France was its most powerful. ",
