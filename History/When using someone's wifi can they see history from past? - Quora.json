This request is seen by all of the equipment that is in the path between your device and the information. The home wireless router is not generally configured for detailed logging, however they can be easily modified to provide this functionality. The ISP also keeps a log, Internet providers in the US are required by federal law to retain this information for a period of time. That being said, Most home users are not savvy enough to keep detailed logs, or even know where to find them if they were available, However there are exceptions. If you connect to my WiFi, I will know what sites you visited. Never assume anonymity when using the Internet. Browser tricks such as Google Chrome\u2019s Incognito mode won\u2019t hide you from routing equipment.  In case you want to click the \u201cLearn More\u201d from the screenshot. Browse in private with Incognito mode Good Luck\u2026 ",

            "answer_text": "It depends on the logging used. In most large scale networks everything is logged as it may have a clue why they were hacked or other reasons. I have reviewed logs from the proxy servers that send information to the internet and log everything that happens. Those logs tell me everything that I need to know about how you use the internet. I can even retrace every site you visit and how long that you was on a site. I can clearly see if you was on a site for 10 seconds or 10 minutes. Does the local Starbucks log everything? I doubt it. I would not run a pubic free Wi-Fi and log everything it would be a waste of resources. Some home Wi-Fi routers will allow you to log but most people don't use it or even know.The internet is not a privacy free place somewhere there is a log of what you do. ",

One way would be to packet sniff, but not all configurations permit this, and it\u2019s compute and storage intensive. Also addresses of HTTPS requests would be invisible. If he were to do this, certain clues would be visible, that would be strong reason to suspect he has done this (do all of this while connected to your neighbor\u2019s WiFi): ",

There you can see who is connected to your wifi, when they connected, the device manufacturer and you can also completely remove them from your wifi network or limit the signal strength they recieve however you I would advice you to know the IP address of your device so that you dont remove yourself by accident.
