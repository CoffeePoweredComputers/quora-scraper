            "answer_text": "The Philistines of the Old Testament ( -\u05e4\u05dc\u05e9\u05ea , i.e. PL\u0160T-) are almost certainly identical with the \u201cPL\u0160T\u201d listed in an Egyptian inscription amongst the various peoples who attacked Egypt a little after ca. 1200 B.C. and who had already destroyed, according to that selfsame contemporary Egyptian inscription of Ramses III\u2019s, Arzawa in western Asia Minor, the Hittite empire in central Asia Minor, Cilicia, Cyprus, and Carchemish in inland Syria. (These attackers are conventionally referred to as the Sea Peoples, even if, from memory, it is said of only one of them that it was \u201cof the sea\u201d. For this inscription see, most conveniently, Ancient Near Eastern Texts relating to the Old Testament, 3rd ed., p. 262.) There are additional textual sources for the devastation wrought by these peoples, incl. the so-called Alasiya-Correspondence, viz. three letters back and forth between the King of Cyprus and the King of Ugarit, discussing sea-borne invaders who are carrying out devastating raids in the area; these kings\u2019 overlord, the Hittite King, has requisitioned their ships and sent them to Lycia in southeastern Anatolia for unspecified purposes. There is also another text which mentions the Shikalaeans (= the TKL, another of the \u201csea-peoples\u201d in Ramses III\u2019s inscription; the \u201ct\u201d should have a bar below it \u2014 it\u2019s a \u201ctch\u201d-sound) who \u201cdwell on ships\u201d and who are carrying out raids in the neighbourhood of Cilicia and Phoenicia. These Shikalaeans end up settling around Dor near Mt. Carmel on the Palestinian coast according to a report of Wen-Amun, an Egyptian ambassador sent to those parts ca. 1100. Incidentally, all of the places mentioned in Ramses III\u2019s inscription as having been destroyed ca. 1200 B.C. according to the archaeological record really were destroyed around that time (with the possible exception of Carchemish). Now back to the Philistines. According to various passages in the Old Testament (e.g. Amos, IX 7 or Jer. XLVII 4) the Philistines had dwelt on Crete before they came to Palestine (which the Greeks, in fact, named after them: \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03b7, \u201cPalaistin\u00ea\u201d is a derivation from \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1fd6\u03bd-\u03bf\u03b9, \u201cPalaistin-oi\u201d \u2014 \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd-\u03b7 is formed, in fact, with a very old suffix, -\u03b7, that was no longer productive in the first millennium B.C.; i.e. the name antedates the year 1000 B.C. or so). That the Philistines could have stayed on Crete for a time is certainly possible, if not actually plausible: If you trace the arc of destruction mentioned in the Egyptian inscription backwards from Egypt to Carchemish and Cyprus, to Cilicia and to western Asia Minor, you\u2019re in the Aegean and very close to Crete \u2014 where, as a matter of fact, the Mycenaean palace at Knosos was destroyed round about 1200 B.C., along with all those other places. However, the Philistines would have been invaders on Crete, unrelated to the peoples already dwelling there ca. 1200 B.C. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that they had anything to do with the Minoans (or the Myceanaean Greeks who governed the Kingdom of Knosos ca. 1200 B.C.). Be that as it may, one word, and one word only, of the Philistine language has come down to us, and that is the word \u05e1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, which refers to the rulers of the five Philistine cities. I give the Masoretes\u2019 pointing (Seranim), but note that for proper names their pointing is often as good as arbitrary. First the consonants. The first letter (\u05e1) originally represented a \u201ct\u201d-sound which the Egyptians routinely transcribe with their sign for the \u201ctch\u201d-sound in \u201cmatch\u201d. Next, geminated (doubled) consonants are not written in Hebrew, so any internal consonant in such a name could be single or double. The \u05d9\u05dd- at the end is just the plural ending. Now the vowels: Whatever vowel stood after the \u05e1 initially is irrecoverable; no matter what it may have been, in this position when the plural ending \u05d9\u05dd- was added, it would have become a schwa. I.e. as the original vowel any given vowel is as likely as any other. The vowel after the \u05e8 , the \u201cr\u201d, for what it\u2019s worth, is given by the Masoretes as an /a/. So, transcribed without the Masoretes\u2019 pointing, the -\u05e1\u05e8\u05e0 gives something like this: a \u201ct\u201d-sound, any vowel you please, an \u201cr\u201d possibly doubled, just maybe an \u201ca\u201d, and then an \u201cn\u201d possibly doubled For obvious reasons scholars have scoured the Mediterranean world looking for something that might fit that description. Scholars have also scoured the Mediterranean world looking for a match for one particular Greek word for a ruler, a word which is transparently a loanword in Greek, namely \u03c4\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, i.e. \u201ctyrannos\u201d or \u201ctyrant\u201d. The stem is \u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd- or \u201ctyrann-\u201d. Basically, \u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bd- fits the bill for -\u05e1\u05e8\u05e0 and vice versa. Semantically it\u2019s an exact match as both words in context mean \u201cruler\u201d. That is all which is known of the Philistines\u2019 language for certain. The only other clue about them is their name itself. In Greek it is a transparent demonym or ethnikon, a name for a people, with an absolutely transparent derivation: it is a place name plus the suffix -\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9, \u201c-inoi\u201d. The place name is, and can only be, the stem \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4-, \u201cPalaist-\u201d. As fate would have it, there is such a place in Illyria, to the Northwest of Greece. There are a few more things that could be said about the distribution of the suffix -\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 (limited to Illyria and central and southern Italy \u2014 with one, and only one exception) as well as an apparent -st- suffix in Illyrian and central Italian place-names, but let it pass. Anyway, if the Philistines really did come from Illyria, that would put them in a perfect position to swoop down on Greece ca. 1200 B.C., stay a while on Crete, and then move on to end up in Palestine.

They have been associated with the \u201cSea People\u201d but that is uncertain, and we also don\u2019t know who the Sea People were or if the Sea People existed at all. Best guess would be Greek or some language closely related to Greek. This guess is based on their names and their pottery. This means that they might indeed well be from Crete or some other Greek Islands, which would mean that they could have Minoan ancestry. I am not an expert at all, I just have this from the Wikipedia articles about Philistines, Sea People, Bronze Age Collapse, and the Greek Dark Ages. ",
