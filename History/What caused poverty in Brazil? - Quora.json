            "answer_text": "The main reason why Brasil is poor is because of comunism. It started with Getulio Vargas. He took the power when Brasil was starting to develop and crippled our regulatory landscape. We have terrible laws, and the most terrible ones were created at that time. Almost a century has gone through and we are still in this regulatory hell. Well, in fact, it has gone worse since our 1988\u2019s comunist constitution. Draconian labor laws. In practice, in Brasil, small business are forbidden to have employees. Big business suffer from labor laws too, but for small business they are unsurmountable.It is forbidden to earn money.Just for instance: There is a type of business in Brazil called MEI (Individual Micro Entrepeneur). MEIs are limited to R$ 60,000 of revenue per year. If you make some extra revenue by accident, more than R$ 60,000 per year, you enter a much higher tax bracket and you have to pay taxes RECTROACTIVELY, since the beginning of the fiscal year.Also MEIs are limited to have only 1 employee, which takes us back to point 1.Also, have in mind that 1 dollar is more or less 3.5 reais today.It is forbidden to have property.In some cities, city tax for property is larger than the income from rent.Also, if you rent your property for a family, and that family has no property, you can\u2019t evict them until they find another place to live. This means than eviction process takes years.In rural areas, you have to use your land. You cannot leave it untouched. If you don\u2019t use the land, taxes are unsurmontably high.It is forbidden to import technology.In Brazil, some imports are tax exempt. This is the case of books, for instance. However, 99% of the stuff you buy abroad is taxed.The tax for imports is 60% for the federal goverment and around 20% for the states. On top of shipping, on top of each other. If you buy something that cost $80 in the US and shipping is $20, it will cost you $100 + 60% + 20% = $192 minimum. Remember that 1 dollar is 3.5 reais.Also, since customs inspection is VERY SLOW, it takes around 3 to 4 months to receive your order. IF YOU RECEIVE IT.Either the delay or the high cost alone would cripple Brazil\u2019s technologic growth. Both of them together make it impossible.You don\u2019t own your land. You only have a license for use. If you dig and find anything of value, it will not be your property. Also rivers, riverbanks and beaches are also not yours. You can\u2019t build, you can\u2019t farm, you can\u2019t use the water without permission.Also, the Navy can take any coastal land at any time.Well, there are many more reasons, but these are the main ones.

            "answer_text": "Brazil is not exactly poor. Its money is badly distributed and it has lots of bottlenecks, but it is indeed a rich country. There's a tax/financial structure that rewards you more if you leave your money in the bank (especially in investment lines where you lend money to the government) than if you put that money on the market and generate jobs. When someone rows against the tide and creates jobs, there's a lot of incentives to keep salaries low - high taxes, for example. There's an awful, awful lot of corruption, which cascades down to the economy and makes everything more expensive for everyone. The figures mentioned in just one scandal that\u2019s in the news have enough zeroes to make you dizzy. Then you remember other parts of federal government also offer opportunity for corruption that are not being looked at as much, and there are 27 states and 5,570 cities that open procurement bids that more often than not may make corruption easier. There are lots of little and not so little benefits for politicians and judges and related people. Congressmen approve pay raises for themselves like you decide to replace your smartphone (and the Constitution enshrined isonomy, so every elected official gets a raise too). Unmarried daughters of judges can be paid hefty pensions. Judges and congressmen themselves can make about a third on top of what they make, in the name of allowances to buy suits (even having great salaries) and pay rent (even if they own houses). A country that pays for the suit and the rent to homeowning officials who raise their own salaries at will is not really a poor country, do you agree? A country where construction companies can find billions to slice from public contracts, then give politicians million-sized slices of those billions, must be quite rich to afford it. And please remember I'm not including all the money sinkholes we read about every day. But those riches are just not going to as many pockets as they could. And there are so many people getting the butt of the joke that this country happens to look poor. ",
