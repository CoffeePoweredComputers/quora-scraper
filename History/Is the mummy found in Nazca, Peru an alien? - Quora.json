            "answer_text": "Of course not. It\u2019s just another alien speech used to take the gullible ones\u2019 money. Those alleged mummies are fakes made up from another human and animal bones. The people building them were so incompetent that in some sample there were found two left legs. They also used yeast and other easily found bricolage supplies. Just don\u2019t waste your time with that ancient aliens crap. ",

            "answer_text": "No. Forensic evidence revealed that it was a human child, though it remains to be seen whether it\u2019s even a real mummy at all and not a hoax. The fact that they deliberately reported the \u201cfind\u201d only to sites known for parroting debunked conspiracy theories and Newage technobble certainly raises more than a few red flags. ",
