            "answer_text": " This was Finland\u2019s situation just after Winter War, a war where 3 million Finns stood alone without any ally to come to its aid against 170 million Soviets. Essentially, Finland was deep between Soviet Union and Nazis. Big risks What if Nazis and Soviets decided to fight each other on Finnish soil, to escalate the conflict to Finnish territory? Should Finland mobilize it\u2019s army in preparation for potential escalation? World trade was dying out, this was the height of success for Nazi U-Boat Warfare and most of the world was already involved with WW II. You could not simply buy food from international markets to Finland like you used to, just like during WW I the international trade started to wither. Worse, Finnish trade was primarily through sea through Nazi controlled waters - Nazis had their fleets and aircraft and submarines covering almost the whole length of Finnish trade routes and Soviets themselves would be potentially able to send submarines to hit Finnish shipping. Finns were starving in 1942 There simply wasn\u2019t enough food. Finland isn\u2019t a bread basket, much of the country lies within Arctic Circle. Farm yields in these latitudes are not great and farming methods were not very advanced and even if Finland had machinery to tend the fields there was no fuel to go around. As Finns had chosen to fight with their own separate war goals on Nazis\u2019 side, they were starving in 1942 until they received food shipments from Germany. Without these shipments the Finnish army would have lost all it\u2019s capability as malnutrition and diseases were spreading at alarming rate as the starvation was starting to hit the troops. Benefits of choosing a side Finland by working with Nazi Germany could rest assured that one of the two potential invaders was now not going to invade Finland. Furthermore, Nazis took responsibility over the northern half of Finland\u2019s long 1,000+ km frontier with Soviet Union, allowing Finns to focus their troops where they mattered the most, the southern half. Finns also received military equipment from Nazis, including Italian Fiat-fighters that Nazis had confiscated when Italy tried to send them to assist Finland in Winter War - Nazis were cooperating at the time with their Soviet allies as per the secret part of Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact where they had divided Europe among themselves and where Finland was promised for Soviets. Finns received modern fighter craft, antitank weapons and other highly necessary and useful equipment. Last but not least, Finland worked with Nazis to deploy a submarine belt from southern Finland to Estonia, trapping all the Soviet submarines unable to come after Finnish or Nazi shipping. The entire Soviet Baltic Fleet became bottled at the eastern end of the sea. This enabled Finland to feed it\u2019s people throughout the war without having to surrender to either Nazis or Soviets. Preparing for the next war While there was a chance that Soviets might have ignored Finland after Winter War, there was no indication in that direction. Soviets pursued an incredibly aggressive and imperialistic policy of expansion and were entirely ruthless in every regard. By siding with Nazis Finland pursued it\u2019s own war goals which were to retake the lost territory, repopulate the Viipuri region and above all to occupy easily defended front line to face off the next Soviet attack with room to withdraw. Soviets had pushed the border towards Helsinki in Winter War under the false pretense of \u2018defending Leningrad\u2019. Moving the border considerably to east secured Helsinki and added some buffer around Viipuri as well. Once the easily defended line was reached in late 1941 the entire Finnish army - they simply stopped and started digging in. The Nazis were still aggressively pushing forward but Finns simply dug in and waited. They would not take part in siege of Leningrad, the favorite city of Finnish high commander Marshall Mannerheim. Finns waited and while waiting they carved elaborate woodwork to decorate their bunkers with. They waited all the way until summer 1944 when the Soviets finally struck back. And as was expected the red hammer pounded Finns hard, collapsing the entire front that was prepared for years, pushing Finns back all the way near the Winter War border while also losing Viipuri in the process. Luckily there was some room to withdraw lest Soviets would have been able to threaten Helsinki. Then Finns finally were able to rally their forces and by utilizing some of the most accurate and dense artillery barrages of WW II Finns fought the Soviet offensive to a standstill. Finns showed that Winter War was not just a fluke caused by bad weather Finns showed Soviets that they can fight their best battle hardened divisions in summer conditions and still fight them to a standstill With the two facts - that Finns could fight back hard and that Finns had not taken part in the siege of Leningrad over the years it was besieged Stalin was eventually convinced to tolerate the continued existence of Republic of Finland to it\u2019s neighbor. The Nazi collaboration ended up costing Finns We are forever tainted with the dishonor of having sided with Nazis. In addition, as our people drove Nazis out of northern Finland they destroyed and burnt everything in their wake. There was nothing but desolation in whole of northern Finland in 1945, 300 Finns would perish post-war to Nazi mines alone. Finns also paid massive war reparations to Soviet Union, 160 million dollars in pre-war value as metal products. Finland was not allowed to receive Marshall Aid either, Finland had to allow the communist party and so forth, Finnish leaders were sentenced to jail. Was it worth it? It was still better than Finland succumbing to either Nazis or Soviets due to falling under reeling pressure of widespread starvation. You can\u2019t defend your country when you have nothing to eat, when there\u2019s no meat around your bones left and when you become ill. The Jewish community in Finland survived through the war. Three Jews fighting on Finnish side were awarded with Iron Crosses from Nazis though they all refused to accept them.  Field synagogue on Finnish front  Sholem Bolotowsky on guard duty at Syv\u00e4ri While other countries in Europe saw Nazis commit genocide and others saw communist commit genocide and some saw both take turns trying to out compete each other in atrocities, Finland managed to defend it\u2019s people and democracy throughout the war despite facing some difficult choices and sharing a land border with Soviet Union and later with Nazis as well, being squeezed between the two empires of evil. Finland was going to be hit by a locomotive, when you\u2019re hit by a locomotive you don\u2019t always get full style points. To be able to survive at all and to keep the civilians from being purged by either Nazis or communists was nothing short of a feat in itself. ",

            "answer_text": "Hindsight is 20/20. But had we not tried to regain the territory that Stalin took from Finland in the Winter War, he might have considered us a pushover, and when the war in Europe was over, he could have come back with a vengeance. This way at least he knew he would have to invest a terrible amount of manpower to get anywhere (as he did in the final battles of the Karelian Isthmus, but was stopped).  It is certain we could not have fought the Continuation War alone, and with Germans as co-belligerents, we would not have stood a chance against the Lend-Lease-equipped Soviets. So my answer is yes, albeit with an eye to the cost to the nation. ",
