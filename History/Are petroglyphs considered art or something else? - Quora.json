            "answer_text": "It's remained an opinionated debate\u2026But, it hinges on how one defines Art or craft as a thing to express one's sense of artistic render of experience (artistic process) from one\u2019s own perspective of self awareness \u2026as it might be said, \u2026 for the sake of one's self.. art for the sake of art, per say. Is art conveying the story narative of one's mind\u2026or is the caving an image in a stone or other medium just simply to record one's observation or stake a claim to territorial presence\u2026 is it just ritual recording like a ledger or attempt to manifest an image of an event crudely or as precisely able: Like a group ritual performance or spiritual ideologies of imagined form if one believes it allows one to capture its essence. If I provoke a question by the nature of its composition in your mind\u2026 it's my breath of expressing my artistic sense as a creator\u2026it's then an object of art\u2026 nature if questioned promotes an emotional appeal and it can become an artistic experience in one's mind - then one may endeavor to express that to an audience form\u2026 a feeling of thought. Short answer is - yes, petroglyphs/pictographs can reflect the self expression of one's mind of creative introspection and provoke it might propagate a responce in the mind of another it becomes their artistic breath of being found in the substance of the image. What is the story we find in the image and if no story found\u2026? What then would one have it be? ",

            "answer_text": "There are Documentaries on YouTube which discuss some petroglyphs in a new way. So, something else. I don't speak for all petroglyphs but a surprising number seem to be\u2026 Scientific documentation. One is \u201cSeeking the third story\u201d. Another by the same people is \u201cSymbols of an Alien Sky\u201d. The 'symbols' part refers to petroglyphs. 'Alien' means simply, watch the video and find out. The second video seems to be a little more polished for a general audience. But both use the voice of David Talbot so you won't waste your time getting an overlap of information. These are paradigm changers. And they are narrated by a voice almost as good as Bob Ross. Background music is pleasantly relaxing too. Watch them before you go to bed as part of your ASMR playlist.

            "answer_text": "A petroglyph is a form of art but also a direct though mysterious communication of meaning. A petroglyph is art in that it embodies an appreciation of something that could be lighthearted or serious: a funny profile or a sun god. A petroglyph communicated (past tense) directly to others a certain, specific meaning that to people seeing it today may be lost. Of course, newly made petroglyphs or \u201cglyphs\u201d pop up all the time. ",
