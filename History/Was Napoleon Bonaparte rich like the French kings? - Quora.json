            "answer_text": "Far more so, actually, particularly towards the end of his regime and because of his war spoils. Almost immediately after his divorce and before his second marriage Napoleon re-arranged financial matters in a way that allowed him much more freedom (and was not covered by the constitution. But who cared?). By the first constitution in 1792 Louis XVI had been allowed a \u201cListe civile\u201d of 25 million Francs per year, and the same sum had been granted to Napoleon in 1804 when he took the throne. There were also no less than 47 palaces that belonged to the emperor (some of those outside of France, in Italy and Holland). (In comparison: That \u201cother emperor\u201d in Austria had three.) In January 1810 finances were divided into three domaines: Dotation de la Couronne: 25 millions per year + the exclusive right to live in and use the palaces that belong to the crownDomaine extraordinaire: This is where all the war spoils went. Reparations, contributions \tetc. Napoleon was supposed to use it in order to \u201cenhance the \tglory of the empire\u201d (in truth, he also paid Pauline\u2019s and Hortense\u2019s debts with it).Domaine priv\u00e9: Napoleon\u2019s belongings as a regular citizen, which he could invest in business or receive interest for like anybody else. This is probably the money he still really had when he was on Saint Helena.As for Napoleon\u2019s imperial \u201chousehold\u201d, by 1813 it had grown to an impressing number of over 3000 people employed for Napoleon\u2019s personal needs. He had, for example, an annual budget of 20.000 Franc for buying new clothes, which I find remarkable for someone who seems to only ever have worn either a green or a blue uniform (again, in comparison: a worker or craftsman made about 2-3 Francs per day - so there was a huge gap). But to be fair, it\u2019s quite probable that this was not in accordance with what he personally would have liked. It seems he was convinced that he had to put up a huge show for the French (or for the neighbour monarchs) in order for them to accept him. (All information taken from P. Branda, \u201cNapol\u00e9on et ses hommes\u201d) ",

            "answer_text": "What is sure is that his family had been extremely poor (for a noble family) and he wasterribly greedy. Here is what Guillemin writes about him: \u201cOn the 12th of November 1799 \u2014 that is exactly two days after his success \u2014 Bonaparte has already such sums that he can pay cash the 120000 francs for the Belgian property which he had bought on credit in February \u201898. He also pays Josephine\u2019s debts (one million) plus the 250000 francs needed for the Malmaison. Behind him, he had three Swiss bankers whose project, well in line with Rotschild\u2019s doctrine, was the establishment of a Banque de France in their control (the same thing that so many American presidents opposed until Wilson gave it to them). The bankers are given the privilege to collect taxes on give them to the State only later, once they have made them \u201cfructify\u201d. And the privilege of printing paper money, out of the control of the State. When in 1969 the secret notes of Bertrand who had accompanied Napoleon to St Helens were decyphered, one could read the reality of what Napoleon confided with his former general, and those were the words of a gangster who thought that 300 millions were too little for him.
