            "answer_text": "In Siberia, the most commonly spoken language is Russian. One can say that Russian is Mandarin of the North Euro-Asia. The newspapers, the television, most of the books and the school teaching all is in Russian. As far as the culture goes, however, - it is all Asian. If you come, for example, to Altai Mountains you will see very little of Russian culture. Even the the language would be only partially Russian. You will see many signs like \u201c\u0410\u043a \u0427\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0433\u0435\u0448\u201d or \u201c\u0427\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0435\u201d which are in the local language. You can come to other places within Siberia and you would see the similar situation. When you travel around Siberia you would meet a lot of different people who look mostly Asian, speak their native language and conduct their own local authentic lifestyle. You can meet some people that visibly resemble ethnic Russians (tall, blond hair, blue or grey eyes) who would speak the mixture of Russian with the local dialect and who would also live within the local tradition. In larger cities, like Novosibirsk, Tomsk, Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk, etc. you can meet a lot of Asian-looking people who speak Russian and live the typical European-Russian lifestyle. The Siberia is a big place - you can find almost anything in there. Historically, Siberia was a \u201cmixing pot\u201d of cultures, politics and powers. There was a lot of inter-cultural and inter-ethnical diffusion over the last few centuries. All the people have taken something from each other and all became a bit of both - a bit of Russian and a bit of Asian. See, there is no simple answer to your question, but if one wanted to come up with a simple one, I would say the following. As others already mentioned here, the answer depends on who is asking. To someone outside Siberia - all the people of Siberia are Russians. To someone inside Siberia - most of people are not Russians, and only few are. One way of thinking about it is to recognize that the word \u201cRussian\u201d stands for two things - Russian Civilization that includes many nations and ethnics, and for Russian Ethnics that refers to one of the Slavic tribes with its language, culture and DNA. I think the similar story is with China and India. From what I have learned from Chines and Indian people, they describe their situation in a similar way. ",

            "answer_text": "Oh.. that question again! Ok, I just copy-paste my answer from another topic: I am a native Siberian (Buryat), and for me, your question sounds a little bit strange. For instance, try to ask some native Alaskans do they identify themselves as Americans? Of course, they do! But at the same time, they know they are native Alaskans of course ) And term \"Russian\" in English really ambiguous. Here in Russia, we use the term \"\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435\" as the definition for Slavic people in Russia, and the term \"\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0435\" (sounds pretty official) as the definition of citizenship. Both terms in English - Russians. It's not too strict. Sometimes we also use the term \"\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435\" for all peoples of Russia. And this term could be adjective. Nowadays we (native Siberians) are bearers of Russian culture but at the same time, we have our own culture, language, and traditions. I really like it. And Slavic peoples of Russia\u2026 and native Siberians... We got through some really heavy stuff. My grandfather was killed during WW2. We work together, we study together, we live and die together. Yes, I'm not \"\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\", but for you my friend I am Russian and this is 100% right definition for English speaker. ",
