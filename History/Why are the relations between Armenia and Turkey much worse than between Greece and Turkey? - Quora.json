            "answer_text": "Turkish-Greek relations were partly \u201cremedied\u201d by the population exchange in early 1920s but also with the enforced set of parameters during the Cold War era for the two NATO members. The latter meant that the prevailing constraints during the Cold War simply forced Greece and Turkey to get along. The Cyprus crisis in early 1970s were an obvious test of this constraint where, had it not been for the two countries being NATO members, the whole episode would most probably developed quite differently than it did. The current (strained) relations is then quite logically a legacy of the past decades. Armenia, on the other hand, has in reality not had any kind of state relations with Turkey since WWI. The last concrete state level negotiations between Turkey and Armenia took place during the Paris Peace Conference and the ensuing S\u00e8vres Treaty. Beyond that, Armenia has not been in direct negotiations with Turkey, thus unable to resolve any existing issues, the question of the Armenian Genocide being the elephant in the room. The S\u00e9vres Treaty was scrapped and replaced by the Lausanne Treaty, where the Armenians were not represented. The same goes for the Armenian SSR: although the following Kars and Moscow treaties are supposed to be signed between the new emerging Turkish Republic and Armenia (and the emerging Soviet Union), in reality Yerevan had nothing to say and it was Moscow who dictated the terms and agreed to the provisions. Armenia has been legally obliging to those treaties, but it is hardly any surprise that the provisions within are not necessarily what Armenia would had put forward. And while Armenia has ever its regained independence in 1991 emphasized on \u201crelations without preconditions,\u201d Turkey has openly insisted on two preconditions (dropping of the strive for international recognition of the Armenian Genocide and explicit recognition of the Armenian-Turkish border) while adding the resolution of the Karabakh Conflict (in the favor of Azerbaijan) for normalizing relations. So, there are evident differences between the Greek-Turkish and Armenian-Turkish relations which have to do with both historical legacy but also contemporary politics. ",
