            "answer_text": "That is a broad question to consider, yet I\u2019ll take a stab at it. I will also limit the context some, and say you are referring specifically to the colonies prior to 1763 as at the conclusion of that war, France had lost all it\u2019s possessions within North America. to Britain (by conquest) and Spain (as compensation.) In essence, I will answer the question as if the French and Indian War had not happened. So, perhaps the first major change to history would be that the British government MOST LIKELY (I saw this because there still is the chance): would not have put in place restrictions on the importation of arms and ammunition into its colonial possessions in North Americawould not have started strict enforcement of trade laws through use of military forceswould not have signed treaties with the Native American tribes limiting colonial expansion to the Appalachian Mountainswould not have levied new taxes, such as the Stamp Act, since the war debts that they were meant to pay wouldn\u2019t have been incurred and the colonies would still be providing resources for defense against the French enemies.The effect of these would have been to delay if not prevent the American Revolution. If it effectively prevented it, there wouldn\u2019t be a United States like we know today. Instead, the states would be part of the Commonwealth, much more similar to Australia or modern Canada than what they are today. Had the French managed to maintain their colonial possessions in Canada and Louisiana there are a number of routes these areas could have taken. Mass immigration of Europeans probably wouldn\u2019t have happened as it did under British control, as that really wasn\u2019t how the French operated. This might mean that these areas would be characterized by a larger percentage of native peoples than they presently are. Cooperation with native populations was more in line with the way the French did handle these possessions when they had them anyways. Had these possessions survived into the modern era, they probably would have formed into one or more sovereign nations, just as other French possessions did. However, the possibility that they would have been lost a long the way to another power - particularly during or after the Napoleonic Era (if it happened) is fairly high. For France, it is possible that, if the retention of the colonies had the effect of preventing the American Revolution, it may have ALSO prevented the French Revolution inspired in part by it. France would have retained it monarchy, at least for a little bit, and Napoleon may not have risen to power at all. This is sort of where things become VERY blurry (at least for me) since I personally don\u2019t know enough about the French monarchy to really have much of an idea as to what this would mean in the long term for France or its neighbors. Napoleon conquered large parts of Europe, yet I don\u2019t know if France under their monarch would attempt the same. Rather, I suspect they wouldn\u2019t and that would have huge ripple effects throughout history. It is possible that a non-Revolutionary France wouldn\u2019t have seen a unified Germany and without a unified Germany, the world wouldn\u2019t have seen the World Wars of the 20th Century, the collapse of Tsarist Russia, or many other pivotal events. It is also quite possible that these events would have still happened, only with different undercurrents and even different results. For instance, I suspect that, while American wouldn\u2019t have opened Japan to the West in the 1850s, some other power - most likely Britain - may have, especially with their heavy involvement in China. So, while I am sorry to give a partial answer, I am hopeful those who know more about 18th and 19th Century France and Germany in particular can take up the mantle. This question is very much in the vein of the \u201cbutterfly effect.\u201d Lastly, and strictly for a bit a background for those interested, I did create a video I posted on YouTube that traces how and where the Europeans set up colonies in North America. So, it may be worthwhile for interested parties to gain some context at least as concerns these colonies. However, if one wants to skip it, I would recommend looking at the maps available on Wikipedia that show the makeup of the colonies before and after the French and Indian War. These are very telling as to why the British felt confident enough to turn their military forces in North America towards trade law enforcement, which angered to colonists and contributed greatly to the revolution.

            "answer_text": "Well,they tried, but the deck was stacked against them. They didn\u2019t have as many people over here as the British, they had more territory to defend, and they had the smaller navy to resupply their forces. The only way the French could have held on would have been to not get into the Seven Years War in the first place. Since France and Britain seemed to get into a war every few decades as a matter of routine, that would have been pretty difficult to do. I suppose that if the French went all in with their American colonies to the neglect of everyplace else in the world, then they might have been able to put up more of a fight against the British. With the right forces deployed in the right places, they just might have been able to fend off the British and fought to a draw, thus allowing them to stay in place. The problem for the French is that New France just never was all that profitable for them - certainly not enough to justify the huge military investment that holding it would require, and not enough to justify turning their back on other parts of the world like India. They therefore would have had to not just garrison their territory much more heavily, but also ramp up economic development to a much greater degree. What could a pre-industrial New France produce, though? There just wasn\u2019t the potential for plantation agriculture that there was in the Southern British colonies or in the West Indies. Timber could potentially have been produced to a greater extent, but mining was probably the only resource in which there was a lot of under-exploited potential. Unfortunately, in Canada and the Midwest, most of the ore deposits are not located close to the St. Lawrence or the Mississippi/Ohio rivers. Before the advent of railroads, there were bound to be severe limits on the quantity of ores that could be transported from the mines to France. In any case, prior to the advent of the industrial revolution, railroads, and steamships, there just wasn\u2019t that much demand for minerals. It might have actually made more sense to develop the capacity to refine the ores and to manufacture goods from them close to the mines, and then instead ship those value-added products back to France. The transportation problem would have been easier, it would have driven a much higher level of economic development, and attracted a lot of settlers. It might have even given New France a lead over the British colonies, whose manufacturing potential was being held back by British mercantilist policies. Unfortunately, France would have had the same motive for the same policies as the British, and many rich and powerful people in France would not be happy with seeing so much value added production develop in their colonies to compete with domestic manufactures. The one advantage the French would have had over the British, though, is that theirs was an absolute monarchy not constrained by a parliament, so the king could have just told everyone to shove it. One is thus forced to conclude that if France held on to its American territories by the only way it could have held on to them, this would have made a huge difference not just in French North America but in France itself, as well as in not just British North America but also in Britain itself. The entire world would be quite different, in ways we can scarcely imagine. ",
