            "answer_text": "All Persian Empires together ruled somewhat around a millennium and two centries combined, which is long enough for an empire to rule over a vast area in the middle east with no local comparable power. but if you asked why those powerful superpowers declined, the answer would be different but the main reasons could be ordered as follow: 1- In the Achaemenid Empire which was the first Persian superpower in the region, revolts, and treason combining with no brave king in front of a military genius like Alexander the Great caused the empire to be declined. Actually, in the Darius III era, Satrapies were unsatisfied with the governing method of the king and they start to not support the central power with rebellious subjects. This system of governing over local kingdoms made the Persian empire to be the first-ever multiethnic and multicultural kingdom over a vast area that no clans has ever reached it before. but as a Consequence, Darius III was defeated in a battle by Alexander the Great and his effort to restore the army by moving to the east was unfinished by the treason of one of his commanders and so he got killed. 2- In the Arsacid empire era, the Persian system of governing a central power over the local kingdoms were restored and made one of the mightiest Persian empires over centuries which defended the mainland against the powerful army of Romans, however, being King of Kings has some drawbacks too, a local king may revolt and claim the thrown with any excuse, finally one of the powerful clans of Persians took the thrown by the force which was the decline to the Arsacid empire and beginning of the new Sassanid empire era. 3-Finally in the Sassanid era, some very bad fortunes happened at the end, a constant battle against Romans with internal instability due to conflicts between Parthian and Persian clans made the central power so unstable that there was no man to rule for years and Khowsro II daughters took thrown for many years. As a result, so many casualties happened due to nonstop fights in frontiers with Romans and internal conflicts, consequently, it made the Persian army weak enough to be penetrated by Arabs. on the same hand, no reputed commander left to fight against Arabs when one commander lost the battle, especially after Rostam Farrokhzad lost the battle of Al-Qadisiyyah. Conclusion: Ruling over a vast area with a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural habitat has some pros and cons. The biggest drawback is more treason would happen due to not uniform society and so the army with different soldiers from different areas made it difficult to command while different abilities would be in hand with more unpredictable capabilities. If you look at Persian\u2019s history deeply you would find out that most of the Persian lost were due to those treasons which made us so untrusty that even nowadays we suffer this a lot. ",

            "answer_text": "Let me put this \u2018the Persian Empire did not last long\u2019 in perspective. The first Persian Empire (established by Cyrus the Great and conquered by Alexander the Great) lasted 220 years. If you were to translate such timeframe to current times, it would mean the Persian Empire would have been founded in 1800, about the time Napoleon I established his Empire which lasted a dozen of years, while the Persian Empire would still be around for a couple of years till 2020. Or, taking this thought experiment in the other direction, which might even be more profound: had the Persian Empire been established in the year 1950, when our grandparents were young and long before many of us were even born; and it would still exist in the year 2150, more than a century away, a time when our great-grand children will be very old.
