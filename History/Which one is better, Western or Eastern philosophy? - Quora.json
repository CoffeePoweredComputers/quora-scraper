            "answer_text": "Philosophical viewpoints arise from insights on human experience, which is universal. A person who is of any origin can study philosophies of any culture and have the possibility of gaining insight from that course of study. But it is only a possibility. One can read without comprehension. It takes a spark of intuition, often arising from life experience and an open mind, to gain anything from reading philosophy or even from a good teacher. Often, the axioms of these philosophies are quite embedded in the memetics, the sort of painted in symbology and assumptions, of their native cultures. This means that for a westerner, western philosophy us easier to learn, but provides less of a sensation, often enough, of ground shattering insight \u2014 since the foundational assumptions are quite familiar from subtle assumptions permeating the student's birth culture. Eastern philosophy can seem, in contrast, exotic and romanticized to the western mind \u2014 even become \u201corientalized\u201d \u2014 because the base cultural assumptions require (dare I say) a re-orientation from early axioms and building blocks, for the western student. So, for the western student the east seems superior, until as a mature scholar he or she can examine native traditions in a new perspective as truly human, not parochial western, having learned what is global in philosophical thought. And it is similar for the eastern student with one variation: western philosophy is the imperial philosophy of dominant scientific/capitalist culture. So it is never the same to return to your philosophy, denigrated by the dominant culture. This does not make western philosophy better, any more than it made the British Empire better than its colonies, when it held so many in dominance. Britain considered this, and presented it as natural law; the colonies, including our main Quora countries of origin of India and the US, both disagreed, in their times. ;) It is always the unconscious assumption of a dominant culture that their cultural artifacts are superior, and that \u201cgoing native\u201d is attractive but to be avoided, it seems. But I believe that philosophers, east and west, and theologians, struggle to describe subtle problems of human experience that are basic to all humans in all cultures. Whether you describe this as reality, God, the dharma, god head \u2014 it is as though we are seeing a nearly perfectly transparent gem, and the great teachers of every tradition shine a beam of light on one face of this barely translucent gem. By examining enough of these beams of light, we can eventually intuit something of its vast geometry and beauty. And that is a path of a life worth living. ",

Define \u2018philosophy\u2019. I\u2019m not being silly, this is seriously the work that needs to be put in to answer a question like this. The best way to answer it is to personally spend a lifetime perusing through the various works written around this world. Various conclusions can include: Western philosophy is better because it has a greater rigour to it and wider scope of interest.Eastern philosophy is better because it takes different approaches than Western philosophy that are more illuminating.Both have their merits and it is not worthy to compare them.It is impossible to make such a comparison, given that \u2018western\u2019 and \u2018Eastern\u2019 are vague orientalist constructions produced by the West and their scope in reality can\u2019t be reduced to a single homogenous label (try comparing Indian philosophy to Japanese philosophy and it would seem stupid to consider them both \u2018Eastern\u2019). The question is a waste of time and is more about globalized power dynamics than actually trying to assess the validity of philosophical schools.It is possible to make such a comparison because there are noticeable threads of influence that give the \u2018West\u2019 a characteristic philosophical outlook that has fundamentally different assumptions from those threads of influence that went through the \u2018East\u2019.It is silly to make such a comparison because they really are not that different - both have philosophers coming to similar conclusions about various things.I need to think about it more\u2026(p.s. this is the correct conclusion).",
