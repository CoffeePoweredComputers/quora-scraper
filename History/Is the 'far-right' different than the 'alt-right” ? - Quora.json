            "answer_text": "To me, it\u2019s more of a difference between (normal) far right, and (moronic) far right. For example: I\u2019m normal far-right. I believe, like many on both ends of the spectrum, in a utopianistic ideology, which has historically proven to be garbage when it comes to its actual implementation. Yet, similar to most aspects of theology, I have my own right to believe that it is the best course for humanity to take when dealing with it\u2019s own spiritual/political longevity. I believe in the incitement of violence, when the incitement of violence is due. And thus, when the incitement of violence is not due, then I firmly believe in sitting down and talking respectably with the opposition until we both compromise and come to an agreement like any rational individual with a speck of common sense. And while yes, I may believe in a powerful, militant, imperialistic government will bring everyone a more peaceful, higher quality of life for everyone who doesn\u2019t resist and ultimately be struck down with the eternal flames of their deepest political fears, I also believe that that particular outcome is also pretty unrealistic. So at least that\u2019s something we can all agree on. Now\u2026 Let\u2019s talk about the alt-right; rather, the moronic far-right. These people are my greatest, most ultimate pet-peeve. Listen, these are the type of people, who are fist of all, racist. Guess what? That makes me look bad. I\u2019m not racist at all! Yet, what is the first image that comes to mind when mentioning the far-right? You guessed it! Neo-Nazis. That\u2019s (facism + antisemitism = nazism) Anyone can do simple algebra. nazism - antisemitism = facism Also, the moronic\u2014 uh, I mean, the alt-right subconsciously contradict their own goals and make things worse for the rest of us normal far-rights. For example: Portland 2018. Never have I ever been so disappointed in the moronic extremes in my life. First of all, there\u2019s the moronic far-right inciting violence when it was not due!!! And on top of that, they\u2019re a bunch of racists! And when they claim they\u2019re far right, that makes me look racist!! Now, to go on a small tangent here, this provoked the moronic far-left: the antifas. So not only was there a bunch of morons making the normal far-rights look bad, but there was equally a moronic force on the other side making the normal far-lefts look bad. So now, it doesn\u2019t matter which end of the political spectrum you\u2019re on, because you look like an idiot regardless. It\u2019s simple math people! Moronic far-left + Moronic far-right = X X = everyone looks mediocre. Moronic far-rights want less gun laws, but then they go ahead and bust a cap at an antifa and now there\u2019s more burocratic red-tape for everyone!!! They\u2019re the most un-tactful, embarrassing, I-I-I- \u2026.I have no words for them. None. It\u2019s moronic. (The Alt-Right) You wanted the difference, I gave it to you. I hope it helped differentiate. ",

            "answer_text": "The banter around the political grouping Alt-Right seems to be trending lately largely as a result of its association with Trumpism and more recently Hillary Clinton\u2019s reference to this linkage. But what exactly is the Alt-Right? I first became aware of the phrase Alt-Right about a year and a half ago and have since learnt much about the streams of ideas that surface in the political sphere that it dominates. What follows is a combination of my observations, realizations and opinions regarding this movement. The Term \u2018Alternative Right\u2019 was first coined by the Paleo-Conservative thinker Paul Gottfried about a decade ago. However the derivative Alt-Right is more commonly used on the net. The term Dark Enlightenment is often employed synonymously with the Alt Right (read the work of Nick Land) but many Alt-Righters are not fond of the sinister implications of this designation.Alt-Righters tend to be unified in their opposition to both illegal and in many cases legal immigration (which sets them apart from most conservatives). Many are hostile to liberal democracy in its current form, champion isolationism, oppose free trade and as a whole are guided by a philosophy of a rigidly defined Race Realism that is opposed to miscegenation.Many Alt-Righters are White Nationalists and believe in a shared European identity that needs to be cultivated through education, political activism and ultimately the physical separation of race groups. Ingroup preference, it is argued, is followed by all \u2018races\u2019 therefore it should not be wrong if whites act accordingly.The movement is very much driven by the philosophy of decline (as are some Conservatives) but their race based \u2018solution\u2019 to this realization sets them apart from mainstream conservative support. For Alt-Righters the rot has set in and Western Civilization as it stands is heading toward an abyss driven by incompetent politicians, social justice warriors political correctness and toxic liberalism.Alt-Righters largely detest mainstream conservatives who they see as sell outs to a liberal establishment and thereby worthy of the crude epitaph cuckservative (a derivative of cuckold and conservative).Leading voices in the Alt-Right include Jared Taylor (of American Renaissance and Richard Spencer (a promoter of the Identitarian Movement) however Alt-Righters are largely decentralized and exert most of their footprint through the internet which has proved to be fertile ground for many of its \u2018techsavy\u2019 ground troops.It is incorrect to label Alt-Righters as Neo-Nazis, while some certainly align with this mindset the framework is broad enough that it includes Libertarians, traditionalists, paleo-conservatives and a host of other peripheral positions. It is not a Christian specific grouping and seems from what I have observed to contain many atheists, agnostic theists and European pagans. The commonality being an affection for European Civilization rather than a metaphysical belief system. Oddly enough many Alt-Righters are fairly liberal on social issues such as gay rights and abortion.Alt Righters are very much opposed to Islam however many are not fans of Judaism and in particular the Jewish impact on Western Civilization either. In the mind of many Alt Righters the Jewish elites have supported a policy of liberalism in order to water down establishment based anti-Semitism (a thesis advanced by the controversial academic Kevin MacDonald). The Jew is seen as the internationalist whose ultimate impact on European Civilization is negative (borrowing from Henry Ford). This opinion however is not shared by all Alt-Righters.Since it exists on the periphery the Alt-Right (just like the leftist radicalisms) has attracted more than its fair share of wackos, conspiracy nuts, hate mongers and marginal voices however it has several reflective thinkers who are well versed in philosophy, critical thinking and reasoned argument. Taylor comes across as such an individual as does the rising you tube star Millennial Woes.Alt-Righters tend to support Trump although some have probably come to their positions from various source backgrounds (not necessarily Republican). Most are Millennials or Gen Xers but don\u2019t necessarily hold to the same positions of nostalgia that defines Paleo-Conservatives such as Pat Buchanan.While News Outlet Breitbart does at times articulate the Alt-Right position on some issues - particularly illegal immigration and Islamism - it is not seen as an Alt-Right publication by adherents to the movement.Genetics plays a key role in Alt Right philosophy which views almost all issues through the prism of race as a hereditary construct.While some Alt-Righters are white supremacists many are not preferring to couch their white Nationalism in the same veneer as any other type of nationalism viz. Asian, Black, Italian, Thai etc - That is the focus should be more about the in-group than the other.Many Alt-Righters are anti-capitalist and most are opposed to free trade. In this respect they again differ from Conservatives. In fact on economic issues some of the anti-capitalism drivers are not too distinct from that of the Radical Left.The Alt-Right is not (yet) a significant force in and of itself and would probably vanish into the political ether if it were not for the pro-Dem media and indeed the Clinton\u2019s campaign to exaggerate their association with Trump.As a Classic Liberal I myself take great issue with the Alt Right. Their fascination with race is wrong-headed, destructive and ultimately corrosive to Western Civilization. In a sense they are advocating a modern version of Fascism that is Utopic in structure and at odds with the fundamental tenants of Burkean Conservatism. I am not convinced that the Alt-Right is even a philosophy of the right but more a mutation of identity politics, pseudo-science and a national socialism. However they do raise some valid points about the collapse of traditional structure within the nation state, top down social engineering and the challenges to our value system brought about by ill-conceived government policy. While I wouldn\u2019t give the movement more credit than they deserve a free and open discussion of some of these ideas (however harsh they are) should be part of our own self-reflection, not necessarily for acceptance but to increase our propensity for informed decision.
