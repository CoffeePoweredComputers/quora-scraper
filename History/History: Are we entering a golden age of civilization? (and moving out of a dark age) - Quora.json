            "answer_text": "Sorry, but we have left the Silver Ages and have just entered the Age of Aquarius (which is also forming part of the the Bronze Age), which will be then followed by a full blown Dark Age. The next Golden Age will start in about 10 000 - 12 000 years.  Many assume that the Golden Ages are the time when the humanity achieves the greatest successes in science and philosophy. But that couldn't be further from the truth. The real Golden Age is when consciousness levels are at the highest ad people at their happiest living simply and in harmony with nature without questioning it\u2019s laws. When the humanity starts to seek answers and experience the need to posses their own identities (whether through studies, inventions, gaining knowledge or materialistic views) this is a sign that the collective Ego is kicking in and we are slowly leaving the Golden epoch. The last Golden age was about 6 000 years from now, and it was a time time when humanity lived simply.  ",
