It includes its history, many photos of ancient tablets written in cuneiform (including one demonstrating the beveled writing instrument and how it was held). Here is an excerpt from the Cuneiform Script chapter: Writing is one of the basic characteristics of the culture of the ancient Near East. It first emerged in southern Mesopotamia at the end of the fourth millennium BCE in the form of the so-called \u201cpictographic\u201d tablets of Uruk. The discoverers of the script gave it the name \u201ccuneiform,\u201d from the Latin cuneus (wedge), on account of its wedge-shaped marks. This effect was created by using a calamus or reed pen to make three-dimensional marks, mostly on wet clay although other surfaces were used. And an excerpt from the chapter titled The Mesopotamian Scribes: The complexity of cuneiform script restricted its use in society: only the small caste of scribes was able to write. It is hard to calculate the number of scribes who were working at a particular era, but such a task has recently been undertaken for the third millennium. It is estimated that at Girsu, ca 2350 BCE, about thirty scribes were active simultaneously. A few decades later, there would have been about a hundred scribes in the whole of the Akkadian empire. Following administrative reforms introduced by Shulgi, king of Ur, the number of scribes increased. There were 1600 over four generations in the empire of Ur between 2100 and 2000 BCE.
