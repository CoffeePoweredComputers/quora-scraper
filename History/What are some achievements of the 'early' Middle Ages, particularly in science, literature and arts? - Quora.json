            "answer_text": "This is an interesting question, but also one that could go either way because it depends on one\u2019s definition of \u201cEarly Middle Ages\u201d. Since I\u2019ve been requested to answer this, I will humbly try to give a first shot at it. Science One of the most influential works in early medieval science is De temporum ratione (\u2018The Reckoning of Time\u2019) by the monk Bede. This work is a manual to the calculation of time and, by extent, astronomy. By writing this, Bede explained a lot about cosmology and proposed a way to calculate the correct date of Easter - which is not set on a fixed date such as Christmas. The Reckoning of Time put forward a lot of rules that we would nowadays summarize with the word \u201ccalendar\u201d.Bede immediately brings me to my next example. He also wrote a lot about Viking raids. And while the Northmen didn\u2019t reach their conclusions in life by what we deem the scientific method, obviously they reached heights in shipbuilding, seafaring and exploration that other civilizations found hard to keep up with. At one point, Viking trading networks spanned from Greenland to the Russian steppes and from Sicily to the fjords of Norway. Their longboats were a marvel of engineering and a powerful competitive advantage. A proper maester by GoT standards: J.D. Penrose - \u2018The Venerable Bede Translates John\u2019 (1902) Literature A great ethnographical source from this period is the Getae by Jordanes, an Eastern Roman bureaucrat of Gothic background. Written in Latin, this work is an extensive history of the origin and deeds of the Goths. While not an uncontroversial work, the least it does is give a representation of how this civilization was perceived at the time. The book also contains information on the early history and the customs of the Slavs. A certain \u201cking of the Brettones\u201d is featured as well, who might have been a historical source of inspiration for the Arthurian legend.A somewhat similar work is the \u2018History of the Lombards\u2019 by Paul the Deacon. Written before 800, it contains a mythological origin story of the Longobards - in the same vein as the Getae. Paul possibly wrote his work at Montecassino, southeast of Rome, and cited the earlier named Bede - which goes to show that knowledge spread across Europe in the Early Middle Ages, too.Other examples are the many writings of pope Gregory the Great, who even John Calvin described as a \u201cgood pope\u201d, and of course the Qu\u2019ran. A Salzburg manuscript of the \u2018History of the Lombards\u2019 from the 11th century Arts Great examples are the Visigoth votive crown from before 672 CE, which is a testament to the wealth of this civilization, and the beautiful Lindisfarne Gospels. With this category, though, I\u2019d like to make a push into one of my favorite art territories: architecture.An example of awesome \u2018fusion style\u2019 is the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy. It combines Roman and Byzantine elements. This church is so old that one could almost call it Late Antique. It was built under Ostrogoth rule, so by classical definitions it can definitely be classified as Early Medieval. Building expenses were sponsored by a banker, which - once again - shows that not all wealth was lost after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.A somewhat later example is the Palatine Chapel in Aachen, Germany. Its the remaining component of Charlemagne\u2019s palace that was built on the site. The late emperor is himself is buried in the chapel. You can still visit his remains. Consecrated in 805 by the pope, this building is more pre-Romanesque than San Vitale and is an early testament to a careful architectural departure from Roman and Byzantine styles.

            "answer_text": "Almost the entire corpus of surviving classical Latin literature comes from manuscripts of the 8th and 9th century. It\u2019s a bit sobering to think that if it weren\u2019t for a copying movement more than 1200 years ago the Roman Empire would\u2019ve been known today largely as a prehistoric one. We have some archaeological records of writing including papyrus survivals in Egypt, some late manuscripts from the 4th century and a lot of works written in Greek but without the copying effort we would have probably lacked many of the classical Latin works such as Lucretius, Catullus, Juvenal, Livy and Cicero. All in all the Carolingian empire produced some 9000 manuscripts and we\u2019d the poorer for it had they not done so.  ",
