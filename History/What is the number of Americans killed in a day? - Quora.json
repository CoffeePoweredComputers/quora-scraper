            "answer_text": "If the questioner is asking what is the maximum number of American soldiers killed in a single day, then the answer will surprise many, who automatically assume it must have been during World War 1 or 2. The correct answer is the Battle of Antietam (aka Sharpsburg), which occurred on Sept 17, 1862, between the Union Army of the Potomac, under the command of Maj. Gen. George B McClellan, and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by Gen. Robert E Lee. The precise number of casualties will never be known, as the intensity of fighting in a number of locations on the battlefield caused mens\u2019 bodies to literally disintegrate under fire, many Confederates were hastily interred in mass graves with questionable body counts, and local civilians probably buried many bodies whereever they were subsequently found. However, the generally accepted totals, from all causes, are about 22,700. Many Civil War battles produced higher overall casualties that Antietam, including Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Murfreesboro, and Chickamauga. However, these battles all occurred over several days, so Antietam remains the highest single-day loss. Soldier\u2019s bodies are still unearthed from time to time, as indeed happens on other Civil War battlefields too. I believe that in rare cases where the soldier can be positively identified and living descendants traced, then their wishes are respected. In the majority of cases where identification is not possible, I believe they are traditionally reinterred, with military honours, in one of the cemeteries associated with the battlefield. ",
