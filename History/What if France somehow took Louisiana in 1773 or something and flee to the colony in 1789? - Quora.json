            "answer_text": "The French Crown did own Louisiana and all the rest of what became the Purchase at the time in question. They had, for reasons that now escape me, leased the area to the Spanish Crown for 60 years. Neither Spain nor France had the resources to develope that immense area that they claimed so the colonists, though happy not to be French and Spanish and Creole, understood that they were pretty much on their own and acted accordingly. If Louis XVI had chosen a place to flee with his Court, there were much richer French colonies in the Carribean that he could have chosen. ",
