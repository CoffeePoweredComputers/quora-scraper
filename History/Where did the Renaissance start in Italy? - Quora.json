            "answer_text": "In a word, Florence. We can date the beginnings of the Renaissance to works of Petrarch in the first half of the 14th century. (The artistic side of the Renaissance started a bit later in the early 15th century with Brunelleschi.) I had the good fortune to hear a lecture by the great historian of the Byzantine Empire and the Crusades, Sir Steven Runciman, in which he demolished the notion that Greek studies in the West did not revive until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Petrarch and others in the first half of the 14th century were studying, or trying to study, classical Greek. Boccaccio\u2019s Genealogy Of The Pagan Gods (Geneologia Deorum Gentilium), begun in the late 1340s, uses Greek sources extensively. The fall of Constantinople certainly triggered an influx of scholars and texts, but the process was well underway. Renaissance ideas spread rapidly throughout Italy and into the North during the 15th century, and dominated the culture of Western Europe by the 16th century. ",

            "answer_text": "The Renaissance began in Florence, in the 14th century. Various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of Florence at the time: its political structure; the patronage of its dominant family, the Medici, and the migration of Greek scholars and texts to Italy following the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks. Other major centres were northern Italian city-states such as Venice, Genoa, Milan, Bologna, and finally Rome during the Renaissance Papacy. ",

            "answer_text": "One major reason the Renaissance began in Italy is linked to geography. The city-states of Italy, positioned on the Mediterranean Sea, were centers for trade and commerce, the first port of call for both goods and new ideas. Secondly, Italy was the core of the former Roman empire, and, at the collapse of the Byzantine empire in 1453, became the refuge for the intellectuals of Constantinople who brought with them many of the great works of the ancient Greeks and Romans, works that had been lost to the West during the Dark Ages. Prior to this, scholars in Italy had been examining the works of the ancients, but they were of poor quality and often incomplete. ",
