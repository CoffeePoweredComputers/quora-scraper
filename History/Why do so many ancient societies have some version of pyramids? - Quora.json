            "answer_text": "The reason why so many ancient civilizations from all over the world built pyramid-shaped structures is because, if you want to build a really big, monumental structure out of stone that will not crumble to pieces, a pyramid shape is the easiest way to do it. Basically, a pyramid is just a really convenient way to pile up rocks and have them not fall down on you. If you try to build an enormous, monumental structure that is shaped like a box and has straight walls going straight up at a ninety-degree angle with the ground, then it is a much more difficult to build, because the bricks are stacked up directly on top of each other and every brick has to support the weight of all the bricks on top of it. Often, once you build the monument to a certain size, the weight gets so heavy that the bricks on the bottom crumble and the wall simply collapses. Also, with a box-shaped structure, you have to find a way to support the roof somehow so it does not just cave in. If you build a pyramid, however, then all your problems are instantly solved. Each brick only has to support the weight of the brick immediately on top of it and, as the pyramid goes up, the amount of weight you add with each new layer of bricks decreases. You also do not have to worry about the root caving in, because there is no roof and the top of the pyramid simply rests on top of the bricks beneath it! Even today, many architects still make use of the same basic techniques that make pyramidal structures work. Ever notice that the ground floor of a building is usually the largest, and that the floors on top usually gradually grow smaller and smaller in terms of total floor space as you go higher up? That is to reduce the amount of total weight being placed on the walls on the bottom floor. You will notice that even most modern skyscrapers are vaguely pyramidal in shape:  There is absolutely nothing \u201cmagical\u201d about a pyramid shape. It has no special \u201cpsychic energies\u201d or anything like that. It just happens to be a very architecturally efficient shape. Likewise, there is absolutely no evidence to support the notion that pyramids were built by aliens, or that there was ever a single extremely advanced prehistoric civilization that used pyramids and taught them to ancient peoples around the world. Both of those ideas are ridiculous. The simplest explanation for the existence of pyramidal structures around the world is simply that a pyramid is a very architecturally sound structure.   ",

            "answer_text": "Then there is the unorthodox answer. They got the idea from somebody else. One set of African people constructed a pyramidion memorial to the first bit of land to rise from the endless dark waters that was part of the creation myth of the builder\u2019s great house. During their age of world-wide exploration they shared their stories of myths and legends. Some stayed in these new lands and made a home and in doing so advanced the lives of the indigenous peoples. Millennia later their high civilizations sought to mimic their ancient benefactors in their own ways. Start with Meroe, then the land of the two rivers to the northeast, then South Asia, then Southeast Asia, then the pyramid shaped mounds of China, then the central temple at Ankur-wat (the least obvious pyramidion), then there are the trignons of Japan small but still the same shape and of course the multitude of pyramids in Central America. I can understand how the most difficult example to accept is Central America, since all the others can be reached by land. Although, Japan requires a short voyage it would be a much more acceptable than an ocean. All I can say about that is a German chemist was given a sample of the lotion used in the mummification rituals to anoint the bodies. After her analysis she found cocaine in the sample. She ran multiple tests before she asked herself did she want to put her career in jeopardy by publishing the indisputable finding? Is cocaine grown in Africa or Asia? Also Budge in his dictionary of hieroglyphics has a depiction of an ear of corn. Where is corn indigenous to? You do the \u201cmath\u201d. ",
