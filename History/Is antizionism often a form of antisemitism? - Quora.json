            "answer_text": "If you reject the existence of Israel completely you\u2019re an antisemite. For 2000 years Jewish people lived as a minority everywhere across the Christian and Islamic worlds. Each generation passed Jewish culture and religion to the next with hope of redemption in the future. In each century they were subject to violence (the crusades), expulsion (Spanish inquisition), discrimination (Dhimmi status) and massacre (then Granada massacre). In the 20th century alone 2/3rd were murdered in Europe and most Jews in Islamic countries were uprooted. Now that Jews have sovereignty over a small area of the Middle East, about 0.3% of the Middle East\u2019s land they are called racists and colonisers\u2019 for wanting to retain it. The anti-Zionist sees the Jews default position as a minority amongst the nations, whilst the same minority status for Muslims in just a tiny piece of land such as Israel is seen as unjust, and tables must be turned so that Arab-Muslims can dominate over Jews again. Let\u2019s be clear, a large proportion of anti-Zionists think Jews should \u201cgo home\u201d.  Such language like this in respect to Muslims in Europe would be seen as unacceptable and racist, but seems totally fine when used in respect to Jews. Despite the best efforts to convince us otherwise, Hamas isn\u2019t a freedom fighting organisation. It seeks to create an Islamic dominant society in which Christianity and Judaism are accepted but inferior. Just read their charter:  Anti-Zionist activists regularly chant \u201cPalestine will be free from the river to the sea\u201d meaning all of Israel, the only Jewish country will be gone. Who knows what would happen to Israel\u2019s 6 million Jews in such a situation. We get an idea from Arab poetry: This part of Darren Tatour poem \u201cresist\u201d  Eviction of Jews is an anti-Zionist aim. But who is going to take in 6 million Jews? No like country exists for Jews, unlikely Palestinian-Muslims have other countries to go to that speak the same language as them and practice the same religion. Would now be a good time for Israeli Jews of Yemenite, Syrian or Libyan origin to return? Should someone descended from refugees who moved from Nazi-Germany to Palestine in 1930s \u201cgo home\u201d to Germany? Think about this next time you see \u201cFree Palestine\u201d written. ",

            "answer_text": "Anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism refer to different concepts but both are damaging. Firstly, anti-Zionism often uses the same language as anti-Semitism. Anti-Zionists often fall into the trap of perpetuating anti-Semitic stereotypes or tropes in their criticism of Israel and Zionism. Two cases best illustrate this. The President of the National Union of Students in the UK, Malia Bouatta wrote a blog criticising the prevalence of Zionist thought in UK universities and the national media. In the blog, she referred to \"Zionist-led media outlets\". While her criticism of Zionism as a concept may be valid, expressing it in this language is damaging. It perpetuates the harmful myth that a Jewish conspiracy controls the international media. Ilhan Omar, the US Congresswoman, has also used damaging language in her criticisms of Isreal. She first accused American politicians overt support of Israel as being \"all about the Benjamins\", then in a panel discussion she accused Jewish lawmakers of having an allegiance to \"another country\". This language is damaging because it echoes some of the accusations made against Jews by the Nazis and other anti-Semitic groups. Support for Israel is complex and reducing it to money, or going further and accusing Jewish lawmakers of having \"dual loyalty\", falls into the trap of using well-established anti-Semitic tropes to criticise Israel. Secondly, anti-Zionism creates an environment which is favourable to anti-Semitism. Anti-Israeli expression creates an environment where anti-Semitism becomes more acceptable. In an environment where many people hold anti-Israel beliefs, they are less likely to challenge anti-Semitism when it occurs. Parli does an excellent job of mapping the opinions on the anti-Semitism vs anti-Zionism debate. You can find the section I mention in this answer here: Map: The relationship between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism ",
