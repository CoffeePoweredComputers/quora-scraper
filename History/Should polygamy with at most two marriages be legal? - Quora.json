            "answer_text": "Yes \u2014 but not just that. I presume here you meant polygamy with at most two women married to one man. But that\u2019s almost irrelevant to the question of what kinds of marriage should be legal. (For the religious and moral aspect, I\u2019ll simply note that polygamy was perfectly legal in Biblical times, New Covenant and Old.) Marriage has many purposes in the current culture. It\u2019s helpful to answer this question from the viewpoint of whether a marriage serves the cultural purposes it\u2019s intended to. First, marriage is a declaration of an intent for long-lasting or permanent intimate love to the world at large. From that standpoint, it makes little sense to limit marriage to two people, or to require marriage to be transitive. Second, marriage is a financial and contractural-obligation arrangement. It specifies who will be responsible for raising children, or for caring for adults who need it. It identifies who will inherit if a partner dies. Such contracts are simpler when they\u2019re between two individuals, but the number of participants in such a contract need not be limited to two, or three. In short, if a group of people want to be married to each other in any combination, and if they are committed to working out the details of who pays the bills and who mops the floors, no government should restrict them.
