            "answer_text": "They don\u2019t form nucleotides, no. Nucleotides are the four basic building blocks that form the DNA strand. Amino acids, usually abbreviated as A,C,T and G. If you think of the DNA as a necklace of pearls, like this:  Then every pearl would be one nucleotide. Nucleosomes are much larger than that. They are how the entire DNA strand is stored in the cell. Think of that string of pearls up there again, wrapped around something like this:  That white spool in this picture would be the nucleosome. There\u2019s not quite that much DNA wrapped around it, but the principle is the same. It looks like this:  ",

            "answer_text": "Not at all. The nucleosome it is the complex that it is made up of DNA wrapped around histonic proteins. In particular a nucleosome unit it is made of 147bp of DNA wrapped around an histonic core made of 8 histone proteins 8 (H2A. H2B, H3 and H4. 2 each plus the histone H1 that helps the 147bp DNA to stick to the histonic core). So, no, the nucleosome it is not a nucleotide, but it is partly made of nucleotides. ",
