            "answer_text": "The so called \u201ctreaty\u201d of Versailles was the main reason for the second world war - the strong econmical restrictions and the high payments combined with a financial crisis made the perfect base for these extremists. And the allies knew that - and that\u2019s the main reason why they treated Germany (and Austria) much better after WWII. If it wasn\u2019t Hitler, then there would have been another extremist which might not have been any better than him. I think the entire world learned from the \u201cTreaty\u201d of Versailles that you have to treat the loosing party with respect, otherwise you will cause yet another war a few years later. ",

What\u2019s a possible path for the history of Germany over the next 50 years? A paper that includes dues to pay by unborn third is not a treaty! Germany did not start world war 1, and was not solely responsible for world war 1. Some idiots that have not even been authorized signed a contract to make a whole country responsible including the few next generations. Why should a country act in accordance with such a peace of paper called treaty? World war 2 was inevitable, the first world war was not! ",
