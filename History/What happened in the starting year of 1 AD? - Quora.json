            "answer_text": "Lots of things happened, but no one single thing of great importance. The \u201ctradition\u201d was that Jesus was born in 1AD, AD being an abbreviation for Anno Domini, which is Latin for \u201cYear of our Lord\u201d. However, modern theologians and historians are pretty convinced that Jesus was actually born six or seven years earlier, so the numbering is off. People who don\u2019t like the religious association tend to use the term \u201cCE\u201d for Common Era instead of AD, and BCE for Before Common Era instead of the traditional BC (Before Christ). Sidebar: One curiosity is that 1AD follows directly after 1BC. There is no Zero year in between them. So ten years before 5AD would be 6BC. This is because the concept of zero as a number was not invented until the Islamic era, along with a lot of other mathematical and scientific advances that came out of Islamic innovation. This lack of zero is also why Easter Sunday is referred to as the Third Day after Good Friday. ",
