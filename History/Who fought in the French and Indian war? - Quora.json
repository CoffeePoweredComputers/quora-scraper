Duquesne (Pittsburg, PA) where he came across a group of Imperial French soldiers and Native Americans, got into a battle, which caused the French Ambassador to get injured by gunshot. His commanding officer, Gen\u2019l Braddock was killed. This was the start of what became the first real World War and it covered damn near every continent short of the polar caps. Britain came out the winner, but at a great cost which Parliament unsuccessfully tried to pass on to us. How\u2019d that turn out? Britain and her Indian allies and French with hers. ",
