            "answer_text": "There were seven Wars of the Coalition. The first war was waged against the revolutionary government of the First Republic. The second was waged against the Directory, the government of France at the time the war broke out. Napoleon took power in the Brumaire Coup in November, 1799, and therefore, the War of the Second Coalition was partly a Napoleonic war. The five subsequent wars of the Coalition were all waged against Napoleon. So one could say there were five Napoleonic wars, or five and a half, or six, depending on how one chooses to do the counting. You can read about the Wars of the Coalition by visiting this site: Coalitions Against France Note that under each rubric, there is a \u201cclickable\u201d link for the high points of each coalition war. Note also that Napoleon summoned Ferdinand VII of Spain to France in 1808, informed him that he was deposed, and then invaded Spain to put his brother Joseph on the throne in Madrid. ",
