When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description,standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other\u2014This is My BelovedSon. Hear Him!18 My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)\u2014and which I should join.19 I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that: \u201cthey draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.\u201d Joseph Smith--History ",

Certainly some bad can come from organized religions, but this question acts as if wrongdoings are what ONLY come from religion, which is false. Someone else made a video about the same assertion that religion is evil, but belief in God isn't and it was critiqued in this article that goes into more detail. I think you should check it out.
