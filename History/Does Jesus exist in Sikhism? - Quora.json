            "answer_text": "The name of Jesus (Essa) appears in the work of Bhai Gurdas ji. Christianity existed during the time period of the Sikh Gurus, but they\u2019re not in great numbers then. Two big religions at that time were Hinduism and Islam, and Sikhism started as a third. The focus of the gurus were on the people that they\u2019re meeting and preaching about the True Path. I don\u2019t know much about it but I heard that the first Sikh Guru travelled to Rome and met the Pope there then. So the name of Jesus is available in the Sikh scripture - Vaara Bhai Gurdas. But he\u2019s not as venerated as the Christians do. FYI, a woman in Punjab circulated the misconception about the writing of the tenth guru that in there the guru called Jesus (Essa) as God. This is the same way like the different religions talk about their gods and goddesses in the Sikh scripture, and that woman who\u2019s a Christian stated the same using the name that she believed in. This was debunked by Gurpreet Singh California. ",
