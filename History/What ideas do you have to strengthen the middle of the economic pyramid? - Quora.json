This puts more people on Disability, because those with developmental delay disorder and other Learning disabilities that make them best suited for stocking, Janitorial and other such jobs, can't get those jobs because those people who could do jobs that take more skills can't get them because those jobs are too few in number.  The more people in the middle class sector we have working, the more tax money that will be generated. We might even be able to persuade those in jobs that people on disability could do, to take skilled labour jobs so that we can get more people off of disability.  There are many skilled labour jobs that can't be filled where I live. In my opinion (and I might be wrong here) - perhaps they aren't willing to train people so that they can learn these jobs? What I mean is, if people aren't willing to go to tech school to learn, then maybe they need to have on the job training? ",
