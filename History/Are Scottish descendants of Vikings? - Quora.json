            "answer_text": "The majority of Scottish people have the same roots as as people from the Scottish Borders and northern Ireland. (Historically, the Scottish Borders, or Scottish Marches, is the area on each side of the border between England and Scotland. It included parts of what is now Dumfries and Galloway, but also parts of the English counties of Cumbria and Northumberland.) Modern Scots also have strong genetic links with their Dark Age ancestors, the Picts - the aboriginal peoples of Scotland, especially the north (including the Highlands) and east. Between about the eight to the fifteenth century, Vikings and Norse settlers colonised some areas of what is now the periphery of modern Scotland. This period is known as Scandinavian Scotland.  From around 750 CE, life in Scandinavia had become increasingly difficult, as the population was far greater than the land could support. Norse seamanship skills were legendary, and before long people from Sweden and Norway began to leave their homelands to look for new territories in which to settle. By the end of the ninth century, the Northern and Western Isles, Caithness, Sutherland and Inverness all ended up being occupied by the Vikings. The Vikings\u2019 primary mission was to find new land to settle. Orkney, Mann, Skye, Shetland, and the Hebrides are also perfectly situated to receive goods (and retreating Scandinavian forces) back from Ireland and Britain, as well as Iceland and lands further west. But although the Vikings ended up occupying the western islands, and conquered the Scottish kingdom of Dal Riata (see map above) they were never able to take over the main part of the land,which had become more unified and able to resist the intruders. The Scottish Islands were different: they remained essentially \u2018Norse\u2019 long after the Viking Age in Scandinavia ended. The Hebrides were officially territories of Norway, not Scotland, until the thirteenth century; Orkney and Shetland until the fifteenth. Today these places are still as rich in Norse culture, and often have a distinctly \u2018Nordic\u2019 feel.  Saint Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney. Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney, sometimes known as Magnus the Martyr and later as Saint Magnus, served jointly as Earl of Orkney with his cousin H\u00e5kon until the two fell out. H\u00e5kon subsequently betrayed and murdered Magnus, who later achieved sainthood. Today, natives travelling to the mainland from Orkney describe it as visiting \u2018Scotland\u2019; DNA studies show that Orkney is 30% Norse. The Shetland Isles are even higher, at 44%, a fact which proudly celebrated at the world-famous Up Helly Aa - twelve fire festivals held annually in the islands in the middle of winter to mark the end of the yule season:  People dressed as Vikings march through the streets of Lerwick to recreate its ancient Viking past in a tradition dating back to the 19th century. The procession is led by the Guizer Jarl, or chief guizer, and culminates in a replica longboat being set alight. This years\u2019 Up Helly Aa is on 28th January 2020 (Last Tuesday of January) - so if you\u2019re feeling like Viking, you\u2019ve still just got time to plan your visit!

            "answer_text": "The answer is yes and no. The viking raids on Northern England and Scotland started around 830. And continued for about 400 years. During this time as well there were Vikings, or scandanavian people who went on a raid and stayed and also after a while the Vikings set up trading ports where they had permanent settlements. Just as an example, I am an Australian but of Irish and Scottish descent on my mother side. On my fathers side were English settlers, but from the Coastal areas of South East England were the Vikings would raid and some would stay and some would leave genetic material after a long tough day of pillaging. Anyway so my mother got one of the genetic tests done that shows your origin, what came up was about 50% Irish, 20% Scottish, 15% Scandinavian, and 5% from Normandy. I havent had my done but I think it will have England and Scandinavia as well. So the answer is yes and that I am one, sort of. About five years ago I was in Oslo and I was wandering around, and I passed by a kindergarten. What I couldn't believe is how all of the kids there looked just like my kids. ",
