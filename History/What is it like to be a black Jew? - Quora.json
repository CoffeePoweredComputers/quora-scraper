            "answer_text": "I can only speak for myself. The most interesting thing is that generally no one meets me and assumes that I am Jewish. Even though I wear a Star of David...sometimes people will ask me, \"Do you know what that star around your neck means?\" as if they are sharing some unknown information with me! Sometimes this puts me in an interesting position; especially if someone makes a disparaging remark about Jews. I usually state that I'm Jewish...and then the atmosphere gets to be a bit uncomfortable. Because I know of no other way to be Jewish, it's hard for me to compare exactly how my experiences differ from that of a White Jewish person. I've had non-observant White Jews admit to me that they too have been embarrassed publicly, either inadvertently or pointedly, because they were ignorant of Jewish law or culture. However in my case, because people assume I am not Jewish by default, they will many times volunteer to explain things to me or help me out with Jewish ritual; even though I've been doing it on my own for years and even may be more knowledgeable about it then they are! Socially, it can be very lonely and alienating at times. There are many subjects that Jewish women talk about, such as doing their hair, or where to shop for wigs (doesn't apply to me anyway, since I'm not married, but still), or childhood experiences that I can't relate to or vice-versa. I can't talk to most Jews about my previous experiences with being called a monkey or having teachers marvel at how smart and \"well-spoken\" I was (for a Black child). No one assumes that Jewish children are dunces...as can be assumed about Black children. Also my family life and culture are very different than what many White Jews have experienced. While in general I have been received well by the Jewish community, there are plenty of Jews and communities who have given me the cold shoulder due to my race. When I was younger I used to take this personally. However over time, I've come to accept that ignorance and racism are still alive and well, and it is their issue, not mine. However, I no longer naively believe that I am welcome in any and every Jewish community out there without reservation. That's something that is always in the back of my mind. ",

I quote:As an African-American, Davis was the victim of racism throughout his life and was a large financial supporter of the Civil Rights movement. Davis had a complex relationship with the African-American community, and drew criticism after physically embracing President Richard M. Nixon in 1972. One day on a golf course with Jack Benny, he was asked what his handicap was. \"Handicap?\" he asked. \"Talk about handicap \u2014 I'm a one-eyed Negro Jew.\"[5][6] This was to become a signature comment, recounted in his autobiography, and in countless articles.  But when I was 10 years old and I met him with my parents in France , during a vacation in the French riveria , where he was immensely popular , He was all smile ! I didn't think about his color , his religion , his handicap !  I know that he was the only American singer who was able to defrost , at that time , the Grimaldi's at the Red Cross Gala. Your question  emphasizes that what was obvious to us, in my generation  is not so obvious  today.  Lenny Kravitz  and Stoudemier can answer you better than me.
