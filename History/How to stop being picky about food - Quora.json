            "answer_text": "The only way to overcome this is to put yourself on a diet that changes your pickiness. Frankly, I think that all habitual consumption of healthy food is just an extended form of pickiness, and therefore that the rules and intellectual construct of dieting is the best model for what you have to do to change your own eating habits (whether they are healthy or otherwise). But if there was a simple general way for people to change their habits, somebody would\u2019ve written a book about it by now. (And that book would be everywhere, in everybody\u2019s life, because it would work simply and generally and spread rapidly through the grapevine from there, not selectively in only a few people and with a lot of confirmation bias on the part of the readers, like most self-help books.) However, I\u2019m still gonna give you my opinion. Therefore: \u2014\u2014\u2014 Five Steps to Transition Yourself to a Healthy Diet: 1.) Start Small If you reflexively gag every time you put lettuce in your mouth, don\u2019t put lettuce in your mouth. Instead, start with a vegetable you can tolerate. If lettuce only makes you cringe a bit, maybe eat one piece of lettuce with every meal every day for a few days. To change yourself, you have to train yourself. Eating a pound of sour-vinaigrette salad with radicchio, kale, and arugula when you\u2019ve grown up on chicken strips and McDonalds is, yes, a healthy choice; but we\u2019re playing the long-term psychological diet game, and as far as that goes, overdoing it on salads makes about as much sense as having someone who\u2019s too skinny to hold a tennis racket at arms\u2019 length try to bench press 300 lbs. (130 kilos for you internationals, 21 stone for you Brits. ;) 2.) Don\u2019t Cheat; Just Lower Your Expectations If you reflexively gag every time you put lettuce in your mouth, you\u2019re probably not the type of person to instantly transition your lunches from white-bread-baloney-mayo-American-\u201ccheese\u201d sandwiches to a sweet-potato-free-range-chicken-avocado bowl. You can go directly to this if you want, but the Oreos will still beckon. To change yourself, you have to be disciplined. To maintain discipline while recognizing your limitations, you have to be deliberate about your cheating. Instead of cutting deserts out of your diet instantly, organize your healthy meals to account for your guilty pleasures. For example: if you know that later on in the day you\u2019re going to have something that is American levels of oversugared and under-nutritious, have something that is relatively low-carb as your prior meal. For example, a serving of hummus-avocado-tofu hotdish with a peanut-butter-and-coconut-oil sauce would be low-carb, and that protein and healthy fat would a much better dietary complement to your sugary \u201ccheating\u201d than even something that was healthy but carb-heavy based. 3.) But Seriously, Don\u2019t Mistake the Cheating for the Diet If you reflexively gag every time you put lettuce in your mouth, you\u2019re probably the type of person who doesn\u2019t want anything to taste like lettuce ever. That want is the problem we\u2019re trying to solve. To change yourself, you have to put yourself in a new context, and then let yourself be shaped by that context. If you started with a less-vegetable-y vegetable like corn or green beans, and you ever start finding that those vegetables are starting to get enjoyable, it means that it\u2019s time for you to move on and pick something new, something that is tolerable, but not yet enjoyable. 4.) Make the Vegetables Boring If you reflexively gag every time you put lettuce in your mouth, it is probably because you\u2019re sensitive to whatever bitterness is contained within lettuce. I\u2019m with you on this one. (This might shock you, but I have only very, very recently recovered from a strong, lifelong, and highly-personal vendetta against lettuce.) Sometimes you can\u2019t change yourself: change the world instead. Bitterness is a weird flavor, and everyone is sensitive to different kinds of it. There are lots of ways to make vegetables less bitter, most of which are just variations on the process called leaching; basically, you boil the vegetables in a pot with water, and then throw out the water. The bitter chemicals (along with some of the nutrients) have probably been boiled away, leaving palatable vegetables. If it\u2019s texture you\u2019re sensitive to, cooking them longer will soften them right up. There\u2019s something divine about a nice home-canned green bean, and the way it just melts in your mouth from the cooking and all the time spent soaking in the just-salty-enough water. Just keep in mind that if health is why you\u2019re doing this, cooking the veggies can alter the nutrient profiles and availability levels, possibly making them less nutritious. 5.) But Seriously, Don\u2019t Make Food Boring Sometimes, you don\u2019t have to change yourself, just distract yourself. Taste buds can be tricked. It turns out, if you cover them with fat, taste buds can\u2019t detect bitterness as well. The fat will also allow good fat-soluble flavor volatiles to leach out of the vegetables, enhancing their overall flavor. The fat masks the flavor of bitter vegetables, so cooking them in fat will make them taste better. (You wonder why people put fatty dressings on salads? This is why.) And of course, fat is not the only way to distract your taste buds from the fact that they\u2019re eating vegetables; sweet sugar, savory miso, sour vinegar or citrus, spicy chipotle seasoning, unctious curryleaf\u2026 the reason people put spices and seasonings on their food is \u2019cause it tastes like crap otherwise, and vegetables are no different. If you make vegetables that taste good, you\u2019re more likely to eat them. For example, anymore I pretty much don\u2019t cook cole crops (broccoli, bok choy, brussels sprouts, etc.) without flavoring them with Chinese brown sauce (that stuff that they have in every Chinese restaurant in the USA, which is a combo of brown sugar, rice vinegar, miso [I use white and a little powdered red], flour for thickening, and garlic). \u2014\u2014\u2014 Source that tells how to make a perfectly good and healthy vegetable taste good, even though it\u2019s kind of so bitter that a lot of people don\u2019t like it and instead just call it a weed: Making dandelions palatable ",

            "answer_text": "Hello fellow picky eater! I used to be one of the biggest picky eaters in the world as well. I would gag just drinking water, I felt that I had to drink soda and fruit juice as a result. In addition, I also could not stand the vast majority of vegetables, the only one I would eat was boiled cauliflower with cheese sauce. Today, I drink nothing but water, and at times I have eaten 10 cups of salad in a single sitting. Therefore, I will tell you what I did. I personally started with the water issue, I forced myself to drink nothing but water for a month, because I have long known that if you can repeat an activity every day for a month, it becomes much easier afterwards. That month was torture for me, but I forced myself to do it for a month and told myself if I still hated the water after the month I\u2019d go back to the sweet drinks. Well, I got though the month and water was much more tolerable, so I continued drinking nothing but water afterwards. Now, most water is virtually tasteless to me. In the case of vegetables, I did it more gradually. I started by eating foods that I liked already with a small amount of vegetables mixed in. Stuff like omelettes and sub sandwiches. I started with the more tolerable vegetables like onions and bell peppers. After becoming tolerant of those, I started adding more and more variety of vegetables as I went. When I chose to eat out, I would go to subway and slowly increase the amount of veggies that I put on my sub. Over the course of multiple months, I got where I would have EVERY vegetable on my subs when I ate out at subway. When I was in college, I would get a delicious omelette and a plate of spinach next to it. I started by having a tiny bite of spinach when I took a big bite of omelette. Eventually, I adjusted the ratio to increase the amount of spinach and decrease the amount of omelette per bite. I got to the point where I could eat a ratio of like 1:4 omelette to spinach. I would actually go refill my spinach plate before finishing my omelette. At that point, I decided I was ready to try full salads, so I began eating spring mix from the grocery store without taking bites of good food to go with it. I still hated it a lot more than spinach, but I used willpower for a month like I did with water. I finally got to the point where spring mix was not much worse than spinach to me. Even now, I still dislike tomatoes, I\u2019m thinking of making that my next step in the process. ",

            "answer_text": "You know understanding people and cultures and who, how, and where food comes from\u2026 this changes you alot. Even having a small veggie garden can also help make a difference. We all go through phases and trends as long as we live. Every few years our entire palate changes. Sometimes you have to just FIND A CUISINE that works for you NOW and stay with it. Most go through PIZZA PHASE. Then into Chinese food phase with Fast Food Mexican somewhere in the mix. I went through a salad phase and was eating a fresh salad almost daily for awhile. FIND YOUR CUISINE. It may change within a couple of years or even a couple of weeks. BEGIN TRYING DIFFERENT FOODS ON PURPOSE. Greek maybe. Island. Thai. Soul Food. Southern Cooking. Cajon. German. Scot/Irish. Brit. Get hooked up with some real Italian. Some go through an INDIAN phase but that is way to spicy for me. ALSO you can find 1 simple item you like all along and then WRITE THAT ON A POSTED LIST. I did this for a younger sister who was a very picky eater and always underweight. She liked cucumbers so I began growing those in our backyard. She liked fresh corn and also green beans. Before long we had a running list of things she would eat regularly and it was much more items than we thought and this WILL BE THE CASE FOR YOU ALSO when you begin your own list. Post that list on the side of the fridge and add to it 1 item at a time. START ONLY with the items you like because that is the smaller list to make. I think after awhile you are going to be well farther along the line food wise than you think. Meantime, HAVE FUN WITH THIS AND MAKE IT AN ADVENTURE. My final advice is this: DO NOT GO INTO LIKE VS DISLIKE MODE but elect on a scale of 1 (hate it ) - 5 (love it). 2,3,4 are doable items but not to die for. You can do this = go go go. ",

            "answer_text": "Force yourself to try things. The hardest part is the first taste, but once you\u2019ve assimilated it and your brain has made the connection between what the food looks like and what it tastes like, then it automatically sets itself in a position it wasn\u2019t before: one of rationalization and curiosity over one of fear mixed with denial, which perpetuates a mindset of wanting to like the food you told yourself you wouldn\u2019t like. That\u2019s the way I see it, anyways. I\u2019m 21 now, and I eat everything; and I mean everything. Up until the age of 16, I hated cheese if it wasn\u2019t individually wrapped and tasteless, only ate beef it was cooked to absolute char, and would literally gag if I ate dark chocolate. I sort of opened up after that, and since then I\u2019ve been discovering the beautiful world of food. Last summer I was in Malay, and a local taught me how to pull an urchin off the rocks, crack it open, and suck it out like an oyster. Never would I have done that 6 years ago. The greatest tip that I give to my picky friends, and one that may be more up your alley, is watching cooking shows on YouTube, namely those that have a \u201cdiscovery\u201d viewpoint to lesser known ingredients. First We Feast and Bon App\u00e9tit has great series on everything from Poutine, to strawberries, to hamburgers and more! These videos are made to entice you to try the food they\u2019re advertising, and get your mouth watering. Plus, if you\u2019re from a large city center, many of these videos showcase restaurants in your area, if you look it up specifically! That\u2019s the shpeel. Hope this helps! Good luck on your food journey! ",

            "answer_text": " You\u2019ve probably been told since you were a toddler to \u201cEat your vegetables! They\u2019re good for you.\u201d Do you really know WHY they\u2019re good for you? Let me jump into a few reasons why vegetables kick ass. learn How to eat fruits and vegetables 1) Vegetables are nutrient dense. It should be no surprise that Popeye turned to a vegetable when he needed a powerup. Think of vegetables as one of our body\u2019s most efficient fuel sources: they are packed full of vital macro and micronutrients. Just take a look at our article on how to eat healthy on a budget \u2013 it should be no surprise that vegetables are an important part of efficiently eating healthy! Simply put: vegetables are the backbone of any solid diet. 2) They fill you up, without \u201cfilling you up.\u201d Ever seen what 200 calories worth of broccoli looks like? It\u2019s the size of a grocery bag compared to 200 calories of a doughnut or other treats. If you are feeling hungry but don\u2019t want to overeat, choose a vegetable. Kind of hard to overeat when you\u2019re eating carrots or celery! 3) Veggies keep your body operating at max efficiency! Vegetables are a great way to keep your\u2026um\u2026indoor plumbing\u2026functioning properly. Adding a vegetable or two to each meal is a great way to keep things working right! Seriously: if you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t eat many veggies, you will notice a considerable difference after adding veggies to your diet regularly. 4) They can be delicious! Sure, a point of debate\u2026but as a former veggie hater, I am now firmly on Team Vegetable. A plate full of veggies used to make me want to gag, and now I\u2019m thrilled at the idea of a plate covered in a cornucopia (what a great word, right?) of multicolored plants \u201cOk,\u201d you might be thinking, \u201cI know they\u2019re good for me, but I don\u2019t eat them. Help me!\u201d Okay, okay fine. Here\u2019s how you can get over your vegetable-aversion and get started. Find your gateway vegetable  When I was 22 I proudly proclaimed that I was a \u201ccarnivore\u201d and boycotted veggies. Essentially, I ate things like chicken, hamburgers, pizza, pasta, french fries, rice, and not much else. One day, I decided \u201cI\u2019m an adult, I should probably eat like one.\u201d In my mind, all vegetables were disgusting, but the reality was that I hadn\u2019t really tried many different kinds. Instead I tried a few and just assumed they were all bad. So, for starters: stop saying you hate all vegetables. Instead: you simply haven\u2019t found a vegetable that you LIKE yet. I started trying teeny tiny bits of vegetables. If I went out to dinner with friends, I would ask to try some veggies off of their plate. Once I got over the idea, I would order a new vegetable each visit and give it a shot. I did this for two reasons: I figured any vegetable, even if I didn\u2019t like it, and even if I only ate a small bite, was better than nothing.If I found a vegetable I DID like, I could learn to prepare it the same way and eat more at home.On top of that, I simply forced myself to go into any new vegetable with an open mind and positive mindset. It\u2019s amazing what positive or negative expectations can do to convince ourselves. So, instead of thinking \u201cthis is gross,\u201d say \u201cthis is what I eat and it\u2019s good.\u201d Sounds a bit hokey, but it works. My gateway vegetable: asparagus. I bought some asparagus at the store, put them on a cookie sheet lined with tinfoil, covered them in olive oil, salt, pepper, and stuck them in the oven (at 375 degrees F) for 12 minutes. BAM! Crunchy, delicious, and nutritious. Plus, I felt like a 5 star chef! For my first year as an omnivore, asparagus was the only vegetable I ate. I didn\u2019t branch out too much beyond this, but at least I had found one that I liked. Once I had gotten over the mental barrier that \u201call vegetables are gross,\u201d it was time for me to branch out. YOUR MISSION: Find your gateway vegetable. (We\u2019ll be giving you some great options later in the article.) Suck it up, take one bite of many different kinds of veggies, and see which ones you actually enjoy. Before each bite, clear your mind, Neo. Stop going into each veggie encounter expecting to hate it! You never know when things change. Many people think in order to eat a \u201cPaleo Diet\u201d you\u2019ll need to eat dozens of veggies everyday, but almost everyone starts just like I did \u2013 with only one or two gateway vegetables and slowly branches out from there. Our free download on the Paleo Diet helps show you that it isn\u2019t nearly as complicated as some people can make it out to be. ",

            "answer_text": "I know a lot of people like you. Scotland is full of them, for some reason I don\u2019t understand. You could make a resolution to try one new fruit or veg every week - or every day if you\u2019ve got the cash. I\u2019m sure if you do this with an open mind, sooner or later you\u2019ll find a few you like. Make sure if it\u2019s the type you cook that you don\u2019t boil the beast to death. Lightly cooked so it loses its toughness and retains some crunch will give you the best chance to discover a tasty treat. For fungi - various types of mushrooms, well people will tell me I\u2019m bad but I like them best gently fried in butter. Tear them into chunks, put them in a pan with the butter, keep the heat really low and cook for 10\u201315 minutes. They go great as a side with steak and other chunks of meat. If you\u2019re watching the calories, you can cook them in a little chicken stock instead. In the meantime, well, you realize you\u2019re going to be short on nutrients and fiber without the vegetable kingdom, I\u2019m sure. So you can make up for the fiber with something like psyllium husks or similar, which you can maybe sprinkle on your breakfast cereal or use in a milkshake. Then there are powdered fruit and veg which you can mix into food, which will help with the missing nutrients - or just get yourself a really good one-a-day multivitamin and mineral tablet and take that. But do try and get a taste for the real thing, because for a start you are missing out on a whole world of taste sensation, and there\u2019s really no substitute for the real thing from a health point of view.

            "answer_text": "How can you stop being a picky eater? Two strategies may help, but in reality, being a picky eater is a choice, in most cases. One strategy that helped my daughter expand her eating selections was to allow her to prepare foods. If my wife or I cooked a grilled cheese sandwich, she would see a dark crust, or some other flaw, and turn up her nose, but if she cooked it, she managed to enjoy it thoroughly no matter how rough it looked. Other stuff came along she didn\u2019t want to try, but as she grew up, she cooked quite a bit, even stuff she didn\u2019t want to eat in the process of helping prepare family meals, and if she invested her time cooking it, she would often actually try it, and more, to her surprise, she would even occasionally like it! Another strategy is to convince yourself or your picky eater to nibble a bit, even if just a tiny bite, and if the taste is offensive, leave that food alone. Trying tiny bits of food is usually easier if only a bit is offered, since the picky eater won\u2019t feel bad about leaving a whole portion on the plate. This worked well for one grand daughter, and failed miserably with the other\u2026until the first found she really liked the stuff, and the second became jealous of her enjoyment. The reality is, though, that some people just cannot overcome picky eating habits, and trying to force the issue is not really a constructive approach. Picky eating can have different causes, sometimes a person has too sensitive a sense of smell, for instance, and sometimes one person\u2019s tastes just don\u2019t agree with others, but in the modern world, there are many different foods to try, and many more ways to prepare, or even, to camouflage them.

            "answer_text": "Everyone needs proper nutrition to feel well. I don\u2019t think anyone can argue with me on that. It is getting harder and harder to get proper nutrients because of the amount of processed foods that we consume. It seems everything is laden with sugar, flour, and chemicals. This is one reason I started juicing. My journey into juicing was exciting at first. I went to the farmers market and loaded up on organic fruits and vegetables. Then I went to the vitamin store for chia, flax, acai, spriulina, etc. I bought a fancy blender and got started. It was great. I felt better, had more energy, and was in a better mood. You can get very creative when you start juicing. I was even able to put the peelings in from some fruits and vegetables that we do not normally eat because of the fancy blender. After some time though I started losing interest because of the time and expense involved. It took a lot of time and money to keep the items needed in house and it was very expensive. I then went to the vitamin store and started trying meal replacement products. I found this to be a cheaper and easier alternative. I was trying to lose a few pounds and get a good dose of nutrition. I have tried about a dozen of these and I finally found what I think to be the best. I accidentally discovered it while helping someone devise a nutrious weight loss plan. The drink has 100% of the vitamins and minerals needed for all day. I just mix it with a little apple juice. It also has fiber. If you would like more info on this just let me know as I liked it so much I became a distributor. You can reach me at marcia@startahomebiz.com I still have not directly answered your question. If you do not like fruits and vegetables you have basically 2 choices if you want to get proper nutrition. Pick which fruits and vegetables you do not like and find out which nutrients are in them. If you know this you can look for an alternative food that is rich in the nutrient you need. Or you can purchase a drink like the ones described above to supply the missing nutrients. If you let me know specifically what you don\u2019t like I can give you more information. I hope this was helpful. Thank you, Marcia ",

He then made a conscious decision - as you have - that being picky was stupid. So he decided to eat anything and everything on his plate, and sure enough he grew to like them. My mother would eat everything except tripe. My father liked tripe. (I\u2019m with my mother on this one). So he forced my mother to have tripe, just the once. She concluded that not only did it smell and taste disgusting, it had a horrible texture as well. Mum did the shopping and cooking though, so from then on Dad could only have tripe when eating out. Fresh fruit and vegetables won\u2019t kill you (not eating them, however, may well contribute to an earlier death).

Find a psychologist who has experience in dealing with eating disorders. My son was a super picky eater until about the age of 21. One of his early jobs was working in a high-end grocery store and then in the restaurant attached to the store. The chef demanded that he at least taste all of the foods. If he disliked anything intensely, he had permission to spit it out. But he had to taste. Now he has a wide-ranging palate and will try most foods at least once. So if you cannot accept going to a psychologist, find a job working for a high-end restaurant. If they cannot change your mind about eating a variety of foods, then you could have a true eating disorder and should seek help from a mental health professional. ",

Don't overwhelm yourself with too much change all at once. Maybe try one new food a week, replacing one familiar component of your meal with an alternative (such as a mixture of quinoa and brown rice instead of white rice).Experiment with different methods of preparation. (You may not like mashed potatoes but you might enjoy roasted ones with flavorful seasonings. You may not like oatmeal porridge but you might like baked oatmeal.)Adjust your mentality about trying new foods. Instead of seeing change as an unwelcome disruption and threat to the comfort of your eating routine, think of it as an adventure and an opportunity to experience the variety of foods the world has to offer, and to reap the nutritional benefits of a diverse diet, which eating the same things all the time is depriving you of.Eat with friends and family. Eating with other people who are trying and enjoying different foods may encourage you to do the same more so than eating alone.Best of luck.  ",

            "answer_text": "First of all, you should consult a doctor and/or nutritionist with good references to oversee your diet adjustments and medical condition. When it comes to changing your eating routines, start very small and try tiny portions of foods recommended to you. Pick one or two of these foods at a time and try to eat a small amount of each for several days in a row. Once you have become used to these new foods, possibly after about two to three weeks, then try introducing one or two more foods. Don\u2019t be discouraged if you have set-backs. Just jump back in and keep trying a little bite at a time. Consult closely with your professional advisors and keep at it. Over time, if you put the effort in, you will find yourself naturally going with the new diet now that you have changed your daily eating routines, and you will likely find that your overall health will gradually improve as well. Changing the way that you eat and think about food will take a lot of repetition, but once you acheive some success, everything will begin to seem a little easier. Good luck, and try to think positively. ",

            "answer_text": "How do I stop being picky about food? Thanks for the request to answer. Taste is one of the great mysteries of hu-man consciousness. An old Latin saying states: \"De gustibus, non-est disputandum\" - meaning \"In matters of taste, there can be no disputes\". What tastes right or good for one person, need not be so for another and there can be no dispute. All taste is essentially memory. To the extent that memory is a mystery, so is taste. We can train our taste buds. They renew themselves every ten days or so. To acclimatise your taste buds to new flavours and textures hold small amounts of each food in your mouth. Chew it slowly, savouring the flavour. If you do this three times in a row, at one sitting, for any food you seek to develop a taste for, you will see that just by holding the food in your mouth, chewing it slowly you give your tongue a chance to become more familiar with the flavour profile. Being picky means there is a reason. Meditate on why you may not like a particular food. Food is very emotional topic. Perhaps there is some trauma attached to a given food... as often there is. People bury the memory as they grow up, yet, it still affects them. Decide you are not going to be picky. Make a list of foods you are going to educate your taste buds on, and have fun. Eating is not only essential, it is, perhaps, if your diet is clean and healthy, one of the few guilt free pleasures that does not require a \u2018licence!\u2019 Applied Meta-physics, The Science of Be-ing and Know-ing ",

            "answer_text": "This is a tough one. First off, I do hope you can overcome whatever condition you have. We are incredibly resilient when we take care of ourselves, so hopefully you can recover. Next, you will have to consider something you might not want to. If most of your diet is chocolate and sugar, you likely have some trauma or something packed into that. It isn\u2019t normal and will completely debase both your body and your mind. You might have to seek psychological help in addition to fixing your diet. To change your diet, make it into an adventure. Begin introducing fruits and veggies that are moderate in flavor and texture. It is critically important that you enjoy this experience. DO NOT GET CANNED OR FROZEN fruits and veggies. It will be very difficult to enjoy your experience experimenting if you start with less than quality things. Yes, peas and corn can be good canned, but even they can\u2019t hold a candle to their fresh counterparts. Fruits should be very easy to bring into your diet since they are sugary. Apples will probably be the most healthy for you with their high fiber content and healthy sugar. There are so many different varieties, but some of my favorites are Pacific Rose, Honey Crisp, Fuji, Gala, Cameo, and Jazz apples. For a twist, spread peanut butter on apple slices. For veggies, easy starters would be broccoli, carrots (try to find Nantes carrots), fresh english peas, beets (beets are amazing when prepared right), cauliflower, and winter squashes (delicate, butternut, kabocha). I chose these veggies for their high starch content and moderate flavors. They will be easier for you to get into. It is also likely that you will need to incorporate greens as they are so incredibly healthy. Again, have fun. Experience the soft velvety texture of spinach or the light spice of arugula. Try the butteriness of cabbage or the crisp juiciness of romaine. You can even eat cooked greens like collard greens. And not to get gross or anything, but greens feel even better coming back out. So worth it. Finally, try your best to buy in season, preferably a farmers market. These are usually the freshest and best tasting. You can also talk to the farmers and get to explore new and exciting things as well as learn more about what you will eat. All of it will help you have an enjoyable experience while making the shift. Good luck and I wish the best for you. ",

For example, apples and cheese seperately are their own thing, but together create a whole new experience. So just because you don\u2019t like some vegetables the way you have previously tried them, doesn\u2019t mean there might not be new ways of cooking them, or new ingrediants to try them alongside, that might completely change how you feel about them. So get creative! Also when introducing kids to food, they say the child has to try it as many as 20 times to know if they really like it or not. The child could try banana nine times and hate the texture but on the 10th time they might love it. You could try using this and see if it works at your age too. You could make yourself eat things you don\u2019t like that you know are great for you. After a number of times, you might find you actually love them :) Good luck, I wish you many new great food experiences! ",

            "answer_text": "I, myself, is a picky eater. Picky eaters come off as the majority, and then, there\u2019s people who are open to eating anything. People have different palettes, some choose to not eat certain foods for many reasons. I disliked vegetables, as many kids did, growing up and I blamed it on my parents for not forcing me enough to like it. It gets old by the time you hit your 20\u2019s and you realize you need vegetables because it\u2019s healthier than eating baked potatoes and corn, which are just starches (and I don\u2019t reckon corn is a veggie). And because my doctor said so. And I would know so with all the extra weight I put on. Now, if you\u2019re picky, as in you don\u2019t want to eat the people around you diet, then I don\u2019t see the issue. Are the foods you\u2019re missing out on detrimental to your health? You could substitute foods you dislike with others. Like I said before, I have an iffy relationship with vegetable. I started slowly adding vegetable in foods that I liked, or \u201cmasked\u201d it to put simply. For example, teriyaki chicken fried rice. I\u2019d put steamed broccoli (when its soggy) with the carrots (minced). I think the earthy taste and texture of vegetables throw me off, but I like eating broccoli whole and carrots as well. It takes practice, just as long as you\u2019re incorporating it to your diet somehow. I disliked avocado (still do) for the most part but started adding seasoning and disguising it with peanut butter. Then, there was also a part of me that forced myself to eat my family\u2019s cooking because they took the time of their busy day to make it for me and that there\u2019s other people out there who\u2019d love to come home to cooked meals but don\u2019t.

If texture can affect your enjoyment, consider whether some foods might be prepared differently. For instance, many people who don\u2019t like raw tomatoes can handle them in a smooth puree. For now, stick to flavor profiles that you know you enjoy. If you know you like Tex-Mex, don't try to jump into Asian until you're more comfortable with a bigger variety of food. Remember that bitter flavors can be overcome by roasting or sauteing, and sometimes by sauce. (I learned to like a lot of new vegetables by roasting them a few times, and cheese sauce on broccoli is a classic for a reason.) It takes anywhere for five to ten bites for your taste buds to adapt to new flavors, and it doesn't have to hapoen all at once. In fact, it may be easier to learn to like new things if the experience is spread out, which is why I suggest single bites over a period of days. ",

This meant sifting weavel from the flower using eggs from the chickens and scraping the flies and cream off the milk for a very routine pancake dinner. When you eat like that you become either very picky as your accustomed or you will eat anything. No middle ground there. We all became very eat what's given. Oddly because we gave most the greens to the live stock we were steared to eat less veggies. So never really become to accustomed to eat what my food ate. ",

Here's some ways I've used that have helped me. I prepared and cook my own meals. It gives me a measure of control. I tried it in a different way. My brother hates Brussels sprouts with a passion, but cooked in a casserole, it tastes different. He eats it every time. I can't stand tomatoes or celery, or carrots, but I put all of those in a blender with peppers to make bolognaise sauce. I like spag Bol. Sometimes, you got to experiment. If I'm trying a new sauce, I'll have it on the side. If I don't like it, the meal isn't ruined. And finally, if I don't like something, it is not the end of the world. Big deal.

I've read some psychology books that showed me the truck I needed, the magic of repetition. Our brains, wonderful as they are, employ a lot of shortcuts. One of these is that, in general, if we do something a lot, we must like it. If we repeat something enough, it must be true. So I started. Every night I would eat a baby carrot, all the while exclaiming to my wife how I love carrots. They're just the best, so bright and orange and crunchy. Never mind I hated them, I would keep eating and talking about how good they were. I still don't love carrots. But I can eat them with no discomfort. I'll stick them in stews or other recipes with none of the hesitation I once had. I've now moved on to broccoli, and while I still dislike them, I can tolerate much more of them. Repeat your exposure in small doses, increase the dose when you can, and soon enough you'll be eating vegetables no problem. ",

Something like a yam, it can be with just butter, butter and salt, mashed with marshmallows, butter and different spices like ginger. Eat one bite of each method and you might find one you don\u2019t hate and you ate a full serving of just samples. Fruit is mostly sweet so eating 3 grapes, or strawberries shouldn\u2019t be awful, try blueberries or other fruit, make a smoothie with bananas and it hides some of the fruit flavors. ",

I ate nothing but fast food and boxed or frozen foods. I hated fruits and vegetables unless it came from a can or was in a flavored Starburst. After learning more about nutrition and cleansing my own palate through cleaning up my diet, I really enjoy fruits and vegetables. I often crave them! Really take a look at what you're consuming to understand why you don't like them. Then work on cleaning up your diet. Lastly, begin introducing them one by one and ensure you try a new fruit or vegetable no less than 4 times before you decide you don't like it.
