            "answer_text": "Siberia is a geographical name, while RSFSR or Russia is a state. It is like to ask why Sahara, Mississippi or Alps are not independent states. I have my ex-colleague who mess up two names Serbia and Siberia these are two different names as well. Serbia is independent state in located in Europe. While Siberia is located in Russia and Eastern geographical borders of Siberia are not well defined. Some people says Eastern Siberia, some people says Russian Far-East. And BTW ethnically Siberia is Russian. In Siberia there are natives minorities, like in USA American Indians, First Nations, Eskimos and etc. Same is in Russia (Siberia). here the link to wiki about population. Siberia - Wikipedia There are even big German community there, who live there for the last 200 years! According to the Census of 2010, the Siberian and Far Eastern Federal Districts, located entirely east of the Ural mountains, together have a population of about 25.6 million. Tyumen and Kurgan Oblasts, which are geographically in Siberia but administratively part of the Urals Federal District, together have a population of about 4.3 million. Thus, the whole region of Asian Russia (or Siberia in the broadest usage of the term) is home to approximately 30 million people. It has a population density of about three people per square kilometer. This density is among the smallest in the world. Most Siberians are Russians. There are approximately 400,000 ethnic Germans living in Siberia. Mongol and Turkic groups such as Buryats, Tuvinians, Yakuts, and Siberian Tatars lived in Siberia originally, and descendants of these peoples still live there. The Buryats, numbering approximately 500,000, are the largest indigenous group in Siberia, and are mainly concentrated in their homeland, the Buryat Republic. According to the 2002 census there were 443,852 Yakuts. Other ethnic groups include Kets, Evenks, Chukchis, Koryaks, Yupiks, and Yukaghirs. The Slavic Russians outnumber all of the native peoples in Siberia and its cities except in the Republic of Tuva, with the Slavic Russians making up the majority in the Buryat, Sakha, and Altai Republics, outnumbering the Buryats, Sakha, and Altai natives. The Buryat make up only 25% of their own republic, and the Sakha and Altai each are only one-third, and the Chukchi, Evenk, Khanti, Mansi, and Nenets are outnumbered by non-natives by 90% of the population. About seventy percent of Siberia's people live in cities, mainly in apartments. Many people also live in rural areas, in simple, spacious, log houses. Novosibirsk is the largest city in Siberia, with a population of about 1.5 million. Tobolsk, Tomsk, Tyumen, Krasnoyarsk, Irkutsk and Omsk are the older, historical centers. ",

            "answer_text": "Siberia was not a SSR in the Soviet era, not even a unified entity of some kind. Rather, Siberia was a collection of subnational jurisdictions within the borders of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic lacking any kind of collective existence.While Siberia has a large number of non-Russians, and many subnational jurisdictions have hosted particularly large concentrations of non-Russians forming pluralities or even majorities of population (Sakha and especially Tuva come to mind), overall Siberia's population is homogeneously Russian. It is arguably more homogeneously Russian in population than European Russia, where large and territorially concentrated non-Russian populations live.Without any history of Siberian autonomy, and without any widespread alienation by Siberians at large as non-Russian, how would a separatist movement work? The only potential for separatism arguably only existed in Tuva, where Tuvans not only formed a majority of the population but Tuvans could look back in time to the interwar period when Tuva was a theoretically independent Soviet protectorate like Mongolia. Even there, in arguably the most distinctive area of Siberia, with a history of post-Soviet ethnic conflict even, there was no separatism.",
