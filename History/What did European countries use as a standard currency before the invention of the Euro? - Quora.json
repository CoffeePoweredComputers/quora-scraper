            "answer_text": "As other have said: every country had its own currency and at every border there were exchange agencies and you needed to change money. At a price of course. Living close to the Dutch-Belgian border I always had two wallets in my pocket, one for each currency. For quite some time (1944\u20131971) all these currencies were effectively pegged to the dollar under the Bretton Woods agreement that made dollars convertible for gold, but under the financial strain of the Vietnam War the US gave up this convertibility because countries like France were increasingly changing their greenbacks for gold and this started to deplete the US\u2019s gold reserves. The 1970s therefore became a period of floating currencies on top of oil crises and monetary and economical upheaval. As the US was trying to \u2018pay\u2019 off its war debts by printing more dollars the currencies in Europe diverged strongly. This made the costs of exchanging money skyrocket, because the frequent fluctuations increased the banking risks. Trade across the Alps became financially so risky that it largely came to a halt. This led the Europeans to try and couple their currencies to each other because the chaos was very detrimental to their economies. This linking to a \u2018basket\u2019 currency unit (ECU) that was a weighted average of a whole bunch of currencies was not always successful, especially when the Berlin Wall came down and Germany started to pump huge amounts of money into the former GDR. This put enormous strain on the system and caused the UK sterling to drop out, bringing back the monetary risks and costs that impeded intra-European trade. France then argued that the only way to fix the problem for good was to create the euro. Germany reluctantly agreed. Although the euro was certainly not an ideal construction it did create a great measure of stability and thus prosperity and growth for a time. Again it was America\u2019s involvement in overseas wars that precipitated an economic collapse in 2008 that would try the euro by fire. The euro crisis was eventually overcome but not without leaving great damage to the economies of the south of the eurozone. ",

As Christian Benesch correctly said, there was the ECU (European Currency Unit), that was used as a predecessor to the Euro. It did not really circulate, but worked more like a fictional currency that you could use to make european budgets, international contracts, or used for comparing currencies. ",
