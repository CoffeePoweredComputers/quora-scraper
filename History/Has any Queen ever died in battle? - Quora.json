The Queen of the Celtic tribe, Boudica who led a successful rebellion against the Roman Legions massacred, by Tacitus, more than 50,000 Romans. Today, she became a symbol in the struggles for Justice and independence today. Though she has lost in the end, her actions and defiance towards foreign rule will forever be known. ",
