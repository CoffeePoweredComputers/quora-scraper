            "answer_text": " See the two dark blue counties centered around Paris? That is the extent of the French crown lands in 1066. Oh, and William the Conqueror\u2019s invasion force is sitting in Normandy just above that, getting ready to head off to England to conquer it and become king. Thus making him and Normandy no longer subject de facto to the French king. See that massive purple blob south of Brittany? That is the Duke of Aquitaine. A duke is holding 7 times as much land as the king. Also, at this time, the King of France had to fight and subdue the barons within his own land. So the king didn\u2019t even have total control over the land that was actually his. Now cut centuries later:  The King of France personally holds almost all of the territory in France. This would of course be managed under other nobles, but it is certainly a massive step towards the consolidation of power. One common misconception about medieval kings is that they had absolute power and were the primary determiners of their nation\u2019s policy. While they certainly could be, more often than not, they were at the behest of powerful vassals, whose loyalty could change as often as the wind. Take Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, known as the Kingmaker, for example. He raised more than one rebellion and secured England\u2019s king for some time by virtue of arms and wealth. He eventually got to ambitious and was killed at the Battle of Barnett, but still, one earl managed to do all of that. King John was forced to sign the Magna Carta by his barons. Holy Roman Emperors had to beware the ambitions of their powerful vassals. Being king did not garantee any level of wealth and power. In fact, the first Capet King of France\u2019s greatest accomplishment was not losing his throne. What kings may have lacked in wealth and power, was made up for with political power. A king served as the focal point and Commander-in-Chief of their nation\u2019s military. Since the various landholders could rarely agree on who they wanted as king, they usually tolerated whoever was already on the throne. Sure, you could overthrow Phillip Capet, but the other dukes would be suspicious of whatever choice you made, and you couldn\u2019t take them all on. England suffered 23 years of Civil War between Maud and Stephen as a result of this waffling. And thus, a king\u2019s throne sat carefully balanced between central authority and local authority, and numerous wars in the Middle Ages were a result of trying to tip that balance. ",

            "answer_text": "Kings never held as much land as their vassals, but enough to support themselves if they lost the Kingdom. Let me explain. A king could hold all land within a kingdom since it would be too much work for himself to do. This is why vassals are appointed land under a King. The king still rules the vassals but the land is not personally owned by him.  He would not give all of his land away however since if he had a rebellion he would then hold  no land. The king would usually keep a duchy so that if he lost his kingdom, he would be a powerhouse vassal and would have the option to rebel and take back his kingdom. Let me show you an example.  This is from CK2, a realistic medieval conquering game. If you were to look at BAVARIA  here you will see two symbols, a large crest and a small crest. The king of this and only holds one county and the vassal holds a duchy, shown by the smaller crest. This shows that the king of this county personally holds less land than the vassal but still rules him. If there were to be a rebellion however the king would be able to call upon men from his own land which in turn could stop the rebellion. The Byzantine Empire also shows this with the big crest for the king and multiple small crests for the vassals. There would be no way that the king could rule all of this land by himself and so there are many vassals.  So to fully answer your question, a king would usually hold a duchy worth of land  for himself. This to make ruling easier and to allow a personal army as well as provide protection during a rebellion. ",
