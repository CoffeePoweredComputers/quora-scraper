            "answer_text": "On short question, a short answer you\u2019ll get, sir! Italy entered WW2 days before France surrendered, trying to pry open the way through south France in the Alps, but getting badly repelled. Actually, against French navy, Italy did good but \u2026 war was over in a matter of weeks. Then the Army High Command advised Graziani to attack the British (explicitly saying \u201cdon\u2019t worry about the French on west\u201d), he hid in a Roman tomb 500 km away from front, and left a badly equipped infantry for a very modern warfare to attack the British lines and almost lost Lybia. While Hitler took his time to send Afrika Korps with the future desert fox Rommel to save the situation, well\u2026 Mussolini decided to save his face invading Greece, yelling from Palazzo Venezia \u201cspezzeremo le reni alla Grecia\u201d (he meant \u201cwe\u2019re going to beat the shit out of Greece\u201d). Italian alpine troops lead an assault from Albania and they got kicked badly in the ass from even more poorly equipped (but much more motivated) defenders. Someone then will try to tell you that in order to save Italians from defeat on multiple fronts, Hitler was forced to order the military staff to devise a plan to engulf Yugoslavia and Greece in a nazi love embrace, which is true, and that would have delayed operation Barbarossa, which is false, since the weather in Russia in 1941 was so shitty that the snow didn\u2019t have entirely melt. It\u2019s difficult to lead an armored assault in the mud where your tanks sink.  It would have happened something like this, but without the rich kids shooting softair pellets. When Afrika Korps arrived, Rommel was able to attack and confuse the British (the Allies have already cracked open Enigma, with Ultrasecret, Rommel just sent his intentions to OKW and a moment later followed his instincts and lead an attack/suspended an attack), conquering back Lybia. Meanwhile Mussolini tried to take back a shred of dignity sending an expedition in Russia, some deserted before arriving, the rest lived hell on earth and the campaign of the alpine troops in Russia became matter of legend in Italy. After El Alamein, Rommel\u2019s panzerarmee was forced to retreat. Not enough men, not enough supply. Then the Allies invaded Sicily; there, Italian soldiers didn\u2019t have many reasons to left a scorched earth of their homes for a lost cause. Then Italy switch sides when the situation became unbearable - it has to be remarked the question is still open: what should the Italian troops have done? Fight against the Germans? Surrender? Still fight alongside with the Germans? Badoglio and the king left this question open. And then, well, Italy descended into civil war.  And the answer is short, at least a book is needed to explain what Italy did in WW2. ",

            "answer_text": "For Italy WWII turned mostly in a civil war. italy was pulled into war by Mussolini, who had tied an alliance with hitler in the hope of Hitler supporting his planned army renovation as well as the colonial wars he was planning too. Hitler had other desires and started immediately WWII, for which the Italian army wasn\u2019t prepared. Three years into the war (Italy joined in mid-1940) years into the war, Mussolini was relieved of his command and a new government was formed in Italy, headed by Marchal Badoglio. The new government came to terms with the Allied and sighed an armistice and, subsequently, rejoined the war on the Allied side. From that moment the italian forces were split into 4 parts. The legitimate Italian army, Esercito Cobelligerante Italiano (240,000 men), integrated in the 15th Alied Army Group;The Esercito Nazionale Repubblicano (300,000 men), fighting with the Nazis;The partisan forces (3,800 men in late 1943, and up to 50,000 men and women in the next year) who fought against the Fascists and Nazis in the occupied areas;the Italian Military Internees (over 700,000), deported to German lagers for refusing to join the Fascist army; unlike other deportees, these men could easily return free if the simply enrolled in the Mussolini-led Fascist army, only about one out of ten accepted, while 50,000 men died of disease, exposure, malnutrition and overworking.So, what did these men do? The IMI tried to survive and to remain faithful to the lawful Italian government, the others took part to the war in Italy fighting on both sides. ",
