            "answer_text": "Wow\u2026This is a loaded question, and rather difficult to answer, at least in my opinion. I am a Presidential history buff and I love anything about our Presidents\u2026well, almost anything. But it\u2019s such a difficult job to do well because of all the checks and balances that were put into the system\u2026that being our Constitution\u2026but so far, so good, right? Who did it the best? I guess that depends on how you look at it. Since it\u2019s such a vague question, I assume you want an answer that encompasses everything that a President does, or doesn\u2019t do, and how well they do it. Some President\u2019s are good with the economy, some are good at diplomacy, some are good with foreign affairs, but their are very few that were good with it all. So who did the best job in my opinion? I guess it\u2019s a toss-up between Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Given what they had to work with and what they accomplished, they did some pretty amazing thing. They were not perfect, but they did what they could with what they had. Lincoln abolished slavery and did everything he could do to end the Civil War. Now I will say that I once read that Abraham Lincoln would have done anything he could to end the Civil War. If that meant abolishing slavery, that\u2019s what he would do. If it meant to make slavery legal across the country, so be it. But as historians have revised some things, I believe that Lincoln actually did not approve of slavery and wanted it abolished. I think that\u2019s what most historians will say now. FDR was amazing because he not only had to deal with WWII, but he had to pull the country out of the Depression. He actually found a way to revitalize the economy by industrializing the war effort. So if I had to chose between the two Presidents, I would chose Roosevelt. Although Lincoln\u2019s problem with slavery and the Civil War was far more destructive to the country than Roosevelt\u2019s WWII, but he also had to deal with bringing the country out of a major depression. Plus he performed very well as President much longer than Lincoln. I know it may not be fair to not give credit to Lincoln for what he could have done had he not been assassinated, but he was so I can only base my decision off of what I know. On top of all of this, FDR suffered from polio and was bound to a wheelchair. Although he did hide his condition from the public, maybe he knew that he was the best choice at the time. I mean, what if we did not reelect him three times based on being in a wheel chair. I think our history may have been different. ",

            "answer_text": "Bernie Sanders would have been the best in my opinion. For starters, the DNC cheated him and his supporters out of the running for president. Great way to convince younger people that voting matters \u200d\u2642\ufe0f In terms of policies and being an active president, I think it would have been great to see someone actually stand up for lower to middle class Americans, because we do make up the largest percentage of the population. The hang up for people opposed to Sanders is the socialist description\u2026 He's only \u201csocialist\" regarding things like healthcare, college tuition, and maybe one or 2 other aspects I'm forgetting. However, he supports the idea that most gun owning Americans are hunters and abide by the laws, he believes the super wealthy (\u201c1%ers\") should be taxed more, (I do too. I had a beautiful debate in one of my college accounting classes in 2016, mostly They do NOT use that money to start businesses, they hold onto it lol) and that global warming is not only real, but that human activity is causing the natural process of climate change to accelerate. (I recommend you to watch a movie called \u201cMerchants of Doubt\", and James Hansen from NASA.) I've never understood why Trump was so appealing to so many people. He isn't a self made businessman\u2026 His track record isn't ridiculously awesome\u2026 He has no political experience\u2026 And he literally insulted his way through Republican candidates. On the other side of the coin, Clinton wasn't a great nominee either. Both very corrupt, morally deplorable, () and egocentric people. Bernie Sanders would have made an interesting pick. He's also against the bipartisanshitt that's dividing the country. I think that and his views on healthcare and college are very legitimate reasons explaining why so many from my generation were voting for him. Different news outlets claim it wasn't rigged, others claim it was. (I side with the latter) Regardless, we have 2 more years of this international laughing stock of a presidential administration. I won't be following the candidates or campaigns as heavily as I have in the past because there is no transparency, the divisive rhetoric is more annoying than anything, and Democrats and Republicans are the same teams wearing different jerseys. Like a football scrimmage the day before a game or WWF/WWE. Just my opinion though. ",
