Neither was assassinated because Winston Churchill put a moratorium on the idea, knowing that their combined military incompetence was essential to allied victory. Had Hitler died at that time his heir apparent was the even more vicious but competent Reinhardt Heydrich, military governor of Bohemia. So Churchill had Heydrich assassinated instead. By then Heydrich had initiated the \u201cFinal Solution\", so personally I would choose to keep the gun & take him out a year earlier. ",

I would look them in their eyes and say, \u201cyou know you're not gonna win this war, especially with your dumb war tactics,\u201d then I would do nothing. They probaly would be mad at me. No I wouldn't shoot them, that would land me in jail or worse. I would just stare, and probably be escorted out. Showing an act of defiance is the best I can do. Because the truth is there not going to win the war. But I would not affect history, even if I hate hitler, Mussolini, stalin. The world as you know it would be better in some places and worst in others. ",
