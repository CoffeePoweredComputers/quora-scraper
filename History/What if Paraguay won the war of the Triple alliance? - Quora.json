            "answer_text": "::What if Paraguay won the war of the Triple alliance?:: A difficult scenario, but not impossible. It would take a smarter Solano L\u00f3pez (it\u2019s hard not to be the smartest man in the Presidential Palace when you are an autocrat) and a little luck. The Point of Divergence is the First Battle of Tuyut\u00ed:[1] L\u00f3pez waits the Allies at the Bellaco Norte, and after they smash themselves against the Paraguayan defensive positions, he launches Generals Barrios and Resqu\u00edn against the then exhausted attackers, encircling them and forced to fight to escape or being trapped. Few Allied troops escape towards the Paran\u00e1 river: the Paraguayans capture large numbers of prisoners, the entire Brazilian artillery, and more important, take as prisoners one of Brazil\u2019s top general, the Argentinean president, Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre, and the Brazilian puppet in Uruguay, General Venancio Flores. Argentina and Uruguay are knocked out of the war (with Entre R\u00edos and Corrientes revolting against Buenos Aires), and Brazil is badly hurt. On the other hand, while the Paraguayan victory is complete, it\u2019s very costly: his losses are about the same than in our timeline: 6.000 killed and 7.000 wounded out of a 23.000 men army, including most of his cavalry. Since this L\u00f3pez is smarter, he knows when to hold 'em, knows when to fold 'em and knows when to walk away: he contacts Bolivian President Melgarejo and ask him to intercede for him before the Allies to conclude the war. The Treaty of La Paz recognizes Paraguay\u2019s claims in the Matto Grosso and Formosa, full rights of navigation in the Paran\u00e1 and Paraguay rivers, and a port in Montevideo. None of the combatants pays indemnities. Be ready for round two: an independent, almost autarkic Paraguay is a bad example for Latin America.  Footnotes[1] Battle of Tuyut\u00ed",
