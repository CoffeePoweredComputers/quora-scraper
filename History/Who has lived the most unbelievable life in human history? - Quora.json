            "answer_text": "In a western region of Asia, a dark-skinned fellow gave up wood-working to try being a preacher for a couple years. He had been born in an obscure village, the child of a peasant woman. He never wrote a book. He never held an office. He never had a family or owned a home. He never got much of a formal education. A lot of people didn\u2019t like his sermons and when public opinion turned against him, his friends ran away. One actually turned him in to the authorities. After being tortured, he was brutally killed. \tWhile He was dying, His executioners gambled for His garments, the only property He had on earth. Twenty centuries have come and gone, and today he is the central figure of the human race. All the armies that ever marched, all the navies that ever sailed, all the parliaments that ever sat, all the kings that ever reigned, put together, have not affected the life of man on this earth as much as that one solitary life. In fact, the whole world counts time (B.C. - A.D.) based on his birth. Even the most vitriolic atheist when writing 2019 acknowledges that. Napoleon remarked, \u201cI search in vain in history to find the similar to Jesus Christ, or anything which can approach the gospel\u2026nations pass away, thrones crumble, but the Church remains.\u201d Today there are 1.8 billion followers of Christ. Grab a Bible and read about the amazing things He did if you really want to learn about one unbelievable life. ",
