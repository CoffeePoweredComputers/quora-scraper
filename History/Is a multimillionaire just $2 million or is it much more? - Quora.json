            "answer_text": "According to Forbes, the median net worth of a millionaire is $1.6 million. That means half of all millionaires are worth $1.6 million or less, half more. Since a millionaire, by definition, cannot be worth less than a million, half of all millionaires are squeezed into a $600,000 window. Poor souls. This includes all billionaires, who are, of course, also millionaires. Now, the average net worth of this august group would be considerably higher, as the net worth of a lowly single-billion billionaire is 1,000 million and skews the average considerably. Also, it mentioned there are 14.6 million millionaires in the world, of which 11.1 million are American. On the other hand, there are only about 1500 billionaires in the world\u2014of which 1100 are American\u2014so non-billionaire millionaires outnumber true billionaires by about 10,000 to 1. Also bear in mind the totals can be volatile, as instant millionaires can appear out of nowhere when a professional athlete or music artist/entertainer signs a $1M+ contract. Zero-to-a-billion Billionaires can also appear out of the mist such as Mark Zuckerberg, but that is exceedingly rare. So\u2026the minimal threshold $2 million \u201cmultimillionaire\u201d would already be worth more than half of his or her millionaire colleagues. ",

            "answer_text": "It\u2019s technically 2$ million, but a 2 million net worth won\u2019t really make you feel like a multi millionaire. A multi millionaire lifestyle to me is someone who can afford super cars such as Ferrari or Lamborghini, a $3 million plus house and tens of thousands of dollars in clothes and jewelry. Someone with a net worth of $2 million can\u2019t really afford that lifestyle even if they over spend. Just my opinion. Hope this helps ",
