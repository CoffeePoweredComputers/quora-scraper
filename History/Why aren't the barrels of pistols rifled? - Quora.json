            "answer_text": "If the handgun fires fixed cartridge ammunition and was manufactured in 1899 or later, United States law requires that the barrel be rifled in order to qualify as a pistol or revolver rather than a short barreled shotgun subject to registration and a $200 transfer tax. A muzzle loading pistol may be unrifled, and is probably better off as such. Rifling a muzzle loader makes rapid loading much more difficult and really only offers an advantage in a rifle where the increased accuracy over a smoothbore offsets the slower rate of fire. If you have a breech loading pistol or revolver, trying to force a tight fitting bullet backwards though the rifling isn\u2019t an issue and you don\u2019t need to use an undersized bullet or ball with a greased patch to do the job, either. Speed is no longer much of a factor, so the rifling helps gain some accuracy in a weapon that is already quite difficult for most people to shoot well because of the short barrel. ",

This assists in bullet stabilization and which in turn assists in accuracy of the round fired. There is also a legal requirement that all handguns have to have a rifled barrel to be legal. This was supposedly to make it harder for a criminal to make a homemade gun. But if they are going to make a homemade gun for illegal activity already one more law on the books does not stop them.
