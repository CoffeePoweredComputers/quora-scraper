            "answer_text": "Absolutely yes, anyone who doubts, must visit two breath taking museums one in Shanghai and other in Beijing, if that does not settle it, go to great wall china, if that is still in doubt, go to Forbidden city, if that is not enough, see their modern live shows, which defies, the innovation, originality, and it made me so small, and meager, humble, list goes on. When you see Beijing and Shanghai, modern miracles of scores of subway lines, most clean cities in the world, and both are over 20 to 30 million each, working like clocks. Their 5 star hotels, and some 7 stars, make you wonder, Chinese hard work, discipline, devotion, and their strong wills to be the very best, when I came back to North America, I wondered now which one is the first world. When you see the Chinese kids in public places on field trips, in beautiful, clean,and very proud faces, I wondered which world I am living. All kids respectful, in lines, asking questions, and well behaved, I asked myself, who is the crown prince, definitely China, in my mind. Education is number 1 in every parents mind, they put in some cases 14 to 15 hours a day, the commutes are killer there. Airports, airplanes, the staff, makes you wonder, if this is not the world model, then what is it? Everything worked like a clock. Never mind porcelain, that is why it is called China, and they are now capable of almost anything, it is not the same China, what was portrayed in the media in the past, they got rid of the opium addicts long time ago, now it is new blood, new dreams, great leadership, with great visions. When you go to Bund in Shanghai, and the whole harbor lights up, with Pearl Tower glowing, I asked myself if this is not paradise then what is it? I believe I have seen paradise, that evening, and I am going again to explore more, including Tara Cota Soldiers, in Xian, and cruise on Yangtze river, and after that in next trips, Buddhist temples, when I saw the 88 meter high Lord Buddha\u2019s statue near Lake Turtle Head, in mountains, and the monastery, and bathing of baby Buddha, with thousands of devotees, and monks, who have tremendous amount of faith, my tears did not stop for a while. YES : INDEED PORCELAIN WAS INVENTED IN CHINA, PLEASE VISIT THEIR MUSEUMS, THEY HAVE PRESERVED THEIR GLORIOUS PAST. TO ME, CHINESE ARE :EXTREMELY INTELLIGENT, SMART AND DISCIPLINED RACE IN MODERN WORLD. I BEING CANADIAN( SOON BE 50YEARS) BY ADOPTION OF THIS MOTHER LAND AND BY BIRTH INDIAN, MADE ME VERY PROUD OF MY EX NEIGHBOR CHINA, AND ALSO ONCE I SAW THE REVERENCE FOR LORD BUDDHA ( MY COUNTRY MAN) HIGH IN THE MOUNTAINS, MY SALUTE TO CHINA, AND THE CHINESE, WHO CUT MOUNTAINS TO GLORIFY LORD BUDDHA THERE ALMOST AS BIG AS THE MOUNTAINS HIS MAMMOTH STATUE TOUCHING THE SKY, WHAT WE INDIANS DID NOT DO IT, FOR THIS HOLY MAN WHO IS GOD IN CHINA. FOR THIS RACE, INVENTING PORCELAIN IS VERY MINUSCULE ACHIEVEMENT, WHO GAVE THE WORLD PRINTING PRESS, AND GUN POWDER. ",
