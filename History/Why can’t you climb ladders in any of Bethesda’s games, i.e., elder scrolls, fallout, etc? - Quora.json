            "answer_text": "\u201cWhy can\u2019t you climb ladders in any of Bethesda\u2019s game, i.e., Elder Scrolls, Fallout, et?\u201d Generally speaking, I don\u2019t bother answering questions with questionable syntax (not in this case) or with poor writing mechanics (when rewriting this question for reference, I capitalized the names of the games mentioned). However, based on the two answers posted, I wish to contribute to this question. I know a little about game design, but not enough to even begin to answer a programming answer. It could be due to Bethesda\u2019s choice of game engine. Anyone who has done much with building settlements in Fallout 4 will have noticed how clumsily settlers climb stairs, nor do I recall ever seeing one climb a ladder. On the other hand, it could simply be not important to program that into the engine. Climbing ladders is simply not needed for gameplay. The few ladders that you do \u201cclimb,\u201d you don\u2019t. They are simply transitions to and from interior cells and you do not see yourself climb. If you consider Assassins Creed games, for example, climbing ladders (and a lot of other things) is crucial to the gameplay. However, I\u2019ll bet every one of those climbable instances had to programmed into the engine. The result appears fluid, but I have experienced times when I could not climb in Assassins Creed 4. ",

            "answer_text": "My best guess would be that ladders weren\u2019t necessarily required to create the best sense of atmosphere when it came to those games. Think about it; Fallout 4 was a rather highly rated game, that would probably have been unaltered based upon the presence of ladders. Perhaps the developers at Bethesda never put any thought into it. Sure, their designers may have been thinking about the ladders, but the programmers? Their minds were someplace else, such as making sure the fundamental game mechanics were working. ",
