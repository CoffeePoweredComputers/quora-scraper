            "answer_text": "They started to build them, but stopped before the war.  Carriers are very expensive to build and equally expensive to operate. Carriers are only effective as a part of a naval fleet, full of anti-aircraft vessels, anti-submarine vessels, munitions vessels, refueling vessels, tugs, and accessible repair and replenishment harbors. So, you need to know why would one want to build a carrier, specifically what would it offer that other approaches wouldn\u2019t. Given that Germany was production constrained in WW2, what would have been the opportunity cost to build carriers? The Germans had 3 choices in naval warfare: Concede the open ocean to the British and eventually the AmericansFight a war of denial to keep the Atlantic out of the hands of anyone, but not secure it for their own useFight an all-out assault, with the goal of taking control of the Atlantic As you can see, the North Atlantic is very large and Germany is not well suited to get into and out of it. France is in better shape, but it is still a massive task to control the Atlantic. #1 is close enough to the eventual outcome that their actions didn\u2019t really differ much from that in terms of the Allies abilities to use the Atlantic for supply and movement. Yes, thousands of lives were lost in the Battle of the Atlantic, but the overwhelming majority of Allied shipping went where it wanted to go, and all the losses were easily replaced by the Allied war effort. Supplies to the USSR also got there from the other side of the world and through Persia. As we know, they attempted to do #2, deny the use of the Atlantic to the other side, which was a low-cost cost option and had a nicely asymmetric nature to it. Initially, the Allies had to expend more effort to keep the Atlantic open than the Germans were spending to deny their use of it. This was their massive U-boat effort that led to the Battle of the Atlantic. This plan worked really well until Germany got on the wrong side of the technology curve and their return on investment quickly turned dramatically negative. They built vessels that hinted to an effort at #3, take control of the Atlantic, like the Bismark and Tirpitz battleships, and their initial efforts to build the Graf Zeppelin aircraft carrier, but not enough to really count. The Bismark and Tirpitz were fine battleships for a bygone era, but no longer really relevant to modern aircraft-dominated naval warfare. While the Graf Zeppelin was a solid effort at a first carrier, the Germans were about a decade behind the Americans and Japanese in their carrier technology. The Graf Zepplin would have only been able to hold 44 combat aircraft (compared to the nearly 90 on an Essex class vessel).  Attempting to match the Allies so would have robbed key industrial raw materials from their constrained mechanized land force (tanks, trucks, artillery,\u2026) and air force production. In a rough sense, a single aircraft carrier is the same production effort as a thousand fighter aircraft or a thousand tanks. How many fewer tanks and aircraft could the Germans have afforded to produce? (the answer is well into the negative thousands - they had too few to win the war as it was) Attempting to match the Americans would have made no difference in the Americans ability to control the Atlantic by 1944. If the Germans had built a fleet and it survived as a fighting force until mid-1944, a small portion of the American fleet would have steamed to wherever the Germans were, sunk their fleet, then headed to Panama to get back to the Pacific to continue defeating the Japanese. The difference in scale of the two fleets would have made no other outcome possible - especially since the Ultra intercepts would have made sure the Allies knew were the Germans were, where they were headed, and what their fleet composition was (imagine playing a game of Battleship where your opponent has 5X as many ships, has a bigger board to hide them on than you, and can see your side of the board every move - your loss is assured). As an example, early in the morning on June 6th, 1944, the Normandy invasion fleet set sail from England with 6,939 vessels, 196,000 naval personnel, and 156,000 combat troops; while the day before the Marianas invasion fleet set sail from Pearl Harbor with a blue water fleet of 129 major combat ships alongside the invasion focused vessels to transport and support 71,000 combat troops, heading to Saipan 3700 miles away. So, building a few carriers would have been irrelevant, building more than a few would have been more costly than they could ever afford, and building enough carriers and supporting vessels to matter was well beyond impossible for them. *********** Edits in response to comments ***************** Yes, the UK was the lead navy against Germany for the Battle of the Atlantic. And it took a great toll on the Royal Navy. However, they did not build the navy to the scale the Americans did in WW2. They started the war with 6 aircraft carriers, only one of which was modern - the Ark Royal. They lost 5 before the end of 1942, while only building 4 Illustrious class carriers at the same time. Even by mid 1944, they only had 1 more Implacable and 1 Colossus light carrier. This is not a minor force, but it is something that was within the German\u2019s capabilities to compete with. Germany probably could have built 4 carriers by 1944. Enough to tie up all the Royal Navy carriers, if the Royal Navy is alone fighting them. But, as mentioned, not enough to seriously impede the US Navy. It was just that much bigger. ",

            "answer_text": "Short answer: Because the Germans were not stupid - an aircraft carrier would have been more a liability than an asset. Long answer: They did - \u201cGraf Zeppelin\u201d and \u201cPeter Strasser\u201d, but they were never completed. And there is a reason for that. Building an aircraft carrier is an enormous investment - both in money and in resources. They are slow to complete, take an awful lot of resources and manpower to make and they are expensive to upkeep. They require an air wing, which must be trained and replenished and anything you invest on an aircraft carrier is away from something else. Aircraft carriers are oceanic vessels intended to be used at blue seas and form the nucleus of a battlegroup. They are intended to be used against enemy warships. They are weapons of an island nation. Germany is a continental nation. Its navy was optimized to fight the enemy commerce, not its warships. Submarines and cruisers are weapons of tonnage war, not against enemy navy. The modus operandi of the German navy was to wage tonnage war - to wage war on enemy\u2019s merchantmen - not on its warships. Germany had in no phase of war enough warships to form battlegroups to support and protect the carriers. The German surface vessels were intended to be used against enemy convoys and to act as fleet in being. Moreover, most sea battles in the WWII were waged at Northern Atlantic. It is a nasty place. The Roaring Forties, Furious Fifties and Shrieking Sixties do exist also in North, and the sea going and weathers are usually awful. Gales, storms and rains are frequent. They regularly prevent air operations. An aircraft carrier unable to operate its air wing is a large and expensive target. A WWII vintage aircraft carrier was a fair weather weapon. Battleships, cruisers and submarines could be used in any weather and any sea state. The Atlantic was a battleship domain - the battleship reigned superior there because the seas and weather were simply too rough for aircraft carriers. There is a reason why the Pacific Ocean is called \u201cpacific\u201d (peaceful). Atlantic isn\u2019t. Most sea battles in the Pacific were waged in tropics or subtropical area, where winds outside the typhoon season are calm, weathers fair and sea indeed pacific. There air operations could be made with ease. No such comfort at Northern Atlantic. The Germans had even worse aircraft for the carriers than Fleet Air Arm. Ju 87 was basically, like Blackburn Skua, a sitting duck. Fieseler 167 was even more pathetic than Fairey Swordfish. And Bf 109T had exactly the same Achilles heel as any Bf 109 models - the landing gear - making it unsuitable for carrier operations. It had all the same faults as Supermarine Seafire - bad landing gear, bad landing visibility, abysmally poor range, in-line engine, ditching qualities of a submarine - making it a poor choice for carrier airplane for operability. Given to the record of Fleet Air Arm Seafire losses by prangs, it is questionable if Bf 109T would have fared any better. You can build a flotilla of submarines with the resources invested on an aircraft carrier. A flotilla of U-boats is likely to produce more results against enemy commerce than an aircraft carrier. There was no way the Kriegsmarine could challenge either French Navy, Royal Navy or US Navy for naval combat - Kriegsmarine tended to avoid White Ensign and concentrate on Red Ensign. Given to that function, Unterseeboot is better than Flugzeugtr\u00e4ger. ",
