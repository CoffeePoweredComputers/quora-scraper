            "answer_text": "The answer depends largely on what weapons were available at the time. Today, the term \"gunslinger\" is more or less used to denote someone who is quick on the draw with a pistol, but can also refer to riflemen and those who used a shotgun. Historically the term gunfighter or gunman referred to those who had gained a reputation of being dangerous with firearms and had previously participated in a number of gunfights and shootouts. Hundreds of western films have etched the image in the American cultural psyche of two gunfighters facing off on a dusty main street. Out come their revolvers, they fire and only one walks away. In reality, more missing took place then hitting, and more wounding took place than killing; but many participants later died of their wounds due to the poor availability of proper medical care. Most commonly, gunfights broke out spontaneously to settle arguments, to exact revenge for some perceived slight, or for no good cause at all. There were very few \u201cHigh Noon\u201d moments. Bill Hickok's favorite guns were a pair of Colt 1851 Navy Model (.36 caliber) cap-and-ball revolvers, which he commonly carried thrust into a sash around his waist. He is supposed to have put a bullet in the heart of an opponent at 75 yards with this weapon.  A Colt Model 1873 Single Action Army .44 was carried by Doc Holliday, but he used a 10 gauge shotgun at the OK Corral.  Or perhaps: A graceful and accurate the Schofield revolver No. 3 used at some point in their careers by Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett (who killed Billy), Jesse James, John Wesley Hardin, Wyatt Earp, Wyatt's brother Virgil, and Annie Oakley.  The break-open design and spent case extractor made the Schofield easier to load and reload on horseback. The cylinder had a recess in its rear face, which was surrounded by a shoulder. In the base of this recess was an extractor star carried by the ejector rod. Gunfighters rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely between two or more well-known antagonists. Today, the term \"gunslinger\" is now more or less used to denote someone who is quick on the draw with a handgun. Only a handful of historically known gunslingers were considered to be fast, but several gunmen were noted for being cold-blooded and businesslike employing shotguns and rifles. The usual winner of an encounter was the man who took his time and kept his emotions in check. Gunfighters ranged among different occupations including lawman, outlaw, exhibitionist, and duelist, but are more commonly synonymous to a hired gun that made a living with his weapons in the Old West.

            "answer_text": "The British made Webley \u201cExpress\u201d No.5. Here\u2019s one that I owned and carried in South Africa for a while before superseding to the 1911-A1 type.  Mine was chambered to accept .45 Colt even though the model is described as being chambered for the much shorter ,450 Adams. In Using .45 Colt in it, I never ever put modern factory rounds through it, Always mid-range home-loads and with 255 Grn \u201cKeith-style\u201d cast SWC slugs, The front face of which was just flush with the front face of the revolving cylinder. This revolver was a turn of the century \u201chog-leg\u201d. \u201cgate-loaded\u201d as such but with the added benefit that it was also a double-action. In spite of it\u2019s mild Mid-range loads. It had a whole lot of \u201coomph\u201d and in my opinion would have been a gunslinger\u2019s \u201cwet-dream\u201d. As accurate and manageable a revolver that I ever owned. ",
