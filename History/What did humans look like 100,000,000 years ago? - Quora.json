Our ancestors probably looked something like a rodent, and even this isn't 100 million years ago, it's more like 45 to 60 million years. Five Early Primates You Should Know  Bear in mind that the dinosaurs went extinct about 65 million years ago, so you're asking about a date 35 million years in advance of that. Science fiction stuff. FYI, this never happened.  ",

They were likely easy prey for any small carnivorous dinosaurs that lived near them, so because of this, they were probably had a nocturnal lifestyle similar to that of bush babies and lemurs. ",
