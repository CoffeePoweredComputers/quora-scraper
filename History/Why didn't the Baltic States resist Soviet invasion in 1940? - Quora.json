            "answer_text": "Preparation The soil for this was well prepared already in year 1938 when European powers ceded lands to Third Reich, letting them annex neighbouring lands. On the may of 1938 Soviet media outlets started attacking Latvia and other Baltic States with claims of unhappy dictature, messy countries that need help. In September Latvia refused to align with League of Nations and proclaimed neutrality as we had pretty good relations with Germany and it was tried to maintain healthy relations with USSR. Nor France, nor UK was ready to guarantee Baltic States neutrality because it was more important to maintain good relations with USSR rather than protect some small countries. Allied nations were happy that Baltics had fallen under influence of Soviet Union rather than that of Hitler. In 1939 talks of Baltics neutrality had resumed and USSR said that it would military intervene without asking if someone were to attack Baltics. And of course then on 28th March USSR sent messages to Latvia and Estonia to not align themselves with any block. On 7th June Latvia and Estonia signed non-aggression pact with Germany. On 23rd August the Molotov-Ribentrop Pact was signed and USSR made sure that Germany wouldn\u2019t mind expansion into Latvia and Estonia. Month later both parties had agreed that USSR should take Lithuania aswell. Occupation Soviets started concentrating huge forces on their borders. 200\u2032000 huge man army was stationed on Western Border right before attack on Poland. Latvia in comparison had only 17\u2032000 soldiers. Any kind of resistance would have been unimaginable. In September USSR had made an ultimatum to Baltic States - Mutual protection agreement where Soviets were allowed to station 25\u2032000 man army in Latvia. Similar count in other Baltic States. Finland was also proposed this pact and they refused to sign it. And the Winter War began between two. Latvian president K\u0101rlis Ulmanis was very conflicted because Latvian military doctrine was based on creating resistance up to one month to hold Soviet invasion for League of Nations or other friendly nations to come in aid. But this was impossible. Estonia already had signed the pact, Poland was utterly crushed, all talks with UK and France were frozen due to war. It was hopeless situation where only rational move was to sign the pact and hope that USSR would actually respect sovereignity of countries. Sadly it didn\u2019t happen. Soviets continued to station even more troops in Baltics, ignoring local laws and customs, demanding housing from Latvia. The whole Courland coast area on Baltic Sea shore was occupied by Soviet military. They forced local civilization population to evacuate homes that their ancestors had lived for hundreds of years. This strongly contributed to cultural genocide of Livonian people, Latvian Finno-Ugric people akin to Estonians that had lived in Northern Latvia for very long time. 1940 summer was the time when Soviets decided to play out their cards - They demanded for local government to step down and to create a new one. Accordingly new government consisted of communists and loyalists to USSR. This was a very bloody process because Soviets tortured and killed politicians, army officers and people of power. President K\u0101rlis Ulmanis was imprisoned in Turkmenistan where he died due to inhumane conditions. Aftermath In 1941 when Soviets retreated due to German offence, many crimes against humanity were brought to light - many mass burials of people that suffered communistic genocide. Many bodies of prominent people had been discovered. Having seen the photos, i\u2019m very surprised they could identify bodies, appearantly Soviet KGB services had no dignity and morality. This should remind the world of the atrocities that USSR was willing to commit to achieve their goals. Our wound still haven\u2019t healed. I can\u2019t even imagine what Polish people had to go through in those years, it was way worse than this. Conclusion This happened to a country that was willing to cooperate, didn\u2019t even resist, one can only imagine what would have happened in case if we had fought back, there would be no Latvian speakers today\u2026 Perhaps if we had copied Finnish actions, it might of been different but fending off invasion was never possible - due to low number of troops, lack of strategic depth and sheer size of Soviet force.

            "answer_text": "Too small, too geographically vulnerable, too diplomatically/military isolated. There were only 2 millions Lithuanians, 1.5 millions Latvians, 1 million Estonians. The relief is flat. They could not get help from the UK and France, because the Baltic Sea was blocked by the Germans. In exchange for accepting the Soviet bases, Lithuania, the strongest of the Baltic States, received Vilnius city and the surrounding area, which belonged to Poland until 1939. Finland fought the Soviets, but it was bigger (4 millions inhabitants), military stronger than the Baltics, with a very good defensive position: Karelian isthmus was fortified (Mannerheim Line), the acces from the East was blocked by forests and snow. And Finland could (theoretically) get help from UK and France through the Norwegian port of Narvik. Czechoslovakia, which has a strong and modern army and fortified lines in the mountains surrendered without a fight to Germany, because it was abandoned by UK and France (Munich Agreement). ",
