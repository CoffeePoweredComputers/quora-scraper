            "answer_text": "Recently, Donald Trump bragged about the trillions of dollars his country had spent so far in assembling the world's strongest military force. He teased the rest of the world leaders, almost daring them into a friendly match just to see whose nuke button is reddest. Every once in a while, Elon Musk and his genius colleague, Jeff Bezos, tease one another on Twitter with their latest toys. They long ago moved beyond yatches and sky scrappers as the status symbol and now burn their wealth blowing rockets into space, looking for a new home for mankind. In South Africa, a war is almost breaking out because ordinary folk have been trained to hate each other. The government is working on it though, and soon it will manage to fag the media so that the world thinks it's all right down there. The biggest achievement of life would be if humans learned to care for one another, love knew another, treat one another as family. If this happened, a lot would change, and the world would be a better place. World\u2019s most powerful eaders would focus on uniting nations in stead of drawing war boundaries. World\u2019s wealthiest would focus on making this home more habitable, more food secure, more disease free and more equal than trying to run away from it. And the governments of the world create a global village, wherein people separated by geography and culture felt united by goals and humanity. ",
