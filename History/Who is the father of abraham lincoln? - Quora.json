            "answer_text": "Samuel Davis was Abraham Lincoln\u2019s father. A girl named Nancy Hanks would become Abraham\u2019s mother. When Nancy became pregnant by a married farmer, her caretaker, Elizabeth Sparrow, arranged a marriage to Thomas Lincoln. There was no love in this marriage. Thomas was an unpleasant drunk. Nancy\u2019s new home was an old horse shed in an Elizabethtown alley. Nancy made a bed of straw, and this is where she gave birth to Sarah. A man named Samuel Davis would occasionally come to town to sell his beautiful Arabian horses. Nancy and Samuel met at a horse auction. They fell in love, and Nancy became pregnant by Samuel. Nancy gave birth to Abraham. Their love lasted two years until Samuel\u2019s son, Joseph, discovered the affair. Joseph Davis forced the Lincoln\u2019s to move out of Kentucky. Samuel Davis had three sons of note: Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, and Joseph Davis. Joseph was the wealthiest man in Mississippi. He had over three-hundred-and-fifty slaves. It was Joseph Davis that got John Wilkes Booth involved with Lincoln. Joseph gave $100,000 to John Wilkes Booth to kidnap Lincoln. ",

            "answer_text": "No one knows. Likely Abraham\u2019s mother Nancy Hanks had sex with a black slave, of unknown identity. No one knows Nancy\u2019s father either. Nancy\u2019s mother had sex outside of marriage, probably with a black slave. Black slaves were easily manipulated back then. Records weren\u2019t too good back then. ",
