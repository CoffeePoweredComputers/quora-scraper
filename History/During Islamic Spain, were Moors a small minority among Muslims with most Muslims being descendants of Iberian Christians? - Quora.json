            "answer_text": "At the beginning Islam had existed for less than a century, so even in the Middle East, Muslims were a small and new minority not thinking in terms of mass conversion. Conversion gradually gained momentum, reaching a peak in the prosperous 900s. C\u00f3rdoba makes List of largest cities throughout history - Wikipedia in 935 and 1000, and the raids of Almanzor - Wikipedia made life miserable for the northern Christian kingdoms. But then the caliphate collapsed in the 1000s in Fitna of al-Andalus - Wikipedia and by 1085 Castile was in Toledo at the center of the peninsula. A substantial proportion may have been recent converts still familiar with Christian culture who could easily resume Christian allegiance. The word renegado - Wiktionary means \u201cstrongly denied\u201d not just \u201cdenied\u201d (negado), suggesting that opportunistically joining the Muslim forces (as El Cid - Wikipedia did) and then returning opportunistically was common, and only strongly and persistently abjuring Christianity was notable. At this point the Almoravids and later Almohads entered from Morocco and were less tolerant of pluralistic society in the remaining Muslim south. Almohad reforms - Wikipedia: The religious fundamentalism of the Almohad Caliphate caused a massive emigration of Jews and Christians from southern Iberia to the Christian north and North Africa, specifically Egypt. Jews and Christians were denied freedom of religion, with conversion or death being the rule. This type of behavior was utterly unprecedented in previous Muslim caliphates. However, the Almohads were on a self declared Jihad, and they were willing to use brutal techniques to back up their holy war. When the Almohads took control, many Jews were killed in the invasion. Believing they were on a divine mission, the overall philosophic goal of the Almohads was to turn Jews into Muslims. Half-hearted oaths were certainly not looked to as ideal, and this brought a lot of problems for the population of Spain. The Almohads recognized that many of the conversions by Jews were not particularly sincere, which certainly did not help promote unity. ",
