            "answer_text": "Read and consume what Trump has accomplished for Americans over the past three years, with 90% if the media attacking him 24/7. Look what he did when Schumer & Pelosi launched the fake Russian probe, the expensive & phoney Mueller investigation, the Ukrainian accusations, the faux impeachment with lies & misinformation, their vicious, vile assault upon Bret Kavanaugh, theur Congress doing nothing for nearly four years for American citizens but attack Trump, etc. Then read up on Biden's record with Obama, notice how he jumped far left \u2026. Not for the good of Americans, but for his (and Pelosi's) political reasons \u2026. \u201cVotes!\u201d Research Kamala's history with her far left liberal actions, understand how America would look with a never seen before, FAR left & ultra liberal government. Then determine which way you'd like to live. Understand, Harris & Joe plan to open our southern borders to all, including violent gang members, full term abortions of fully developed humans, much higher taxes to fund free health care for all, to reduce our military & police \u2026. Who protect us, relax posture with Iran, Korea, Russia & China, free schooling, food, housing, & healthcare for illegals \u2026. with YOUR money, promote sanctuary cities with rising crime & violence \u2026\u2026 do your research. Then determine \u2026. What do I want my country to look like? How will Joe's liberal decisions impact me and my family? Then vote with an educated mind. Remember, the haters loathe Trump. But don't take in to count what he's done and his plans for 2021 - 2024. You don't have to like him to appreciate what he is doing for you. We must have a powerful leader (potus), not an alter boy. Trump was not my first OR second choice in 2016.. I just knew about the Clinton history and figured it would be a disaster for Hillary to be potus. Sometimes, you DON'T vote for whom you think is best, but vote against \u2026.. Whom you think would be the most detrimental for the country. My opinion! ",

            "answer_text": "I guess that depends on your perspective. Do you feel like the country is in a better place today than it was in 2016? Do you think that Trump has been a positive president who has led the country in a way that you like, that you approve of? Or, would you like to see a change? Would you like to have a president who treats everyone like they have an equal right as a citizen? Someone that does not threaten and bully any and all opponents, a person who looks to experts in whatever field requires work, whether it\u2019s the quality of air, water or environment in general, or the medical experts that can help to control a serious virus. Does it bother you to know that fact checkers have verified that Trump has told approximately 20,000 lies since he moved into the white house? More than any other president. Does it bother you that there have been investigations where many of the people who helped him win the election have been charged for illegal actions? Does it bother you that he, himself, was not exonerated in those investigations? Do some fact finding & learn the real truth. Don\u2019t go to right wing or left wing sources - look for neutral sources that will actually tell you what you need to know to make an informed decision. Then you can vote for who you believe will be the best president for our country. ",
