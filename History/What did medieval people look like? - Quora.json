            "answer_text": "They looked more or less like us (by which \"us\" means people of European descent).  They would have been slightly shorter on average - about 170 cms for men (5'7) and 161 cms for women (5'2).  That's opposed to modern British averages of 176 cms for men and 162 for women.  Their teeth would have had fewer cavities thanks to a diet low in sugar and meat and high in vegetables, fruit and milk products, but would have been more worn due to grit in their stone-ground bread and more crooked because of the total lack of orthodontic treatment in all classes.   Most common people would have far less body fat and more lean muscle than most of us if they did physical work, which most would have.  They would be, on average, highly fit and, given that they mostly worked out of doors, fairly tanned.  This is why very fair skin and a small, round, slightly fat stomach was considered the height of feminine beauty - only rich women could have such a physique. Contrary to the myths, medieval people washed daily and took baths as often as they could.  Tooth paste and mouthwash recipes are commonly found in medieval collections and all classes liked to keep their teeth clean and white and their breath sweet.  Bad odours were considered not just unpleasant but capable of spreading disease, so were avoided as much as possible when it came to personal hygiene. So, slightly shorter than us (though slightly taller than the average Roman or the average nineteenth century person), definitely leaner (unless very rich and sedentary - the clich\u00e9 of the fat abbot or bishop has some basis), pretty tanned and with healthy if not always very even teeth.

Despite the above being in a book of psalms, you can\u2019t believe everything you see. Europeans of the Middle Ages looked like me. My maternal grandparents were born in the Welsh Marches and I have traced those ancestors back to 1067 CE; my paternal ancestors were German and French. So when I look at certain medieval paintings, I see myself and them looking back. I have used two photos with me in them. Observant readers will have spotted them and agree that I look like these medieval people. Flemish painters are some of my favorite artists.

We are what we are because they had the fortitude and good fortune to survive and send themselves to us. Through writings, portraits, paintings, and sculpture we can see ourselves in them.
