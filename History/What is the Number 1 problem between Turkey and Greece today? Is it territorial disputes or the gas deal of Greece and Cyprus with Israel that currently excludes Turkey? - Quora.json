            "answer_text": "Don\u2019t be na\u00efve. Territorial claims (not disputes) from Turkey are of course related to gas deposits. Greece doesn\u2019t need to claim what is legally theirs based on international treaties. The Aegean, and the Cyprus sea are jam-packed with natural resources. Turkey is excluded because they have NO legal access to it. They are trying hard to grab land from Greece in order to get access to it. Turkey is blocking any reunification of Cyprus as that would make certain they will henceforth not even have the slightest chance that someone will let them even lick a tiny bone from these lucrative deposits. With Cyprus split, they can keep hoping and pushing for a grab without appearing as the aggressor (as is the case with their claims against Greece.) Oh well. No such luck for Turkey. The international law says clearly otherwise. ",

There is nothing found yet between Turkey and Greece, or Turkey and Cyprus. The Barbaross ship from Turkey is struggling for years to find something and haven't got anything yet. The reason why gas and oil is found there is simple. They are on the meeting point of the Eurasian and African tectonic plates. Our common no1 problem is our politicians. They managed to create a heat between the 2 countries in order to hide their failures. Form both sides. ",
