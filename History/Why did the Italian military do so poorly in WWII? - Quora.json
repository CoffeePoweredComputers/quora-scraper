            "answer_text": "First, keep in mind that the Italian Army posed a very serious threat to the Allies in North Africa. The Italians had around a quarter of a million men in North Africa, and they certainly gave a fight, while under attack from the south and east: the Free French nipped at the south of Libya, the British Army battered the east, the Royal Navy fought them at sea and greatly lessened the amount of supplies coming in to keep the army running. Where, then, does this reputation comes from? -Failure to take Ethiopia in a timely fashion ( Even Britain struggled against Ethiopia - one of their first punitive expeditions against the country was described as \u2018the most expensive affair of honour in history\u2019 British Expedition to Abyssinia - Wikipedia. Its success is due to clever planning, the construction of a road and port to supply the troops, and victory through superior spending. ) -Defeat in Libya after overwhelming power was brought to bear by Operation Torch (They held 3 years against the power of the British Empire. What more do you want?) -Defeat against Greece (Absolutely piss-poor planning, and again, they were fighting the British Empire\u2019s forces in Greece as well as the Greek on their native terrain).  What is ignored to create this reputation? -The fight the Italians put up in Russia, in a climate that must have been even harder on them than on the Germans. -The fight the Italians put up in Libya, in Egypt, in Sicily, in Italy, in Yugoslavia.  So if there is, in fact, any truth behind this reputation, where does it lie? Italian commanders had no desire to ensure success. In Germany, there was a core of politicians and strategists whose prime desire was to establish German domination over Europe, and perhaps the world. In Italy, there was a core of politicians and strategists whose prime desire was to esablish their ego\u2019s domination over that of their colleagues and rivals in the service. Tanks, planes, weapons were poorly made. The Navy was not properly thought through. A functional system of supply was not established. In short: Italian command did not care for the Italian soldier. The soldiers would have felt this. They would have known that they were meatsacks for the ambition of their commanders, and that some of the generals would have shot them themselves had it been a more convenient and more efficient way of ensuring the progress of their careers. Morale dropped very low in the Italian army: Roald Dahl notes in his biography that he saw a ship of women being transported to the Italian army in Ethiopia to boost their morale. One of the main problems the British army in Egypt suffered from was the quantity of Italians surrendering to them.  Were the Italians, as some say, cowards? I don\u2019t like the amount of worshipping of German soldiers that seems to be going on these days. Everyone and their dad seems to be saying that \u2018although they fought the wrong fight, they fought bravely, we have to respect that\u2019. My response to that is a loud sigh and a \u2018must we really?\u2019. It took just as much guts, if not more, to be an Italian soldier in world war 2. You were sent to the front, unfed, untrained, armed with a crap machine-gun or strapped into a fragile tank, or into a poorly-built plane, and sent to fight people you didn\u2019t want to fight, for the glory of your superiors. The machine-guns jammed. The air force could not be relied on to give air support - the AA guns could not be relied on to shoot down the enemy bombers - the artillery could not be relied on to stop an enemy charge, or destroy enemy guns shelling you - the anti-tank guns could not be relied on to stop an enemy tank - the Quartermaster could not be relied upon to feed you! It\u2019s even worse than being stuck in a trench and wondering whether the next shell is for you, it\u2019s more about being stuck in a warzone, and knowing that it is literally just a matter of some enemy chap noticing you for you to die, because there is no way that your generals or weapons can ensure victory. Do you know how hard it is, to surrender in a war? It\u2019s not an affair of standing up and putting your hands in the air. You think of your family, your country, your comrades and what they\u2019ll think of you. Your side starts shooting at you as you try to escape. If they catch you, you\u2019ll be shot as an example. Then the enemy starts shooting at you because they can\u2019t tell you\u2019re surrendering. The people who managed to be taken as prisoners were damn lucky. The most extraordinary thing in all this? When the war ended for the Italians, with the surrender of their government, and the destruction of their homeland, the Italians still fought on. They returned to Italy, and started fighting the pockets of Germans left behind by passing Allied Armies, Germans who were murdering and raping the Alps. My great-uncle, who lived on the French side, remembers Italians streaming back across the Alps to try and save their countrymen. Edit: After some helpful and respectful, and less nice comments about the Italian Air Force, I\u2019ve realized that my previous information was incorrect - The Italian air arm was furnished with excellent planes. However my information was correct in the sense that Italian planes were simply not sufficient in number compared to their Allied counterparts. ",

            "answer_text": "I\u2019ve seen some good answers but one thing that isn\u2019t discussed is something that isn\u2019t very well known about the Italian Army. The Italian Army is kind of unique. Most armies are made up of five (5) main units: Infantry, Armor, Logistics, Artillery, and Special Forces. The infantry is the largest unit followed by logistics. In most armies the infantry is also able to fight in multiple environments, yes, there are small numbers of elite troops that fight in specific environments (i.e. mountains) but these units are for specific missions and are for a specific amount of time. The infantry in most armies is expected to be a multi-task capable force. The Italian Army is not designed like this as it has many types of specialist units that are usually only trained to fight in that particular environment. During WW2 these specialist units ranges from battalion to Corps size. For instance, the Italian 8th Army that fought in Russia had numbered about 230,000 men. It was divided into ten (10) divisions. For a battle on the open steeps of Southern Russia you need a force of fast moving infantry. The Italian Army Only one (1) such division, the Bersaglieri, it was a fast moving mechanized division and it was excellent at its job but it only numbered about 10,000 men. The 8th Army also had four (4) other infantry divisions which were slow moving and had no anti-tank weapons - the soldiers of these infantry division had rifles and grenades, that is it. Why? Because Italy had units solely designed for Anti-Air craft roles and nothing else; Italy had units solely designed for carrying and launching mortars and nothing else; Italy had divisions dedicated for anti-tank warfare but they were in Africa at the time. As you can see, Italy had awesome units dedicated and trained for specific purposes and for those purpose only. But an army needs to be flexible. The Italian army was not. In fact, the other 5 divisions of the Italian 8th Army were the Alpine Corps. These Alpine units were amazing. They are perhaps some of the very best units in the world when it comes to fighting in mountain environments. They would have performed wonders if they were sent to fight in Caucasus. The performance of the Alpini in mountain environments is stellar yet, they were sent to fight on the open steeps surrounding Stalingrad. So when the Soviets attacked these mountain troops with tanks, the Alpini had no way to fight against this type of force since they were trained to fight in mountain environments - as a result they got decimated by the Soviets. In the end, the Italian Army did so poorly in Southern Russia not because they had bad soldiers but because they didn\u2019t have the right soldiers for the job. For fighting on the Eastern Fronts, Italy needed more units like the Bersaglieri, not mountain troops. Unfortunately, the Italian Army wasn\u2019t a flexible force, it relied too much on units trained specifically for a single purpose. There is nothing wrong with having small units designed for a specific job but you should not have entire division or corps dedicated to a single role. ",
