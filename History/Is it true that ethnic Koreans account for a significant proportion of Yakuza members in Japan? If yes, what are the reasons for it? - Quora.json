            "answer_text": "The vast majority of Yakuza understandably come from the Japanese underclass. Japanese society is fairly equal and pretty much everyone is middle class, which means someone who couldn't fit in are deviants in a significant way, such as being 1) burakumin, the designated underclass caste in feudal Japan who did jobs considered unclean (sewage, slaughter house, leather tanning) or undignified (historically, street peddlers or street entertainers like dancers); 2) Korean; 3) people with criminal records, significant history of juvenile crimes, etc. Unlike the commonly held belief that Koreans in Japan are descendants of conscripts from colonial time, the majority of Koreans in Japan are economic migrants and many of them were refugees from the time of the Korean war, as well as the significant proportion of them who are political refugees from Jeju. (Jeju uprising). They spoke little Japanese and gravitated toward typical ethnic business like BBQ restaurants, pachinko parlour, ramen shops, etc. They often adopted Japanese names to avoid discrimination. But even for those second generation Koreans with Japanese names who spoke fluent Japanese, employment in a respectable company was completely shut out, because these companies would ask for koseki (like birth certificate in West). For burakumin, it was the same, because HR in Japanese corporations (at least up to late 70s) kept encyclopedia lists of buraku villages, so anyone whose koseki was registered in one of the lists was out. (And until very recently, you could not change your ancestral origin in a koseki.) Now, there is a quasi-legitimate reason for corporations to avoid Koreans or burakumin as if they have criminal record. For one, more than half of the Korean population in Japan voluntarily aligned themselves with Chongryon. Now, this was understandable if one considers that the south was under a military dictatorship and the south was pretty quiet over the right of Koreans in Japan, while the communist north was a vocal supporter of those who were openly against capitalist Japan and the USA. Similarly, burakumin had strong associations with the Buraku Liberation League, a fairly notorious direct-action group, which often functioned like a corporate racketeering group. And this is circular, but, even if a Korean or a buraku applicant himself may not be supporter of North Korea or the Yakuza, it is assumed that he probably knows or has a family/relative who is Yakuza or Chongryon member or any dodgey political organisations. And due to the lifetime employment system, which makes firing notoriously hard, it was so much easier to simply rule out a candidate from that background who are less than 1 % of the population. My uncle, despite being a university graduate, could not get a job in top-tier corporation, because they routinely asked for the father of a new recruit to sign guarantees for any financial loss caused. My uncle's father (my grandfather) died in the war and the fact that his mother (my grandmother) owned a few hair saloons and was financially well off didn't count (because she was a woman or/and hair saloons weren't respectable enough). Still, he got a job elsewhere, though not as good as what he could have gotten if he had a salaryman or a civil servant as a father. Anyhow, this kind of system makes it likely that Koreans or burakumin would make living in a pachinko (gambling) parlour, loan finance, construction, or the entertainment district, where you can\u2019t avoid dealing with the Yakuza.

            "answer_text": "Yes it is true that a significant proportion of the Yakuza are Koreans and those of Korean heritage. About 30% or so are Korean with another 60% or so Burakumin. This is according to Former public security investigator Mitsuhiro Suganuma (video below). However, according to \u201cYakuza:The Explosive Account of Japan's Criminal Underworld\u201d (David Kaplan), the Yamaguchi Gumi group had 70% Burakumin with 10% Koreans and other foreigners. This 10% I doubt would include those that had taken Japanese citizenship. \u66b4\u529b\u56e3 - Wikipedia  So I would say that the number would be around 20\u201330%, which is significant, but the actual number would be difficult to ascertain. As mentioned before, this would not include Koreans who took Japanese citizenship, for which there would be no way to know how many of them were in organized crime based on heritage. However, from the sources, I would say that more than Koreans, Yakuza were dominated by Burakumin. The reason would be that due to discrimination it was very hard for them to get average jobs and lead average lives. Of course such discrimination today is not common so most would have regular jobs. Thus many take Japanese citizenship and are very successful. Softbank\u2019s Masayoshi Son is one Japanese of Korean heritage, and is just one example of those that have been successful in Japan. As for Koreans in Japan, according to the Ministry of Justice, they number 500,000 (May 2019). This includes those from both North and South Korea. They are the second largest after Chinese (650,000). These figures includes newcomers as well. These numbers include all such nationals, including new comers. \u65e5\u672c\u306b\u5728\u7559\u3059\u308b\u97d3\u56fd\u30fb\u671d\u9bae\u4eba\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u77e5\u308b | \u8abf\u3079\u65b9\u6848\u5185 | \u56fd\u7acb\u56fd\u4f1a\u56f3\u66f8\u9928 This makes sense as the number of \u201cZainichi\u201d (Koreans with special permanent residency status) was 800,000 but has been fast declining. The reason for the decline is that many naturalize as Japanese citizens. Others often marry Japanese citizens and their children are automatically Japanese nationals. Sorry for the sources in Japanese but I found those in English to be outdated. Hidesato Sakakibara's answer to How do I join the Yakuza crime syndicate? ",
