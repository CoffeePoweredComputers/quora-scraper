            "answer_text": "For the course of events leading to war after the Moscow peace of 12 March 1940, please see Hannu Mononen's answer to Was Finland on Germany's side in WWII, only because they were invaded by the USSR, and did they lose territory after the war? I will cover the topic by giving some background information first, based on the History of the Continuation War, Part 1 (Jatkosodan historia 1, ISBN 951\u20130\u201315327\u20133). For reasons of strict secrecy, Germany had not informed its assumed allies about its strategic plans in the East during the winter of 1940\u201341. Finnish-German negotiations Unofficially the Finnish Chief of the General HQ, Lieutenant General Axel Erik Heinrichs visited Germany in January 1941 to lecture on the Finnish Winter War to German General Staff officers. He met Colonel General Halder on 30 January and they exchanged views of a possible war between Germany and the U.S.S.R.  Photo in 1945: Erik Heinrichs in the rank of Infantry General, then the Chief of Defence of the Finnish Defence Forces. There were further unofficial contacts between German and Finnish officers in the spring of 1941, discussing \u201chypothetical\u201d and \u201ctheoretical\u201d questions related to a possible German-Soviet war, while the top secret planning of Operation Barbarossa continued in Germany and was not disclosed to Finns. Germans assumed Finns being willing to join their war effort, without discussing it with the Finnish political of military leaders. The Germans had strategic interest in the nickel mine of Kolosjoki, Petsamo in Finnish Lapland, while they planned their Operation Rentier - Wikipedia. No commitments were made by either side, and the official Germany denied any problems in their relations with the U.S.S.R.  Risto Ryti, the 5th President of Finland. The official contacts with Finland were opened by Minister Karl Schnurre arriving as the German Special Envoy to meet the Finnish President Ryti on 20 May 1941. He told about the relations between Germany and the U.S.S.R. having become tense, which might lead to war, or to a Soviet pre-emptive attack against Finland or the Balkans. He therefore invited a delegation of Finnish General Staff officers to Germany for discussions how military action could be co-ordinated in such a case of aggression against Finland (see: the Soviet threat against Finland 1940\u201341 at Hannu Mononen's answer to What role did Finland play in WWII?). The Finnish State Leadership agreed to inform Minister Schnurre about the matter being transferred to the military authorities. The Supreme Commander, Field Marshal Mannerheim, ordered a delegation to be sent, led by the Chief of the General HQ, Lieutenant General Heinrichs, with four other high-ranking officers. They were not authorised to enter agreements, but had the mission of finding out as much as possible about the plans of Germany. The negotiations started in Salzburg with the lead of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht on 25 May, continuing in the Berlin area regarding branches of defence. The German side brought up the possibility that unless agreement will be reached in the political negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union, it will be likely that military confrontation will ensue, and also Finland should be prepared for this. Artillery General Jodl explained German plans of operations via the Baltics to Leningrad, action from Northern Norway, naval operations on the Baltic Sea, and briefly air operations; he did not mention about operations in the directions of Moscow and Ukraine. The Germans proposed negotiations on co-operation, presenting their own views and suggested roles for the Finnish troops. When after the German presentations the Finns were asked about their views, Lt Gen Heinrichs stated they had neither the political nor the military authorisation to state their views, but Finns had a positive attitude to co-operation with the Germans, should defensive measures become topical. Political problems related to Finnish mobilisation were discussed, as Finns had concerns of an immediate pre-emptive strike by the Soviets. The meeting was concluded by agreeing about the Finns giving the answers to questions presented either from their political or military lead by 2nd June. As led to believe, Finns assumed Germany was negotiating with the Soviet Union on the political level. Preparing for co-operation German high officers arrived at Helsinki 3\u20136 June to continue discussions on the matters covered at Salzburg and Berlin. The question of whether or not Finland will commit itself to war on Germany\u2019s side was critical. Finns were concerned about a blunt negative answer leading to Germany not supporting Finland in its negotiations with the Soviet Union. On the other hand, premature commitment to co-operation with Germany would bind Finland and contrast with what President Ryti had previously told Schnurre on 20 May, about Finland not starting the war from its side, which General Heinrichs had repeated in Salzburg on 25 May. The reply to the Germans was negotiated among President Ryti, Foreign Minister Witting, Defence Minister Walden, Field Marshal Mannerheim, and Lt Gen Heinrichs as stating that Finland did not commit itself automatically to the campaign of the Germans. Instead, Finland could take the preparatory measures as suggested by the Germans, if the political side of the issue would have been sorted out. Heinrichs told this to the Germans and stated that the political aspect will be sorted out via another route. He also remarked that any attempts at setting up a puppet government to Finland in Norwegian style would lead to immediate cutting off of all co-operation. Airfields in Finland were agreed for the use of Luftwaffe, and practical matters of liaison were agreed upon. The German Colonels travelled home to report the negotiations, and soon thereafter German troop transports started arriving at Finnish ports. Naval negotiations were conducted separately on 6 June in Kiel. The Germans emphasised that their relations with the Soviets were in order, but negotiations were underway only because of a certain scenario. By early June, German and Finnish military measures had been co-ordinated to a great extent, although there was no alliance relationship. Finns had agreed on this for the case of Germany and the Soviet Union ending up in a war (which the Finns could not know for certain at this stage). Deploying for war \u2013 and its breakout German troops were gradually deployed to Finnish Lapland via the Baltic Sea and by roads from Northern Norway. The Finnish Army was called for extra maneuvers from 10 June on. All personnel were ordered to deploy according to wartime plans. On 16 June the Naval HQ gave orders to prepare for occupying the \u00c5land Islands, which are demilitarised in peacetime.  Finnish and German troops deployed for defence in Finland on 22 June 1941. Dotted line Oulu\u2013Miinoa is internal boundary of operational responsibility. (Map adopted from Jatkosodan historia 1) _____________ By noon on 21 June, the German liaison officer, Infantry General Waldemar Erfurth showed the message he had just received to the Chief of the Finnish General Staff, informing about the coming breakout of the war. When Germany launched Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union on 22nd June 1942 at 3:00 hrs, the Finnish Army was deployed for defence. In the morning of 22 June, Hitler gave his speech: The F\u00fchrer to the German People: 22 June 1941 It included the passage \u201cUnited with their Finnish comrades, the fighters of the victory of Narvik are standing in the Northern Arctic. German divisions commanded by the conqueror of Norway, in cooperation with the heroes of Finnish freedom, under their marshal, are protecting Finnish soil.\u201d The wording \u201cUnited\u201d (in German: Im Verein) was embarrassing for the Finns, who wished to clarify they had no alliance with Germany against any other states, but Finns were brothers-in-arms (Waffenbr\u00fcder) with Germans only against the Soviet Union which caused a threat against Finland. The German troops intended to start reconnaissance across Finland\u2019s Eastern border on 22 June and take a tactically significant mountain top in Salla, but Finns refused permission for it. On the same day, Luftwaffe aircraft that had mined and bombed Kronstadt, landed for refuelling on Finnish Utti airfield, serviced by a German crew. On the previous night 21\u201322 June, German Navy and Finnish Navy submarines had laid mines on the coast of the occupied Estonia against Soviet shipping after the Soviet attack against Finland had taken place. The only Finnish land action beyond the national border was a long-range patrol that was flown to Stalin\u2019s canal by German seaplanes on 22 June. Germans flew bombing sorties against the Soviet base in Hanko, Finland, on 22\u201323 June from airfields in Eastern Prussia. Without declaration of war, in the morning of 22 June at 06:15 hrs the Soviets opened artillery fire on the Hanko front. The Finnish Naval Forces were granted permission to return the fire. Finns occupied the \u00c5land Islands (Finnish territory, demilitarized in peacetime) on 22 June, and fighter aircraft of the Soviet Red Bannered Fleet attacked against the Finnish coastal defence ships that escorted those transports. On 22 June the Soviet Army made some violations of the land border and the Soviet Air Force violated air space on 23\u201324 June, but despite German suggestions, Finland did not give up yet the attitude of neutrality it had adopted. The decisive moment Without declaration of war, the Soviet Air Force launched an air attack with 263 bomber and 224 fighter aircraft, bombing 15 cities, towns and villages on 25 June 1941, including Helsinki, Kotka, Turku, Loviisa, Forsby, and Porvoo. Of the attacking planes, 27 were shot down on Finnish territory without Finnish losses of aircraft. On Hanko front, there was an artillery duel between Soviet and Finnish troops.  Johan Wilhelm Rangell, Prime Minister of Finland 1940\u201343. For that day, the Finnish Prime Minister Rangell had prepared a situation report to the Parliament, with the intention of informing about measures taken by the authorities and declaring that the purpose of the Government is to do all in its power to secure the country remaining intact and preserving neutrality. Because of the Soviet offensive air operation, the PM however changed his presentation and stated \u201cFinland has become the object of an attack by the Soviet Union, which has started acts of war against Finland. Due to this, Finland has undertaken defending itself by all available military means\u201d. The Parliament gave its unanimous vote of confidence to the Government. \u2013 That was all the rhetoric about declaring war. The Germans were granted permission to begin full-scale reconnaissance and carry out flights from Finnish territory from 25 June on. The Finnish IV Army Corps was granted permission to fire on available artillery targets, but for the time being, the frontier was not permitted to be crossed. The Finnish offensive across the eastern border was not launched until 10 July 1941. ",
