            "answer_text": "To answer the question \"Why weren't early Egyptian Emperors Black?\" one has to first define \"Black.\" If you define \"Black\" as a group of people who have dark skin, then there is one answer, but if you define \"Black\" as people who descended directly from people who lived south of the Sahara as opposed to people who descended from people who first went from south of the Sahara to Eurasia and then back to the Nile Valley then I believe that the early Egyptian Emperors, as well as their subjects, were Black in that I believe they descended directly from people south of the Sahara. This is what I understand from my reading. For most of the existence of modern humans the Sahara was a desert and few people lived there. The portion of the Nile Valley that is now in Egypt was pretty much isolated due to the desert and the swamps south of that area, so it is not likely many people lived there. Then approximately 10,000 years ago, the Sahara became wetter and became the Sahara Savanna. People and animals started moving there, but the Sahara was a Savanna for a relatively short period, maybe 2 or 3 centuries. Looking at the geography and remembering that long sea travel is relatively new, it seems to me that, while some people may have come across the Sinai, most came from south of the Sahara. As the Sahara began to turn back into a desert people began to return to where they came from, but also to go to oases and the biggest oases is the Nile Valley. When the Sahara was wet the Nile Valley would have been swampy and most people living there would have moved away. If most people in the Sahara Savanna were descended directly from people who lived south of the Sahara Desert, then it seems that most people who moved to the Nile oases would have descended directly from those people that is they were Black. Based on this the ancestors of most early Egyptian never left Africa. Now it seems that over many generations living in Tropical regions results in the skin turning darker and living north or south of the Tropics results in the skin turning lighter. Egypt is mostly north of the Tropics so while being \"Black\" the early Egyptian would have, over generations, become lighter skinned. Further there appear to be a second reason why over generations skin turns lighter and that is diet. It is my understanding that hunter gathers have a diet richer in Vitamin D as compared to the early farmers such as those who first developed the Egyptian civilization. So this is another reason for the early Egyptians to get lighter skin over generations as the lighter skin would allow sunlight to better produce Vitamin D for them. On top of this it is my understanding that before the uniting of Upper and Lower Egypt, the Upper Egyptian society (in the south) was the most advanced and it seems likely that people descended directly from those in the south would have populated Upper Egypt and those who descended from people in Eurasia would more likely have populated Lower Egypt. To support this it seems that the images posted here of early Egyptians have facial features generally associated with \"Blacks.\" It also seems that the face of the Sphinx, despite the loss of the nose, has these features with more prominent lips and more pronounced cheek bones. Also these images of early Egyptians could have been painted darker with the paint fading over time. This deals with early Egyptians, but it is something else for later Egyptians. Egypt had been pretty much protected and isolated during most of its history, but in the 4th century BCE it was taken over by the Greeks. This introduced European Genes into primarily the upper classes. So the early Egyptians may have not have been \"Black\" in regard to having dark skin, which is due to them living north of the tropics and the change in diet, but it seems to me that it is likely that they were \"Black\" in regard to having descended directly from people south of the Sahara.

            "answer_text": "I would like to correct you: first there were never emperors, there were pharaohs and wives, mothers and sisters who had titles, e.g.: \u201cthe principal wife\u201d, \u201c mother of royal children\u201d and \u201cmother of the king\u201d. As for your question; If you visit the Egyptian Museum in Cairo you will see one of the kings statues painted in black as most of the dynasties in the south of Egypt were a mix of colors fair, brown and black, those co-exist until today as homogeanous society(although it is said that the black paint does not indicate the physical characteristic of the king but it has a religious or political indication. My answer is even though it was not the color of the king /queen but it has an important indication, it indicates that this was not the sembol of evil creatures, or evil deeds, it was not used to indicate a negative indication, The 25th dynasty; the Nubians- if you haven\u2019t seen them -are physically beautiful and gracefull black race, they are the inhabitants of the precious southern governorates of Aswan and Luxor, their existence extends to Sudan.  this is queen Ahmos-Nephertari she belonged to the 18th dynasty, she was the principle wife of king Ahmose, he got the Heksos invaders out of Egypt his grand mother is said to be queen Titisheri of Nobian origin, as for his mother and the mother in law for Nephertari ( Nephertiti) she was said (among other speculations) to be coming from Somalia. The Nubian king Tarharqa the last of the 25th dynasty was the pharao of Egypt and ruler of Ethiopia. So back to to the question, the dominant coloring of Egyptians is brass/ wheat color or light brown, being an African/ partially Asian country makes it really difficult to put us under one of these categories, we are a mix. Finally I would like to mention that during the old Egyptians rule, we were invaded by Asians \u201cHeksos\u201d, and Persians, in addition to the sea people wearing a feather coming from Crete ( greek iland), and the fair skinned \u201cLibyans\u201dwho are Mediterranean phynicians, and Africans.  https://www.google.com.eg/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcriticxxtreme.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F07%2Ftutmosis-iii-pic5.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcriticxxtreme.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F07%2F04%2Fthe-yes-they-were-black-series-pharaoh-during-the-exodus-that-never-happened%2F&docid=CU7IB6W2eHwdgM&tbnid=HJId0wd7DiAJGM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwjdv-LLitzVAhVEXRoKHfj5B6AQMwhoKCEwIQ..i&w=448&h=540&hl=en-eg&client=safari&bih=529&biw=320&q=images%20of%20black%20featured%20pharaohs&ved=0ahUKEwjdv-LLitzVAhVEXRoKHfj5B6AQMwhoKCEwIQ&iact=mrc&uact=8 https://www.google.com.eg/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcriticxxtreme.files.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F07%2Ftutmosis-iii-pic5.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcriticxxtreme.wordpress.com%2F2013%2F07%2F04%2Fthe-yes-they-were-black-series-pharaoh-during-the-exodus-that-never-happened%2F&docid=CU7IB6W2eHwdgM&tbnid=HJId0wd7DiAJGM%3A&vet=10ahUKEwjdv-LLitzVAhVEXRoKHfj5B6AQMwhoKCEwIQ..i&w=448&h=540&hl=en-eg&client=safari&bih=529&biw=320&q=images%20of%20black%20featured%20pharaohs&ved=0ahUKEwjdv-LLitzVAhVEXRoKHfj5B6AQMwhoKCEwIQ&iact=mrc&uact=8  Here you see Aminhotep I with his mother queen Ahmos- Nephertari  ",
