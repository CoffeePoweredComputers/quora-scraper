            "answer_text": "Because history changes with the times. The earliest (general) era of human history is antiquity. The ancient world. Rome, Greece (city states) & the Persian Empire just to name a few of the entities that were prevalent during this time. The changes of human history are usually met with the begging of new ages. These changes must be substantial An easy example is the fall of Rome. Just for a measure of scale, the fall of Rome supposedly resulted in 8 million deaths of former roman citizens and began the European Dark Ages; which is a sub-age if you will of the Middle Ages. The age of imperialism led to the discovery of the new world and, maybe not immediately, but a change from feudal systems and serfdom. It also marked the beginning of economic systems similar to capitalism in the western world. Each different era of history is marked with substantial change in circumstance of the western world, and as such is marked with a book marker if you will. ",
