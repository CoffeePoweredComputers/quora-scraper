            "answer_text": "D\u00e1l Riata or D\u00e1l Riada (also Dalriada) (/d\u00e6l\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0259d\u0259/) was a Gaelic kingdom and political entity that encompassed the western seaboard of Scotland and the north-eastern corner of Ireland, stretching across each side of the North Channel. At its height in the 6th and 7th centuries, it encompassed a large territory of what is now Argyll (Coast of the Gaels) in Scotland and part of County Antrim in the North of Ireland and Southern Pictland. From 795 onward there were sporadic Viking raids in D\u00e1l Riata. In the following century, there may have been a merger of the D\u00e1l Riatan and Pictish crowns. In 843 Kenneth McAlpin became King of Dal Riata and Pictland. After a period of expansion, the kingdom eventually became associated with the gaelic Kingdom of Alba.The Kingdom of Dalriada (Riada\u2019s Fort)in Western Scotland and the Isles (Alba in Gaelic)was formed by an influx of Irish Gaels or Scotti from Ireland led by Carbry Riada who originally hailed from the Irish province of Munster,he was the son of the Munster King Conaire...The Picts gradually merged with the Scotti or Irish Gaels .The Scotti gave their name to Scotland or Scotti land .So yes many a Scot would have Gaelic /Pict ancestry..

            "answer_text": "Given the Picts never mass-migrated as other early medieval races did, they must be to some degree. The Picts stayed in Scotland until their culture just sort of petered out. It was gradually forgotten, perhaps in the 11th century after the arrival of the Vikings. Pictish culture was strongest in the Highlands, so modern Scots who live up there are probably more likely to be descendants than Scots elsewhere. ",
