            "answer_text": "So, with the answers I see on here, they are certainly not wrong in any way, but they tend to focus on the Luger and Nambu when your overall question was the design not specific pistols. Like two other people have pointed out, the Walther P.38 had a very long service record being retired only relatively recently in 2004 (its production continued on as the P.1 where it was made with more modern materials opposed to wood and metal), and they still make exposed barrel pistols today, they are still pretty common. They didn\u2019t really fall out of favor in a general market, but they certainly did for military use, and I believe this is what you mean. See, exposed barrel pistols are very accurate, this makes them very sought after for competition, sports, and recreational shooting. In fact this is probably why Germany went with them. They had a tendency to favor quality and accuracy. However, this tendency unfortunately also translated in not being the best on the battlefield. What I mean by that, well lets take a look at another German weapon, during WWI the Gewehr 1898 (precursor to the Karabiner 98 kurz) If we compare this weapon to the British .303 SMLE and the American Springfield M1903, you will see, though I am sure this is debatable, that overall the Gewehr 1898 was the better machine. It was more reliable, more accurate and had a better action. However, the .303 SMLE had a faster action and double capacity for round storage. As such, despite the notion that the Gewehr 1898 was the overall better and more accurate weapon, many people consider the .303 SMLE to be the better combat rifle. Though there are some arguments that the .303 SMLE\u2019s tendency to get hooked up during cycling negated a lot of its advantage, it is overall said that the Americans made a hunting rifle, the Germans made a sports rifle but the British made a combat rifle. Now the way this correlates is the exact reason why exposed barrel pistols fell out of favor in the military. Though they are generally more accurate, they have many things with them that must be precise and so they have a tendency to function worse in combat conditions (rain, mud, dirt, snow, etc) while other pistols such as the M1911 were built, not as much for quality, or accuracy, but for reliability. Furthermore, being more complicated designs, exposed barrel pistols were generally more expensive than other pistols as well. This is an issue for military service because you aren\u2019t just buying one, but hundreds of thousands, and the servicemen have to use them, take care of them, maintain them and have replacement parts. This is less acceptable in more expensive and complicated designs. Now, exposed barrel pistols are still pretty common today however, it is in the civilian market, where their design is best suited. Where you don\u2019t have to worry about the nitty gritty of combat conditions nor do you have to worry as much about price as the buyers are not buying hundreds of thousands, and still want the benefit of accuracy and quality (of course I am only speaking of a general stance, a shitty made exposed barrel pistol is not going to out shoot an M1911 just because its an exposed barrel pistol). A gun\u2019s design, even if not intended purpose, is essential when determining a \u201cgood\u201d gun. Just because exposed barrel pistols fell out of favor with the military does not mean that they are bad or worse, it just means that design is not best suited for that task. It is better to have a rough and tough, reliable, even if not as much quality and accuracy, pistol. Exposed barrels also don\u2019t make good carry weapons as their long barrels make it very awkward to carry, usually a smaller pistol is better for this regard. However, where the exposed barrel shines is in competition, sports, and recreational shooting (Of course guns are still guns and any of them can be used for whatever purpose you want them to, some are just better designed for it than others. Exposed barrels can be used in military service and they were. They had a very long service record from, basically the time that semi-auto pistols were introduced up till the German military phased out the P.1 in 2004. They were just not the best designed for the roll needed). Furthermore, do not forget, revolvers are fixed barrel designs as well and are also extremely common. ",

            "answer_text": "The Luger and the Nambu, both have fixed barrels and the same general shape, but that\u2019s where the similarities stop. I admit, I like shooting the Luger, it really is one of the most iconic handguns of all time. The Nambu, not so much fun shooting, only memorable as a suicide gun if handled improperly. Both had serious shortcomings that tended to show up in a combat zone.Machining tolerances of the Luger are so close and tight that it doesn\u2019t take much to bind it up and cause it to have problems cycling, and misfires of all sorts would occur. The Luger is a very accurate pistol, for me, it\u2019s a natural pointer, easy to hit targets with on the fly, easy recoil, the toggle action is very fast, but based on my own limited observations, not a firearm I\u2019d care to have in a combat zone, slog around in muck with even in a clamshell holster, and then depend on it to save my life. I can imagine how it must have fared in the filthy, damp conditions a WWI Trench. Iconic, certainly, but reliable? Very questionable. The Nambu , I haven\u2019t had as much experience with, both the shells and the gun are hard to come by, and quite frankly I just didn\u2019t like shooting the only one I ever had a chance to fire. It was a late war model, and not as well made as some I have handled that were made pre war, one even made by an American company.They were made much better, with better fit and finish but i was told they also suffered with frequent problems.The late war model that i did shoot jammed several time on a single magazine and it\u2019s owner said that was the rule not the exception. The fixed barrel handguns went out of favor because production costs were very expensive and required good machinists and lots of hand fitting, as opposed to the 1911, loose tolerances, easy to make, easy to field strip and care for, parts made by a number of manufacturers and easily interchangeable, and thoroughly reliable. What would you rather have in a combat handgun, really cool good looks with a wow factor or reliability, dependability in mud water and sand, a firearm that takes a beating and just keeps going like the Eveready bunny.
