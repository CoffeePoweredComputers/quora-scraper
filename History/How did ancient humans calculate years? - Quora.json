            "answer_text": "The Paleolithic from the 2.6 million BC Homo Habilis to 10,000 BC , the Upper Paleolithic 50,000 BC diversity of artifacts and art is 95 % of technological prehistory fully anatomically and behaviorally modern Humans engaged in Religious and Spiritual behavior, burial and ritual. Australia and 61 degree north latitude of Europe reached by 45,000 BC, Japan reached by 30,000 BC, Siberia above arctic circle by 27,000 BC, Americas by 13,000 BC. Paleolithic coincides with Geologic Pleistocene Epoch 2.6 million to 12,000 BC. Paleolithic Humans had abundant leisure time much greater than Neolithic farming societies and Modern Industrial Societies. Interbreeding between both Homo Sapiens Neanderthalensis until 30,000 BC, and Homo Sapiens Denisovan until 17,000 BC with Homo Sapiens Sapiens. Early Upper Paleolithic Aurignacian Culture used Calendars, 30,000 BC, Lunar Calendar , documented phases of Moon times 12 made a Solar Year, for tracking migration of Game Animals. Genuine fully independent Solar Calendar did not appear until Neolithic. Upper Paleolithic Cultures timed the yearly migration of game animals, wild horses and deer. Neanderthals timed their hunts and became efficient hunters, exploiting a wide variety of game animals, long before the 50,000 BC beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, the Neanderthals large brain size, 1,700 cc compared to 1,400 cc of Homo Sapiens Sapiens, enabled them to become the most intelligent, technologically advanced and savvy hunters using the Lunar Monthly Calendar to hunt game on an accurate yearly basis, the only reason for their being supplanted by Homo Sapiens Sapiens was their lack of antibodies to resist the diseases brought by the African newcomers much the same way that the Native Americans were wiped out by their lack of antibodies resisting the Europeans diseases, much the same way that in the War Of The Worlds the Martian Invaders were wiped out by their lack of immunity to the Earths microorganisms. Womens pregnancy of 9 months and the first 3 months of babies nursing and the beginning of the next pregnancy, a baby every year contributed to the recognition of the time of the year made of 12 lunar monthly cycles and 12 monthly menstrual cycles, and the Paleolithic and the Neolithic centered their societies and Religion around Women. Womens Menstruation, Pregnancy and Nursing was related by them to the Lunar Monthly cycle and the Solar Yearly Cycle and the Migration of Animals that in the Neolithic the Genuine Fully Independant Solar Yearly Calendar came into existence based on the yearly planting agricultural cycle.

            "answer_text": "The sun changes its rising and setting points on the horizon during the year in a cyclic pattern. Ancient people could use natural landmarks such as distant mountain peaks to take note of when the cycle repeats, and count the days. It\u2019s not a big leap for humans to begin placing markers, like stones, to mark the rising or setting sun. Stone circles are quite common archaeological artefacts. Incidentally the best time of year to mark the rising or setting sun for counting days would be at the equinoxes, when the sun rises due east and sets due west. This is because the sun\u2019s apparent north-south movement on the celestial sphere is greatest then, so its rising or setting point on the horizon changes most rapidly. It would then be easiest to pin it down to the exact day. Of course the fly in the ointment here is that if you\u2019re nomadic you can\u2019t do this. ",

            "answer_text": "The Chinese year system worked on a 60-year cycle. There are 10 heavenly stems and 12 earthly branches, and a combination of one each consecutively leads to 60 variations. For example, this year is the dingyou \u4e01\u9149 year, where ding is the heavenly stem and you is the earthly branch. As you may see, it is most useful for a person\u2019s lifetime and less so for longer periods. As such we read documents in relation to the creator, for example when an artist signs with a year we know that it can only be a year he lived in. We also relate it to reigns. For example, the year 1898 is often expressed as \u201cthe wuxu \u620a\u620c year of the Guangxu reign\u201d. ",

(Simpler method: it is winter ergo a new year)Stars: this is, where it gets realy good: You stargaze and get the idea, that the same constellations can be seen again and again after a given time. So you build a place with some exact places stones or what not.",
