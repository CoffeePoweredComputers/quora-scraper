            "answer_text": "There have been a lot of reasons given for this and there is no single reason Christianity grew so rapidly in the face of what was an intensely religious world. Among other things, Christianity promised a highly desirable future not dependent on wealth. it was a very non-hierarchical, class-ignoring message. They offered social services not seen elsewhere - in fact, although it would not really become fully evident for several centuries, Christianity basically invented organized charity, hospitals, etc. https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/why/appeal.html On the other side, it is apparent that the Roman religious culture had become too pluralistic - when everything goes, nothing gets taken seriously. They also called for \u201cconversion\u201d rather than \u201cadherence.\u201d https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/why/starksociology.html One other that I\u2019ve seen, but can\u2019t recall a reference for, is that Christianity offered freedom from fate. Free will was a significant part of early Christian teaching, quite contrary to general pagan belief that fate rigidly controlled everything. ",

            "answer_text": "Historian, Charles Freeman: The distinct identity of the early Christian communities and their insistence on welcoming and offering support to all must have been attractive to many who needed protection in a harsh world. Women seem to have made up a large part of the membership of the early communities. . . . An ascetic streak in early Christianity appears to have attracted virgins and widows in particular. It was precisely women of this status who were most marginal in traditional Greco-Roman society with its focus on marriage and childbearing, and so the church offered them a home denied elsewhere.[1] Biblical scholar, E.P. Sanders: Many, however, would have heard quite gladly the message that, by being baptized and professing faith in Christ, they would be assured of eternal life. . . . It seems not to have been difficult to get a sizeable number of people to increase their chances of a happy future by joining religions or cults.[2] Footnotes[1] Amazon.com: Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean (9780199651924): Charles Freeman: Books[2] Paul (A Brief Insight): E.
