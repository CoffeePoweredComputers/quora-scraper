There was one VicePresident, Agnew, under Nixon, who was charged with accepting bribes when he was a state governor and was forced to resign. He might be the worse; the situation was prickly since Nixon himself was being forced out at the time. After Agnew\u2019s departure Gerald Ford became VicePresident and when Nixon resigned Ford became President and immediately granted pardons to Nixon and Agnew, with the result that when Ford ran for the presidency on his own he was not elected.

Mr. Rockefeller\u2019s brother was working on bringing the Chase Bank to Russia during the Ford Administration. It was a time when during the 1976 Presidential Debate, President Ford was convinced Eastern Europe was a free society and that there wasn\u2019t any real intervention in Eastern Europe from Russia. I came across as if the president was brain washed by the VP and business interests in Russia. President Gerald Ford later lost the election to former peanut farmer Jimmy Carter and, according to some reports, was placed on suicide watch. ",
