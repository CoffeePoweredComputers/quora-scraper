            "answer_text": "Yes, they did. The History Channel did a story on it. They invented a long canister full of perching bats. Each bat had a small pyrotechnic charge strapped to it. The idea was to drop these over Japanese cities. The canisters would pop open and the bats would naturally hide in the eaves of the wooden Japanese buildings. When the tiny firebombs went off, the city would burn. During the testing of this method of fire bombing, one canister popped open, the bats flew out and half the military base burned to the ground. After that, the whole idea was dropped. ",
